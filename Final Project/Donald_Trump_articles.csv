"Trump secretly sent Putin COVID-19 tests during pandemic shortage, a new book reports",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5146501/trump-putin-covid-tests,2024-10-08T23:07:08Z,"Russian President Vladimir Putin and then President Donald Trump shake hands before a meeting in Helsinki, on July 16, 2018.

Vice President Harris is criticizing Donald Trump following new reporting by the journalist Bob Woodward that the former president secretly shared COVID-19 test machines with Russia's Vladimir Putin at a moment in 2020 when tests were out of reach for most Americans.

The revelation, first reported by CNN and The Washington Post on Tuesday, is detailed in a forthcoming book called War book by the famed Watergate journalist, about Trump's record on the international stage, as well as President Biden's.

According to the book, Trump sent the secret shipment of testing equipment to the Russian leader at the height of the pandemic in 2020, even as the U.S. and other nations were facing crippling shortages of testing kits.

""I don't want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me. They don't care about me,"" Putin told Trump, according to the book. Trump responded, ""I don't care. Fine,"" according to Woodward.

NPR has not independently verified the account, which was based on interviews with unnamed sources.

Asked about the report during an interview Tuesday with Howard Stern, Harris said Woodward's reporting was an example of why Trump cannot be trusted as commander-in-chief, because she said he is easily manipulated by authoritarians he hopes to befriend.

""He admires strong men, and he gets played by them because he thinks that they're his friends, and they are manipulating him full time and manipulating him by flattery and with favor,"" Harris said. ""Remember, people were dying by the hundreds, everybody was scrambling to get these kits ... and this guy, who was President of the United States, is sending them to Russia to a murderous dictator for his personal use.""

The Trump campaign has dismissed the book as ""made up stories"" written by a ""deranged man,"" according to a statement by its communications director, Steven Cheung.

""President Trump gave him absolutely no access for this trash book that either belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section of a discount bookstore or used as toilet tissue,"" the statement read.

Woodward's reporting adds to the swirl of questions that have surrounded Trump about his relationship with Putin dating back to his 2016 campaign for the White House, when he publicly called on Russia to find Hillary Clinton's missing emails. Trump has defended his stance toward Putin, maintaining that had he still been in office Russia would not have invaded Ukraine in 2022.

It is a relationship that appears to have continued even after Trump left the White House, according to Woodward, who reports that the former president may have spoken with Putin as many as seven times since Biden took office.

In one episode reported by Woodward, Trump ordered an aide away from his office at Mar-a-Lago in order to take a private call with Putin early in 2024.

The book also details pivotal moments in the Biden presidency, including the administration's response to the war in Ukraine and Biden's fractious relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Woodward recounts the president's frustrations with Netanyahu amid the ongoing war in Gaza as he concluded that Netanyahu's instincts for political survival outweighed his interest in defeating Hamas.

""That son of a b****, Bibi Netanyahu, he's a bad guy. He's a bad f****** guy!"" Biden reportedly told advisers, according to Woodward.

Asked about the anecdote, the White House declined comment, but deputy press secretary Emilie Simons said the U.S-Israel relationship is ""as strong as ever"" and said Biden and Netanyahu have a long and candid relationship.

""They can have very honest and straightforward conversations with each other,"" Simons said."
"As Florida braces for Milton's impact, FEMA chief says hurricane aid isn't political",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5144720/fema-prepares-for-hurricane-milton-while-managing-the-massive-response-to-helene,2024-10-08T22:46:58Z,"<iframe src=""https://www.npr.org/player/embed/nx-s1-5144720/nx-s1-5213843-1"" width=""100%"" height=""290"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" title=""NPR embedded audio player"">

Today, Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, is urging people to flee flood-prone areas before the arrival of Hurricane Milton. That storm follows Helene, which flooded both the Gulf Coast and Appalachia. And responding to both storms is the responsibility of Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who is in Raleigh, N.C., this morning and is on the line. Good morning.

INSKEEP: Thanks for taking the time. I know you've got a lot going on. What information are you receiving about preparations on the Gulf Coast?

CRISWELL: So we know that Hurricane Milton is going to be a large storm. Even though we're getting some reports that it might weaken some, I don't want people to take that for granted. This is going to be a significant storm that's going to hit the west coast of Florida. I was in Tampa yesterday. I met with the mayor of Tampa, and I also met with the mayor of St. Petersburg and listening to them about their current recovery efforts from Hurricane Helene as they now prepare for what Hurricane Milton might do. We've sent additional resources down there to support them - their search and rescue, power teams, et cetera - and so we'll continue to move resources in until the storm makes landfall.

INSKEEP: So like lots of people, I'm looking at the National Hurricane Center maps and trying to calculate where on the coast, and it looked like right now it was going to hit in the area of Tampa right by St. Pete Beach, I mean, areas that have already been devastated once in recent days. How does that complicate things that this - that the area has already been damaged?

CRISWELL: It certainly complicates things, Steve, as they were still doing debris cleanup, and so they've done an amazing effort of trying to get the debris that they had from Hurricane Helene out of the way, so it didn't create additional complications. I know Governor DeSantis mobilized National Guard and some of his other state resources to help move that debris out and make it as safe as possible. I think the biggest thing that I heard when I was on the ground is people were aware of the threat from Hurricane Helene and the amount of storm surge that it brought. This one is going to bring more, so people are listening. They are evacuating. That's what's really important right now.

INSKEEP: I'm glad you mentioned Governor DeSantis - Republican governor, no fan of the Biden administration. Do you feel that Republican governors across the Southeast are working well with the administration at this time?

CRISWELL: I can tell you that I have a good relationship with all governors. You know, the disaster response is nonpolitical. It is all about the people. I've talked to Governor DeSantis. I've talked to all the governors in these impacted states. I continue to reach out to them to check on their progress. When it comes to helping people for disasters, they work with me, and that's what we need to do right now.

INSKEEP: How widespread are the power outages and blocked roads still in North Carolina, where you are now?

CRISWELL: We are definitely seeing progress across North Carolina, but they're still the hardest-hit areas and where that last mile of restoration is going to be the most difficult. There's power lines. There's still some water infrastructure and this transmission line. And when you think about the topography in...

CRISWELL: ...North Carolina, it just makes it that much more difficult to get that - those final lines - those final water distribution lines restored. But we have the Army Corps of Engineers that's in here helping them. They have tremendous resources that have been out there. We even have brought in Title 10 forces that are helping with debris removal, so we can access these areas. Progress every day, and we're going to continue to support them until it's all back on.

INSKEEP: I'll just give you a chance to respond. Also, as you know, former President Trump made a claim last week about FEMA being short of money to give it to illegal migrants, so they can vote. People in the country illegally can't vote. But what about the money? Do you have the funding that you need?

CRISWELL: We absolutely have the funding that we need to support the ongoing response to Helene and the response that we're preparing for for Hurricane Milton. There has been no money diverted from the Disaster Relief Fund to go support any other requirements across the federal government.

INSKEEP: And just so I know, I mean, the administration is asking Congress for more money. That's for future issues going through the fiscal year?

CRISWELL: So we're focused right now on the response, and that's what I - I go into INF, immediate needs funding, so I can always have enough for response. But I'm going to have to be back in that maybe in the December, January time frame to support the other recovery projects going across the rest of the country.

INSKEEP: OK. But for right now, you've got the money you need. FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell, thanks very much for the update.

Some Indian American Democrats see themselves in Harris. Others see the limits,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5131223/some-indian-american-democrats-see-themselves-in-harris-others-see-the-limits,2024-10-08T21:57:10Z,"In the warm Georgia heat, Kannan Udayarajan is sipping chai and talking politics at an Indian restaurant in a small strip mall in suburban Atlanta.

There used to be only one Indian restaurant here, Udayarajan says, in this corner of adjoining suburbs at the edge of Forsyth County.

""Now in a 10 mile radius we probably have 40 to 50 at a minimum.""

The exponential rise in Indian restaurants follows a wave of Desi immigrants here. Desi is a term many people from the South Asian diaspora use to describe themselves. These immigrants are no longer primarily landing in traditional South Asian strongholds, like California and New York, but are also reshaping states like Texas and Georgia, helping transform metropolitan suburbs into some of the most diverse spaces in American life. Indian Americans now make up the second largest immigrant population in the United States.

Udayarajan says he's been a political junkie ever since he came to America for work in 2007. He hadn't planned to stay, but he got married and had kids, and in 2018 he became a citizen. Still, he didn't get involved in local politics until 2020, when former President Donald Trump was running for his second term. Udayarajan organized in his own community, helping register Indian Americans to vote, sometimes teaching them about American democracy.

""Joe Biden won Georgia by 11,780 votes,"" he says. ""And Forsyth County polled16,000 brand new Democratic votes in that election. So we made an impact.""

South Asians are one of the most progressive Asian American communities, a realignment that dates back to 9/11 and the policies and racial animus that followed. A recent Pew Research Center study found that 68 percent of Indian registered voters identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning.

Two years ago, Udayarajan became the head of the Forsyth County Democratic Party. He says this year, he believes Desis could again make the difference in a battleground state like Georgia.

Udayarajan is joined at the restaurant by Ashwin Ramaswami, a 25-year-old who was born and raised just a few blocks away in Johns Creek. Udayarajan asks Ramaswami if he thinks the South Asians here are excited about Vice President Kamala Harris' nomination for president.

""I see a huge amount of excitement,"" Ramaswami tells him. Udayarajan asks if it's more among the immigrant community or among folks who were born here?

""I think everyone,"" Ramaswami says. ""It's so different to have a presidential nominee called Kamala, right? Kamala is a Sanskrit word.""

A meme circulating on messaging apps and other social media has been hard to miss. The meme goes that in Sanskrit, Kamala means ""lotus,"" but in America Kamala means POTUS -- President of the United States.

""The ticket's been supercharged for the Desi community,"" Ramaswami says. He points out a personal overlap: Harris' mother is from the same village as his mother in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

""People can see the connections, they can see their own stories in her, because politics -- a lot of it is about the policy, but it's also about can you trust the person you're going to be electing.""

Ramaswami left John's Creek to go off to school, and then work. Now he's returned and is making a run for Georgia state Senate. He's part of another growing group -- young South Asian Americans running for office.

At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this past summer, South Asians gathered everywhere: Delegate meetups and happy hours and networking lunches.

""For all the years that I've been involved in politics, I've been part of the broader Asian American community,"" says Ann Lata Kalayil, co-founder of the South Asian American Policy and Research Institute. ""But more recently, we've started talking about South Asian Americans."" She points out the number of times she heard ""Indian American"" mentioned on the DNC stage and in the media to describe Harris. ""There's a real sense of pride, you know?""

Deep Singh Badhesha grew up in predominantly white Colorado Springs, Colo.

""I was the only South Asian there,"" he says. ""I was always trying to find my identity, but it was hard,"" he says, because no one at school looked like him. He describes experiencing a classic Asian American childhood experience -- the lunchbox moment. ""Your mother will make you a deliciously cooked Indian dish"" Badhesha explains, ""and you'll bring it to school and you open it up and everyone's like, oh, what the hell is that gross food?""

He says when it happened to him he felt like an outsider, so he broke off parts of himself to fit in.

""I used to actually be a super Republican and libertarian person because I used to look for folks like Bobby Jindal or Nikki Haley. And I'm like -- 'oh this is where South Asians look like they're having acceptance, right?'""

Then he went to college and met South Asian peers.

""They instilled a lot more pride in who I was,"" he says.

Badhesha believes things are different now.

""Being in this moment and seeing a lot of young folks in particular who see themselves in the Democratic Party -- who see themselves in Ro Khanna or Pramila Jayapal -- and of course Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, you know, it's like a huge moment for South Asians.""

Back in the Atlanta suburbs, another group of South Asians are meeting to talk politics, but there is no celebration over Harris' nomination.

""It stings, right?"" says Anjali Enjeti. ""I mean, boy, would I love to celebrate a Black, Jamaican, Indian woman.""

Enjeti says she cannot support Harris because of the Democratic party's political, military and financial support for Israel, and what is happening in Gaza and in other parts of the Middle East.

""It feels like a betrayal that when we finally get somebody who we can relate to in some way, to have them support and enforce a genocide is -- it's just devastating.""

Israel stands accused of war crimes and genocide in front of the International Criminal Court, whose preliminary finding is that it is plausible Israel has violated the convention against genocide. Israel and the Biden administration strongly deny the charges.

Enjeti and Harris are both half Indian, and they can each trace their roots back to southern India. Enjeti says that is where the similarities to Harris end.

""I think identity politics is a trap,"" she says. ""It is a trap to think that somebody's shared demographics or community has anything to do with your values.""

Enjeti is sitting with Farhana Rahman, remembering 2020. They registered voters and knocked on doors and drove people to the polls.

""We were screamed at,"" Enjeti says. ""We faced very real physical threats. We risked it all for Biden to win in Georgia.""

""That same me has done nothing this election cycle,"" Rahman adds.

Rahman says as an Indian American Muslim, she believes another Trump presidency is a ""existential threat to democracy,"" even potentially to her own safety. But she says she doesn't feel safe now. She says she's afraid to speak out against the conflict in Gaza and she's reluctant to tell colleagues and acquaintances that she is Muslim.

""I feel like I have to hide my identity,"" she says. ""It's unfortunate, but the level of Islamophobia, just making it so prevalent -- people can say horrible things to Muslims, and it's completely okay.""

She believes she has faced more Islamophobia and repression in the past year than she did after 9/11.

""After October 7th, it has become extremely dividing to the point where being a Muslim automatically means you are pro-Hamas and [an] anti-Semite.""

Rahman says she still doesn't know who she will vote for on Election Day, but she says the options only fill her with sadness and fear."
Two Jewish Democrats reflect on Congressional efforts to combat surge in antisemitism,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5125793/jewish-democrats-antisemitism-congress,2024-10-08T20:41:44Z,"Reps. Jared Moskowitz, Kathy Manning, Josh Gottheimer, and Dan Goldman speak at a press conference in April about allegations of harassment and antisemitism against Jewish students at Columbia University. Stefan Jeremiah/AP/FR171756 AP hide caption

As Congress continues to deal with the policy and political implications of Hamas' attack on southern Israel one year ago, lawmakers are also reflecting on the rise of antisemitism in the United States.

Jewish Americans represent about 2 percent of the population and were the target of 16 percent of hate crimes in 2023 - a surge of over 60 percent from the year before, according to the FBI's hate crime statistics report. Current figures are likely higher, given reports that anti-Jewish animus has been higher since Oct. 7 and the report only captures a few months of data post-attack.

North Carolina Rep. Kathy Manning and Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz, two Jewish Democratic lawmakers, are working to address the issue despite political divisions within Congress and their own party.

""There's been a change in this country from, you know, the swastika on a wall that happened once in a while or someone being accosted on the street once in a while to the point where you can't even keep up with all the antisemitic attacks that are going on,"" Moskowitz said.

Manning, who co-chairs the House bipartisan task force for combatting antisemitism, said she's been tracking the rise in anti-Jewish hate over the last year.

""I think it's important to remember the attacks began before Israel had any response, before they sent any troops into Gaza,"" she said. ""We saw people being threatened. We saw violent language used against Jews. And, of course, we've seen the eruption of antisemitic behavior on college campuses across the country.""

The rise in demonstrations on college campuses last spring was the subject of various committee hearings in the halls of Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought a Republican delegation to visit Columbia University. Manning and Moskowitz were part of a separate visit with Jewish Democratic lawmakers.

""We didn't go to Columbia because we had a problem with students protesting. They have every right to protest,"" said Moskowitz. ""We went to Columbia because Jewish students were afraid to go to school.""

Protesters on campuses maintained their aim was to show public support for the people in Gaza and to demand their universities divest from companies with ties to Israel.

""We've always been told that you can be anti-Zionist without being antisemitic. And I would say that you could. As it turns out, they're just not,"" Moskowitz said. ""And the reason why is they're not surrounding Israeli students going to class. They're surrounding a kid wearing a Jewish star going to class. They don't know his position on Israel. Maybe he's anti-Israel, but he's Jewish.""

He said the protests highlighted the need for Congress to step in.

""If what was happening on college campuses were not about Jews, if people in hoods were encircling Black kids, blocking them from class, or some right-wing extremist group was targeting the LGBT kids, we don't believe it would have gotten past lunchtime on the first day,"" Moskowitz said. ""We believe Congress would have acted.""

Congress has taken steps over the last year in response to rising antisemitism but there are ongoing divisions about what elements are most important to address at the federal level and which policies will actually lead to solutions.

In May, the House passed the Antisemitism Awareness Act, which would see the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism when reviewing complaints of discrimination in programs that receive federal financial assistance. The bill goes further than an executive order former President Donald Trump signed in 2019 and opponents say it could restrict free speech. The measure has not been taken up by the Senate.

Manning spent nine months with House colleagues and counterparts in the Senate negotiating what she calls the ""most comprehensive bill"" on antisemitism that incorporates the guidance outlined in the Biden administration's national strategy to counter antisemitism. The result is the Countering Antisemitism Act, which would establish a position in the White House to coordinate federal efforts to counter antisemitism across various agencies and to conduct a study that analyzes the prevalence of online antisemitic content. The bill would also appoint a senior official within the Department of Education to be responsible for addressing antisemitism on college campuses.

That bill has yet to be brought to the floor for a vote by Republican leadership.

Moskowitz says the issue more broadly has highlighted what he calls schisms within his own party.

""It was real easy for Democrats, right, when it was just [GOP Rep.] Marjorie Taylor Greene talking about Jewish space lasers to go call her out, or easy when Tucker Carlson has a Holocaust denier on his show to call him out,"" Moskowitz said. ""I didn't see the same level of interest on calling out the antisemitism when it was within your own tent.""

He said Democratic lawmakers weren't unified in their condemnation of some of the violent language being used on campuses.

""As soon as they saw there was division in our party, the Republicans jumped right in from a political issue, from a fundraising issue, and wanted to drive that wedge. We made it easy for them to do that, by the way, when there are people protesting in front of college campuses saying, 'go back to Poland, kill all the Zionists.' And like several of my progressive members are like, 'Oh, look, it's raining today.'

Manning said the events of the past year have brought Jewish members in the House closer together but support from colleagues has been uneven.

""What I have experienced is not antisemitism from my colleagues, but willful ignorance of what so many of us are experiencing,"" she said.

Moskowitz agreed.

""A lot of other members are scared to step out because they don't want to get targeted,"" he said. ""They don't want to get protested in their district and don't want police in front of their house, which I have 24-hours a day.""

He said that police protection began within weeks of October 7, based on death threats against him and his children, ages 7 and 10.

""It's not a pleasant time to be Jewish at the moment,"" he said. ""Almost every Jewish member has this story. My grandparents were Holocaust survivors. And there are bits and pieces of stories my grandmother's told me that are repeating themselves. Different - not the same, but similar threats. And Jews see and feel that. So we'll have to see what the new Congress wants to do. The schisms that exist on this issue are still going to exist.""

Manning adds she hears from Jews across the country worrying about what the future holds, and asking if Congress can help.

""I think so many Jews, particularly of my generation and older, carry all of those stories on their shoulders -- the history of the Crusades, and the Inquisition, and the pogroms and the Holocaust. When I talk to people about what the difference is today is all those other disasters that happened to the Jews were perpetrated by the governments of those countries. What's happening today in the United States, not only is it not perpetrated by our government, our government is trying to put into place structures to combat that antisemitism,"" she said. ""And that's the thing that gives me hope moving forward."""

I went to a classic Wisconsin supper club to talk politics. This is what I learned,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5138314/wisconsin-supper-club-harris-trump,2024-10-08T15:11:27Z,"The Packing House in Milwaukee caters to diners of all political persuasions. Keren Carrión/NPR hide caption

When we started planning an election reporting trip to swing state Wisconsin, locals told us we had to include a visit to a supper club to experience a unique part of the state's culture. So when I finally met Chris Wiken, whose family opened The Packing House in Milwaukee 50 years ago, my first question was, ""What on earth is a supper club?""

""This is the elusive question,"" he says. ""The whole idea of a supper club is somewhere that you're going to come and spend the evening at.""

Typically, a supper club will include a few things: a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned cocktail at the bar, seafood or prime rib in the dining room and then live music and a boozy ice cream drink to close out the night.

Even though The Packing House was remodeled about a decade ago, it still has a classic old-time aesthetic with dark wood and dim lighting. Walking through the doors feels like going back in time.

Milwaukee's main airport terminal was just across the street when The Packing House opened in 1974. Now, that terminal serves private jets where former President Donald Trump, Vice President Harris or their running mates park every time they come to town.

""The police and Secret Service come over and go, 'Hey, Chris, they have to close down the street again.' And then I go and shake my fist at them,"" he says, joking that he'll vote for whoever shuts down the street in front of his restaurant fewer times.

You won't see a Harris or Trump sign in front of The Packing House. Wiken doesn't want to alienate his customers, who have a wide range of views, as the All Things Considered crew and I discovered when we started chatting people up at the bar.

Janine Collette, having dinner with an old friend, remembers growing up in Wisconsin before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in the state.

""In high school, we used to raise money in the girls' bathrooms to help girls go to the state of New York to get an abortion,"" she says. ""We're not going back."" Collette is excited to cast her vote for the candidate she expects to become the first female U.S. president.

At the other end of the bar, Ron Raasch says that he has voted for Democrats his whole life and that this election may be the first time he doesn't. He's disillusioned with the two-party system and is considering a vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

""It's very hard to see the difference when both of the major parties are going to continue shipping arms all over the world and especially to Gaza,"" he says. Raasch isn't concerned that in 2016 and 2020 the margin of victory in Wisconsin for Trump and Biden, respectively, was less than 1% of the vote. ""People are throwing that as a fear tactic,"" he says. ""And I'm trying to [more so] make a statement that the two-party system is showing its age and its frailties.""

Wearing a Packers hat at the bar, Lee Cielonko is nursing a beer while he waits for his food to arrive. ""I want the economy to be put back together. I want energy. I want to drill, baby, drill, man,"" he says.

He's supporting Trump and is concerned about immigration, saying: ""People come here and they don't have the same culture as us. They don't understand and know a lot of the way our culture works.""

So much about the future, as well as this election, is uncertain; there can be something comforting in the familiar: fish fry Friday, a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned at the bar and live music in a place that has been doing pretty much the same thing since before most Americans were born."

As Hurricane Milton intensifies and heads toward Florida's Gulf Coast, residents are not only preparing for weather impacts but also dealing with misinformation about FEMA. The disaster relief agency has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in aid so far to help those affected by Hurricane Helene. Former President Donald Trump claims FEMA is running out of money after spending it on undocumented migrants. However, FEMA's administrator says those false claims are discouraging people from applying for the federal funds they desperately need.

Israelis yesterday observed a day of grief and reflection to mark one year since the Hamas-led attacks on communities near the country's border. Multiple memorials took place, partly due to disagreements over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence on continuing the war in Gaza. Families of hostages and their supporters boycotted the official government memorial service. They're seeking an immediate cease-fire deal to end the war and secure the release of the remaining 101 hostages.

In a wide-ranging interview with 60 Minutes yesterday, Vice President Harris was pressed for specifics on how she would pay for her economic plans and work to end the war in Ukraine. Her appearance on the show is part of a long tradition of presidential candidates sitting for interviews with 60 Minutes, dating back to 1968. Trump has criticized Harris for being unwilling to sit for difficult interviews with the press. The show says Trump was scheduled to appear for an interview as well, but his campaign canceled last week. Here's a deeper dive into Harris' responses during the interview.

NPR is visiting six key swing states that will likely decide this year's historic election. This week, Morning Edition is in Michigan to listen to voters about what matters to them and how that will affect their vote.

In 2017, Trump introduced ""Opportunity Zones,"" a tax incentive program aimed at encouraging investment in low-income and distressed communities like Detroit. Some were concerned at the time that investors would benefit more from the program than residents. Detroit Public Radio's Russ McNamara says it's a ""firm maybe"" that the program has reached its goal. Listen to hear more about what the program has achieved so far and how development in Opportunity Zones can be measured.

It's a string of media appearances that the vice president's campaign says is purposefully geared at reaching a wide variety of audiences on different platforms, especially as voting begins in many states around the country and Election Day inches closer.

""Vice President Harris is seizing this opportunity to reach voters where they are,"" a Harris campaign official said in a statement ahead of the vice president's interview with Cooper, adding that the appearance ""underscores the importance of connecting with younger audiences, especially those who will play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the election.""

Major party candidates have sat down with 60 Minutes dating back to 1968. The show has a traditionally older audience and a massive reach, remaining the highest-ranked news program for decades.

But with her interview with Cooper, who is a millennial, Harris became the first presidential candidate to ever appear on Call Her Daddy, one of the most popular podcasts in the country, especially among women, where nearly 8 in 10 of the show's listeners are under 35, according to metrics from Edison Research.

It's a podcast known for celebrity interviews and frank discussions, tailored to women, about topics like sex and relationships -- not politics. But that didn't stop Harris, who is banking on support from young voters this fall.

""I think you and your listeners have really got this thing right, which is, one of the best ways to communicate with people is to be real,"" Harris told Cooper after being asked why she wanted to come on the show.

""I think, especially now, this is a moment in the country and in life where people really want to know they're seen and heard,"" she added. ""And that they're part of a community. That they're not out there alone.""

Harris spoke with Cooper for about 40 minutes, spending the most time on the topic of protecting abortion access. The interview was an opportunity for Harris to try to reach a key voting bloc -- Gen Z and millennial voters, who have turned out at lower numbers than older generations.

Cooper has also built a massive fan base online, with more than 11 million followers across her show and personal accounts on Instagram and TikTok. Plus, Call Her Daddy has a politically and geographically diverse following, according to Edison.

Nearly half of the audience identifies as Democrats, compared to a quarter who are Republicans and 20% who are Independents. Plus, the largest portion of Cooper's listeners -- a third -- live in the South, an area with key swing states like Georgia and North Carolina.

It isn't the first time Harris has veered outside of mainstream news media to appeal to voting blocs key to her potential victory. Last month, she went on the sports podcast All the Smoke, a show geared towards Black men, hosted by former NBA players Stephen Jackson and Matt Barnes.

These moves are not unique to the Harris campaign. Former President Trump has also put an emphasis on reaching voters outside of traditional news outlets and on social media -- a strategy that has been central to the campaign's youth outreach.

While Trump has largely done interviews with news outlets that are friendly to conservatives, over the past few months, he and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have also appeared with a number of popular influencers and sat down for podcast interviews that have largely younger, male-dominated audiences.

That's included conversations with influencers who also have some of the top-ranked podcasts in the country, like Logan Paul -- who has a combined following of 46 million across TikTok and Instagram -- and Theo Von, who has collectively 14 million followers on the same platforms."

Vice President Harris sat for a wide-ranging interview that aired on 60 Minutes Monday, during which she was pressed for specifics on how she would pay for her economic plans and how she would bring an end to the war in Ukraine.

The interview with correspondent Bill Whitaker followed weeks of criticism from her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, that Harris has been unwilling to sit for difficult interviews with the press. Her appearance on 60 Minutes was part of a week-long media blitz that will see Harris appear on programs that include The View, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Howard Stern Show.

On the economy, Harris was pressed on how she would pay for economic promises like an expanded child tax credit and tax breaks for first time home buyers and new businesses. A new report from the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that Harris' estimated proposals would cost the government around $3.5 trillion, but Harris said she would offset that by raising taxes on corporations and the highest-earning Americans.

Her answer led interviewer Whitaker to push back, saying, ""We're dealing with the real world here."" Harris responded by saying she believes leaders in Congress are privately ready to listen to her.

""When you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about,"" she said, adding that there are ""plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

On the issue of immigration, Harris was asked why the Biden administration to did not move sooner to crack down on illegal immigration - a recurring criticism on the campaign trail from Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.

""The policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem,"" Harris said. Illegal border crossings have fallen off by half, she said, ""but we need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem.""

Harris was also asked about criticism from her Republican opponents that she has morphed from a relatively liberal candidate during her first run for the White House in 2020 to a more centrist candidate today. She responded by saying that her evolution is result of traveling the nation as vice president ""and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground.""

""I believe in building consensus,"" Harris said. ""We are a diverse people, geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds, and what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus, where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing, as long as you don't compromise your values.""

On foreign policy, Harris said she would not meet unilaterally with President Vladimir Putin of Russia about ending the war in in Ukraine, suggesting Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy would need to be involved. ""Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine,"" Harris said.

The vice president also shared new details about a surprising admission she made during her debate with Trump: that she is a gun owner. -- that she was a gun owner.

She told Oprah Winfrey last month that she had long owned a gun for protection, because of her history in law enforcement. ""If somebody breaks in my house, they're getting shot."" She told Whitaker she owned a Glock and that she'd ""had it for quite some time."" Asked if she had ever fired it, she said, ""Yes, of course I have, at a shooting range.""

Harris' appearance was part of a long tradition of presidential candidates sitting for interviews with 60 Minutes going back to 1968. The show said Trump had been scheduled to appear for an interview as well, but that his campaign canceled last week."
Harris and Trump marked 1 year since the Oct. 7 attacks with tributes to the victims,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144699/kamala-harris-donald-trump-october-7,2024-10-07T22:25:41Z,"One year after Hamas attacked Israel, both major-party presidential candidates marked the date on Monday with promises of continued support for the Jewish state.

Vice President Harris remembered the victims of the Oct. 7 attack by planting a memorial tree at her residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., while former President Trump visited a sacred site for Hasidic Jews in Queens, N.Y.

""I will never forget October 7, and the world must never forget,"" Harris said during a tree-planting ceremony on the grounds of the vice president's residence. ""We must work to ensure nothing like the horrors of October 7 can ever happen again.""

Hamas, which controls Gaza, killed about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7 and took some 250 hostage in Gaza, according to Israel. A year later, more than 100 hostages are still unaccounted for. Israel's response to the attack has killed at least 41,000 people in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials.

Harris reiterated her support for Israel's defense, and promised the Biden administration would continue working to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. She then read the names of seven missing American citizens.

Harris also called for efforts to ""relieve the immense suffering of innocent Palestinians in Gaza who have experienced so much pain and loss over the year.""

She appeared alongside her husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish and and who has led White House efforts to fight antisemitism.

Trump met with members of an Orthodox Jewish community in New York on Monday morning, and visited the grave of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, an influential orthodox rabbi who died in 1994. Trump was then scheduled to attend an Oct. 7 remembrance event Monday evening with Jewish leaders, according to Trump campaign officials.

Hamas' stated goal is the elimination of Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israel says the objective of the war in Gaza is to eliminate Hamas.

The war has exposed rifts within the Democratic Party over the Biden-Harris administration's support for Israel. Those divides are particularly pronounced among younger voters -- a key voting bloc for Democrats and a group more likely than older voters to express sympathy for the Palestinian people. According to the Pew Research Center, voters ages 18-29 also are less supportive of U.S. military aid to Israel.

Trump has sought to capitalize on those tensions within his rival's party, saying recently that any Jewish voter who supports a Democrat is a ""fool."" Those remarks drew widespread criticism from Jewish organizations across the ideological spectrum.

He continued emphasizing the message in an interview Monday with radio host Hugh Hewitt. ""I did more for Israel than anybody, I did more for the Jewish people than anybody, and it's not a reciprocal, as they say,"" Trump said."
Fact checking falsehoods about FEMA funding and Hurricane Helene,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144159/fema-funding-migrants-disaster-relief-fund,2024-10-07T19:19:40Z,"Debris seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene on September 30, in Asheville, N.C. Mike Stewart/AP hide caption

Rumors, misinformation and lies about the federal government's response to Hurricane Helene in the southeastern United States have run rampant since the storm made landfall, especially around funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The claims have become so widespread that FEMA set up a response page to debunk many falsehoods around how disaster funding works and what the agency's response has been.

As of Sunday, FEMA says it has provided more than $137 million in assistance to six states in the southeast, including 7,000 federal personnel, nearly 15 million meals, 14 million liters of water, 157 generators and more than half a million tarps.

The agency also says more than 3,000 North Carolina residents have been rescued or supported by more than 1,200 urban search and rescue personnel, with recovery efforts aided by National Guard and active-duty troops. North Carolina has also received $100 million in federal transportation funds to rebuild roads and bridges washed out by the storm.

Republicans, especially former President Donald Trump, have sought to wield the storm as a political tool against Vice President Harris with less than a month to go before Election Day. Trump has repeatedly attacked Harris and President Biden as doing a ""bad job"" handling the storm's aftermath without specifics, instead using misleading math to complain about immigration and foreign aid.

""They're offering them $750 to people whose homes have been washed away,"" Trump said Saturday at a rally in Butler, Pa. ""And yet we send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of. They're offering them $750. They've been destroyed. These people have been destroyed.""

The $750 Trump refers to is what's called Serious Needs Assistance, an initial direct relief payment intended to help cover emergency supplies like food, water, baby formula and other basics

The serious needs assistance is one of many changes to FEMA's individual assistance programs that took effect earlier this year, along with displacement assistance to cover immediate housing needs while residents sort out long-term options. FEMA assistance also covers storm-related damage to homes and personal property.

Another popular refrain that has gained traction on the right in recent days is the claim that FEMA has no money for hurricane recovery because of money spent on migrants, something that is not true.

The money used in the aftermath of Helene and other major disasters is not part of FEMA's operating budget, but instead comes from the Disaster Relief Fund, which is appropriated by Congress.

Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas reportedly said the agency ""does not have the funds to make it through"" the rest of hurricane season.

FEMA is required to share monthly status reports on the DRF, and before the end of the fiscal year the agency had to implement ""Immediate Needs Funding"" that puts a pause on some of the agency's spending that is not tied to lifesaving and life-sustaining efforts when the needs of the DRF could be more than the remaining balance.

The most recent report that runs through August showed a projected deficit by the end of September -- and that's before Helene made landfall.

October is the start of the federal government's fiscal year, and a stopgap spending measure approved by lawmakers last month replenished the DRF at last year's baseline level of $20 billion, though some of that money is reserved for ongoing recovery efforts from previous disasters and projects to mitigate future impacts.

The DRF is often considered the first line of response while FEMA and other agencies assess the damage and needs related to a specific disaster. Once that information is compiled, the president typically sends a formal request to Congress for supplemental appropriations to provide more closely tailored funding and programs for any given response.

Congress has not yet passed supplemental funding for other disasters that occurred earlier in the year, much to the frustration of members in communities recovering from floods, fires and other major events. Even if they had approved the existing funding request, the money would not have been directed to Helene relief since the storm damage happened after Congress left Washington at the end of September.

Lawmakers could return to Washington to try to pass more aid but they are waiting for the White House to send an updated funding request. President Biden wrote a letter to Congress last week that said FEMA ""has the resources needed for the immediate emergency response phase.""

Biden went on to say an updated request is on its way.

""My Administration will keep the Congress apprised of efforts to assess the full resource requirements associated with Hurricane Helene, including for long-term rebuilding and resilience efforts, as those estimates become available,"" he wrote.

One continuing resolution proposed in the House last month would have included an additional $10 billion for the fund, but that version failed because it was tied to a controversial Republican-backed election bill that focused on further cracking down on already-illegal non-citizen voting.

An August report from the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General argues that billions of dollars earmarked for disasters that occurred more than a decade ago could be returned to the Disaster Relief Fund.

But the false argument from Trump and other Republicans has been that the Biden administration diverted disaster money to take care of migrants.

""They stole the FEMA money, just like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them this season,"" Trump said in Michigan last week.

Non-citizens cannot vote in the election, and no disaster funds have been diverted. Instead, Trump and his allies are referring to the Shelter and Services Program that saw FEMA disseminate hundreds of millions in grants from Customs and Border Protection to municipalities that saw an influx of migrants.

That program was a separate funding source with a separate purpose covering separate years - and not relevant to the current hurricane recovery efforts.

Meanwhile, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday he had no plans to bring lawmakers back from recess before the election to address requests for additional disaster relief as Hurricane Milton approaches the Florida coast as a Category 5 storm."
"1 year after Hamas attacked Israel, the conflict grows more dangerous than ever",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/g-s1-26381/hamas-israel-hezbollah-gaza-lebanon,2024-10-07T16:07:28Z,"A girl walks through the rubble of a collapsed building in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Oct. 2, amid the war in the Palestinian territory between Israel and Hamas. Bashar Taleb/AFP via Getty Images hide caption

Thousands breached a border fence. Others arrived in speedboats. Some even came by paraglider in a dawn attack by Hamas fighters a year ago that caught Israel by surprise, leaving 1,200 people dead and another 250 as hostages. It also set in motion events that now threaten to turn Israel's long-running conflict with Iran's proxies into a direct and dangerous war with Tehran.

Saturday, Oct. 7, 2023, marked the deadliest day in the history of modern Israel, triggering a devastating attack on Palestinians. The result has been a humanitarian catastrophe for Gaza. Beginning in the days after the Hamas attack, Israeli warplanes began punishing airstrikes inside the narrow strip of Palestinian territory that also lies adjacent to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. By the end of the month, Israeli forces had launched a full-scale ground invasion of Gaza.

At the one-year mark in the Israel-Hamas war, here are four things that are key to where things stand today.

In the aftermath of the Hamas attack, as Israelis mourned those killed, they also feared for the safety of the hostages. A central plaza in downtown Tel Aviv, unofficially dubbed Hostages Square, was quickly transformed into a gathering place for the families, friends and supporters of the captives. ""Bring them home now!"" emerged as a potent rallying cry, and posters showing the faces and names of the hostages became ubiquitous. Many Israelis began wearing special necklaces, bracelets and T-shirts to show their support for the captives. Daily vigils in Hostages Square drew large crowds.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- already weathering intense criticism for intelligence failures in the lead-up to the surprise attack -- came under intense pressure to halt the fighting in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages.

Although Israel and Hamas managed a brief cease-fire in November that allowed for the exchange of more than 100 hostages for nearly 250 Palestinian prisoners, the truce lasted just a week. Hamas did unilaterally release four hostages, and eight others were rescued by Israeli forces. Israel's military also recovered the bodies of several hostages.

The fate of the remaining captives in Gaza has remained an open wound for many Israelis. Netanyahu's office believes that of the 101 hostages still unaccounted for in Gaza, about a third are likely dead.

The hostages question continues to shape Israel's public response to the conflict.

Since the start of Israel's military response, the country's attacks have killed at least 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including 16,500 children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Another 95,000 people have been injured, the ministry says.

Israel's military began its assault on Hamas in the north of Gaza, and as Palestinian civilians sought to escape the fighting, most of them fled southward, displacing them from their homes and cutting them off from critical infrastructure needed for daily survival.

Recent data from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health Organization and Palestinian officials in Gaza indicate the attacks have damaged or destroyed more than half of Gaza's homes, 80% of its commercial facilities and 85% of the territory's schools.

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has called the humanitarian situation in Gaza a ""moral stain on us all,"" and the aid group Refugees International has said that Israel's military response ""has wrought disproportionate death and suffering among civilians in Gaza, generating famine-like conditions while obstructing and undermining the humanitarian response.""

Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city, which Israeli authorities considered to be a Hamas stronghold, experienced some of the most intense bombardment of the conflict.

In the first few months of fighting, Rafah, near the border with Egypt in southern Gaza, was designated as a ""safe zone"" by the Israeli military -- meant as a place where civilians could shelter and get access to desperately needed international humanitarian aid. Even so, Israel continued to carry out airstrikes on Rafah, some targeted at Hamas fighters or facilities, while others aimed to free Israeli hostages, according to the Israeli military. Some of those airstrikes hit homes, killing and injuring dozens of civilians, and others destroyed food distribution sites. More than half of Gaza's prewar population of 2.2 million was believed to be sheltering in Rafah. In May, Israel issued evacuation orders for the city and launched an offensive that sealed the border with Egypt, which until then was one of the main entry points for humanitarian aid.

Food, drinking water and materials for temporary shelters are in short supply and are being carried in by trucks operated by international relief organizations. People in Gaza are down to one meal every other day, and an estimated 50,000 children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are in urgent need of treatment for malnutrition.

U.S. efforts to speed aid to Gaza have also floundered. A special $230 million temporary floating pier known as the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore system (JLOTS) operated only intermittently as damage from high winds and rough seas in the eastern Mediterranean repeatedly rendered it inoperable.

Besides the brief cease-fire to facilitate a hostages-for-prisoners swap, repeated rounds of peace talks -- some mediated by Qatar -- have failed to make much progress. Deep-seated animosities and the fragmented nature of the Palestinian leadership have played a part in preventing any lasting peace deal.

Meanwhile, the U.S. has tried to walk a fine line between diplomatic and military support for its long-term ally, Israel, and a desire to mitigate the suffering in Gaza while trying to contain a wider war that increasingly has dragged Iran and Israel into direct conflict and could engulf the rest of the Middle East.

For the moment, cease-fire talks that at times sparked optimism have fallen silent.

In late September, Secretary of State Antony Blinken summed up the U.S. position, saying, ""Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorism. The way it does so matters.""

Meanwhile, public opinion in the U.S. has been split largely along partisan lines, with conservatives showing support for Israel, but some people, younger and more liberal, turning out for pro-Palestinian rallies on college campuses.

Among Democrats, more than half say that Israel bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war in Gaza, while only about 4 in 10 Republicans do, according to a Pearson Institute/AP-NORC poll published last week.

That political dichotomy could influence the outcome of a likely tight U.S. presidential race, with some Democrats suggesting that Netanyahu is ignoring the Biden administration's peace entreaties in an effort to tip the election toward former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, voters in key battleground states give Trump higher marks than his opponent, Vice President Harris, on foreign policy matters, according to a recent poll by the New York-based Institute for Global Affairs.

From the opening days of the conflict in Gaza, the Biden administration warned against allowing the Hamas attack to morph into a war that could bring in Hezbollah -- the Lebanon-based, Iran-backed militant group -- as a primary combatant and could eventually lead to a direct conflict with Tehran.

But increasingly in recent weeks, that's exactly what seems to be happening.

On Oct. 8, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets against Israel in support of the Palestinian militants fighting in Gaza. Israel hit back, and for months, low-level conflict simmered along the Lebanon-Israel border. Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, mostly stayed out of the conflict. But an Israeli attack in April against an Iranian diplomatic base in Syria that killed several of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers changed the dynamic. Less than two weeks later, Iran retaliated with a large-scale drone and missile strike on Israel. The attack, heavily telegraphed by Tehran in an apparent effort to contain the fallout, was easily repulsed by Israeli air defenses, assisted by the United States.

Fast-forward to last month: In an operation credited to Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, in synchronized attacks over two days, electronic pagers belonging to members of Hezbollah suddenly exploded across Lebanon, killing more than a dozen people -- including two children -- and wounding thousands more, according to Lebanese health authorities.

Soon after, Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes against southern Lebanon that it said were aimed at Hezbollah targets. One that hit a residential building in downtown Beirut killed a top Hezbollah commander.

As Israeli airstrikes continued days later, multiple residential buildings in southern Beirut were demolished. On Sept. 27, Israel announced that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who led the militant group for more than three decades, was killed in one of the strikes. Hezbollah later confirmed his death.

Israel also hit ports and power stations in Yemen operated by another Iran-backed group, the Houthis.

The United Nations says about 1 million Lebanese have fled their homes amid the Israeli airstrikes. Israeli authorities say about 63,000 Israelis remain displaced from the border area with Lebanon due to Hezbollah rocket fire.

On Oct. 1, Israel opened a ground offensive in southern Lebanon, a move that hearkened back to a similar 1982 invasion of the country's south by Israeli forces, which led to an 18-year occupation and to a monthlong war that Israel fought against Hezbollah in 2006. Less than 24 hours later, Iran launched a massive ballistic missile attack on Israel. The country's extensive defenses -- bolstered by two U.S. destroyers deployed in the region -- intercepted most of the Iranian missiles. However, Israeli officials acknowledge that some of the Iranian missiles did hit an air base."
"Trump and his faithful followers return to Butler, Pa., to energize the flock",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5141930/trump-butler-elon-musk-christianity-evangelical-2024-election,2024-10-07T15:31:26Z,"Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump addresses a campaign rally at the Butler Farm Show grounds on Sunday in Butler, Pa. This was the first time that Trump has returned to Butler since he was injured during an attempted assassination on July 13. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images hide caption

Nearly eight hours before Trump spoke in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, Bernie Haney and his wife, Christa, managed to get seats near the stage. They had been present for the shooting on July 13, and God was part of their decision to return.

""We had some hesitation about coming,"" said Bernie Haney. ""But we absolutely believe that God was looking over him because of the angel, and so if God was looking after him then, he'd be looking out for him now.""

That ""angel"" he mentioned refers to a massive flag that hung over the stage on July 13. When the wind tangled it, some believed the resulting shape looked like an angel. After Trump narrowly escaped assassination, the flag took on a weightier meaning.

On Saturday, that flag-angel was shown constantly on the rally screens, and it was even on a sign on the way into town.

It's an example of a years-long phenomenon: the evangelical Christianity that long predated Trump in the GOP has now fused with Trump's cult of personality, as he has taken over the GOP. The result is a potent fuel for his campaign that was very apparent in Butler Saturday.

The rally was somber at times -- there was a moment of silence for Corey Comperatore, who died on July 13. That moment was followed by the sound of a tolling bell and a recording of Ave Maria.

But the mood also often turned celebratory, as when multiple speakers credited God for saving him from the shooter.

Among them was vice presidential nominee JD Vance.

""I believe, as sure as I'm standing here today, that what happened was a true miracle,"" Vance told the crowd. ""And on that day, America felt the truth of scripture -- 'Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me.' I truly believe that God saved President Trump's life that day.""

Trump himself echoed that in his speech.

""By the hand of Providence and the grace of God, that villain did not succeed in his goal, did not come close,"" Trump said. ""He did not break out our spirit. He did not shake our unyielding resolve to save America from evils of poverty, hatred and destruction.""

Many Trump followers, like Christa and Bernie Haney, believe that. But that leads to a difficult question of faith: if God saved Trump, why not spare Comperatore?

They admitted that it's a difficult question.

""I mean, my heart goes out to that family, the Comperatore family,"" Christa said, and her husband jumped in to elaborate.

""We don't know why he wasn't protected,"" Bernie Haney said. ""But, you know, you don't always know why God does what he does.""

Trump supporters use language to describe him that goes beyond how many voters talk about politicians.

""He's touched something, I think in all of us, that we see how it was and how it could be and how it's not now,"" said Mark Usciak as he stood in line on Saturday morning.

With millions already voting, Trump's followers feel the urgency growing. Several, like Peg Napolitano, told me they're volunteering for the campaign. In fact, Napolitano laid down her work to devote time to Trump.

""I retired early from my job of 18 years, and I've been doing this ever since, because I saw at that moment how important this really is,"" she said of July 13. ""I have six grandchildren, and I can't leave the earth with this being the way it is. And so, yeah, why not fight for him? He's fighting for us. Look what he did here July 13th. He stood up and kept fighting. So how do we not do that?""

Even at a rally marking a somber occasion, Trump still gave a Trump speech. He cast undocumented immigrants as dangerous -- which has no basis in fact -- and sowed distrust in elections -- Trump multiple times warned that Democrats would cheat this year.

Again, there's no evidence of this. But Trump ally Elon Musk, making a special appearance, put the situation in dark terms.

""Text people now -- now -- and then make sure they actually do vote,"" he told the crowd. ""If they don't, this will be the last election. That's my prediction.""

Which shows that with one month to Election Day, the Trump campaign is not moderating. They're not evangelizing to the unconverted. They're firing up the believers and making sure the whole flock gets out to vote."

One year ago today, Hamas launched an ambush attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking hostages. This unleashed the deadliest war in Palestinian history. According to the Gaza health ministry, at least 41,000 people in Gaza have been killed by Israeli airstrikes and fire. Now, Israel is bombing Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Hear directly from people in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank as they describe how one year of this war has upended their lives. For more coverage marking this anniversary, check out NPR's special series page.

The war in the Middle East is personal in the swing state of Michigan. The GOP and Democrats are focused on the Arab and Muslim American voting bloc, and the state has the largest Lebanese American population in the country. Many in the state have families living in the areas of Lebanon that are being bombed right now.

A new report has found that both Harris' and Trump's economic plans would increase the national debt. According to the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, Trump's plan would add an estimated $7.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, while Harris' proposals would cost the government an estimated $3.5 trillion. The committee has cautioned that there could be a future fiscal crisis if politicians do not take more decisive action on the national debt. Let's take a closer look at the details of both economic plans.

NPR is visiting six key swing states that will likely decide this year's historic election. This week, Morning Edition is in Michigan to listen to voters about what matters to them and how that will affect their vote.

Michigan, a ""blue wall"" state, is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House. But the victory won't be easy. Harris and former President Donald Trump remain in a close battle. Here are key factors that could decide which way Michigan swings:

This essay was written by Daniel Estrin, NPR's international correspondent in Jerusalem.

""The day still keeps surprising us,"" my colleague Anas Baba in Gaza texted me last Oct. 7, close to midnight.

I was at a hospital in southern Israel. The waiting room was full of parents in a daze, waiting for word about their children who had come under attack at an outdoor techno rave near the Gaza border. In Gaza, our producer Anas was taking photos of families fleeing their homes as Israeli airstrikes rained down.

It was the deadliest day in Israeli history. It sparked the deadliest war in Palestinian history. One year later, it has grown into a regional war. Every day keeps surprising us.

A year later, I find myself thinking about where the survivors and witnesses of this war draw strength.

I think about Batya Ofir, a woman my colleague Itay Stern and I met the other day at Kibbutz Be'eri, the Israeli village that suffered the greatest loss -- 102 people there were killed. Her brother was killed along with his family. She felt survivor's guilt, and she told us she asked herself whether she wanted to keep on living.

""I really thought about it. And then I decided that I wanted to continue to live,"" she said. Today, she is learning how to kayak in the sea to help her face her fears. ""I do everything to give some meaning to life now that they're gone.""

Our colleague Anas Baba in Gaza has been reporting for NPR in Gaza all year. Again and again, he has videotaped bodies brought into the morgue after Israeli airstrikes. He always trains his camera on young children, sheltering near the morgue, standing alone and watching silently as bodies are laid out.

What gives him strength, he said, is collecting biscuits and fruit to give to the children he meets. ""I can help them survive,"" he told me.

He often meets a young girl named Habiba at the hospital in central Gaza. She's been colorblind since birth. One day, she told Anas she saw a man drowning with water coming out of his nose. It wasn't water; it was blood.

""This girl does not know the color of blood,"" Anas told me. ""I wish all the children in Gaza were colorblind now."""
Helene recovery is more political online than on the ground,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/g-s1-26584/helene-recovery-north-carolina-tennessee-flooding-fema,2024-10-07T11:40:08Z,"In Swannanoa, N.C., neighbors didn't wait for government assistance before jumping in to help each other after flooding and landslides. Some critics point to the high number of grassroots efforts as proof the government has abandoned Helene victims. Gerard Albert III/BPR hide caption

APPALACHIA REGION, N.C. and TENN. -- It's election season, so maybe it's no surprise that the federal response to damage in Hurricane Helene's wake is a hot topic, especially on social media. However, some of the conspiracies, misinformation, and rumors that circulate are extraordinary.

Enough so that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is addressing them directly: No, FEMA can't seize your land if it's ""deemed unlivable"" and the agency says rumors it's confiscating private donations are false.

On the ground in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee, NPR reporters are hearing echoes of this misinformation. But they've also found less politicization and a more nuanced view of the federal response, especially in communities that have been without internet access since Helene raged through the region.

Elon Musk's social media platform X has been an especially fertile place for politically charged rumors and conspiracies. Sometimes they have been fueled by the billionaire himself.

On Friday Musk fed into a common complaint online that governments are preventing private citizens from offering help to people in need. Musk wrote that his ""blood is boiling"" after engineers from his company SpaceX tried to offer help via helicopter but ""@FEMA wouldn't let them land to deliver critical supplies.""

Actually the Federal Aviation Administration regulates airspace and the FAA said in a statement that following Helene the skies have been crowded and it's trying to maintain safety. A federal official confirmed to NPR that there have been more than 30 cases where two aircraft almost collided, as air traffic in the region increased 300% after the storm. There are no restrictions to aerial recovery operations.

Perhaps no area in North Carolina has been the subject of more blatant false online rumors than Chimney Rock -- including the persistent untrue claim that FEMA abandoned the village so that the Biden administration can mine lithium there.

""Anything that you see, that you hear that sounds like that is not true,"" says village mayor Peter O'Leary.

""It's a little disturbing and just upsetting that people want to believe the horrible stuff, but they don't want to believe the true stuff,"" he says.

FEMA could be moving a little faster than it has been, he admits, and he has had moments of frustration, ""[but] every time I found out why somebody's not moving as fast, the reason for it is always a good, sound reason,"" he says.

North Carolinians with no previous experience living through a natural disaster may be understandably wary of FEMA. The agency has received a lot of bad press in the past for how it handled other disasters, such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy.

""People up here aren't going to put up with the bureaucratic stuff,"" says Colt Truesdale, a North Carolinian who organized a donations drive and benefit concert Saturday afternoon in Mill Spring. Like so many people in this part of the country, he's not waiting for government assistance or leadership, instead taking matters into his own hands to help neighbors.

""We're just a different breed up here, and it's starting to get spicy,"" he grins.

In Jonesborough, Tenn., where the Nolichucky River flooded rural farms and homes, there are echoes of the online kerfuffles but also a desire to step away from politics.

""We've been in a bit of an internet black hole down here,"" says Mollie Freeman, as she picks up muddy items off the floor of her mother-in-law's flooded house and puts them in a trash bag. ""We're just kind of focused on helping each other and just haven't paid too much attention to it.""

A mile-and-a-half down the road, a local bar has become a collection and distribution center for donations and a source of hot meals for those helping locals recover. It's also where neighbors catch up and share news -- not all of it true.

""There is no organization. It's called community,"" says Tabitha Swinehart, who has lived here for 30 years. Asked about the federal government's response to storm damage she says, ""Honestly, I don't know what you're talking about. There has been none. We haven't seen any federal response."" FEMA says nearly 7,000 federal employees have been deployed across the region.

Swinehart then packs hot meals onto a blue four-wheeled utility vehicle and speeds away to deliver them up mountain roads that are no longer accessible by car.

The owner of Green Turtle Garage Bar, Stacey Puzio, is wearing a Trump t-shirt. ""Pretty much all of my whole wardrobe is either Trump or Green Turtle,"" she laughs. Jonesborough is in Washington County, which voted for Donald Trump in 2020 by a two-to-one margin.

""Well, you got a lot of conservatives over here who are not fond of the government,"" Puzio says. While the bar only just got electricity restored, some of the politically charged misinformation about the federal government's response to Helene has reached her.

""Somebody mentioned that [Vice President] Harris was going to be gracious enough to send $750 to ease the strain of losing your loved one and your pets and your home,"" Puzio scoffs, ""So I'm sure that'll make a huge difference for everybody.""

FEMA distributes disaster assistance and says rumors that only $750 will be available are false. This is just one program called ""Serious Needs Assistance"" for immediate help with ""essential items like food, water, baby formula, breastfeeding supplies, medication and other emergency supplies."" The agency says there are other programs available that can help pay for things like temporary housing and repairing a home.

Former President Donald Trump has accused the Biden administration of ""going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas."" But relief volunteers like Tyler King of Johnson City, Tenn., say they want to avoid partisanship now.

""When that stuff becomes the focus, I think we're worried about the wrong things,"" says King. ""I think to go down those roads is a little irrelevant when there are people hurting, dying and in need.""

Along with FEMA assistance, volunteers and community food and supply drives help fill the gaps, and these efforts sometimes lead to striking displays of non-partisanship.

In Swannanoa, N.C., wedding photographer Michael Freas drops off a Starlink internet receiver to a park where another grassroots relief effort has sprung up. His contribution earns him a comforting hug from one of the volunteers in charge of the donation table.

The Asheville resident says it's been a relief to set aside the political tensions and focus on building neighborly connections.

""I think with the climate, with how everything [was] pre-storm, I haven't heard one talk about this or that,"" he says, referring to how politically charged his interactions had been before tragedy put everyone on common ground.

In fact, Freas says, he's been having unexpectedly poignant moments with people on the other end of the political spectrum -- including with one stranger who parked a car covered in MAGA bumper stickers on the same bridge from which Freas surveyed the damage to south Asheville.

They looked over the destruction, then hugged -- a moment of empathy that would have been unimaginable just a week earlier.

""It was a pretty powerful moment,"" he said. ""I'll remember it for the rest of my life."""
"Guns, transgender rights, porn: The Supreme Court begins another term",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5100857/supreme-court-term,2024-10-07T09:06:24Z,"The U.S. Supreme Court begins a new term this week, with public opinion of the court at near record lows. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images hide caption

The U.S. Supreme Court opens a new term this week, with guns, transgender rights, pornography, and lots more on the docket, including potential election cases in the wings.

In the wake of last year's tumultuous term and the court's decision giving broad immunity to former President Trump for his actions while in office, the court finds itself stuck on the wrong end of public opinion, a place where, according to the Gallup poll, it has largely been mired since 2021. The partisan gap is gargantuan, and has been since the court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Adding to its woes have been ethics controversies and the kinds of leaks that have previously been unheard of, including one this year about what went on behind the scenes in the immunity case.

""Something does seem broken,"" says Lisa Blatt, a veteran Supreme Court advocate. ""At oral argument, which is when I see them [the justices], they just seem visibly frustrated.""

For the most part, the justices still try to portray the court as amicable, but you don't have to be a genius to see that they are not exactly happy campers.

That said, the work has to get done, and there is already a fair amount of controversy on the justices' plate. Once again, it's the social issues that will interest most people, though there are plenty of relatively dry, though important, cases on regulation of everything from the environment to e-cigarettes. The three social issue cases already on the docket involve transgender rights, guns and porn.

The transgender case is a test of laws in 24 states that have banned the use of puberty blockers and other hormone treatments for minors.

""This is obviously the blockbuster case of the term,"" says Deepak Gupta, a Supreme Court practitioner and lecturer at the Harvard law school litigation clinic. ""It's a case of enormous significance"" and ""presents fundamental questions about the scope of state power to regulate medical care for minors, and the rights of parents to make medical decisions for your children."" Interestingly, Gupta notes that these questions are ones ""which you may think of in a different context as conservative values.""

The other blockbuster case of the term, at least so far, is one involving so-called ghost guns that are made from build-it-yourself guns kits bought online. Unlike guns bought from a licensed dealer, these guns are untraceable. They have no serial numbers, can be purchased anonymously and without any background checks. In 2022, as the number of these guns found at crime scenes mushroomed into the tens of thousands and law enforcement became alarmed, the ATF classified the kits as firearms subject to same laws that apply to licensed gun dealers. The Biden administration argues that the regulation tracks the 1968 Gun Control Act, which defines a firearm as ""any weapon that is quote designed to or may readily be converted into a functional firearm."" The kit sellers counter that a bunch of parts are not a firearm.

A second gun case tests whether the Mexican government can sue U.S. gun manufactures for allegedly aiding and abetting illegal gun sales to traffickers for Mexican cartels. Mexico has extremely strict gun laws that make it almost impossible for people to obtain guns legally.

Moving on to pornography, Texas passed a law limiting access to sexually explicit material on the internet for kids under 18. The law requires submission of various age verification measures, such as a government-issued ID card, in order to get access to adult sites. A coalition of free-speech groups, backed by both liberal and conservative groups, challenged the law, contending that it's written so broadly that it chills the speech of adults who would realistically fear extortion, identity theft and even tracking of their habits by the government and others. The challengers claim that there are for less intrusive age verification methods. But the conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law, so now the Supreme Court will have the last word.

Finally, there are lots of cases waiting in the wings. Religion cases, environmental cases, and The Trump Jan. 6 prosecution could well come back. And for icing on the cake, there could be questions that arise from the upcoming presidential election. Trump supporters have already brought all manner of challenges to the way elections are to be conducted, but so far, nobody has any idea how those challenges will shake out. Most of the justices would clearly like to steer clear of playing a major role in the election, but they have just as clearly left room on the docket to act if they have to."
It's a close race for Michigan. These factors could decide it for Harris or Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5130163/michigan-2024-election-harris-trump,2024-10-07T09:06:21Z,"A Trump and Harris sign side-by-side in a neighborhood on Oct. 3, 2024 in Hillsdale, Mich. Sylvia Jarrus for NPR hide caption

Michigan is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House.

The state is part of the ""blue wall,"" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that she and Democrats need to hold to avoid a second Donald Trump presidency.

It's home to some of the key demographics that both parties are courting this election, from white voters without college degrees to the largest Black-majority city, Detroit, and one of the nation's largest Arab American populations.

But the path to victory is not easy this year. Harris and Trump remain in a close battle, as his populist message continues to resonate with white voters and union and blue-collar workers, particularly on the economy.

Dave Dulio, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, says ""in places like Macomb County, with many blue-collar voters and union workers, Trump made inroads by pledging to get the U.S. out of bad trade deals and renegotiate NAFTA, which he did.""

""I think they still give him credit for that,"" he added.

Dulio underscores the state's significance by noting that small shifts could lead to substantial changes for candidates: ""If you take a small shift among the Arab American community and a small shift among union workers, those multiple small shifts could drive a very different result.""

Both candidates have heaped attention recently on the Wolverine State. On Oct 4, Harris visited a Redford Charter Township firehouse near Detroit, meeting union representatives. She met with Arab American and Muslim leaders then appeared with United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain in Flint and vowed support for Michigan's auto industry. Trump held campaign events twice in September and took his presidential campaign to Saginaw Valley State University in Kochville Township on Oct. 3.

Michigan also plays to the strengths of the vice presidential nominees, who hail from the Midwest. Both Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have stumped in the state in the last month.

To better understand the key issues shaping voters' decisions -- from the economy and immigration to abortion and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East -- we are in Michigan this week hearing directly from voters and political observers as part of our ""We, The Voters"" series.

A September poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Michigan voters cared most about the economy, followed by abortion and immigration.

Economy

Michigan's unemployment rate is historically low, according to state data, but it has slowly ticked up in recent months. Meanwhile, inflation has eased, but high costs of living remain a concern.

The state continues to suffer from the decades-long decline of automobile manufacturing, and high interest rates have constricted sales of cars, according to a September study from the University of Michigan.

Both parties are trying to put focus on the economy. GOP attack ads argue that Biden and Harris are responsible for inflation, while the vice president's messaging focuses on plans to uplift the middle class and paint Trump-era tax cuts as benefiting the wealthy.

Meghan Wilson, an expert in public policy and urban development, said Harris could expand the Democratic position on economics by appealing to Black business owners and holders of student debt.

""African Americans in Detroit have a lot of small businesses, and so we're looking for capital for those kinds of small businesses. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job of bringing the small businesses into the conversation,"" Wilson explained.

Organized labor plays a key role in Michigan's economy. Both parties are making a play for Michigan's union members, who accounted for 13% of workers in the state last year. Exit polls in 2020 showed Michigan's union voters favoring President Biden over Trump, and Biden pledged to be ""the most pro-union president"" in U.S. history, which he backed up with a visit to UAW workers striking in Wayne, Mich.

Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said Biden's visit to striking workers helped him bump up his union support, but his policies to advance electric vehicles with tax credits were unpopular with Independent and Republican voters.

""You have Harris leading among union members with 63% which is almost where Biden was in 2020 with 65%, so she's improving her lot among union members, but still, the EVs are a problem,"" he said.

Still, one encouraging sign for the Harris campaign could be Michigan's local Teamsters union backing her candidacy, breaking with the national union that declined to endorse any candidate for U.S. president, after they had supported every Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton.

Abortion

Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a landmark amendment to the state constitution, securing the right to abortion and other reproductive health services.

Democrats won control of all three branches of Michigan's governments since making abortion a central voting issue.

But that success may have made it a less influential issue in the 2024 election. A KFF poll in June found that women in Michigan saw abortion as ""decided"" and they were more concerned about inflation and the rising cost of living.

""The Democrats are putting an awful lot of their eggs in the basket of abortion,"" the pollster Porn said.

Dulio pointed out that Trump's main weakness stems from what has driven Democratic success in every election -- and not necessarily abortion since it's already decided in the state: ""His character remains a key weakness. He's deeply unpopular because of the Jan. 6 spectacle and doubling down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. That just turns off persuadable voters,"" he said.

Michigan is home to one of the largest Black populations in the nation, ahead of Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, and the largest Black-majority city, Detroit.

Harris would herself be the nation's first Black woman president, but some Black voters may not be as motivated to vote as they were in 2020.

""The main challenge is the enthusiasm gap,"" said Ronald Brown, a political scientist at Wayne State University. He said among Black voters in Michigan, those who were in the ""black leadership class"" -- meaning serving in government, churches, Black fraternities and sororities -- were highly likely to vote for Harris. However, those without deep connections to the party, especially working-class and poor Detroit residents, were susceptible to sitting out elections. In particular, he pointed to Detroit's recent voter turnout -- higher in 2020 than it was in 2016 -- as a key factor explaining the state's pick for Biden after it went for Trump four years earlier.

""What could occur is that among working class and poor Black voters, lack of interest could lead to fatigue and this may drive those voters not to vote. And in Michigan, you don't need many. You need enough,"" he said.

Democratic state Sen. Sarah Anthony has a different perspective. She had seen an encouraging gain among young people to help shore up Harris' base.

""The Biden coalition included many working-class white men, a group Vice President Harris has struggled to win over. While there may have been losses there, the data I've seen shows significant gains due to increased enthusiasm among young people and people of color,"" she said.

U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East

The Detroit Metropolitan area has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. Dearborn, often called the Capital of Arab America, is home to a majority of Lebanese residents who maintain strong ties to southern Lebanon.

Arab and Muslim voters here were largely supportive of Biden in 2020. However, many have since been alienated by his handling of Israel's deadly war in Gaza and the administration's ongoing military aid to Israel. Many now are similarly concerned about Israel's continuing bombardment of Beirut and ground invasion along the countries' shared border.

Abbas Alawieh, a Dearborn Democratic strategist and one of the co-founders of the ""uncommitted movement,"" backed Biden in 2020. But earlier this year, he and other organizers successfully secured more than 100,000 ""uncommitted"" votes in the Michigan primary to protest Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.

Alawieh, who had advocated for a Gaza ceasefire, told Morning Edition host Leila Fadel that he feels more despair now as the conflict spreads to his family's homeland, Lebanon.

""This is a grieving community. So, for us to give guidance to vote for Kamala Harris, when she is part of the administration that's actively killing their family members, it's like giving a campaign speech at a funeral.""

Professor Dubio said the uncommitted movement has the potential to ""have a huge impact,"" and while he believes many of them will ultimately vote for Harris, he added, ""it can't and shouldn't be ignored.""

Abbas mentioned sending letters to Vice President Harris's team, including her national security advisor, requesting meetings with those directly affected by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. ""So far, the answer is still no.""

He added that Donald Trump visited the community, took photos with leaders, and invited them to his campaign rally.

Saeed Khan, an associate professor of Near Eastern and Asian Studies at Wayne State University, said Muslim and Arab voters were drifting toward Trump in 2016, and some continue to do so today, not only because of a push away from Democrats, but also a pull toward the Republican party's values. Many Arabs and Muslims, immigrant Muslims, voted for the Republican ticket at least until September 11 and then started to move toward the Democratic Party.

""The Republican message of self-reliance, smaller government or less government intrusion, lower taxes, social conservatism really appealed to many, especially immigrant Muslims and Arabs, because it epitomized the American Dream that they had internalized,"" Khan said."

The counting of ballots can take longer in some places than in others.

In presidential elections, that difference can cause a candidate's early advantage in a state to change as more localities report their results in the hours and, sometimes, days after polls close on Election Day.

In 2020, the phenomenon known as the ""red mirage"" or ""blue shift"" turned the hue of several seemingly red states -- where then-Republican President Donald Trump appeared to be in the lead over the then-Democratic candidate Joe Biden -- blue.

Trump and his allies responded by linking that change in states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania to baseless claims of widespread voter fraud involving mail-in ballots.

In fact, however, it stemmed from partisan divides in where voters live and their preferred way of casting ballots, plus, in some states, laws that slow the tallying of votes.

There are two trends that help explain the range of reporting speeds for election results:

An analysis of the 2020 election by the MIT Election Data and Science Lab concluded that the differences in how quickly counties reported their results were ""driven by the fact that smaller and more rural counties, which favored Trump, could report their ballots before the counties with hundreds of precincts and hundreds of thousands of voters.""

It took longer for many of those larger counties to report results because of the big batches of mail-in ballots they received, the analysis found. In some states, allowing absentee ballots that arrive after Election Day to be counted also slowed down counting.

And there's another wonky factor to consider -- whether a state's laws allow election officials to process mail-in ballots before Election Day.

There's an in-the-weeds process in election administration that's called ""pre-canvassing.""

It involves all of the steps needed to prepare mail-in ballots for scanning, including checking voters' signatures on return envelopes, opening those envelopes and flattening the ballots inside.

When this processing is allowed to start varies depending on the state, and the MIT analysis found that states with laws that allow pre-canvassing before Election Day were faster to report results in 2020.

For this year's presidential election, the states that do not allow processing before Election Day include two key swing states: Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

While Arizona allows processing as soon as a completed ballot is received, election officials in that swing state say there are likely to be reporting delays because hundreds of thousands of voters are not expected to drop off their mail ballots until Election Day.

Still, some election watchers say the experience election officials have gained with mail-in ballots since the 2020 election, and some 2020 mail-in voters returning to in-person voting, could help reduce the time needed to finish counting this year.

But especially if the presidential race turns out to be close in any states, extra patience may be needed before voters see the true colors of the 2024 electoral map."
"Medical debt snares millions of people. States, red and blue are passing laws to help",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5135641/medical-debt-solutions-hospitals-republicans-democrats-state-laws,2024-10-07T09:02:28Z,"While hot-button health care issues such as abortion and the Affordable Care Act roil the presidential race, Democrats and Republicans in statehouses around the country have been quietly working together to tackle the nation's medical debt crisis.

New laws to curb aggressive hospital billing, to expand charity care for lower-income patients, and to rein in debt collectors have been enacted in more than 20 states since 2021.

Democrats championed most measures. But the legislative efforts often passed with Republican support. In a few states, GOP lawmakers led the push to expand patient protections.

""Regardless of their party, regardless of their background ... any significant medical procedure can place people into bankruptcy,"" Florida House Speaker Paul Renner, a conservative Republican, said in an interview. ""This is a real issue.""

Renner, who has shepherded controversial measures to curb abortion rights and expand the death penalty in Florida, this year also led an effort to limit when hospitals could send patients to collections. It garnered unanimous support in the Florida Legislature.

Bipartisan measures in other states have gone further, barring unpaid medical bills from consumer credit reports and restricting medical providers from placing liens on patients' homes.

About 100 million people in the U.S. are burdened by some form of health care debt, forcing millions to drain savings, take out second mortgages, or cut back on food and other essentials, KFF Health News has found. A quarter of those with debt owed more than $5,000 in 2022.

""Republicans in the legislature seem more open to protecting people from medical debt than from other kinds of debt,"" said Marceline White, executive director of Economic Action Maryland, which helped lead efforts in that state to stop medical providers from garnishing the wages of low-income patients. That bill drew unanimous support from Democrats and Republicans

""There seems to be broad agreement that you shouldn't lose your home or your life savings because you got ill,"" White said. ""That's just a basic level of fairness.""

Medical debt remains a more polarizing issue in Washington, where the Biden administration has pushed several efforts to tackle the issue, including a proposed rule by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, to bar all medical debt from consumer credit reports.

Vice President Harris, who is spearheading the administration's medical debt campaign, has touted the work on the presidential campaign trail while calling for new efforts to retire health care debt for millions of Americans.

Former President Donald Trump doesn't typically talk about medical debt while stumping. But congressional Republicans have blasted the CFPB proposal, which House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) called ""regulatory overreach.""

Nevertheless, pollster Michael Perry, who has surveyed Americans extensively about health care, said that conservative voters typically wary of government seem to view medical debt through another lens. ""I think they feel it's so stacked against them that they, as patients, don't really have a voice,"" he said. ""The partisan divides we normally see just aren't there.""

When Arizona consumer advocates put a measure on the ballot in 2022 to cap interest rates on medical debt, 72% of voters backed the initiative.

Similarly, nationwide polls have found more than 80% of Republicans and Democrats back limits on medical debt collections and stronger requirements that hospitals provide financial aid to patients.

Perry surfaced something else that may be driving bipartisan interest in medical debt: growing mistrust as health systems get bigger and act more like major corporations. ""Hospitals aren't what they used to be,"" he said. ""That is making it clear that profit and greed are driving lots of the decision-making.""

Not every state effort to address medical debt has garnered broad bipartisan support.

When Colorado last year became the first state to bar medical debt from residents' credit reports, just one Republican lawmaker backed the measure. A Minnesota bill that did the same thing this year passed without a single GOP vote.

But elsewhere, similarly tough measures have sailed through.

A 2024 Illinois bill to bar credit reporting for medical debt passed unanimously in the state Senate and cleared the House of Representatives 109-2. In Rhode Island, not a single GOP lawmaker opposed a credit reporting ban.

And when the California Legislature took up a 2021 bill to require hospitals in the state to provide more financial assistance to patients, it passed 72-0 in the state Assembly and 39-0 in the Senate.

Even some conservative states, such as Oklahoma, have taken steps, albeit more modest. A new law there bars medical providers from pursuing patients for debts if the provider has not publicly posted its prices. The measure, signed by the state's Republican governor, passed unanimously.

New Mexico state Sen. Steve Neville, a Republican who backed legislation to restrict aggressive collections against low-income patients in that state, said he was simply being pragmatic.

""There was not much advantage to spending a lot of time trying to do collections on indigent patients,"" Neville said. ""If they don't have the money, they don't have the money."" Three of 12 GOP senators supported the measure.

North Carolina state Treasurer Dale Folwell, a Republican who as a state legislator spearheaded a 2012 effort to ban same-sex marriage, said all elected officials, no matter their party, should care about what medical debt is doing to patients.

""It doesn't matter if, as a conservative, I'm saying these things, or if Bernie Sanders is saying these things,"" Folwell said, referencing Vermont's liberal U.S. senator. ""At the end of the day, it should be all our jobs to advocate for the invisible."""

With less than a month left until Election Day, both the Harris and Trump campaigns have presented their economic visions to the American people -- including proposed tax cuts, border security spending, and affordable housing policies. But it's still unclear how much these plans will cost, and how they will be paid for.

A new report from the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for Responsible Federal Budget finds that both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris will deepen the national debt to pay for their initiatives. Trump's estimated economic plan would sink the nation $7.5 trillion further into to debt over the next decade, while Harris' estimated proposals would cost the government half that -- around $3.5 trillion.

""Whoever wins the 2024 presidential election will face an unprecedented fiscal situation upon taking office,"" according to the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget's report. ""Both the Republican and Democratic candidates for President have put forward campaign plans that would, at best, maintain the status quo and, at worst, add tremendously to our debt and deficits.""

The report said their estimates come with ""a high degree of uncertainty"" because of lack of specifics from both campaigns; the estimates for Harris' plans range from adding $0 to $8.1 trillion to the debt, while the forecasts for Trump range from $1.5 trillion to $15.2 trillion.

The committee warned of ""an eventual fiscal crisis"" if politicians don't address the national debt more forcefully. The nonprofit also provided an overview of the candidates' competing economic visions -- pulled from campaign websites, emails, speeches, social media posts and discussions with campaign staff.

Both Harris and Trump plan to extend portions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -- a law passed in 2017 that made major changes to the tax code. The law is set to expire in 2025.

Extending the TCJA is the most expensive portion of both campaigns' economic plans, totaling $3 trillion for Harris and $5.4 trillion for Trump, according to the report.

The difference between the two costs comes from Harris' promise that ""no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay more in taxes,"" meaning Americans earning less than that will continue to benefit from the TCJA tax cuts while those making more than that will not.

Meanwhile, Trump has promised to ""make the Trump tax cuts permanent"" for all those who benefited from the law initially. Notably, Trump has promised to end the $10,000 cap on deductions for state and local taxes, known as SALT, which has become a contentious political issue.

Both the Harris and Trump campaigns have promised to eliminate taxes on tips -- despite the shaking heads of economists.

Trump proposed the policy first after a visit to Las Vegas. But the Harris campaign told NPR their plan is distinct as their policy would have caps on salary, meant to prevent high-earners from marking all their salary as tipped wages and taking ""advantage of the policy."" The Harris campaign said it also plans to increase the minimum wage in tandem with not taxing tips.

The Committee for Responsible Federal Budget estimated Harris' no-tax-on tips policy would cost $200 billion over 10 years, while Trump's would cost $300 billion.

The former president has also proposed a blanket tax exemption for overtime pay. The committee listed this as the second-most expensive portion of his economic vision, costing the U.S. government some $2 trillion over 10 years in lost taxes.

Trump's call for an end to taxes on Social Security benefits is the third-most costly part of his plan. Between 50% to 85% of Social Security benefits are taxed, the committee said. Cutting those funds would increase the deficit by $1.3 trillion, it found.

Harris has no plans to cut taxes on overtime pay or on Social Security benefits, according to the report.

The second-most expensive portion of Harris' economic plan is her proposed expansion of the Child Tax Credit, which currently gives most parents a $2,000 per-child tax credit.

As president, Harris ""would make the CTC fully refundable; expand eligibility to 17-year-olds; and increase the size of the CTC to $6,000 for newborns, $3,600 for other children under six, and $3,000 for children six and over,"" the report said.

This expansion of the CTC would cost $1.4 trillion over ten years.

While Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, said he supports a child tax credit increase, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget didn't include it in its analysis.

Both Harris and Trump promise to increase border security.

The Democratic presidential candidate said she would sign the bipartisan border security bill if passed -- which would hire more border patrol agents, asylum officers, immigration judges, and others. The bill failed to pass in a divided Congress earlier this year, and would have cost $100 billion over a decade.

On border security, Trump said he would implement the ""largest deportation program in American history,"" while also finishing the border wall and strengthening the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

The committee estimated Trump's immigration plan would cost $350 billion over 10 years, but it also noted significant uncertainty, given few details on Trump's mass deportation plans.

Both Harris and Trump plan to address the high cost of housing, but their methods differ.

Harris plans to give first-time home buyers a tax credit and would seek to boost housing construction through tax incentives for new homes, while also expanding the low-income housing tax credit.

These plans have a $250 billion price tag, according to the committee.

Meanwhile, Trump plans to lean solely on tax incentives to help homeowners. The campaign hasn't released any details of exactly how.

""While the Trump campaign has not provided specifics on these tax credits, one option would be to revive the $8,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit that was in effect in 2009 and 2010,"" the committee's report said.

With this assumption, the committee forecasted Trump's housing plan would cost $150 billion over the next decade.

Harris' planned expansion of Affordable Care Act subsidies is estimated to cost $550 billion over 10 years. The ACA allows Americans without employer-provided or government-sponsored health insurance to get covered with income-based tax credit subsidies, lowering the overall cost of getting coverage.

Harris plans to make recent increases in these subsidies permanent, according to the deficit analysis.

Meanwhile, Trump promised his administration will have the government or insurers pay for in vitro fertilization treatments and ""we will also allow new parents to deduct major newborn expenses from their taxes,"" Trump said this summer.

The group said it did not receive specifics from the Trump campaign; based on public statements, it estimated this plan would cost $150 billion over a decade.

Both Harris and Trump intend to offset the massive costs of their plans by making the government money elsewhere.

Harris intended to generate revenue through taxes on corporations and high-earners: those making more that $400,000 per year. These actions would bring in $4.3 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The Harris White House would bring in another $250 billion in reduced spending on prescription drugs, it estimated.

Trump, on the other hand, intends to raise revenue with heavy tariffs on foreign imports and with a reduction of policies to protect the environment, which is expected to allow oil companies to drill on protected lands and generate tax revenue. The committee said these plans would generate $3.7 trillion over 10 years.

Neither Harris or Trump's revenue plans would fully cover their projected costs, the group found."
Pro-Trump Christian nationalists are on tour to recruit election workers,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5123626/christian-nationalist-election-workers-lance-wallnau,2024-10-06T13:30:47Z,"Lance Wallnau preaches to attendees at the Courage Tour inside the Monroeville Convention Center on September 28, 2024 in Monroeville, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/for NPR hide caption

""This isn't a political rally,"" said Lance Wallnau from a convention hall stage in Monroeville, outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""It's much different than a revival meeting, it's kind of a new type of thing. It's where the people of God, the citizens of heaven, bring heaven to earth.""

Wallnau, a former oil industry marketer turned charismatic Christian author and media figure, was there recently on the sixth stop of his swing state Courage Tour. The tour's goal is to bolster the courage of attendees' to speak their minds politically and recruit them to serve as local election workers and poll watchers.

Over the course of two days, audience members would pray, sway with their hands in the air to swelling worship music, take in lessons on American history, politics and the Bible, and be visited by vice presidential candidate and U.S. Senator JD Vance. Wallnau, along with his wife Annabelle, are just two of several right-wing Christian leaders hosting these revival-style events at which Trump is seen as God's anointed candidate, according to Matthew Taylor, a senior scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish Studies.

""They understand this as a literal spiritual battle between angels and demons. The angels are trying to enact the will of God, which they believe is to see Donald Trump given a second term,"" said Taylor, who has done extensive research on Christians who were part of the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol to disrupt the certification of the 2020 election for Joe Biden.

On January 6, Wallnau was scheduled to speak at a prayer rally in Washington DC. But before he made it to a microphone, Trump supporters had already broken into the Capitol. So Wallnau went back to his hotel room to stream live on a Christian talk show. Right away, he and his co-hosts made baseless claims that the FBI had bussed in members of antifa to sow violence among the otherwise peaceful crowd.

""They're actually the activists that are working for the Democratic Party that were there in order to create the incident with violence that would smear the president,"" Wallnau said. ""It was the devil's people at this thing.""

""I have been through the social media accounts of many, many of the Christians who were there on January 6th,"" said Taylor, ""and you can find them posting Lance Wallnau videos and Lance Wallnau commentary."" He added that one criminal defendant even cited Wallnau's show as his reason for attending what he believed was a permitted rally.

In his new book, The Violent Take It By Force, Taylor describes Wallnau as ""Trump's most influential spiritual propagandist."" He says when many Christian and evangelical leaders had been reluctant to back the brash, twice-divorced, reality TV billionaire's 2016 presidential run, Wallnau gained a following popularizing biblical rationales for supporting then candidate Trump. God, Wallnau proclaimed, had anointed Trump, imperfect as he was, to lead the country.

Wallnau is well-known in evangelical circles for having popularized a Christian concept called the ""Seven Mountains,"" which calls on the faithful to take dominion over all areas of culture. In person, however, the media-savvy Wallnau can be challenging to pin down ideologically. He's previously identified as a ""Christian Nationalist,"" but told NPR the term is a label ""to create anxiety and misrepresentation."" Wallnau also called Taylor's scholarship ""the fantasy narrative of this one guy obsessed with Christian nationalism.""

""Nobody's a demon, but they can be under the influence of demonic ideas,"" Wallnau said in an interview. ""I regret when it sounds like I'm making people evil because I'm in the business of redemption."" He still questions the 2020 election results and to this day refers to the events of January 6th as ""election fraud intervention.""

On the Courage Tour, Wallnau and his fellow speakers laid out an updated approach for the coming election.

""Are you guys ready to show the world that Christians will be silent no more?"" Joshua Standifer asked from the stage. His nonprofit, Lion of Judah, is helping recruit the folks in the audience to become election workers.

""We all remember 2020 when they bought up the windows, when they closed the doors, when they kicked all the volunteers out. You can be on the inside and be one of the ones making a difference and making sure that nothing nefarious happens,"" said Standifer, invoking debunked, but still popular, narratives of election fraud.

Standifer also wants these poll workers to send anything they see that could be evidence of fraud. He's been calling the effort ""a Trojan horse,"" which alarms some observers. He told NPR he didn't mean the metaphor to extend to the part where the Greeks decimate the city of Troy.

""Do I regret it? I don't know, because it's brought a lot of coverage to us, you know, for better or for worse,"" said Standifer.

Even when everyone is working with the purest of motivations, no election runs perfectly, according to Mollie Cohen, who teaches political science at Perdue University.

""But if you are constantly under scrutiny by folks who are looking to catch you in a mistake, certainly, there are mistakes to be found,"" she said.

The truth, she says, is that most mistakes are caught and addressed very quickly. And since 2020, many election officials have put an even greater focus on transparency.

Mollie also says there's lots of researchshowing that working the polls increases peoples' confidence in elections.

""Something happens when people engage in election administration. It is very boring. It's quite tedious. And you really see everybody in your polling place,"" she said.

That's been true for Dina Macey. She drove in before 5am to wait in her car and make sure she could get in to see JD Vance on the second day of the Courage Tour.

""It's the white Subaru, that's all Trumped out. It's got the Trump flags all over it and the bumper stickers, you know, magnets,"" said Macey.

She's been an election worker before and was a poll watcher in 2020.

""And I did catch a couple people. Like a kid just walked in, didn't sign in or check in, and he was going to enter that. And I was like, 'whoa, you can't do that, you know?' So I bring it to [election workers'] attention,"" said Macey.

Macey is clear she hasn't been pleased with everything about the elections she's worked, but ultimately, the process she saw felt secure. That trust, though, doesn't extend to the rest of her state, or the country.

Traveling shows like Wallnau's Courage Tour are likely to reinforce suspicions like those.

""We don't trust the government on vaccines now. We don't trust them on laptops. We don't trust them on elections. And that's not a good place for a country,"" Wallnau told the audience on day two of the Pennsylvania stop.

This election cycle, the Trump campaign has focused heavily on legal challenges to voting rules. They've also geared up to dispute election results in the courts. That's a big part of why Matthew Taylor is concerned about Wallnau and others like him.

""Part of what happened in 2020 was, there was no evidence of election fraud,"" said Taylor. ""The Courage Tour is one component of this multi-pronged effort to stage the aftermath of this election as a season of contestation, that the results of the election are not the results of the election.""

A contentious election will also help sustain right-wing and religious media circuits Wallnau is part of.

""By the time that the 2020 election happened, there were hundreds of charismatic prophets who were all prophesying that Donald Trump was God's chosen candidate and was destined to win the election,"" said Taylor.

When Trump lost, Taylor says those leaders pivoted to support the false narrative that the election was stolen, through more prophecies about demonic plots and divine motivation to fight back. Taylor believes those narratives posed a serious threat to democracy then, and he says it's not looking much different this year."

Evan Vucci/AP hide caption

The July 13 assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump's life was a recurring theme at a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pa. on Saturday.

Trump returned to speak at the Butler Farm Show grounds in the small Pennsylvania city -- the site where, nearly three months ago, a gunman's bullets grazed the Republican presidential nominee's ear, as well as killed one rally attendee and injured two others.

""Exactly 12 weeks ago this evening on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me and to silence the greatest movement, MAGA, in the history of our country,"" Trump said in one of his many references to his near-death experience. ""But by the hand of providence and the grace of God, that villain did not succeed in his goal, did not come close. He did not stop our movement, he did not break out our spirit. He did not shake our unyielding resolve to save America from evils of poverty, hatred and destruction.""

Speaking from behind transparent screens owing to heightened security, Trump honored Corey Comperatore -- the man who was fatally shot during Trump's rally in July -- with a moment of silence. Bells tolled and tenor Christopher Macchio's sang Franz Schubert's ""Ave Maria,"" a piece often performed at funerals. Trump also expressed thanks to the Secret Service team and medical professionals who came to his aid.

Crowds waited for hours in the Pennsylvania sun to hear Trump speak. Their cries of ""Fight! Fight! Fight!"" punctuated the action on stage.

Other speakers at the event also referenced the July 13 shooting.

Eric Trump appeared to blame his father's political opponents for the assassination attempt: ""They tried to kill him,"" Trump's son said. ""And it's because the Democratic Party, they can't do anything right.""

Elon Musk focused on Trump's bravery: ""The true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire,"" the billionaire entrepreneur said. ""We had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot.""

Beyond the references to the July shooting, Trump's speech focused on many of his usual talking points, including putting an end to illegal immigration, the importance of fossil fuels to the U.S. economy (""We are going to drill, baby, drill!"") and his plan to turn the country into a ""manufacturing superpower again.""

He also twice repeated his plan ""to keep men out of women's sports"" on the grounds of it being ""so demeaning to women."""

Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images hide caption

Former President Donald Trump returns to Butler, Penn., on Saturday for a rally on the site where he was nearly killed in a deadly July 13 shooting.

Speaking to NewsNation's Ali Bradley this week, Trump said he felt he had to return to the Pennsylvania town.

""I'm going back to Butler because I feel I have an obligation to go back to Butler. We never finished what we were supposed to do. And I said that day when I was shot, I said, 'We're coming back. We're gonna come back.'""

The event will be on the grounds of the Butler Farm Show -- the same location where the July assassination attempt took place. All signs point to a Trump rally that will be bigger and longer than even a standard Trump event. What's unclear is how inflammatory of a tone Trump will take in front of a friendly crowd on a site where he narrowly escaped death, or whether he plans a more somber message.

When asked what Trump plans for his speech, campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt gave few details.

""President Trump looks forward to returning to Butler, Pennsylvania to honor the victims from that tragic day,"" she said in a statement. ""The willingness of Pennsylvanians to join President Trump in his return to Butler represents the strength and resiliency of the American people.

On Friday, the Trump campaign team sent out a list of more than 60 special guests for the event. It includes the family of Corey Comperatore, who died in the July 13 shooting, as well as David Dutch, who was injured in the shooting. (The other person injured that day, James Copenhaver, was not listed among the guests.)

The list also includes both typical Trump rally guests -- an array of politicians, local sheriffs and Trump family members -- as well as unusual additions. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk will be in attendance, as well as the Frog-X Parachute Team, which bills itself as a ""veteran-owned, extreme aerial demonstration team.""

All of this sets up the rally to be an all-day affair. Usually, doors have opened for recent Trump rallies three or four hours ahead of time. On Saturday, they will open at 10 a.m. ET -- a full seven hours before Trump is set to speak, at 5 p.m. Three hours have been allotted before Trump's speech for the pre-program.

The looming question is what all those people -- and especially former President Trump -- will have to say about the shooting, not to mention last month's apparent assassination attempt in Florida.

In announcing the rally, the Trump campaign struck a positive tone: ""President Trump will return to the site, joined by tens of thousands of proud citizens, and together, they will celebrate a unifying vision for America's future in an event like the world has never seen before.""

But Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have not matched that tone when speaking about the shooting since then.

When asked by NewsNation's Bradley about his return to Butler, Trump's immediate response was to cast blame on the White House for recent security difficulties.

""I think that the White House isn't treating us very good,"" he said. ""I get crowds that are 10 times bigger than anybody else, 20 times bigger than anybody else. And we're entitled to security. The White House makes it very difficult.""

A Wisconsin Trump rally was recently moved indoors due to a shortage of Secret Service officers, a fact that Trump has complained about in multiple recent appearances.

In the aftermath of the assassination attempt in Butler, the Secret Service has come under intense scrutiny for the security failures that allowed a gunman to fire multiple shots toward Trump in Butler, and then a second alleged gunman who was able to make it within several hundred yards of Trump at his West Palm Beach, Fla., golf course on Sept. 15.

The Secret Service has since increased security for Trump to a presidential level, and late last month Congress voted to boost funding for the agency by $231 million.

Meanwhile, Vance has blamed Trump's political opponents for recent threats to the former president.

Vance at one point blamed an unnamed ""they"" for the Butler assassination attempt.

""They couldn't beat him politically, so they tried to bankrupt him,"" he said at an August rally in Atlanta. ""They failed at that, so they tried to impeach him. They failed at that, so they tried to put him in prison. They even tried to kill him.""

In an August appearance on the Full Send Podcast, Vance also expressed anger -- and suggested a partisan conspiracy -- because of his perception that the assassination attempt hadn't received sustained-enough attention.

""The people, the senior leadership, the people who run the search algorithms, it is effectively a left wing propaganda machine,"" he said of Google, which he alleged was making it harder to search for content about the Butler assassination attempt.

The Butler shooting took place just two days before the Republican National Convention opened in Milwaukee, and it lent the gathering an ecstatic tone, as attendees celebrated Trump's survival. For a brief period, it seemed that the event could reshape the race.

But the shooting proved not to have lasting effects -- especially because just over a week later, President Biden dropped out of the presidential race, eventually handing the torch to Vice President Harris. The race has been essentially deadlocked ever since."
Biden says small business disaster loan program will soon run out of money,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140667/hurricane-helene-loans-biden-kamala-harris-trump,2024-10-05T03:31:20Z,"President Biden crosses himself after Buck Paulk of Shiloh Pecan Farm, in Ray City, Ga., leads a prayer on Oct. 3, 2024. Mandel Ngan/AFP hide caption

President Biden sent a formal letter to Congress late Friday night saying that a key loans program for helping disaster victims will run out of money within weeks at a time when Americans hit by Hurricane Helene need the relief.

The Small Business Administration disaster loans program helps renters and homeowners repair properties and helps businesses cover basic operation expenses. But the agency needs about $1.6 billion to keep running for the year, an administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic information.

Congress is on recess until Nov. 12. But Biden said the program would run out of funds before then.

""I warned the Congress of this potential shortfall even before Hurricane Helene landed on America's shores,"" Biden said in his letter, saying the White House had asked for more funding for the SBA ""multiple times over the past several months"" including during the recent negotiations over a stop-gap funding bill.

""The Congress must act to restore this funding,"" said Biden, who traveled to four states this week to survey damage.

Hurricane Helene ravaged a huge swath of North Carolina and big parts of Georgia, two critical states for the upcoming federal election.

The federal response to the disaster has become an issue in the campaign. The administration is going to great lengths to demonstrate it was both prepared for the storm and has pulled out the stops to help people hurt by it.

Biden said the response has been ""robust and well-coordinated"" and said the Federal Emergency Management Agency has enough resources for now, though it will need more money by the end of the year, when Congress gets back. How much more is still to be determined, he said.

Vice President Harris went to Georgia earlier this week to reassure victims and talk to community leaders, and tomorrow she heads to North Carolina to see the damage there.

Former President Donald Trump has also been to Georgia and North Carolina this week. On Friday night in Fayetteville, N.C., he said: ""This is Katrina,"" alluding to the deadly 2005 hurricane response botched by the government. ""They are doing the worst job on a hurricane that any administration has ever done.""

Trump has repeatedly made false claims about the disaster response, including that FEMA is running out of money because it has spent it on migrants, and that Biden had not been in touch with the Republican governor of Georgia."
"In Michigan, Harris hits back against Trump over his electric car attack lines",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140654/kamala-harris-trump-electric-vehicles-flint,2024-10-05T00:42:24Z,"FLINT, Mich. - Vice President Harris pushed back against a barrage of attacks from her Republican opponent falsely alleging that she intends to ban gas-powered cars.

""Let us be clear, contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive,"" Harris said at a rally on Friday, countering that former President Donald Trump would hurt the auto industry and the union workers that power it in this critical swing state.

Trump and Republicans have long railed against policies and incentives championed by President Biden aimed at boosting electric vehicles, measures he has said would be good for the environment and for advanced manufacturing jobs.

Trump regularly slams Harris at his rallies over the issue. Lately, his campaign has spent more than $1 million airing a television ad in Michigan that tells autoworkers that ""Kamala Harris wants to end all gas-powered cars"" and that ""massive layoffs already started.""

Harris - who was introduced by the president of the United Auto Workers, a union that has endorsed her - said six auto plants closed when Trump was in office and accused him of making ""empty promises"" about supporting the sector.

""We will not be gaslighted,"" she said.

""We will ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs, from advanced batteries to electric vehicles are not only invented, but built right here in America by American union workers,"" Harris said.

She pointed to a Detroit News report that Trump's running mate JD Vance was noncommittal about a grant to a GM plant in Lansing, Michigan. The Biden administration gave the company $500 million to convert the plant to make electric vehicles. ""He might let the Grand River assembly plant in Lansing close down,"" she said."

Elkhorn, Wisconsin is a small town less than an hour outside of Milwaukee that feels like a world away from the big city.

The main street looks like it's been unchanged for decades. There's a barber shop, a saloon and a restaurant that advertises homemade pizza. And while this is a Republican stronghold, Democrats are trying to make some inroads here.

""Our goal in this office is to move the needle,"" says Ellen Holly, the former chair of the Walworth County Democrats.

""Maybe we will this year. Maybe we'll wake up and suddenly Walworth County will be a blue county. I'm not going to bet my child's life on it. But we're heading in that direction,"" Holly told NPR.

She's used to being in the blue minority. But today, she's surrounded by volunteers who agree with her, stuffing pamphlets into plastic baggies that canvassers will take door knocking around the neighborhood.

In a state where every vote matters, campaigns are not only trying to win in counties where they're strongest. They're also trying to lose by less in places where votes for their candidate are harder to find.

Holly says that the Wisconsin Democrats have a specific goal in mind with their efforts: win at least 42% of the vote.

It might be counterintuitive to celebrate a loss, but for Holly, it's a positive measure of progress.

""Everything we do here helps,"" she said. ""Biden won, I think, by 21,000 votes in the state. That's what we contributed. Now, I can't say that it was just because of us, but if we did nothing, he would not have won.""

In many ways, ""lose by less"" has become the key term in this campaign.

""Because Wisconsin elections are so competitive and so closely decided, the parties understand that any little gain anywhere could make the difference,"" said Anthony Chergosky, who teaches political science at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse.

So what does the strategy look like in practice? For one, door knocking.

Barb Biggler and Margie Black are Democratic party volunteers who live in Walworth County, walking through a neighborhood where Trump signs fill the lawns. But when asked if they think of it as ""enemy territory,"" Biggler says no.

""I kinda don't like to think about the war and the battle and that rough language,"" she said. ""It kinda scares me so I don't really want to be frightened by our own country.""

These canvassers told NPR they sometimes meet ""quiet Harris voters."" They're people who promise to support the Democrats, but don't want to put a sign on their lawn.

That's the mirror image of how Denise Salamone feels. She's a Trump voter in a wealthy Democratic area on the edge of Milwaukee.

She says that in 2016, her neighborhood was filled with signs supporting Bernie Sanders.

She volunteers with the Milwaukee Republicans, who are trying to turn the solidly blue area a little more red. Ultimately, both groups with a similar goal in mind: make their losses less stark.

Rob Mulcahy serves on the executive board of the Milwaukee Republicans. Like the Democrats canvassing in Walworth County, he refuses to think of this blue zone as hostile.

""It is not enemy territory for me. I have lived there my entire life. I do have the courage to put yard signs up in the last election. I put up every Republican candidate and I intend to do so again this year,"" he told NPR.

For Mulcahy, starting conversations with neighbors about voting can begin with the community they are a part of.

""I've coached a lot of sports in the North Shore. So if it's a parent whose kid I've coached, it's a great icebreaker to talk about the sports. I don't know anybody [who] could possibly want boys playing women's sports. It's just to me, it's a no brainer.""

He's referring to a law Wisconsin's Democratic governor vetoed this year that would have banned transgender high school athletes from competing on teams that align with their gender identity.

But Hilario Deleon, the chairman of the group, says other GOP volunteers lead with different topics when they knock on doors.

""We talk about economics, we talk about crime,"" he said. ""We talk about, y'know, actual issues that people care about. Are you better off now than you were four years ago?""

While the Walworth County Democrats have a goal of hitting 42% of votes for Harris in their county, the Republicans have their own number here in the big city.

""If we get more than 35%, even 38%, that is a win,"" said Deleon. ""Because the rest of the state will help carry us over the finish line."""

President Biden told reporters Friday he is confident the election will be free and fair, but he said he was concerned about the potential for violence if former President Donald Trump again refuses to accept the will of the voters.

""I'm confident it will be free and fair. I don't know whether it'll be peaceful,"" Biden said during a surprise appearance at the White House daily briefing. ""The things that Trump has said and the things that he said last time out, when he didn't like the outcome of the election, were very dangerous.""

Biden noted that during this week's vice presidential debate, Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, would not say whether Trump would accept the outcome of the election. When asked if he and Trump would challenge the election results -- even if every governor in the nation certified them -- Vance demurred, saying he and Trump were ""focused on the future.""

""I don't know anything about what [Biden] said,"" Trump told reporters in Georgia on Friday following the president's remarks. ""I only can hope that it's going to be free and fair, and I think in this state it will be, and I hope in every state it will be, and I think we're going to do very well.""

Trump often links himself winning with fairness.

Speaking to reporters earlier this week, Trump said, ""All I want is a fair election. That's all. Just a fair, honest election. I hope we're going to get that.""

But when pressed on whether he trusts the process this year, he responded, ""I'll let you know in 33 days."" Two days later, in Michigan, Trump again lied about the results of the 2020 election.

""We won. We won. We did win,"" Trump said. ""It was a rigged election. It was a rigged election. You have to tell Kamala Harris. That's why I'm doing it again. If I'd thought I lost, I wouldn't be doing this again.""

Trump's remarks came during a week in which a newly unsealed court filing by special counsel Jack Smith offered perhaps the most detailed picture to date about the former president's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

The 165-page document, released Wednesday by the U.S. District judge presiding over the case, says that after Trump lost in 2020, he ""resorted to crimes to try to stay in office,"" and ""launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn election results in seven states he had lost."""

"In swing-state Wisconsin, new districts threaten the GOP hold on the Legislature",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5108996/wisconsin-election-voting-legislature,2024-10-04T16:50:56Z,"GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Smoke from portable grills filled the air with the smell of bratwurst on a recent Sunday in the parking lots that surround Lambeau Field.

People were gathered to watch the Green Bay Packers take on the rival Minnesota Vikings, but in a state and city where football is a staple of the culture, they were also there for the pregame tailgate and the experience of one of Wisconsin's premier gathering places.

In one of the crowded lots, the Packers Tailgate Band meandered its way through lawn chairs and folding tables full of food. Brass and woodwind instruments carried the tune while a makeshift drum set mounted to a stroller kept the time. When the band played ""Roll Out The Barrel,"" a Wisconsin polka staple, people got up from their seats and danced.

""It's probably like the best job I have,"" said Tim Kozlovski, the band's sousaphone player. ""It's just having fun with people and partying with them and getting them in the spirit for the game.""

Kozlovski said the Packers unify people in Wisconsin -- he calls it a ""good place in your heart."" And in an atmosphere like that, he said there are some things you just don't talk about, like politics.

""You gotta learn to keep that to yourself when you're trying to make people happy,"" he said.

Not everyone has that luxury in Green Bay, where for the first time in years, Lambeau Field and the surrounding community are part of a fierce campaign that could decide control of the Wisconsin Legislature. A couple of parking lots over, local Democrats are tailgating, hoping to unlock the political power they were granted when the state redrew its political maps and turned this once-safe GOP district competitive.

""I actually enjoy talking about politics,"" said Ryan Spaude, the Democratic candidate running to represent this area at the state Capitol in Madison. He's a local prosecutor. ""I enjoy having a respectful dialogue with other folks about politics. I also think we can do better than some of the yahoos that are down there in Madison right now.""

Spaude is well aware of the divided nature of his district. President Joe Biden would have won this district in 2020 -- former President Donald Trump would have carried it in 2016. He jokes that this district is as purple as some of the Minnesota Vikings jerseys in the crowd that day.

""Ninety-nine seats in the state Assembly,"" Spaude said. ""There's about a dozen that are like mine that could go either way. These seats will determine who gets the majority.""

When it comes to races for statewide office, Wisconsin has a well-earned reputation as a swing state. Four of the last six presidential contests have been decided by less than a percentage point.

But in races for the Legislature, it's been anything but competitive ever since 2011, when Republicans took control of state government and redrew the state's legislative district lines, cementing their power for years to come.

""There would be a couple competitive seats in the state Assembly every year, but the outcome of them was basically inconsequential,"" said John Johnson, a redistricting expert at Marquette University Law School. ""There was no chance that majority control of the chamber would change.""

The GOP used its majorities to shift Wisconsin's politics to the right. When Republican Scott Walker was in the governor's office, they famously passed laws that weakened unions in a state with deep ties to organized labor.

Even after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers took office, their legislative majorities effectively gave Republicans veto power. As neighboring states expanded Medicaid or legalized marijuana, the GOP was able to block Evers' plans that would have had Wisconsin join them.

This election, in this 50-50 district, the debate is different. Spaude said the number one issue he hears from voters is about the cost -of -living.

""The second issue is -- why can't you people work together? Just the gridlock you see,"" Spaude said.

Nearby, Patrick Buckley, Spaude's Republican opponent is also making the rounds. He's a small business owner and former police officer who currently chairs the board of Brown County, home to Green Bay.

""We get a lot of stuff done at the county,"" Buckley said. ""I'd like to take what I've learned there at the county to the state level. Because I think we need that there.""

Buckley said the new map created an opening for him because this new district had no incumbent. But he insists he hasn't really thought about how his race could tip the balance in the Legislature. When asked about the top three things he talks about with voters, Buckley has a clear answer.

""Economy, economy, economy,"" Buckley said. ""A lot of people are hurting out there, and we gotta figure out what we can do as government to give them some sort of relief.""

The idea that Wisconsin could be in this position seemed, just a few years ago, almost impossible. Even with Evers in the governor's office, the Legislature redrew Wisconsin's maps to make them even more powerful with the help of a then-conservative majority on Wisconsin's Supreme Court.

But everything changed in 2023 when voters flipped control of the court from conservative to liberal, and the new majority ordered new maps drawn

In an unexpected twist, the Republican-controlled Legislature chose maps that were drawn by Evers, making the political calculation that it was their least-worst option. In a brief speech before their vote, Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said the new maps would be ""very competitive,"" and the Legislature would be ""up for grabs.""

""We will have the ability to decide if we want to go toward the direction of Minnesota and Michigan,"" Vos said, referencing two states where Democrats control both the state Legislature and the governor's office.""Or [if] we want to stay in the direction that we're heading in Wisconsin, where we have the ability to have a lower tax burden, a lower regulatory touch, and still a historically good economy for Wisconsin. So I'm optimistic.""

This will be the first test of how that debate plays out in Wisconsin. As with many political issues, the answer could be complicated.

A few blocks away from Lambeau Field, Bud Hearley was watching the game with family and friends from the comfort of a one-car garage turned into a bar. Hearley, who lives in a nearby district, said there are too many extremes in politics, and he'd like to see more compromise.

""I'm looking for a little more give and take on both sides with the issues that they make so extreme,"" Hearley said. ""There's not enough middle.""

Hearly doesn't fit neatly into one box when it comes to the issues. He favors the legalization of marijuana and thinks women should have the right to abortion, with some limits. He's also a strong supporter of capitalism who is leery of government overreach. And he tends to vote for Republicans.

Back at the tailgating event, Democratic voter Denise Gaumer Hutchison concedes that Democrats may or may not win it all this year, but for the first time in years, she said they'll at least be able to force Republicans to have a dialog. That was never possible, she said, under the state's old maps.

""Those maps were not fair to the point that legislators wouldn't even try,"" Gaumer Hutchison said. ""They wouldn't even do doors. They wouldn't even come talk to people who might be of a different opinion because they didn't have to. Now they have to.""

It's not just Lambeau Field's Assembly seat that's up for grabs this year. The district next door is so close it would have been won by both Evers, a Democrat, and Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson two years ago. The surrounding Senate district could also flip and give Democrats a chance at winning that chamber in 2026.

Regardless of the outcome, there's already been a political sea change in Wisconsin, a state where the race for president is seemingly always up for grabs, and now the state Legislature is, too."

Mark Schiefelbein/AP hide caption

Vice President Harris plans to meet briefly on Friday with a group of Arab Americans in Flint, Mich., before she rallies supporters there.

The meeting comes as her campaign works to build support with Arab Americans who have been frustrated with the Biden administration's response to the ongoing war in Gaza and the expanding conflict into Lebanon.

The key swing state of Michigan has one of the largest Arab American populations in the country.

A poll published this week by the Arab American Institute found Harris and her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, at roughly even levels of support among Arab Americans. In recent years, the group had favored Democrats by large margins.

""In our 30 years of polling Arab American voters, we have not witnessed anything like the role that the war on Gaza is having on voter behavior,"" said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, in a statement.

Yesterday, the Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz spoke to a Muslim group focused on getting out the vote activities. And earlier this week, Harris' national security adviser Phil Gordon met virtually with Muslim and Arab community leaders to reiterate that the Biden administration is working to bring about a cease-fire."

""You have to work, work, work,"" she said with a smile. ""It's not easy.""

Conteh is an immigrant from Sierra Leone who lives just outside Philadelphia. She has been a U.S. citizen for two years, but this fall marks the first time she can vote in an election, and she plans to cast her ballot for Vice President Harris.

""She will... treat immigrants the same. Talk about wages, talking about mortgage,"" Conteh said, explaining she is worried about rising prices. ""We are on the same page,"" she added.

Conteh is one of more than half a million naturalized citizens living in Pennsylvania. And she is part of a growing portion of the U.S. electorate, making up about one in ten eligible voters nationwide as of 2022.

It's a voting bloc that could be crucial in the presidential race, especially in key battleground states like Pennsylvania, where President Biden won last time by a margin of about 1%, or 80,000 votes.

Those stakes were ever-present to a small group of immigrant advocates and new citizens, including Conteh, who recently gathered at a community center in the Philadelphia commuter town of Lansdale, Pa.

""We know that Pennsylvania will be one of the most critical states during this election, and new American voters have the power to sway the outcome,"" Laila Martín García said to the group. Martín García is an organizer with the nonpartisan group National Partnership of New Americans or NPNA.

""We have the numbers,"" she added. ""Are we ready to translate those numbers into impact?""

It's unclear how many new citizens are already registered to vote, however, roughly eight in 10 naturalized Pennsylvanians say they're definitely planning on casting a ballot, according to NPNA's latest state-wide polling from Aug.

Similar levels of enthusiasm were reflected in NPNA's surveys from other crucial swing states, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada.

But deadlines are creeping up. Pennsylvania has until Oct. 21 to register to vote. So after the event ended, Huascar Aragonés didn't wait a second longer.

Aragones first came to the U.S. 16 years ago from the Dominican Republic. He works for his union, the Service Employees International Union, SEIU, and as he filled out his registration form, a few of his colleagues excitedly watched close by.

When it was complete, the room erupted in applause.

""When I became a citizen, I did it out of the fear I have about politics,"" Aragonés said in Spanish. ""Especially the politics of former President Donald Trump -- I was afraid that he would separate me from my family because I am an immigrant worker.""

The topic of immigration has remained a big issue throughout the campaign. Trump has made it central to his reelection bid, vowing to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.

For Aragonés, Harris is the best candidate right now.

""What I feel is something really beautiful,"" he said. ""When you are a citizen of the United States, you feel like you are a part of this country. And that you can vote for the candidate that you would like, for the changes you want to see.""

But other new voters aren't as excited about the matchup.

NPNA's Laila Martín García, an immigrant from Spain also recently naturalized, is gearing up for her first presidential election as a citizen.

""The joy that voting brings to me, I wish I had the same joy because a candidate is giving me reasons to vote for them,"" she said. ""I feel like I'm going to head to the polls on Nov. 5 to vote against somebody more than voting for somebody.""

Speaking outside her role with NPNA, she's backing Harris. However, there's a caveat: Martín García disagrees with how Harris has approached immigration issues, particularly the vice president's support for the bipartisan bill in Congress that -- if passed -- would have expanded restrictions and given money for a border wall. The legislation failed but Harris has vowed to sign it if it were to pass while she was in office.

That being the case, to Martín García, it's a vote for Harris, but a reluctant one. A feeling she shares with many other new voters around the country.

""To be honest, [as] a first-time voter, that breaks my heart,"" she said. ""It's just not how you want to vote for the first time or really ever."""
The October surprise: Harris is navigating a pair of them,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5137967/kamala-harris-hurricane-israel-iran-october-surprise,2024-10-04T09:09:19Z,"Vice President Harris hands out food to people at the Henry Brigham Community Center in Augusta, Ga., on Oct. 2, during a tour of hurricane damage in the area. Brendan Smialowski/AFP hide caption

With only a month left until Election Day, Vice President Harris is navigating a pair of external challenges in the month of October that pose risk to her campaign.

At home, there's the recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Helene -- including in the vital swing states of North Carolina and Georgia. And abroad, there's the real risk of escalating conflict in the Middle East.

The twin crises present a unique challenge for the Biden administration and, by extension, Harris -- who is a key part of that team. So her campaign and the White House are pulling out the stops to try to show voters they're on top of things, even as Harris pushes ahead on the campaign trail.

For Harris, there's the fear that these ""October surprises"" go sideways and she gets some blame. In a race this close, every vote matters.

But these kinds of high-profile crises also present an opportunity to demonstrate leadership, said Democratic political strategist Ian Russell.

""What she has to do, and what she is doing, is showing up and showing that she's engaged, showing that she's capable of stepping up to the challenges that the country and the world face and I think she's doing that very well,"" Russell said.

Harris took a break from the campaign on Wednesday to visit a Georgia neighborhood ravaged by Hurricane Helene where more than half of residents don't have power and many don't have running water.

""The president and I have been paying close attention from the beginning to what we need to do to make sure the federal resources hit the ground as quickly as possible,"" Harris said. ""That includes what was necessary to make sure that we provided direct federal assistance. And that work has been happening.""

President Biden also surveyed Asheville, N.C., where some of the most severe storm damage occurred, as he and Harris try to reassure voters in the critical state that their administration is up to the task. Harris' campaign has said she plans to tour storm damage in North Carolina soon, too.

Her opponent, former President Donald Trump, is slated to be it the state on Friday for a town hall.

The International Longshoremen's Association decision to go on strike on Tuesday had been another challenge for Harris, threatening to upend the economy heading into the election.

But on Thursday, the union dockworkers and port operators reached a tentative agreement on wages and agreed to extend their contract to Jan. 15. Harris and Biden had sided firmly with the union, and on Thursday Biden said both sides had acted ""patriotically"" to reopen the ports to ensure supplies were available for hurricane rebuilding efforts.

The Trump campaign is on the lookout for anything they can use against Harris in the closely contested race -- including the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

On Tuesday, Trump told his supporters that he was the person to take on Iran after it attacked Israel. ""We have a nonexistent president and a nonexistent vice president, who should be in charge, but nobody knows what's going on,"" Trump said.

Harris made sure to get out in front of cameras this week to reaffirm her support for Israel. ""As I have said, I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist militias,"" she said.

""And let us be clear: Iran is not only a threat to Israel; Iran is also a threat to American personnel in the region, American interests, and innocent civilians across the region who suffer at the hands of Iran-based and -backed terrorist proxies.""

How the White House, Harris and her campaign are able to navigate these ""October surprises"" is critical in a race this close, with only a month left.

""There's always going to be something that could go wrong at home or abroad,"" Russell said. ""And our leaders need to be able to step up and deliver while also being politicians."""
We visited a Sikh temple that sits at the intersection of multiple election issues,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5136995/wisconsin-election-harris-trump-sikh-temple-oak-creek,2024-10-04T09:08:47Z,"The Sikh Temple of Wisconsin was the scene of a deadly mass shooting in 2012. Angela Major/Wisconsin Public Radio/NPR hide caption

It's Sunday morning at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, in the Milwaukee suburb of Oak Creek, and hundreds of worshippers are showing up for prayers.

They walk into the main hall where people are praying, passing by a bullet hole in the door frame. It's a reminder of what happened here on another Sunday morning 12 years ago, when a gunman who was affiliated with white supremacist groups came and opened fire on the people who were praying.

""We were on our way to go to the gurdwara when one of our family members called and said, 'Don't go there, there had been a shooting,'"" recalls Kulwant Dhaliwal, the chairman of the board here at the gurdwara, or Sikh temple.

Dhaliwal immigrated to the United States from India in 1968 and worked as a doctor in Wisconsin for decades until he retired.

""I couldn't believe it. Hard to believe somebody will come and shoot people at the place of worship,"" he said. ""We don't bother anybody. We haven't done anything wrong.""

Six people were killed that day and four others were wounded, one of whom died of his injuries years later.

All Things Considered recently spent a week reporting from Wisconsin as part of an NPR series focusing on swing states ahead of the election. And this gurdwara sits at the intersection of several election-season topics.

Immigration is one. Most of the people at this temple are immigrants.

Identity is another. Sikhism originated in India, and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is half Indian.

This community also experienced the deadly white supremacist attack, years before mass shootings at a Black church in Charleston, a synagogue in Pittsburgh and many other places. Gun violence and extremism have also come up for both Harris and former President Donald Trump this year.

On the morning the shooter arrived at the gurdwara in 2012, women were in the kitchen stirring big pots of curry and lentils.

Sundays are when the temple opens its doors to feed anyone who's hungry, to give back to the community at a free meal called langar. It's the same scene now, more than a decade later.

Prabhjot Singh is our escort and host and says that anywhere from 700 to 800 people come on a Sunday for the meal, which is prepared from scratch each week at the gurdwara.

By day, Singh is a banker raising two young kids with his wife. He's also secretary here at the gurdwara.

This temple is a sacred place, where they discourage public talk of politics. So while worshippers sit on the floor praying in the main hall, Singh leads us into the basement, where kids in Sunday school are learning Punjabi.

Singh came to the U.S. to get his MBA when he was 23. One big reason he stayed in Wisconsin was this temple. So when a shooter arrived, it felt unbelievable to him.

""We knew shootings were normal in the U.S. but ... but we never thought someone could target a religious place,"" he said. ""That was one thing which took a long time to forget about and feel safe again to come back.""

The U.S. is now in the final weeks of an intense election season, and it's not lost on Singh that immigration has become a focus of much of the conversation. Yet while he estimates that about 80% of the members of his congregation are immigrants, he doesn't believe it's the most important issue to many of them.

""They're already here, you know. They are part of this country now,"" he said. ""Now they are trying to achieve the American dream, which is getting the best education for their children, getting food on the table every day, making sure everyone is healthy and safe.""

Singh adds that while some people in his community showed excitement at having a candidate of South Asian descent at the top of the Democratic ticket, for many others, Harris' ethnicity doesn't matter more than any other candidate's ethnicity. And he can recall speaking to business owners at the temple after Trump won in 2016 and discovering they voted for him.

Still, for Singh, the rhetoric matters. And he said it's the reason he won't be voting for Trump.

""The words he uses are very aggressive, harassing words for others,"" Singh said. ""Whether it's for immigrants -- I think lately he gave a speech about eating cats and dogs by migrants ... maybe if that happened one incident, it doesn't mean all of the 25 million immigrants are eating cats and dogs.""

The rumor has been debunked, but Singh believes the narrative was still damaging for immigrants everywhere.

And this is a community that knows how easily fear of immigrants can turn into violence against immigrants. But they refuse to barricade themselves and hide.

The day before we met Singh, he joined other Sikhs at a city-wide cultural event with the mayor of Oak Creek. They taught people how to tie the turbans that so many Sikh people wear as a sign of their faith.

Singh said one of the most important principles of his religion is sharing what you have with others.

So on this Sunday, just past the security cameras and the hired guard at the door, anyone is invited to sit and eat for free as volunteers circle with seemingly endless ladles of curry, rice, lentils and more."
Wisconsin's vote is vital to the presidency. What are residents there looking for? : Consider This from NPR,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/1203261215/wisconsin-election-north-avenue-milwaukee,2024-10-03T21:46:17Z,"Jim Neumeyer is the owner of Beans & Barley, a staple cafe and shop in a Milwaukee neighborhood, talks to customers at his shop. Beans & Barley is a progressive space in the community.

On a recent fall morning, Consider This host Ari Shapiro started his day on the edge of Lake Michigan in the city of Milwaukee before the sun had risen.

His agenda for the day included traveling the 15 mile stretch of North Avenue with reporter Maayan Silver of WUWM, the local member station in Milwaukee.

North Avenue runs through a large swathe of Milwaukee. It covers different demographics and neighborhoods, urban, suburban, rich, poor, segregated and integrated. Shapiro and Silver made the trek to get a better understanding of what voters in Wisconsin are looking for and feeling ahead of the election in November.

In a state of 6 million people, where the presidential vote can be decided by a margin of twenty thousand votes, It's not just one demographic group or bloc that can make the difference in 2024.

It's all of them.

As the two begin strolling, Silver shares a saying she's heard often in Wisconsin ""As goes North Avenue, so goes Wisconsin.""

On this rainy, murky fall morning, a dedicated group of runners agree to chat with our hosts about the upcoming election, though politics are typically a subject that they don't tend to discuss with each other.

One of the organizers of The OMG running group is 64-year-old Patrick Beiser.

""I would say our particular group here, the Milwaukee running group, has a more liberal leaning, so we agree with each other mostly, so there's not a lot to discuss.""

Hans Goldenberg, a 34-year-old who lives in ddowntown Milwaukee runs up to join the group. His political views are different from the rest of them.

""I don't know. I may or may not vote,"" he told Shapiro. ""I don't like either candidate to be completely honest.""

Goldenberg wants lower taxes and less crime, and thinks Republicans would do a better job addressing that. But he's also more socially liberal.

""I've gone both ways in the past. I voted for Obama. You know, I feel like sometimes my vote doesn't matter.""

32-year-old Jackie Breen jumps in.

""I understand that, because I have felt for many many elections, for a very long time, like who am I voting for? I don't want either.""

She says her top issue is the environment, and she's a committed Harris voter.

But she gets why Goldenberg is frustrated.

""Where's my third option, where's my fourth option, where's someone who is actually closer to my age, who understands that my generation is going to have debt for the rest of their lives?""

Further down North Avenue, Beans and Barley first opened its doors 50 years ago.

Two-story windows let daylight stream into the building. It's a gift shop, deli counter, and restaurant. There is a sign on the glass that says ""Black Lives Matter."" On the reverse, it says ""Racism is an insidious cultural disease.""

Milwaukee is only 40% white, and it's also one of the most segregated cities in the U.S. Jim Neumeyer started as a teenage dishwasher here. Now he's one of the owners.

As a small business owner, one of the biggest challenges Neumeyer faces right now is the price of ingredients. Some of his costs have gone up 20%.

""We're not like a super duper fancy restaurant. We're like an everyday restaurant. And in order to be a place that people in the community for instance can gather daily, we have to keep it really reasonable,"" he told Shapiro.

So what does that mean for Neumeyer politically?

""I think what it means is we have to have someone who's very interested in obviously the smaller business, not necessarily tax breaks for only the largest of businesses. We also need to see some relief from the prices and hopefully see some of them be able to come down.""

Who does he think is capable of handling that job?

Not Trump, says Neumeyer."
"Driven by Republicans, most Americans are concerned about fraud in the 2024 election",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5130284/election-concerns-voter-fraud-trump-harris-poll,2024-10-03T20:01:24Z,"Former President Donald Trump stands on stage after speaking at a campaign event in Indiana, Pa., on Sept. 23. Behind Trump, Republicans are urged to vote in numbers that are ""too big to rig."" Alex Brandon/AP hide caption

A majority of Americans worry this year's general election will be tainted by fraud, according to a new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll out Thursday -- an ominous finding for the thousands of local election officials across the country tasked with administering voting.

Almost 6-in-10 Americans say they're concerned or very concerned that there will be voter fraud this election, a number that experts say is driven in large part by Donald Trump's continued false insistence that elections can't be trusted. Eighty-eight percent of voters who say they support the former president say they are concerned there will be fraud, compared with 29% of those who support the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris.

In the four years since the 2020 election, there has never been any evidence of widespread voter fraud in that contest, and numerous audits, studies and investigations (including those led by Republicans) have confirmed the results many times over.

Still, as voting has begun in many parts of the country, election officials are struggling to persuade voters listening to political figures who insist the results will be tainted.

Local election officials say they've spent countless hours trying to educate voters on the checks and balances that make fraud unlikely and rare, but it's unclear those efforts have made much of a dent. And they worry the stage is set for Trump again to try to overturn the results, or for his followers to commit violence, if they feel the election was stolen from him.

""This conversation is so much deeper than even the mechanics of election administration,"" said Stephen Richer, the Republican county recorder in Maricopa County, Ariz. ""It's more about, how do you convince someone of the truth?""

Richer, who lost a reelection bid earlier this year to a GOP challenger, has continuously pushed back against baseless fraud claims since he took office after Trump's loss in 2020. And he's talked openly about the threats he's received, including from a number of men who have been charged for threatening to kill him.

In an interview with NPR last month, Richer said the specific voting conspiracy theory that has ""spiked"" in recent months is about non-U.S. citizens illegally voting and influencing results.

The new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll confirmed that trend, with 52% of respondents saying they were concerned noncitizens would vote for president in this year's election, even though that is illegal, and there has never been evidence to support the idea that noncitizens register and vote in anything but microscopic numbers.

NPR reported in the spring that far-right figures -- including Trump, X owner Elon Musk and conservative attorney Cleta Mitchell -- were beginning to center their voting messaging around noncitizens ahead of the presidential election. The new survey found that 85% of Trump supporters said they were concerned about noncitizen voting.

Ninety percent of Trump supporters also think all immigrants who came into the country illegally should be deported.

The mass deportation idea, a draconian step favored by Trump, is now mainstream, with 59% of voters agreeing with the idea.

Marist interviewed 1,628 adults for the survey, which was conducted Friday through Tuesday. The overall poll sample has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points, with larger margins of error for subgroups.

It's long been a truism in elections that voters have much less trust in elections in other places, but have more faith in the voting system where they live. The new poll results bear that out as well.

Close to 80% of voters surveyed said they were confident that their state or local government would run a fair and accurate election this November.

Tina Barton, a Republican former election official from Rochester Hills, Mich., told NPR that the most effective way to build confidence in elections is to keep reminding people that voting is a local activity and election officials are human beings in their community as well.

""These are people who live and work in your neighborhood, go to the same church you do, your kids play soccer together,"" Barton said. ""This is still a neighborhood transaction.""

The poll also provided more insight into how people plan to cast ballots this year, with the long-term trend of more and more early voting seeming poised to continue.

Roughly half of registered voters said they planned to vote early, either in-person at a polling place or by mail, and half said they planned to vote in-person on Election Day.

Some partisan differences in those methods still exist, after Trump's efforts in 2020 to demonize absentee voting during the pandemic. About 71% of likely voters who say they plan to vote by mail support Harris, while 58% of planned Election Day voters say they back Trump.

The presidential race continues to be a toss-up.

Among likely voters -- which Marist describes as voters who say they are definitely voting this year -- Harris holds a slim lead over Trump, 50% to 48%. That lines up with the previous NPR/PBS News/Marist survey, in September, and national polling averages.

Trump holds a narrow, 4-point edge with independents, and the survey points to a vast gender gap: Trump leads Harris by 16 percentage points with men, while Harris outpaces Trump with women by 18 points."
Politically-charged rumors and conspiracy theories about Helene flourish on X,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5134866/rumors-conspiracy-theories-helene-social-media,2024-10-03T13:47:35Z,"Marine One, carrying President Joe Biden, flies above a storm impacted area near Asheville, North Carolina on October 2, 2024. Biden was visiting North and South Carolina to survey the damage after the passage of Hurricane Helene. Social media sites, especially X, were filled with politically-charged rumors and conspiracy theories about the hurricane response. MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images/AFP hide caption

Avery Dull left her apartment in Hendersonville, North Carolina with her baby daughter a day after she made a TikTok showing brown floodwater from Hurricane Helene swelling beneath her second-floor balcony. Staying with friends two hours away and her life in limbo, Dull has been spending a lot of time online.

""Usually I'm in bed by 10 p.m. I haven't gone to bed till 3 a.m. since this happened,"" she told NPR. ""I mean, I've been up all day and night just trying to find any, any information I can whatsoever. It has been consuming me.""

Having evacuated, Dull is turning to videos on TikTok to keep her up to date on her community.

""This is my hometown. And to see these places just water up to the roof, I can't even comprehend it...I walked those streets and they're just, I mean, sunk.""

She constantly watches for death toll updates. ""I want to know if any of my family members who I haven't heard from are alive and well...And every time I update, it goes up, like, five people.""

People like Dull, as well as those still in their storm-damaged communities, are hungry for reliable information. When they turn to social media, they're finding mixed results. Some platforms don't have much news at all. Other platforms have enabled them to form groups that provide information and companionship.

And then there is X, formerly known as Twitter, where politically charged rumors flow freely. Emergency management researchers lament that the platform owned by Elon Musk, which was once considered a useful source of information in a disaster, is instead contributing to the chaos in Helene's wake.

The storm hit two swing states just a month before a close election, making criticisms about the response a tempting political line of attack.

On X, the top results for ""Helene"" have millions of views but are not always reliable.

""'$2.4 billion aid to Ukraine' vs 'No more aid for Hurricane Helene' - 3 days apart"" pro-Trump account End Wokeness wrote alongside video clips of President Joe Biden speaking on two occasions. The post received over 5 million views.

The text misrepresents one of the Biden videos. In it, Biden responds ""no"" when asked if more federal resources will be directed to disaster relief and says that local governments have yet to ask for what has already been allocated. The video also shows Biden saying the federal government had already pre-planned hurricane relief even before states had asked for disaster aid.

Former president Donald Trump claimed without evidence that Democrats were withholding aid from Republican areas. Trump also falsely claimed that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp had not been able to speak to Biden, even though both confirmed they had spoken to one another.

There's no evidence the federal government is withholding aid from affected states. The Republican governors of South Carolina and Georgia have praised the federal government's support.

Other videos on X made wilder claims.

""Don't worry guys, weather modification isn't real! It's just a coincidence that Hurricane Helene is one of the most devastating 'inland damage storms' in history and that hundreds of pro-Trump counties are being massively impacted during the most important election of our lifetimes,"" influencer Matt Wallace posted alongside video footage of flooding. The post received 11 million views.

False claims about weather-altering tools have become common in the aftermath of major storms, said Amber Silver, who teaches emergency management at the University of Albany. ""And there's always questions about...is this storm, you know, man-made or is it natural?""

""But the scale of that amount of chatter with Helene was unexpected for this event,"" she said.

While X's predecessor, Twitter, has always had fewer users than other major social media platforms, ""it has been historically very influential in disaster preparedness [and] response,"" Silver said.

In a recent study, Silver and her colleagues surveyed people about how they used social media after Hurricane Dorian in 2019.

""When people were sharing pictures of themselves at the grocery stores with carts full of supplies, or standing in line to get gas, or standing in line at Home Depot buying a generator, people felt internal pressure to prepare for the storm, too,"" she said.

After a disaster struck, people used the platform to spread information that helped first responders plan and call for help, Silver said.

But since Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter in 2022 and its subsequent transformation into X, all that has shifted. A blue check mark used to mean that the company had verified a user's identity. Now it just means the user has paid for a subscription, which makes identifying which accounts are trustworthy more difficult. The company also raised the cost of access to analyze its data, making rumor-monitoring efforts prohibitively expensive for many researchers.

""The kind of difference here that we're experiencing is just the amount of kind of maybe unuseful tweets that you have to dig through to be able to find the useful, actionable ones,"" said Samantha Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management at Massachusetts Maritime Academy. ""And that's a real challenge because in a disaster, you don't necessarily have time to be digging through all of that.""

Researchers have not yet looked at whether the effects of X's changes under Musk are negative for disaster response. Silver is applying for funding to answer the question.

""I do still think that there are real benefits to using social media in disasters -- whether it's Twitter, Tik Tok or something else -- as a way for people to organize among themselves and work directly with survivors,"" Montano said.

Dull says she has been relying on TikTok and a neighborhood Facebook group as well as family and friends in the area. She wants to know both what's happening now and what's happening next.

""I would like to hear updates on the people that are trapped on top of mountains right now. I would like to know what steps they're going to take to move forward and start rebuilding,"" said Dull. ""I want to know how they're going to help us feel a sense of normalcy again."""
"In excerpt from new memoir, Melania Trump says women have the 'right to choose' abortion",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/g-s1-26134/melania-trump-memoir-donald-trump-abortion-position,2024-10-03T13:23:45Z,"""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?"" Melania Trump asks in her new memoir, according to an early excerpt published by The Guardian. The former first lady is seen here alongside her husband, former President Donald Trump, in cardboard cutouts at a campaign rally in Johnstown, Pa. Chip Somodevilla/Getty hide caption

Former first lady Melania Trump says in a self-titled memoir set to be released next week that she supports women's autonomy and the right to control their own bodies -- including abortion, if they choose, according to a report Thursday.

Her stance adds another jolt to a presidential campaign season rife with dramatic events, with Melania Trump weighing in on a topic that is a central issue in her husband's bid for reelection.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy"" when deciding when and whether to have children, Melania Trump writes in the book, according to an excerpt cited by The Guardian. The newspaper says it obtained an early copy of the book.

Those decisions, she said, should be based on women's personal convictions, not on ""intervention or pressure from the government,"" according to the excerpt.

According to the The Guardian Melania Trump also writes:

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

NPR has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment about Melania Trump's writings, and is seeking independent verification of the excerpt from the book's publisher.

Abortion has long been a key issue in U.S. political campaigns, but the 2024 race comes two years after the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v Jackson that found there is no constitutional right to abortion.

Democrats have used that controversial ruling as a rallying call, emphasizing that pivotal votes on the high court's decision came from justices nominated by then-President Donald Trump.

The former president's position on abortion has been closely analyzed as he seeks to regain the White House.

""After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v. Wade, much to the 'shock' of everyone,"" Trump said last year on his Truth Social platform.

But this year, Trump has seemingly sought to portray a more nuanced position on abortion, including saying that abortion laws should be left for states to decide.

As NPR's Sarah McCammon reported after the 2022 midterm election:

""Advocates for bans on most abortions - including a wave of state laws passed in recent years that prohibit the procedure within the first several weeks - are at odds with public opinion, according to many years of polling. While most Americans support some restrictions on abortion, most support access earlier in pregnancy.""

Melania Trump's memoir, titled Melania, has a release date of Oct. 8, by Skyhorse Publishing, with distribution by Simon & Schuster.

In its summary of the book, the publisher said of the former first lady: ""She shares behind-the-scenes stories from her time in the White House, shedding light on her advocacy work and the causes close to her heart.""

The former first lady was born in Slovenia in 1970, three years before the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. She moved to the U.S. in 1996 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006."

The judge presiding over former President Donald Trump's Jan. 6 case has unsealed a new court filing revealing more details about Trump's charges of attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Prosecutors say they have sufficient evidence to convict him, even after the Supreme Court ruled this summer that presidents enjoy broad immunity for official acts while in office but not for unofficial acts as a candidate or a private citizen.

The Israeli military said yesterday that eight of its soldiers were killed in the ground invasion into Southern Lebanon. The ""limited"" incursion is part of Israel's campaign against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. Last night, Israel hit another building in central Beirut. Lebanese health authorities say that nearly 1,400 people have been killed in less than a month.

Jury deliberations are set to begin today in the high-profile police brutality case related to the death of Tyre Nichols. Police video shows officers beating Nichols, a Black man they pulled over during a 2023 traffic stop. He died three days later. The three fired detectives -- Justin Smith, Tadarrius Bean, and Demetrius Haley -- are accused of several felonies, including depriving Nichols of his civil rights by excessive use of force, conspiring to cover up the attack and obstruct justice and more.

When fentanyl began to spread in the American street drug supply, most experts believed it was unstoppable. Some of the most sophisticated and ruthless criminal gangs in the world operate the supply chain that fuels the demand for this deadly synthetic drug. Over the past six months, Dan Ciccarone, a physician and street drug researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, heard from experts who have noticed fewer overdoses and a significant decrease in the presence of fentanyl. This mirrors what Ciccarone's team saw in areas where illicit fentanyl had been flowing for years.

How Democrats are targeting red seats in blue New York to help win back the House,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5119744/democrats-flip-new-york-house-races,2024-10-03T09:07:01Z,"New York Gov.

Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in 2022 with the help of a mini red wave in the blue state of New York.

Democrats lost five seats in suburban districts, mostly around New York City, as many in the party were caught off guard. This year top Democrats across the state have joined forces to try to win those seats back, potentially netting the four seats they need to win back control of the chamber.

The GOP formula in 2022 was a barrage of ads and attacks on Democrats on crime, immigration and border security. The targeted messaging energized the Republican base and depressed Democratic turnout.

Party leaders responded this year with an effort modeled on more traditional battleground states will help turn things around for them this cycle with both resources and a stepped up ground game.

New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand told NPR she realized the need for the coordinated effort when she asked what candidates were doing in the week heading into the 2022 midterms and got a puzzling answer.

""There were [check] no big rallies. There was no organized canvassing, there was no coordination at all amongst local candidates and House candidates,"" Gillibrand said.

Kathy Hochul, then the Democratic candidate for governor, was being attacked by her GOP opponent Lee Zeldin about rising crime rates and border security. Gillibrand says tens of millions of dollars in negative ads had a big impact on Democratic voters in suburban districts around New York City.

""We had the worst voter turnout in 10 years,"" Gillibrand said. Hochul won, but the wave of House losses caused Gillibrand to reach out to Democrats in Wisconsin -- a perennial battleground state -- to come up with a 2024 strategy.

""So the day after the election I said to my chief of staff: 'We have to do something differently. Let's create the first-ever coordinated campaign for New York.'""

Now, Hochul says the coordinated campaign is allowing Democrats to connect with voters in a way that hasn't been done before.

""We're making unprecedented investments, rebuilding Party infrastructure, and turning out voters to elect Democrats and flip the House majority in November,"" she said in a statement to NPR.

Gillibrand, Hochul, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and state party leaders have opened 40 offices in seven House districts and hired 100 full-time staffers. Republicans have just five similar ""battle station"" offices.

Democrats linked state and local party operations. That effort has allowed them to make over 2 million contacts with voters between knocking on doors and phone calls, according to a spokeswoman for Hochul.

The strategy focuses on a more sophisticated get-out-the-vote effort, but it also includes going on offense on the issues that hurt the party the most two years ago -- crime and immigration.

Gillibrand points to her first ad as an example. She says it lists ""what I've done personally to make New York safer"" -- and touts her work on addressing fentanyl and illegal guns. Her third ad focuses on reproductive rights.

The move to lean in on crime and border issues follows the blueprint Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi used in February, to win a special election of a seat previously held by GOP Rep. George Santos. Suozzi emphasized a bipartisan immigration reform overhaul proposal, and effectively flipped the script on an issue that has traditionally put Democratic candidates on defense. Party strategists say his message is a good model in other districts in the state.

But Republicans say they still have the upper hand when it comes to the issues that got them elected in the first place.

Long Island Republican Nick LaLota is one of the five House freshmen elected in 2022. LaLota says his party will likely be outspent this cycle but says voters trust the GOP on the core issues.

""Suburban New Yorkers want two big things: a secure border and public safety and a better economy and less inflation. While they have a lot of money in campaign dollars and a lot of field offices and volunteers, their deficit is on policy solutions to those two big areas.""

New York isn't a presidential battleground but LaLota says GOP nominee Donald Trump knows New York is crucial in the battle for the House. He had a rally last month. He told NPR Trump knows his campaign needs to keep House Republican seats in suburban New York.

""His presence there demonstrates that he wants a governing Republican majority to give him the policy he needs from Congress when he returns to the White House.""

Marc Molinaro is another freshman GOP lawmaker whose district stretches from the Hudson Valley to the Finger Lakes. He says House Republicans are a check on an otherwise blue state.

""The people I represent want a balanced approach to government. They know that single-party rule in New York has led to the highest taxes of any people in the country, crime and an open border, Molinaro said.

But ultimately, taxes may prove the decisive issue in these New York contests. Trump's 2017 tax bill capped a popular state and local tax break called SALT, effectively levying an increase on many New York homeowners. Republicans were pleased that Trump stressed at his New York rally that he'll revive it.

""I will cut taxes for families, small businesses and workers including restoring the SALT deduction,"" Trump vowed at his Uniondale rally.

LaLota said that public pledge helps make the case to other GOP lawmakers as they craft a possible tax bill when many of the Trump tax provisions expire in 2025. ""Way to put this on the table -- this is what suburban constituents in blue states want,"" LaLota said.

Molinaro says the GOP has to follow through on that promise.

""If we really mean to provide meaningful tax relief to middle-class families, that's got to include reestablishing the SALT deduction.""

Jeffries vows Democrats will bring back the tax break, and calls out Republicans having it both ways on the tax break.

""They were the arsonists who burned down the state and local tax deduction and they have no credibility in trying to pretend right now they will be the firefighters.""

Democrats argue that Trump will be a factor in the race, and that the GOP lawmakers' decision to stand with Trump at his recent rally and vote in mostly lockstep on legislation championed by hardline House Republicans will hurt them with independents and Democrats in New York.

But several GOP strategists familiar with the campaigns in these districts stress that these incumbents have worked to create their own brands, and some have made a point to call out some extreme GOP colleagues in the House.

Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, another Long Island GOP lawmaker Democrats are targeting, faces a challenge with his own personal issues taking front and center in recent weeks. The New York Times reported that he put his mistress and the daughter of fiancee on his office payroll, something not allowed by House ethics rules, and a possible campaign finance violation. D'Esposito argues he didn't do anything improper and that the story was a political attack.

Republicans hope to link their Democratic challengers to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who was recently indicted on bribery and fraud charges. Lawmakers say his high profile case helps the GOP make their case against electing more Democrats to the House, but challengers in many of these House districts have called on Adams to resign.

Gillibrand waves off Adams as a factor in November House races. She says Democrats this year learned their lesson about engaging voters earlier on liabilities -- like crime -- and this new campaign focuses on the message and mechanics to get their supporters out to vote.

""Last cycle people felt depressed. This is about what we've accomplished, what we're actually doing to address their number one concern."""
Kamala Harris is making an unusual pilgrimage today -- to the birthplace of the GOP,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5137349/kamala-harris-liz-cheney-wisconsin-little-white-schoolhouse,2024-10-03T09:04:59Z,"The town known as the birthplace of the Republican Party is an unlikely campaign stop for a Democratic presidential candidate.

But on Thursday, Vice President Harris will be holding an event in Ripon, Wisc. -- home to the Little White Schoolhouse, where an 1854 meeting led to the formation of the Republican Party.

Harris will be joined in Ripon by former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, who endorsed her last month. Harris' campaign says they will speak about the history of the GOP and appeal to Republicans and independent voters disillusioned with her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump.

""I will always put country above party, and I will be a president for all Americans,"" Harris said at a rally in Charlotte, N.C., last month, noting that more than 200 prominent Republicans had backed her campaign.

Cheney and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, are staunch conservatives who have said they will vote for Harris because they believe former President Donald Trump poses a danger to American democracy.

Liz Cheney became a vocal opponent of Trump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. She voted to impeach him and later served on a House committee that investigated the attack. She lost her primary race in 2022 to a candidate backed by Trump.

Dick Cheney said in a statement last month that Trump ""can never be trusted with power again"" because he ""tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him."""
PolitiFact founder says both parties need factchecking. But they don't lie equally,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5133743/politifact-founder-says-both-parties-need-factchecking-but-they-dont-lie-equally,2024-10-03T01:38:35Z,"CBS said that its moderators would largely leave fact checking up to the vice presidential candidates in Tuesday's debate. Journalist Bill Adair said the network sent a powerful message, though.

Last night's vice presidential debate stirred controversy before it even started as CBS announced the network's moderators would largely leave fact-checking up to the candidates themselves. That led NPR's David Folkenflik to seek out the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Bill Adair, founder of PolitiFact and author of a forthcoming book that argues fact-checking is not always up to the moment.

DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Bill Adair paid close attention to last night's vice presidential debate, especially the moderators.

BILL ADAIR: The boldest moment, of course, was when they silenced the mics when JD Vance was going on.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MARGARET BRENNAN: And just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.

FOLKENFLIK: That was CBS' Margaret Brennan. Republican candidate JD Vance wasn't having it.

JD VANCE: Margaret, the rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check. And since you're fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.

FOLKENFLIK: And then the moderators silenced the candidates.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BRENNAN: Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut. We have so much we want to get to. Thank you for explaining the legal process.

ADAIR: It was a moment when the network stepped in and said, enough. And I think that was a really important moment that said to the viewers, we're not going to just let these guys keep talking and spewing things that are of questionable accuracy. We're putting you first, viewers. And a lot of us sitting at home watching these things have felt like the networks have been too passive in letting the candidates go on and on and on.

FOLKENFLIK: As a veteran political reporter in 2007, Adair founded PolitiFact to offer reported assessments - ratings, really - of the truthfulness of claims from public officials and politicians, pants on fire being the worst of it. Others, including The Washington Post, joined the fray. Adair says that when he started, he simply wanted people to have these assessments as a resource to draw upon.

ADAIR: I've evolved a little bit. We see every day that these false beliefs become serious problems, whether it's a huge number of people that believe false claims about Haitian immigrants eating dogs and cats in Springfield, Ohio, - something that is false - or more recently in Western North Carolina where there were false claims about dams breaching, and people freaked out. And so it's really important that fact-checking journalism get to people quickly and correct this misinformation.

FOLKENFLIK: While both major political parties peddle falsehoods, Adair argues that Republicans lie more and they lie worse than Democrats, and then they lie some more to discredit the people trying to hold them to account.

ADAIR: Any fact-checker would, in a moment of candor, tell you that that's very true, this asymmetry, that Republicans lie more. And to be clear, this was true before Donald Trump came on the scene. And it's even more true now.

FOLKENFLIK: As a result, Adair says, reporters and fact-checkers have often pulled their punches because they fear partisan blowback. After ABC put on the sole debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump called for ABC to lose its local TV licenses because its moderators pushed back when he made false claims. Adair argues that journalists cannot shy away from making such calls.

ADAIR: Journalism just can't sit back and wait for people to come to it. I think we need to become a little more active in stepping forward and saying, that's wrong.

FOLKENFLIK: Even so, Adair says fact-checking is part of the public discourse in a way that just wasn't 10 or 15 years ago. And he says he takes hope from a surprising source.

ADAIR: Every now and then, Donald Trump will cite fact-checkers (laughter) in attacking his opponents, and I take that as an odd but small victory.

FOLKENFLIK: Adair's book is called ""Beyond The Big Lie."" It's scheduled for publication on October 15.

Harris and Biden surveyed damage wrought by Hurricane Helene in 2 swing states,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5136749/kamala-harris-joe-biden-hurricane-helene-north-carolina-georgia,2024-10-02T23:26:55Z,"AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Vice President Harris took a pause from the campaign trail on Wednesday to visit a neighborhood ravaged by Hurricane Helene where more than half of residents don't have power and many don't have running water, consoling a woman who she said had lost her husband.

""There is real pain and trauma that has resulted because of this hurricane,"" Harris said.

Meanwhile, President Biden spent about an hour flying over Asheville, N.C., by helicopter. ""You can see homes that are moved, clearly, from one side of the river, down the river to another side,"" he said. ""Communities like Chimney Rock are reduced to piles of wood and debris.""

Biden and Harris are trying to reassure residents hurt by the massive storm that the federal government will help the region recover. Making good on that promise is a critical test for the administration in this election year, particularly in the swing states of North Carolina and Georgia, where Biden and Harris visited.

But Biden said it wasn't about politics. ""At a moment like this, we put politics aside -- at least, we should put it all aside, and we have, here,"" Biden said at a briefing at an emergency operations center in Raleigh, N.C.

""There are no Democrats, Republicans -- only Americans -- and our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and as thoroughly as we can,"" he said.

Biden announced that the federal government would cover 100% of the costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for six months for North Carolina, as requested by its Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper.

He also directed up to 1,000 active-duty soldiers to be deployed to help the North Carolina National Guard deliver food, water and medicine.

In Georgia, Harris said the federal government would cover 100% of the costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for three months for the state, as requested by its Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Kemp was not with her for the tour.

The White House also announced that Biden had authorized 100% of the costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for three months for Florida -- a state he plans to visit on Thursday.

Biden will also make a stop on Thursday in Valdosta, Ga. That's where former President Donald Trump was on Monday, where he, too, said that disasters transcend politics.

""As you know, our country is in the final weeks of a hard-fought national election. But in a time like this, when a crisis hits, when our fellow citizens cry out in need, none of that matters. We're not talking about politics now. We have to all get together and get this solved,"" Trump said.

But during his stop, Trump falsely said Gov. Kemp had not been able to reach Biden. ""He's been calling the president, hasn't been able to get him. But they'll come through, I'm sure,"" Trump said. Biden later that day angrily criticized Trump.

""He's lying, and the governor told him he was lying,"" Biden said, noting he had spoken with Kemp. ""I don't know why he [Trump] does this. And the reason I get so angry about it -- I don't care about what he says about me, but I care what he communicates to the people that are in need. He implies that we're not doing everything possible. We are,"" Biden said."

Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption

In a newly unsealed court filing, special counsel Jack Smith provided the most detailed picture yet of his criminal case against Donald Trump for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election and why the former president isn't immune from prosecution.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over the case, released the filing, with minor redactions, on Wednesday.

The special counsel uses the 165-page document to make his case that Trump's actions around the election were made in a private capacity, and not his official role a president.

This comes after the Supreme Court ruled this summer that presidents enjoy broad immunity for official acts while in office, but not for unofficial acts as a candidate or private citizen.

""When the defendant lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office,"" the special counsel's team writes. ""With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost.""

A D.C. grand jury indictment accused Trump of actions that culminated in the violent siege at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. If he regains the White House, Trump is expected to direct new Justice Department leaders to drop the landmark case.

""At its core, the defendant's scheme was a private criminal effort,"" the special counsel writes. ""In his capacity as a candidate, the defendant used deceit to target every stage of the electoral process.""

The broad strokes of the special counsel's allegations against Trump have long been known. The filing, though, adds some new details, including Trump's conversations with his vice president, Mike Pence.

Lawyers for Trump and for Special Counsel Jack Smith had clashed over whether the brief should be released, given its potential impact on the 2024 election where Trump is the Republican nominee.

Ultimately, Chutkan agreed to release part of the government's new arguments against the former president, saying the public must understand the court's eventual decision on immunity, and therefore needs access to the government's arguments."
Neighbors have been helping neighbors recover from hurricane Helene : Consider This from NPR,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/1202966849/neighbors-have-been-helping-neighbors-recover-from-hurricane-helene,2024-10-02T21:27:54Z,"An aerial view of people clearing away debris in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene flooding in Asheville, North Carolina. President Joe Biden has ordered the deployment of 1,000 active duty U.S. soldiers to assist with storm relief efforts.

Today, the White House announced that 1,000 active duty troops would be deploying to help speed up delivery of food, water and medicine to communities most impacted by hurricane Helene. Both President Biden and Vice President Harris visited the region Wednesday.

Though recovery in the isolated and mountainous areas of North Carolina and Tennessee has been slow, NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports strangers who were not affected have been lending helping hands. Like 22-year-old Tyler Venerable in Newport, Tennessee, who's been using his orange forklift to clear out people's flood-ruined belongings.

""I have a business here, have this equipment,"" he says. ""There's people in need, so we're just going to give back to the community.""

He tells NPR that he's been sharing his number at the dump, offering to help people lug more than one item at a time. Other people have been connecting on Facebook, creating an informal network to help their affected neighbors. Venerable has even seen others pass out jugs of water so people can flush their toilets.

""I just think that's what we're supposed to do. I'd be upset if I was sitting at the house.""

Meanwhile, 56-year-old Trudy Hall watches her ruined belongings get carted away. She says she's gotten help from strangers since the day of the storm. A neighbor connected her with a man who took her in. Hall's coworkers have stepped up with support, even helping to clean out her house.

""How about that,"" she says. ""People are good.""

Team Rubicon is a nonprofit led by military veterans, and one of the organizations helping in the relief efforts. CEO Art delaCruz is on his way to Pasco County, Florida, which experienced a storm surge that caused flooding, but he says there are Team Rubicon members spread across affected areas in the southeast.

In early phases of recovery, delaCruz tells NPR they send route clearance teams with heavy equipment and chainsaws.

""They were able to clear enough debris on these roads across Florida, South Carolina, Georgia to fill up a convoy of 1,050 dump trucks,"" he says. ""In this long marathon process of restoration of services, all of those can occur once the roads are cleared.""

Now, he says they're transitioning to helping individual homeowners and helping restore people's lives.

""It's important to note that we've literally sprinted into the beginning of a marathon. This will take months to recover across this entire region.""

Beyond sending money to aid organizations helping with recovery efforts, delaCruz suggests people reach out to their friends and family and make disaster plans.

""This is one of those times where - the idea of neighbors helping neighbors, it should go from West Coast to East Coast and come together to be able to help the people impacted.""

The flooding in Western North Carolina has also left election officials scrambling to prepare for voting. WFAE member station reporter Steve Harrison reports that state election officials are confident that early voting will begin on time - October 17 - in all counties. They just can't really say what early voting will look like.

""There may be polling places impacted by mudslides, there may be polling places inaccessible because of damaged roads and there may be polling places with trees that have fallen on them,"" said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections.

Mail-in voting will also be impacted: presumably many of those ballots are lost and won't be found. Amanda Allen, elections director in Jackson County which is part of the disaster area, tells NPR she and her colleagues are dealing with questions like:

Besides the process of voting, reporter Steve Harrison spoke with Republicans who are concerned that turnout will be significantly down in the mountains - counties which Trump won in 2020. This year though, thousands of people are displaced and living elsewhere and, while they can vote by mail, it's unclear whether that will be a priority."
Trump and Harris plan to end taxes on tips. The reaction is mixed in Las Vegas,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/26/nx-s1-5125788/trump-and-harris-plan-to-end-taxes-on-tips-the-reaction-is-mixed-in-las-vegas,2024-10-02T20:47:24Z,"Clark County, Nevada, runs on the hospitality industry. How will a plan to eliminate income tax on tips affect workers decision on who to vote for, or whether to vote at all?

I'm in the swing state of Nevada this week, asking voters about the issues that matter most to them this election. Hospitality, gambling and entertainment are the economic engine of this state. A lot of the workers here in Las Vegas rely on tips to help pay their bills, so it's no surprise that former President Donald Trump chose a campaign rally in Las Vegas to make this announcement in June.

DONALD TRUMP: For those hotel workers and people that get tips - you're going to be very happy because, when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips - people making tips.

MARTÍNEZ: When Kamala Harris made the same promise, she also did it in Las Vegas.

VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: We will continue our fight for working families of America...

HARRIS: ...And eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers.

MARTÍNEZ: So what do the people who earn tips think?

MICHAEL WAGNER: My name's Michael Wagner. I'm a Las Vegas native. I'm a bartender.

MARTÍNEZ: He says he makes up to $120,000 a year and that at least 75% of his income comes from tips. His biggest tip ever? - $10,000, which was split with colleagues.

WAGNER: I'm not very invested into politics. I'm 41. I've never voted. This would definitely be the thing. If this was something that was going to actually get me to register, go out and actually do it.

KIMBERLI YELLE: My name's Kimberli Yelle. I am one of the servers here at Artesian Cellars Winery.

MARTÍNEZ: In Pahrump, 90 minutes west of Las Vegas, she told us she makes minimum wage, which is 12 bucks an hour here, and that 75% of her income is tips. She is skeptical about these campaign promises.

YELLE: I'm just worried about the back end. What other taxes are they going to raise to make up for losing that taxed income?

ALLAN SCHLEICH: Hi, I'm Allan Schleich. I'm a bartender in the Arts District, Downtown Las Vegas. That would definitely help with rent, groceries. You know, maybe I'd be able to go to the dentist for once.

MARTÍNEZ: He says he plans to vote Democratic, but not because of tips.

SCHLEICH: As Democrats always do, they tend to pander to the left and the working class without actually fulfilling their promises, while the right wing definitely just only supports the rich.

LASHAWNDA PARRISH: I'm Lashawnda Parrish (ph). I'm a Uber and Lyft driver in Las Vegas, Nev.

MARTÍNEZ: She says she makes around $100,000 a year, about 20% in tips. She likes the candidates' proposal on tipping, but it isn't affecting her vote. She says she plans to vote for Kamala Harris.

PARRISH: I would say it would be on my radar. It wouldn't be, like, one of the most important issues to me. I'm a independent, and I tend to vote both Republican and Democratic - split my vote sometimes.

SUMMER BUNNY: My name is Summer Bunny. I'm an adult entertainer here in Las Vegas.

MARTÍNEZ: That is a stage name. She asks that we not use her legal name for safety reasons. She says she makes between 10- and $20,000 a month. Her biggest tip so far? - a thousand bucks. She told us she would vote for Harris because of her support of reproductive rights. She wasn't impressed, though, with the proposals on tips.

SUMMER BUNNY: All my income is tips. I understand that there has to be order, like, in some way. So I can get away without paying taxes, which doesn't seem fair at the same time.

MARTÍNEZ: All right. So is killing the income tax on tips something that could actually happen? I'm here with David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution, to hear about the economics behind this campaign promise.

So David, we know the President cannot change tax law without Congress. But if Congress voted to exempt tips from taxes, who would benefit?

DAVID WESSEL: Well, not very many people. There are, of course, a lot of tip workers in Las Vegas. Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at the Yale Budget Lab, estimates about 2.5% of all workers in the U.S. - waiters, bartenders, hairdressers - routinely get tips. Maybe it's a little higher if you add in the growing number of Uber drivers and DoorDash drivers. But even among the lowest-paid workers, very few are in jobs where tipping is common. Moreover, nearly 90% of all tip workers make so little money that already they don't pay any federal income taxes under current law.

MARTÍNEZ: Though, you know, David, most of the tip workers we spoke to were skeptical or pessimistic, like another shoe would drop - like, nothing good could happen or could come out of this. So they wondered whether taxes maybe would be raised to offset. What do you think?

WESSEL: Right. So there are two bills already in Congress to exempt tips from taxes - nine cosponsors in the House, 10 in the Senate, mostly Republicans, but the three Democrats from Nevada are on the case. They don't say how they're going to make up the money. If this actually happens - and I don't think it's likely - if it does happen, it'll be rolled into a big tax bill next year. And it's not clear at all whether that will be offset by higher taxes or spending cuts somewhere.

MARTÍNEZ: What about employers? What are employers likely to do if tips are exempt from taxes?

WESSEL: Well, certainly, some employers are simply going to pay their workers lower wages since they know the employees will be able to keep more of their tip income. But another issue is likely to come up - and one of your people you talked to raised this - is the question of fairness. Why should a waitress who makes 30 grand a year in wages and tips pay less in federal taxes than a cafeteria worker who doesn't get any tips? And that bartender you talked to who said he makes 120 grand a year - 75% of it from tips - is that really what President Trump and Kamala Harris have in mind - giving someone like him a tax cut? Indeed, the Harris campaign tells reporters that they're going to limit this to people who make up to 75 grand.

MARTÍNEZ: Polls in Nevada show that Harris and Trump are pretty much dead even here. They both made those announcements here - just a way to get some votes - to get some extra votes, David?

WESSEL: Yeah, it seems to me that the only rationale for this proposal is to win votes in Nevada. And I suspect that Kamala Harris isn't in love with this idea, but she figured she would match President Trump and then move on. If the goal was really to help hard-pressed, low-wage workers, there are more efficient ways to do it. Make the Earned Income Tax Credit bigger. Expand the Child Tax Credit. Raise the minimum wage, which, by the way, all - Harris wants to do all those things.

I don't think this is the big issue that Nevada voters are going to work a vote on. And with both President Trump and Vice President Harris saying the same thing, it's hard for me to see how many votes this will swing. But in a close election, you had one guy who says he's going to register for vote for the first time if he thinks this is going to really happen.

MARTÍNEZ: David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution - David, thank you.

Who is the real JD Vance? And 4 other takeaways from the vice-presidential debate,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/g-s1-25869/vp-debate-tim-walz-jd-vance-takeaways,2024-10-02T09:03:51Z,"Republican vice presidential candidate, Sen. JD Vance, and Democratic vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, participate in a debate at the CBS Broadcast Center on Oct. 1, 2024 in New York City. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption

Partisans on both sides will have arguments for why their guy did well at certain times and not as well at others in the first and only vice-presidential debate Tuesday night between Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz.

This debate likely will not move the needle at all in this presidential campaign, because -- first and foremost -- no one votes for the vice-presidential pick. After all, the most important rule of being a running mate is, ""First, do no harm.""

Short of a major mistake, VPs are unlikely to make a fundamental difference in the race. And there wasn't one of those Tuesday night.

But there were five takeaways from an interesting night:

On style, Vance was clearly more polished than Walz, and he likely accomplished what he sought out to do -- appear more rational and agreeable than Trump and, frankly, himself. But there's a real question about who the real Vance is. He was once a Trump critic, who became one of Trump's biggest cheerleaders. Since that transformation, he's gotten a reputation as a hard-charging MAGA partisan willing to take on all comers, known for making controversial statements, whether about ""childless cat ladies,"" not caring what happens to Ukraine ""one way or another"" or propagating false claims about immigrants eating pets.

But with his popularity lower than any vice-presidential running mate in modern history, another Vance showed up Tuesday night -- one largely respectful of his opponent. Vance even thanked the ""folks at CBS,"" a far cry from the booing that takes place on the campaign trail at his rallies when a reporter asks a question.

Vance also did a lot of laundering of Trump's positions, especially on health care, child care and Jan. 6. Because Republicans have an inherent advantage on the cost of living in this election, his strongest moments were when he questioned why Harris hasn't brought down prices already as part of the administration and implemented some of the things she's promising to do if elected president.

Some will see Vance's performance Tuesday night as a more focused version of Trump. Others will see him as something of a chameleon.

Walz got off to a shaky start. He was asked at the beginning about foreign policy, which is clearly not his strong suit. He had some awkward pauses and misspoke (saying he's ""friends with school shooters,"" for example, when he appeared to mean families of victims of school shootings).

Walz seemed to find his footing, though, on domestic issues, like dealing with hurricanes, climate change, abortion rights and, somewhat surprisingly, in an exchange on immigration, which is generally one of the weaker areas for Democrats. Walz effectively painted Trump as uninterested in solving the problem of immigration because he blocked a bipartisan border security bill. Walz also aimed to isolate Trump as the problem -- even saying he thinks Vance wants to find a solution to the issue. Vance's comeback was to say that Harris is inauthentic and a newcomer to a harder line on immigration. Both campaigns will be happy with those lines of attack.

In addition to foreign policy, Walz was weakest in his response to questions about his time in China. Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests, which took place in the spring of 1989. Minnesota Public Radio and others have reported that he didn't actually travel there until later in the summer.

Instead of directly saying he misspoke, Walz gave a meandering answer that included him saying, ""I will talk a lot,"" which could imply you can't believe everything he says.

Walz's best moments of the night came when talking about Jan. 6 and the 2020 presidential election. At one point, Walz asked Vance if Trump had lost the 2020 election. Vance deflected and claimed instead that the real threat to democracy was ""censorship.""

""That's a damning non-answer,"" Walz retorted.

It was something of a stunning admission: Vance dismissed the idea that experts should be trusted.

That posture mirrors how the right more broadly in the last decade of American politics has moved away from believing experts. Democrats have had their own issues with being perceived as elitist and talking down to working-class voters. Republicans, like Trump, have exploited that.

In place of trusting traditional sources of knowledge, Trump has played to cultural grievance, telling people there are simple solutions to complex problems -- like suggesting tariffs will pay for child care, which they will not. Vance embraces this line of thinking and says voters should trust Trump over others. Giving the example of conventional wisdom about the global economy, Vance said, ""For the first time in a generation, Donald Trump had the wisdom and the courage to say to that bipartisan consensus, 'We're not doing it anymore.' ""

That exposes one of the biggest issues in America: People don't agree on a shared set of facts. People have their own ideologies and are finding others who affirm what they believe -- whether Trump or posts on social media -- rather than having their minds changed by contrary evidence.

Sowing distrust in experts lends more credence to conspiracy and makes it harder to bridge divides.

Moderators can only fit so much into a debate, but there were some things that have gotten attention in this campaign that weren't brought up -- some of which involve the vice presidential candidates directly.

Vance wasn't asked, for example, about his 2021 comments about ""childless cat ladies"" that have drawn so much controversy.

Walz didn't have to account for his military record timeline or his misstatements on carrying weapons of war. Vance wasn't asked about his ""stolen valor"" accusations about Walz's service, either.

Neither candidate was asked about Ukraine, where these two campaigns have fundamentally different views, and Vance, in particular, has been a vocal critic of U.S. aid for Ukraine.

Strikingly, there has been no substantive discussion -- in this debate or the two presidential debates -- about Trump's handling of the COVID pandemic.

With the praise from the right of Vance's performance, it makes you wonder if Trump might be reconsidering another debate with Harris.

Does Trump want to let Vance have the last word? Does he want people questioning if Vance is actually a better debater and a more focused candidate?

How the debate plays in conservative circles -- and how much praise Vance gets -- might make the decision for Trump in the end."

This story first appeared in the NPR Network's live blog of the 2024 vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz. For the latest on the campaign, head to NPR's Elections page.

Vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz faced off onstage in New York Tuesday for what is the last scheduled debate of election season.

The tone was largely collegial -- in contrast to much of the campaign so far -- as the two Midwestern men tackled issues like the economy, immigration and health care.

NPR reporters fact-checked the candidates' claims in real time. Here's what they found:

VANCE: ""If you believe [that carbon emissions drive climate change], what would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America ... Unfortunately, Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite.

Under the Biden-Harris administration, the U.S. produced a record amount of oil last year -- averaging 12.9 million barrels per day. That eclipsed the previous record of 12.3 million barrels per day, set under former President Donald Trump in 2019.

Last year was also a record year for domestic production of natural gas. Much of the domestic boom in oil and gas production is the result of hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking"" techniques. While campaigning for president in 2019, Kamala Harris said she would ban fracking, but she changed course when she joined the Biden administration.

In addition to record oil and gas production, the Biden-Harris administration has also coincided with rapid growth of solar and wind power. Meanwhile, coal has declined as a source of electricity.

-- NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley

MODERATOR: ""[Gov. Walz] mentioned that President Trump has called climate change a hoax. Do you agree? ""

VANCE: ""Look, what the president has said is that if the Democrats, in particular Kamala Harris and her leadership, if they really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America, and that's not what they're doing.""

VANCE: ""I've noticed some of our Democratic friends talking a lot about ... this idea that carbon emissions drives all the climate change. Let's just say that's true, just for the sake of argument.""

Former President Trump has, in fact, repeatedly called climate change a hoax and made light of its effects.

His rhetoric on climate change has shifted over the years, with the former president at times saying he believed the issue was real but did not know if it was driven by human activity.

Scientists agree that the climate is changing, and that change is being driven by human activity, specifically burning fossil fuels which increases carbon emissions.

-- NPR producer Lexie Schapitl

VANCE: ""And then I think you make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers. A lot of people will go home if they can't work for less than minimum wage in our own country, and by the way, that will be really good for our workers who just want to earn a fair wage for doing a good day's work.""

As the vice presidential candidates discuss how to address concerns over immigration, increased migration -- both legal and illegal -- has helped to grow the labor force in recent years, allowing employers to keep adding jobs at a rapid clip without putting much upward pressure on prices.

Over the last 12 months, for example, the foreign-born workforce has grown by nearly 1.5 million people while the native-born workforce has shrunk by 768,000 people -- mostly due to retirements, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Were it not for the influx of immigrant workers, the U.S. economy would likely be shrinking.

They do not appear to be displacing native-born workers.

The share of working-age men who were in the workforce in August was 89.5% -- higher than all but one month during the Trump administration. The share of working-age women who were in the workforce last month was the highest ever -- 78.4%.

-- NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley

VANCE: ""A lot of fentanyl is coming into our country ... Kamala Harris let fentanyl into our communities at record levels.""

Once again we heard that undocumented immigrants are bringing fentanyl into the country -- a myth which has been debunked.

In reality, close to 90% of illicit fentanyl is seized at official border crossings. Immigration authorities say nearly all of that is smuggled by people who are legally authorized to cross the border, and more than half by U.S. citizens. Virtually none is seized from migrants seeking asylum.

Also, NPR has reported that the U.S. is currently seeing significantly less fentanyl in circulation and fewer overdoses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that fentanyl-related deaths dropped by roughly 10% last year.

-- NPR immigration correspondent Jasmine Garsd

VANCE: ""If you look at what was so different about Donald Trump's tax cuts, even from previous Republican tax cut plans, is that a lot of those resources went to giving more take-home pay to middle class and working class Americans. It was passed in 2017 and you saw an American economic boom unlike we've seen in a generation this country.""

Despite Trump's frequent claims to the contrary, the 2017 tax cut was not the largest in U.S. history. However, it was big enough to blow a large hole in the federal budget. Tax revenues as a share of GDP dropped to 16.3% in the year after the tax cut was passed, down from 17.1% the year before and an average of 17.7% over the past 40 years. Even though federal spending also declined as a share of GDP in 2018, the deficit topped $785 billion that year, and approached a trillion dollars in 2019 -- the year before the pandemic.

According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, more than half the savings from the 2017 tax cut went to the top 10% of earners, and more than a quarter went to the top 1%.

Large parts of the 2017 tax cut are due to expire next year. Trump has proposed extending all of them, while also calling for an additional cut in the corporate tax rate. Harris has proposed extending the tax cuts for everyone making less than $400,000 a year (97% of the population) while raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy.

While Harris' tax proposals are similar to those made by President Biden, her plan differs from the president's in some respects. For example, she called for a 28% tax on millionaires' investment income -- which is lower than the 39.6% rate Biden has proposed.

Under the Biden-Harris administration, the IRS has also beefed up tax enforcement to ensure that wealthier people and businesses pay what they owe. GOP lawmakers have criticized that effort, and it could be reversed in a second Trump administration.

-- NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley

VANCE: ""I think you can make a really good argument that [Trump] salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came about. ... Donald Trump could have destroyed the program -- instead, he worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that Americans had access to affordable care.""

During his presidency, Trump undermined the Affordable Care Act in many ways -- for instance, by slashing funding for advertising and free ""navigators"" who help people sign up for a health insurance plan on HealthCare.gov. And rather than deciding to ""save"" the ACA, he tried hard to get Congress to repeal it, and failed.

The Biden administration has reversed course from Trump's management of the Affordable Care Act. Increased subsidies have made premiums more affordable in the marketplaces, and enrollment has surged. The uninsurance rate has dropped to its lowest point ever during the Biden administration.

The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010 and is entrenched in the health care system. Republicans successfully ran against Obamacare for about a decade, but it has faded as a campaign issue this year.

-- NPR health policy correspondent Selena Simmons-Duffin

MODERATOR: ""Senator, you have not yet explained how you would protect people with preexisting conditions or laid out that plan.""

JD VANCE: ""Look, we currently have laws and regulations in place right now that protect people with preexisting conditions. We want to keep those regulations in place, but we also want to make the health insurance marketplace function a little bit better.""

Vance was asked about comments he's made recently, trying to fill in the details of Trump's comments during the presidential debate that he had the ""concepts of a plan"" when it comes to replacing the Affordable Care Act. (The Harris-Walz campaign needled the Republican ticket ahead of the debate about not having anything clearer to say on health policy.)

But when Vance refers to ""laws and regulations in place"" protecting people with preexisting conditions, those laws and regulations are the Affordable Care Act.

For context: Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies could deny coverage or charge higher premiums when people had ""preexisting conditions,"" which could be anything from diabetes or cancer to acne or back problems. The ACA made that illegal, and now everyone has to be covered and their premiums are based on their income, not how healthy they are.

Risk pools previously could essentially sort people into a ""healthy"" bucket, where you pay less for a health plan, and ""sick"" bucket, where you pay more or can't get coverage at all. The ACA requires insurance companies to take all people into the risk pool.

Health policy experts across the political spectrum say it's a terrible idea to go back to pre-ACA policies.

Of Vance's idea, conservative health policy expert Joe Antos told Roll Call last week, it ""doesn't make any sense,"" adding, ""you need some healthy people in there with some sick people, otherwise you're going to have a financially unsustainable system.""

Cynthia Cox of KFF, a nonpartisan research group, tweeted a thread enumerating how perilous things were when insurance companies could consider your ""preexisting conditions"" when deciding what coverage to offer you, if any.

""Cops, firefighters, miners, offshore drillers and pro athletes were denied plans,"" she wrote, because their jobs made some insurers think they were too risky to cover. And if your kid had more than three ear infections in the previous year, that could be grounds for denial, too.

VANCE: ""Thanks to Kamala Harris's open border, we've seen a massive influx in the number of illegal guns run by the Mexican drug cartel.""

Actually, there is long standing evidence showing the gun smuggling route is going in the opposite direction.

Most recently, the Mexican Attorney General of the Republic and the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) made an effort to trace the origin and number of firearms in Mexico coming from or through the United States. Mexico's Secretariat of Foreign Relations found that 70-90% of traced firearms originated from and passed through the U.S. The ATF and U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated a lower rate of 68%.

-- NPR immigration correspondent Jasmine Garsd

VANCE: ""Another driver of the gun violence epidemic ... is the terrible gun violence problem in a lot of our big cities, and this is why we have to empower law enforcement to arrest the bad guys, put them away, and take gun offenders off the streets.""

Of course, crime rates vary by city, but overall across the country, violent crime dropped nationwide in 2023, with murder falling by around 10% from the year before, according to data released just last week from the FBI. More than 16,000 law enforcement agencies sent their crime data to the FBI, covering around 94% of the country's population.

This year-end data, released each fall by the FBI, is the most complete look at national crime rates we have, but it is a little dated. Still, according to preliminary FBI data, violent crime has continued to drop nationwide in the first half of 2024 compared to the first half of 2023.

WALZ: ""I've not been perfect, and I'm a knucklehead at times ... I got there that summer and misspoke on this.""

Walz has a long relationship with China and claimed he'd been there ""about 30"" or ""dozens"" of times, but after APM Reports questioned how that was possible, his campaign acknowledged the real number of trips from the U.S. to China was ""closer to 15.""

Walz lived in China for about a year, teaching in the southern city of Foshan. His stint with the nonprofit organization WorldTeach started in the summer of 1989, just two months after the Tiananmen Square massacre.

Starting in 1993, he led annual summer trips to China for students in the Nebraska and Minnesota high schools where he taught.

Walz also once described being in Hong Kong in May 1989, during the student uprising that culminated in the Tiananmen Square massacre, the reporting from APM Reports notes -- an assertion that is belied by newspaper accounts at the time."

In Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance shied away from bombastic untrue claims about immigrants eating people's pets and instead tackled issues such as the impact of immigrants on U.S.-born worker's wages.

""You make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers,"" he promised. ""A lot of people will go home if they can't work for less than minimum wage in our own country. And by the way, that will be really good for our workers who just want to earn a fair wage for doing a good day's work.""

Most labor economists disagree with the claim that immigrants depress native-born worker wages.

Vance carefully dodged questions regarding family separation, a policy that caused uproar during former President Donald Trump's administration. He falsely claimed guns are smuggled into the U.S. over the border with Mexico (in fact, it's the other way around), and spoke about immigrants as being responsible for the housing crisis -- a complex issue that even conservative analysts say pre-existed the current wave of migration, but has been exacerbated by it.

Both candidates spoke about fentanyl as related to immigration, which remains a pervasive myth: Fentanyl is overwhelmingly brought into the U.S. by people crossing legally, through ports of entry. The street supply of fentanyl is also drying up.

For his part, vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz reminded debate viewers of the bipartisan bill that would have strengthened border enforcement. It was killed at the behest of Trump, and Walz repeated the Democratic vow that if elected, Kamala Harris will sign it ""on her first day in office.""

Video credit: CBS News Vice Presidential Debate.

Immigration is one of the top concerns for voters and seen as a weak spot for Democrats, who, in response, have been flexing their muscle. On her recent trip to the Arizona border, Harrris vowed to ""set rules at our border and to enforce them, and I take that responsibility very seriously.""

Still, on several occasions at Tuesday's debate, Walz was critical of the Republican campaign's rhetoric on immigration. He criticized Vance for how he spoke about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

""When it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanize and villainize other human beings,"" he said.

Vance did not repeat the false rumors that he helped amplify earlier this month regarding Haitian immigrants eating dogs and cats.

""""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio are the American citizens,"" Vance responded."

In Tuesday's vice presidential debate, Republican Sen. JD Vance refused to answer when asked directly if former President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, and sidestepped other questions about election integrity.

Moderators asked Vance if he would, as vice president, ""seek to challenge this year's election results, even if every governor certifies the results."" They also asked about his past remarks on the 2020 election, particularly what he has said about asking states to ""submit alternative electors"" before certifying the election.

Vance dodged the questions, though, and said that he was ""focused on the future"" and that ""censorship"" was a bigger threat to democracy.

When Walz re-upped the matter, asking Vance, ""Did Trump lose the 2020 election?"" Vance replied that he was ""focused on the future.""

Walz called the response ""a damning non answer.""

As recently as this year, Vance told ABC News that he if he was vice president in 2020 he would not have certified the election like former Vice President Mike Pence did in 2021.

""If I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others, that we needed to have multiple slates of electors, and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there,"" Vance said. ""That is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020. I think that's what we should have done.""

The discussion over electors was a key controversy during the Trump campaign's broader scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election. That scheme resulted in several criminal investigations.

To be clear, there is nothing in the Constitution that empowers a vice president to force states to have multiple slates of electors. According to legal experts, it is up to states to decide that. And in the case of the 2020 election, there was no reason for states to consider multiple slates of electors.

And lastly, a vice president's role during certification is largely ceremonial. According to the Brennen Center for Justice, federal law ""clarifies what was already evident to most legal observers: the vice president's role in the joint session is limited to 'ministerial duties,' and she or he does not have the authority to determine the validity of electoral votes or otherwise 'adjudicate or resolve disputes.'"""

This story first appeared in the NPR Network's live blog of the 2024 vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz. For the latest on the campaign, head to NPR's Elections page.

The CBS news program 60 Minutes announced on Tuesday that former President Donald Trump has backed out of an interview he had agreed to do as part of its prime-time election special next week.

""For over half a century, 60 Minutes has invited the Democratic and Republican tickets to appear on our broadcast as Americans head to the polls,"" the newsmagazine posted on X. ""This year, both the Harris and Trump campaigns agreed to sit down with 60 Minutes.""

It went on to say that ""after initially accepting 60 Minutes' request for an interview"" with Scott Pelley, Trump's campaign ""has decided not to participate.""

The election special will air Monday at 8 p.m. ET as planned, and include Vice President Harris' interview with correspondent Bill Whitaker.

""Our original invitation to former President Donald Trump to be interviewed on 60 Minutes stands,"" the statement added.

Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded shortly after on X, calling the program's version of events ""fake news.""

He said the show ""begged for an interview,"" and despite initial discussions, ""nothing was ever scheduled or locked in.""

""They also insisted on doing live fact checking, which is unprecedented,"" Cheung added.

Trump has run into trouble with 60 Minutes before, notably cutting short a 2020 interview with correspondent Lesley Stahl -- and backing out of a second that had been previously scheduled -- after becoming visibly frustrated with her ""tough"" line of questioning about the COVID-19 pandemic and other topics.

The Harris campaign was quick to criticize Trump on Tuesday night. Senior adviser David Plouffe posted on X that the former president is ""afraid"" of the debate stage and of 60 Minutes.

""And his campaign team -- after the last three days of increasingly unhinged and unstable ranting at his rallies -- is clearly afraid of exposing him beyond comfortable confines,"" he wrote.

He appeared to be referencing Trump's increasingly threatening and insulting rhetoric at rallies over the weekend, in which he described Harris as ""mentally impaired"" and said police should be allowed to be ""real rough"" on criminals for one hour to send a message.

The prime-time special would have been one of voters' final chances to see Trump and Harris side-by-side before Election Day. While the Harris campaign has called for a second debate, Trump's team has not agreed to one.

Hurricane Helene upends election planning in some parts of North Carolina,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5135564/north-carolina-helene-voting,2024-10-01T22:01:27Z,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- North Carolina election officials said Tuesday that early voting would start as planned on Oct. 17, including in counties that were devastated by flooding from Hurricane Helene.

But they don't know how many early voting sites and Election Day polling places might be unusable in the swing state because of the storm.

""There may be polling places impacted by mudslides, there may be polling places inaccessible because of damaged roads, and there may be polling places with trees that have fallen on them,"" said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections.

North Carolina is still trying to assess the damage from Helene, which caused massive flooding in the mountainous western part of the state.

Twelve county elections offices were still closed because of the storm, as of Tuesday evening. That means elections officials there can't process new registrations, and they can't send out or receive mail ballots.

The state's registration deadline is Oct. 11 -- though eligible voters can register in person at early voting sites during the early voting period, from Oct. 17-Nov. 2.

Brinson Bell said she hopes to know by the end of the week whether any polling places need to be moved. She said it's possible the board could set up temporary early voting sites in tents in parking lots -- something it did after Hurricane Dorian in eastern North Carolina in 2019.

She is confident the election will move forward as planned.

""It's not without consideration that I or someone else will go in that community and knock on doors if that's what it takes,"" she said.

North Carolina is considered one of seven swing states that could decide the presidential election. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris have made numerous visits to the state this year, and polls show it's a toss-up.

It's unclear how the storm will impact who turns out to vote.

One of the hardest-hit counties is Buncombe, home to Asheville, which is a Democratic stronghold. But overall, most of the impacted counties are conservative and gave Trump large margins in the 2020 election.

North Carolinians have already started voting by mail. Generally, small shares of the state's voters cast mail ballots -- in the 2022 election, just about 5% voted by mail.

The state elections board said about 250,000 mail ballots have already been sent out for the 2024 election. It didn't know how many of those ballots went to western North Carolina.

It's possible some of those ballots were washed away in the storm. Others are probably waiting in post offices, unable to be delivered. Postal service in the region is widely disrupted.

Brinson Bell said North Carolina voters can track the status of their mail ballots online, if they have internet access. They can request a new mail ballot and the state will void the old one, or they can simply ignore their requested mail ballot, and vote in person.

The state's mail ballots were already delayed by more than two weeks after the North Carolina Supreme Court ordered the elections board to reprint ballots to remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s name from the presidential race. The ballots were sent out in late September to voters who requested them.

In addition to the delay in getting mail ballots sent, there also is a tighter window for those ballots to be returned. The Republican-led General Assembly eliminated a three-day grace period for mail ballots to arrive after Election Day. For ballots to count, they must arrive at county elections boards by 7:30 p.m. on Nov. 5. (Military ballots and ballots from overseas civilians can arrive later.)

Brinson Bell said she doesn't know if she will ask state lawmakers to restore the three-day grace period.

She said it might make more sense to ask for more flexibility in where voters can return their mail ballots. Under current state law, voters can only drop off mail ballots at voting sites during early voting. She said she might seek permission to allow voters to drop off mail ballots at polling places on Election Day.

""[We're] seeing whether that's something that's more realistic and beneficial,"" she said.

Voters in affected counties do have more flexibility when it comes to the state's new voter identification requirements. According to the state elections board: ""One of the permitted exceptions is for voters who are unable to provide ID because of a natural disaster that occurred within 100 days of an election. ... This means that voters in or from the 25 counties under a disaster declaration may use this exception to the photo ID requirement, if they are unable to show ID when voting because of the natural disaster."""
VP debate: JD Vance and Tim Walz face off tonight. Here's how to watch and when,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/live-updates/jd-vance-tim-walz-debate-2024,2024-10-01T21:58:31Z,"One question likely on the minds of many people watching tonight's faceoff: Who is this for?

National polls show a tight race between Trump and Harris, suggesting the race will come down to voters in a handful of swing states -- depending on who they vote for or whether they vote at all.

And as NPR's Domenico Montanaro reports, only a ""tiny slice"" of the electorate -- from 6% to the low teens -- is considered persuadable.

In NPR's own polling, there have been nearly four dozen undecided voters in the last four months who gave their permission to be contacted.

Montanaro spoke with 10 of them in the days after the Harris-Trump debate, and detailed their reflections here.

""The debate was important for Harris. Most who watched said she performed better than Trump. They were not all moved to vote for her as a result, but four who seemed to need a degree of reassurance about Harris are now voting for her or leaning Harris' direction after the debate.

And while undecided voters often have unique reasons for what influences their votes, there was a clear gender divide. All four who say they are now voting for or leaning toward Harris are women. That also reflects the wide gender gap seen in polls between the candidates.

The other six -- one woman and five men -- were a mix. Five said they likely won't be voting for Harris, most citing the economy or immigration as reasons. One other said he is still truly undecided, but said prices are a major concern.

Two are leaning toward Trump; another said she aligns more with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; a self-described progressive said he doesn't like Harris' stance on the war in Gaza; and one other, a conservative, said he might not vote at all.""

One thing the group had in common? Many did not want their names used, citing security concerns in the current political climate."

Ohio's freshman U.S. Sen. JD Vance will make his debate debut Tuesday night alongside Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The former venture capitalist and author has had some missteps and stumbles since former President Donald Trump selected him as his running mate on the Republican ticket.

In less than two years in the Senate, he's become a familiar political figure in Ohio. But only one Democrat in the country has had the experience of debating Vance on stage.

That's Tim Ryan, the former Youngstown-area congressman whom Vance defeated after winning a seven-way Republican primary in 2022, on the strength of Trump's endorsement.

""I think you'll see somebody being very aggressive at trying to frame the Harris-Walz ticket as super extreme, super out of touch. They'll be blamed for everything and the world's going to end if they get elected,"" Ryan said about Vance on the debate stage. ""He'll be hitting that hard because he has an audience of one, and that's Donald Trump.""

Vance's conversion from Trump critic to cheerleader has been well-documented, but his about-face could still come up in the debate.

Ryan said some of Vance's other controversial statements also seem likely to surface, such as the false and racist rumors he's repeated about legal Haitian immigrants in Springfield and his negative comments about childless women.

The debate will be a chance for both Vance and his Democratic opponent, Walz, to present their policy positions to the broader American public, as most people are less familiar with them than with their partners on the presidential ticket.

Vance in particular will have to overcome lower favorability ratings.

""I don't know if it's who he really is or who he thinks he really is at this point,"" Ryan said. ""There's a real uncomfortableness to him, and he's also very thin-skinned and so he can fly off the handle a little bit if you hit him in the right spot.""

Ryan added that during the debate with Vance, Walz should be prepared to ""fact-check him in real time"". CBS News, which is hosting the debate, said it will be up to the candidates to call out inaccurate statements rather than relying on its moderators.

Republicans in Ohio celebrated Vance's selection as Trump's running mate. And Republican strategist Mark Weaver said Vance has appealed to moderates who may be still deciding.

""Republicans are energized, and many independents are impressed by his policy expertise and his eagerness to deftly answer all press questions while campaigning,"" said Weaver, a consultant who's has worked with a range of Republicans, from local officials in Ohio to former President Ronald Reagan.

Weaver said Vance has sharpened his communications skills through interviews and rallies over the last few years. And no matter what happens in November, Weaver said Vance's future is ""all blue sky - he'll either be the Vice President and President of the Senate or a first term Senator with a higher profile than his peers elected in 2022.""

""As a local Democratic Chair who came to the party after spending twenty years in local GOP administration, my expectations for JD Vance on the debate stage could not be lower,"" said Chris Gibbs, who now leads the Democratic Party in Shelby County in northwest Ohio.

Trump won that county with 81% of the vote in 2020.

""I predict Vance will spend ninety minutes affirming that the legacy core GOP principles of diplomacy, statesmanship, personal responsibility, and compassion have all but been extinguished from a once-serious party,"" Gibbs said.

Gibbs said as a farmer managing both crops and livestock, he wants to hear both candidates talk about immigration, trade, tariffs, biofuels and the Farm Bill, rather than personal attacks he expects Vance will launch at Walz."
"In Nevada, Latinos could pick the next president. They aren't sold on either candidate",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25479/nevada-latino-voters-trump-harris-culinary-union,2024-10-01T12:02:30Z,"LAS VEGAS -- Walking out of a grocery store in a Latino neighborhood on the east side of the city, Flor Elena Fernandez says she's wrestling with who to vote for in this year's election.

The 36-year old housekeeping manager worries about the cost of food. She worries about the cost of living.

""We're all waiting for what is going to happen, especially us Hispanics, says Fernandez, who is originally from Cuba. ""The economy is bad. We're waiting to see what happens.""

Her one and a half year old son, dressed in a red Flash superhero shirt is riding in the cart. Her mom also walks along, smiling knowingly.

Flor Maria Parra, Fernandez' mother, explains that she's already decided.

""Yes, for Kamala Harris,"" Parra, explains. ""At least with Hispanics, she defends the Hispanics a lot, while Trump throws them out.""

Around 1 in 5 voters in the Silver State are Latino. Now, that's more political power than the group has in almost any of the other 7 key states in the electoral college count.

President Biden barely eked out a victory in Nevada, in part by winning 60% of the Latino vote, but polls suggest Trump has stronger Latino support than previous Republican campaigns.

It's here in Las Vegas where Trump unveiled his plan to eliminate taxes on tips, seen as a direct pitch largely to Latino workers who make up the backbone of the state's casino and hospitality industry.

Looking to regain their advantage, the Harris campaign is spending $3 million in Spanish-language radio this month, which it says is the largest investment in Hispanic media ever.

The Democrats have also launched their not-so-secret weapon in the state -- an army of service workers from the Culinary Workers Union who have been helping deliver the party victories for several elections.

Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Workers Union, admits Nevada, ""to be honest, should be Trump territory.""

""At the end of the day, we're competitive, and we outwork everybody,"" he said, adding, ""there's a pathway to win if we really can get workers talking to workers face to face at the doors.""

That's exactly what they do. Thousands of cooks and servers and room cleaners will take a leave of absence to knock on doors, six days a week for Harris and the Democrats. The Culinary Union will help cover their missed wages as they undertake this different kind of work.

The Trump campaign is also increasing its efforts to reach Latino voters. In Nevada, it's hosting Spanish phone banking sessions, postcard writing nights and trainings for local volunteers.

Tony Fabrizio, Trump's lead pollster, argues that Harris' team is spending so much money on Latinos because they've lost so much ground within the community, especially in Nevada and Arizona.

""I don't care whose national poll you look at -- even yours, from NPR -- it is really very clear that she is underperforming with Hispanics, not only nationally, but in these two key states,"" Fabrizio said.

Back at the supermarket, views of Trump are widely mixed. Alfredo Alcasar is a maintenance worker. He says he doesn't like how Trump talks about Latinos.

""I don't like to be minimized. Trump always minimizes us, he said. ""And why, if we've done nothing bad? All we've done is try to contribute to the country as best we can.""

But Pedro Fernandez, a carpenter -- who is not related to Flor Elena and her mom -- is less worried about Trump's rhetoric and more concerned about inflation and the cost of living.

""We've been here 18 years, and when Trump was in power, the economy was stronger,"" he said.

As for Flor Elena Fernandez, she's torn. It will be her first time voting after recently becoming a citizen, and she wants to make the right choice. She agrees the economy is bad, but she also sees her mother's perspective.

""We know that she has a plan, but we don't know how good it will be,"" Fernandez says of Harris."
Vance and Walz are both veterans. Here's what it means to have a vet VP,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5134005/vance-walz-veteran-election-2024-vice-president,2024-10-01T10:06:41Z,"Left: Republican vice presidential nominee Sen.

For the first time since 1996, both major parties have picked a veteran for vice president -- a fact that some veterans' groups are celebrating, with the hope that it leads to greater understanding of military and vets issues.

That's if it's not all lost in a political slugfest of election-year personal attacks that threaten to degrade the public's respect for veterans instead.

""Through all this noise you still have vice presidential nominees who raised their hand and said that if I am called to give my life for this country, I will do it,"" said Rye Barcott, who leads With Honor, a political action committee dedicated to electing veterans who pledge to cross party lines.

""That is valuable and is something that we need more of,"" Barcott says.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance served four years in USMC public affairs, including one uneventful six-month deployment to Iraq. He went from a broken home life to a GI Bill education that culminated at Yale Law School.

And he writes in his memoir Hillbilly Elegy of how the Marine Corps taught him adulthood.

""The day I graduated from boot camp was the proudest of my life,"" he wrote.

Beyond drill sergeants screaming at him to get physically fit, they chaperoned his first grown-up decisions. When he bought his first car, a senior enlisted Marine steered him away from a sports car and a usurious loan.

Walz is also positive military role model from central casting: The high school teacher and coach, juggling his family and job with serving in his state National Guard one weekend a month and two weeks per year.

Walz joined the Guard when he was 17 years old. He'd just hit his 20 years for retirement when 9/11 happened, and he reenlisted. Over the course of his 24 years, he deployed for various natural disasters, and for one year to Italy in support of the war in Afghanistan.

Neither Vance nor Walz saw combat, which is much more the norm than many civilians realize. Both grew doubtful of the Iraq war, mirroring a majority of Americans. Walz talked about preventing America from deeper entanglement there when he first ran for Congress in 2004.

That doubt led the two men to different conclusions, made clear by their positions on Ukraine, where Walz supports American engagement to deter Russia, and Vance supports restraint (which his critics call isolationism.)

Either point of view is informed by military experience, which is a plus, says Allison Jaslow, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.

""Having lived experience of those who served in the military as a part of the next administration would be super valuable as we confront so many threats abroad,"" she said.

More than on foreign policy, a vet VP might influence the trajectory of the Department of Veterans Affairs, where experience suggests a second Trump administration would sharply diverge from a Harris administration.

Trump's signature achievement for veterans was the 2018 VA Mission Act (which Trump incorrectly calls ""VA Choice"" at his rallies.) The 2018 law widened veterans' options to use private health care if the distance or wait time for a VA appointment is too onerous. Having the choice is popular, but private medicine costs much more than VA care and isn't demonstrably better. It's one reason the VA is facing a $12 billion shortfall in the coming budget.

The bigger reason for the shortfall though is the Biden-Harris administration's signature achievement: the PACT Act, which opened VA to hundreds of thousands of veterans exposed to toxins, from Agent Orange in Vietnam to burn pits in Iraq. After Biden signed the PACT Act, VA enrollment jumped 33% in the next two years.

A Harris-Walz administration is likely to continue expanding VA-based care to cope with the new influx. Trump and Vance would likely look for more ways to carve off parts of VA care to the private sector, as outlined in the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025. While Trump has disavowed it, Vance has links to the project, and the section on VA was written by Brooks Tucker, former VA acting chief of staff under Trump.

Both laws are bipartisan compromises, something that still happens frequently on legislation regarding veterans. But which candidate ends up administering them going forward will have huge implications for the direction of the VA.

Vance's short, two-year career in the Senate hasn't yielded much of a record on veterans' issues. Walz can point to his early role investigating traumatic brain injury and toxic exposure, a key law focused on preventing veterans suicide, and the expansion of the GI Bill in 2017.

Vance has started talking about veterans issues on the campaign trail, though he spends more time attacking Walz's military record, which he says Walz embellished.

While Vance has been careful not to exaggerate his own record and his six uneventful months in Iraq, the man on top of the GOP ticket might overshadow that. Trump avoided serving in Vietnam, and over the years he's made disdainful comments about wounded veterans and even those killed in action. In early August Trump spoke of Medal of Honor recipients in terms that the VFW labeled ""asinine,"" and at the end of that month the Trump campaign filmed an ad in Arlington National Cemetery, and verbally abused a member of the cemetery's staff who tried to enforce the rules there.

Veterans advocates fear that using military service as a political cudgel only diminishes what has been one of the few American institutions to preserve public trust. While Americans say they prefer veterans as candidates, confidence in the military service has sunk nationwide, and the number of vets running for office dipped sharply this cycle, continuing a long slide from a peak in 1970."
JD Vance's time on the trail has often been overshadowed by self-made controversy,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5060281/vp-debate-jd-vance-haitian-migrants-abortion-childless-cat-ladies,2024-10-01T09:10:12Z,"Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance speaks to a crowd during a rally at the Berks County Fairgrounds on Sept. 21, in Leesport, Penn.

Republican vice presidential nominee Ohio Sen. JD Vance has been an aggressive messenger for Donald Trump's campaign vision for the future and is a constant fixture on the trail, doing interviews and taking questions from the press.

But in the 11 weeks since Vance joined the GOP presidential ticket, that message has been overshadowed by controversy -- often of Vance's own making.

His acceptance speech in Milwaukee at the Republican National Convention was heavy on biography and nodded towards a more polished take on Trump's often dire rhetoric.

""My friends, tonight is a night of hope,"" he said. ""A celebration of what America once was, and with God's grace, what it will soon be again. And it is a reminder of the sacred duty we have to preserve the American experiment, to choose a new path for our children and grandchildren.""

Vance's selection came at a moment when Trump was leading in key battleground polls after President Biden's poor debate performance and the GOP was rallying around Trump after an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. The freshman Ohio senator was viewed as the MAGA heir apparent to the party's future.

But in the run-up to Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, there have been two conflicting forces at work on the trail: the message that Vance wants to get out, and what actually sticks.

Take his first solo campaign rally in his hometown, just days after the RNC, where he delivered a populist speech vowing to help lift up ""forgotten communities all across our country.""

""We're going to fight for every single worker in this country,"" he said. ""If you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to put a good dinner on the table and send your kids to whatever vacation and whatever school you want to.""

But another line that broke through to the public -- and not for good reason -- was a comment about Diet Mountain Dew.

""Democrats say that it is racist to believe -- well, they say it's racist to do anything,"" he said. ""I had a Diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today. I'm sure they're going to call that racist, too.""

In the days that followed, Trump struggled to quickly pivot his campaign message to address Vice President Harris after President Biden dropped out of the race, but Vance was quick to fill in the gaps to question her record and make her the focus of attacks on immigration, inflation and other top Republican issues.

When Harris named Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and the pair embarked on a swing state blitz, Vance was there, too, countering the Democratic message with the case for a Republican presidency.

""It is normal people who suffer when Kamala Harris refuses to do her job, and it is normal people who stand to benefit the most when we re-elect Donald J. Trump president of the United States,"" he said in Philadelphia.

But Vance's rapid ascension in politics means he has relatively less experience as a campaigner, delivering stump speeches or handling the intense scrutiny on past and present statements.

So the prebuttal tour came as Vance was also dealing with uproar over old comments he made deriding Democrats in charge as quote ""childless cat ladies.""

""It's not a criticism of people who don't have children,"" Vance said in an interview with Megyn Kelly. ""I explicitly said in my remarks despite the fact the media has lied about this that this is not about criticizing people who for various reasons didn't have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child.""

But the damage was done, as Vance's old comments provided Democrats an opening to attack the GOP ticket as sexist and out of touch.

Then, there's more recent remarks, like a weeks-long inflammatory crusade against Haitian migrants living in Springfield, Ohio that Vance has sought to use as a cudgel to attack Democrats over immigration.

""The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes,"" Vance said in a Sept. 15 CNN interview. ""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do.""

State and local Republican leaders in Ohio have rejected claims made by Trump and Vance about Haitian migrants in Springfield. The city's mayor told news outlets that Vance's staff knew the conspiracies about eating pets were false before Trump uttered the lies on the debate stage last month.

Several times, Vance has also staked out policy positions for the ticket that Trump has later disagreed with or shot down, like when Vance said that Trump would veto a national abortion ban.

""I didn't discuss it with JD, in all fairness,"" Trump said on the debate stage. ""And I don't mind if he has a certain view, but I don't think he was speaking for me.""

Where Trump offered a ""concept of a plan"" for health care, Vance answered a question after a Raleigh, North Carolina campaign speech with more details of how Republicans would overhaul health insurance risk pools under the Affordable Care Act, a broadly unpopular proposal.

Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Vance has also been prolific when it comes to messaging campaign goals, frequently doing media interviews, delivering speeches and taking questions after most every stop -- prioritizing local journalists.

But those Q and A sessions can turn contentious, with the crowd often booing questions from journalists as Vance takes the opportunity to paint himself as a pugilist for Trump, whether it be queries about interest rate cuts or questions about the campaign's support of North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who allegedly called himself a ""Black Nazi"" among other things on a porn forum more than a decade ago. (Robinson has denied the allegation.)

Vance, who was a combat correspondent in the Marine Corps, regularly lectures reporters about what he perceives to be unfair coverage of him and frequently directs them to ask Harris questions instead.

Even in more casual campaign settings, Vance has struggled at times to connect. At one stop at a doughnut shop in Valdosta, Georgia, an employee was awkwardly put on the spot by the candidate -- she then asked not to be filmed on camera. On another visit to a Pennsylvania sandwich shop last weekend, Vance was left standing outside in a parking lot after some initial confusion because staff at the shop were never given advance notice of his visit.

All of these things have contributed to Vance having the lowest favorability rating on this year's presidential ballot -- and one of the lowest of any VP pick in recent history."
Tim Walz's state became a 'trans refuge.' Here's what that means and how it happened,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5103113/minnesota-trans-refuge-walz-vance-transgender-rights,2024-10-01T09:07:05Z,"MINNEAPOLIS -- As Gov. Tim Walz prepares to debate Sen. JD Vance Tuesday night, Minnesota's status as a ""trans refuge"" state will likely be in the spotlight.

""He's very heavy into transgender, anything transgender he thinks is great,"" former President Trump said on Fox the day after Walz was announced as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate. (Trump has pledged, if elected, to end gender-affirming care for youth nationally.)

In Arizona earlier this month, Vance falsely claimed the ""trans refuge"" law Walz signed allows the state to ""take children away from their parents if their parents don't want to do sex changes."" He added, ""that is not small government, that is disgusting, and he should be ashamed of himself.""

Here's what the ""trans refuge"" law in Minnesota is, how it's working, and how involved Walz was in getting the law passed.

The first thing to understand about how politically purple Minnesota came to pass this law, is that in 2022, voters elected Democratic majorities in both houses of the legislature and the governorship. It was the first Democratic trifecta in a decade, and lawmakers came in with a list of priorities.

Making the state a ""trans refuge"" wasn't on that list. But freshman Rep. Leigh Finke, the first transgender member of Minnesota's state legislature, made sure it was added.

""I knew that we had to do something because the national, coordinated anti-trans wave was building steam,"" Finke says. In 2023, between January and May, 15 states across the country enacted laws banning gender-affirming care for youth, including Minnesota's neighboring states of Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota.

""The dominoes fell in 2023,"" Finke says. ""The self-evident urgency became clear to the members of the Minnesota legislature.""

Walz, from the governor's mansion, was an active ally in the effort to protect transgender people in the state and not a newcomer to the issues, Finke says. ""Walz is a teacher and his history includes being the Gay Straight Alliance advisor at Mankato West [high school],"" she points out. ""People who are around young people and have seen what it means to deny people their authentic fullness -- they understand it.""

He was ""clear eyed in his support for this all along,"" Finke says, and quickly signed an executive order to put some protections in place in case the bill didn't get through the legislature. Because her party had only a very slim majority, Finke says she spoke to ""every single Democrat in the legislature -- and some of them for hours and hours,"" about the bill and its importance.

The day of the vote in the House, protestors arguing for and against the bill filled the state house. Debate on the floor was contentious and many hours long. ""We voted at 5:45 in the morning in the House -- it was a filibuster situation -- and everybody stayed up and made it happen,"" she said. In the end, the bill passed in both the house and the senate, and only two Democrats across the legislature voted against it, she says. ""I feel incredibly proud and grateful.""

Walz signed the bill in front of cameras. As he signed, he said ""Love wins,"" and handed one pen to preteen Hildie Edwards, who had testified in support of the law, and another to Rep. Finke.

The text of the law protects the privacy of both patients and clinicians when it comes to gender-affirming care in Minnesota.

""If you are trying to access health care for transition-related reasons, you can access that care in the state of Minnesota no matter where you live, and while you are in the state of Minnesota, our laws will protect you,"" Finke explains.

The law also protects medical providers from out-of-state subpoenas. Finke points to how Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton tried to get medical records for transgender Texans from Seattle Children's Hospital. ""Under our bill, the attorney general is tasked with protecting people in Minnesota to receive gender-affirming care,"" she says, so hospitals and doctors in the state don't need to worry about that kind of effort.

The law does not regulate the care itself -- it was already legal in Minnesota, and the details of a patient's treatment are governed by standards of care, and by an individual's choices, made in consultation with their family and doctor.

One provision of the law concerns custody cases, which Vance pointed to when he claimed the state of Minnesota could kidnap kids. ""There's nothing like that anywhere around this law -- it's a made up lie,"" Finke says. The bill allows certain custody cases to be heard in family court in Minnesota and judges to issue temporary orders, but it does not determine which parent gets custody or hand custody to the state. ""The state cannot claim jurisdiction or custody of a child,"" she says. ""Of course it can't.""

Since Minnesota's trans refuge law was in response to anti-trans legislation in states across the country, the circumstances are ""much more tragic than celebratory,"" Finke says.

Many trans people and their families living in states with bans feel like they're being driven out. ""Hundreds of people and families within the first six months moved to Minnesota -- I'm sure that's a major undercount,"" Finke says. ""And I know as the election comes, we're getting more and more."" She says trans people and their families are worried about what another Trump presidency could mean for their rights, not just in relation to health care access, but also military service, housing and employment discrimination, among other issues.

Since Minnesota's law took effect last spring, it has affected health care providers in the state. Children's Minnesota, which runs a gender program for youth, has seen an increase of about 30% in calls from patients in neighboring states. The hospital tells NPR their waitlist is about a year long for new patients, and they have hired new clinicians to keep up with demand. Family Tree Clinic, a Minneapolis provider of gender-affirming care, has begun a program to help train more physicians on this kind of care around the state.

Some families who can't relocate end up driving hundreds of miles to see gender-affirming care providers in Minnesota. One Minneapolis doctor told NPR he currently has 15 patients who do so.

On the presidential campaign trail, Walz isn't shy about his support for LGBTQ+ rights.

He headlined the recent Human Rights Campaign annual dinner and proudly enumerated the ways that both he and Harris have supported LGBTQ+ rights through their careers. He told the crowd, as he has said many times on the campaign trail, that there's a saying in Minnesota: ""Everything works better if you just mind your own damn business and I'll mind mine.""

""That's truly a long standing Minnesota value here,"" says Finke, who was born and raised in the state. ""People don't necessarily want to get involved, for better or worse, in their neighbors' lives, and that has allowed us to do a lot of good progressive work.""

""Some of the earliest trans action for civil rights was done here,"" she adds. ""In 1978, there was a case argued by the ACLU for a trans woman in the Army to be able to stay and keep her job. We were the first state to protect trans people in our Human Rights Act. It's always just been a part of the fabric here.""

Rep. Leigh Finke has faced fierce opposition to her trans legislative work -- including threats and harassment. In a way, that has helped fuel her own political rise. ""I'm a little bit famous in the Midwest,"" she grins.

""There were some viral moments from the House floor from conservatives going on tirades against me and against trans people, and it provided an opportunity for us to be able to stand strong, to be able to say, 'Here we are, queer forever, you can't just yell at us and have us go away,'"" she says.

She's had positive attention, too. Last year, she was named the USA Today ""Woman of the Year"" for Minnesota, and she was recognized as a ""Health Hero"" by Children's Minnesota.

And she is happy that there is more representation of trans people in public life than when she was growing up in the 80s and 90s in suburban Minnesota. ""You can't be what you can't see,"" she says, noting that she didn't come out as trans until adulthood. ""And I'm so grateful that I did. And I'm so grateful that I get to be in a position now where other people can see not just that there are trans people, but that we're succeeding.""

But when she knocks on doors for her re-election bid this fall, Finke says trans issues are not what voters are concerned about. ""I think that, in general, people don't want to be talking about trans kids, they would rather just let us live our lives.""

She's happy to talk about her other political priorities, like housing and the arts and urban tree policy, instead."
How young Republicans and Democrats are whipping up votes in key districts,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5123646/donald-trump-kamala-harris-georgia-election-young-voters,2024-10-01T09:06:16Z,"A member of the Young Republicans fills out a postcard asking for support for GOP candidates in Georgia. Nydia Blas for NPR hide caption

In a bustling restaurant in northwest Atlanta, roughly a dozen young Republicans are surrounded by pitchers, chips and salsa, chatting and laughing as they fill out postcards.

""Anybody need a drink?"" calls Winslow Jones, the president of Atlanta Young Republicans.

The group has met for what they're calling Margaritas and Mailers, and today they are handwriting postcards asking for support for two down-ballot GOP candidates running in nearby districts.

""Margaritas help,"" Jones laughs. ""This is an environment where people can come and connect with likeminded people.""

As election day nears, all eyes are once again on Georgia and its 16 electoral votes. And this time, one essential voting bloc is getting a lot of attention: millennials and Gen Z.

Voters under 44 years old will make up about half the eligible voting population in the U.S. this fall, according to population projections from the U.S. Census Bureau. NPR traveled to Atlanta to see how different groups of young organizers are approaching this moment.

At the Young Republican meet-up, Jones points to the intellectual diversity among its members, including the varying opinions on former President Donald Trump.

""I think across the board there can be mixed feelings about Trump,"" she says. ""But I think what we're all united on is this is a much bigger picture here that we need to look at ... issues that are affecting people at large.""

Jones says the issues resonating with younger conservatives like herself include the economy, the U.S.-Mexico border and crime.

Nearby, Jacquelyn Harn is also busy writing postcards. She's the chairwoman of the statewide group, Young Republicans of Georgia.

""We're excited for a change,"" Harn says when asked about Trump's 2024 run. ""We want the life that we had four years ago when President Trump was president. And his policies -- his conservative policies -- we need those back, and we want those to be able to achieve our version of the American dream again.""

Harn says young people have been hit hard by the economy and inflation. She points to housing and the fact that she can't afford to buy a house because she's ""paying rent out the wazoo every month."" And she doesn't see that changing if Kamala Harris wins.

""She's saying day one, she's going to fix the housing crisis and the pricing and inflation,"" Harn says. ""She's had three-and-a-half years to do that, so no one's buying it.""

Yet while younger Republicans in Atlanta are mobilizing, young conservatives in general are becoming increasingly rare, says Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University.

""Since the Obama years, the youth vote really has sided with the Democratic presidential candidate more often than not,"" Swint told NPR. ""The only question has been, what's the size of that turnout for the Democratic candidate?""

Back at the Margaritas and Mailers event, NPR asks Harn if it's harder for Republican groups to fire up younger voters who may be watching Harris, who is nearly 20 years younger than Trump and has landed high-profile endorsements likely to resonate with young people, like from Taylor Swift.

Harn says she isn't fazed: ""Taylor Swift is a billionaire who doesn't have to worry about how much groceries costs ... you can't tell me she relates to the average person around this table tonight. So if the best they can do is a celebrity endorsement that is not relatable at all, I don't see what they're doing.""

In the two months since President Biden stepped aside and Harris took the top of the ticket, Democratic groups in Georgia have shifted their campaigning into overdrive.

""Things just got crazy out of nowhere,"" says Davante Jennings, the president of Young Democrats of Georgia. ""Like, more people involved, more support, more work, more canvassing, more text banking. But it's good.""

When we meet Jennings recently at the Atlanta headquarters of the Harris-Walz campaign, he is joined by a dozen 20-somethings all typing on laptops set up on white folding tables, surrounded by pizza boxes. At the front of the room, a screen shows dozens more joining via Zoom. This is a joint text banking event, co-hosted by Young Democrats of Georgia, Men4Choice and Reproductive Freedom for All.

For organizers like Jennings, the goal is to hold onto the wave of enthusiasm Harris' candidacy generated and use it to mobilize all Georgians. At this event, they sent about 64,000 texts, all aimed at a very specific group: men of color, 27 to 50 years old.

""The backbone of the Democratic Party is the Black vote, which is why the Republicans are heavily focused on Black men specifically,"" Jennings says. ""When we show up ... elections seem to kind of flip. And right now it's not 100% guaranteed that we're going to get all of the Black vote.""

Jennings is also acutely aware of how seemingly small moments can build momentum. He just took over as the Young Democrats president from Parker Short, who recently went viral for lip-syncing Kendrick Lamar at a Harris rally in Atlanta. Jennings says the group got a lot more inquiries from potential organizers after that.

Yet while the Harris-Walz campaign is leaning hard into online messaging, embracing memes and viral moments on platforms like TikTok, political science professor Bernard Fraga of Emory University says it may have its limits. It's one thing to have that support from young people online, he says, it's another to turn that into ballots.

""It still remains to be seen whether the Harris campaign can continue that momentum all the way into November and make sure that Gen Z and younger voters are mobilized and active participants in our democracy,"" he told NPR.

Outside of campaigning for either party, a swathe of nonpartisan groups operate in Georgia and are working to simply make sure young people are politically engaged.

Among them is Rise, a nonprofit organization specifically targeting Gen Z students. It recruits ambassadors and pays them $3 for every person they get to pledge to vote. We met Rise's Georgia organizers recently in an area of Atlanta that includes a number of HBCUs, like Morehouse, Spelman and Clark Atlanta University.

In a presentation to a group of college students interested in becoming ambassadors, Rise's leaders tell them to highlight issues that are likely to resonate.

""How many folks in here have been impacted by gun violence?"" asks Aunna Dennis, Rise's director of Georgia. Nearly every hand in the room goes up.

Dennis tells NPR the aim is to mobilize millions of young voters across the country, but specifically in Georgia.

""We got 12 million voters here in this area alone, we have over five million registered voters. And we can unleash the youth wave on each of these campus communities,"" she says. ""That's a win for us.""

Meanwhile, at Kennesaw State University, nonprofit Poder Latinx has come to campus for National Voter Registration day. On the campus lawn, organizers are handing out pins, stickers, drinks -- even bottles of Tajin -- waving students over to the tent and encouraging them to register. By the end of the day, 81 new voters had registered, taking the total to more than 1,100 since Poder Latinx started doing this in March.

One of the students that came by the table was 19-year-old Iambianze Jackson. She told us she is planning to vote for Harris this November, but is less than enthusiastic.

""She doesn't really explain her policies well,"" Jackson says. ""She mainly talks about tax cuts for the middle class but like, she doesn't really have policies.""

And then Jackson says something we heard from a few people in this battleground state: The election can't come fast enough.

""I'm ready for it to be over,"" Jackson says with a laugh. ""I'm ready for the results to come out so we can just proceed from there, whatever happens."""
Claudia Sheinbaum to be sworn in as the 1st female president of Mexico,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25648/claudia-sheinbaum-female-president-mexico,2024-10-01T06:38:50Z,"MEXICO CITY -- Claudia Sheinbaum will take the oath of office Tuesday as Mexico's first female president in more than 200 years of independence, promising to protect an expanded social safety net and fight for the poor like her predecessor, but facing pressing problems.

The 62-year-old scientist-turned-politician will receive a country with a number of immediate challenges, foremost among them stubbornly high levels of violence, a sluggish economy and hurricane-battered Acapulco.

Sheinbaum romped to victory in June with nearly 60% of the vote, propelled largely by the sustained popularity of her political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

He took office six years ago declaring ""For the good of all, first the poor,"" and promising historical change from the neoliberal economic policies of his predecessors. Sheinbaum promised continuity from his popular social policies to controversial constitutional reforms to the judiciary and National Guard rammed through during his final days in office.

Despite her pledge of continuity, she is a very different personality.

""López Obrador was a tremendously charismatic president and many times that charisma allowed him to cover up some political errors that Claudia Sheinbaum will not have that possibility of doing,"" said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political analyst at Mexico's Center for Economic Research and Teaching. ""So, where López Obrador was charismatic, Claudia Sheinbaum will have to be effective.""

He is not leaving her an easy situation.

Her first trip as president will be to the flood-stricken Pacific coast resort of Acapulco.

Hurricane John, which struck as a Category 3 hurricane last week and then reemerged into the ocean and struck again as a tropical storm, caused four days of incredibly heavy rain that killed at least 17 people along the coast around Acapulco. Acapulco was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, and had not recovered from that blow when John hit.

Sheinbaum must also deal with raging violence in the cartel-dominated northern city of Culiacan, where factional fighting within the Sinaloa cartel broke out after drug lords Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after they flew there in a small plane on July 25.

López Obrador has long sought to avoid confronting Mexico's drug cartels and has openly appealed to the gangs to keep the peace among themselves, but the limitations of that strategy have become glaringly apparent in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, where gun battles have raged on the city's streets. Local authorities and even the army -- which López Obrador has relied on for everything -- have essentially admitted that the fighting will only end when the cartel bosses decide to end it.

But that's only the latest hotspot.

Drug-related violence is surging from Tijuana in the north to Chiapas in the south, displacing thousands.

While Sheinbaum inherits a huge budget deficit, unfinished construction projects and a burgeoning bill for her party's cash hand-out programs -- all of which could send financial markets tumbling -- perhaps her biggest looming concern is the possibility of a victory for Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.

Trump has already vowed to slap 100% tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico. Though that would likely violate the current U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, there are other things Trump could do to make life difficult for Sheinbaum, including his pledge of massive deportations.

Things with its northern neighbor were already tense after López Obrador said he was putting relations with the U.S. embassy ""on pause"" after public criticism of the proposed judicial overhaul.

First lady Jill Biden struck an optimistic tone for relations with the incoming Sheinbaum administration saying at a reception Monday that, ""Under Dr. Sheinbaum's presidency I know we will continue to build a more prosperous, safe and democratic region -- and take the steps in our U.S.-Mexico partnership.""

There are areas where Sheinbaum could try to take Mexico in a new direction. For example, she has a Ph.D. in energy engineering and has spoken of the need to address climate change. López Obrador built a massive new oil refinery and poured money into the state-owned oil company. But his budget commitments do not leave her much room to maneuver.

Jennifer Piscopo, professor of gender and politics at the Royal Holloway University of London who has studied Latin America for decades, said Mexico electing its first female leader is important because it will show girls they can do it too, but it can also create unrealistic expectations.

""Woman firsts are powerful symbols, but they do not gain magic power,"" she said. ""Especially when the governance challenges are so large, expecting magic solutions overnight can also generate outsized disappointment."""
"Dockworkers begin walking picket lines, risking to snarl East and Gulf Coast ports",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5133391/dockworkers-strike-east-gulf-coast-ports-shipping,2024-10-01T05:17:07Z,"BALTIMORE -- Union dockworkers along East Coast ports began walking picket lines early Tuesday, threatening to halt the movement of billions of dollars' worth of goods including furniture, paper, shoes, manufacturing components, farm machinery and much more.

Workers began forming picket lines outside of East Coast ports shortly after midnight, even though the International Longshoremen's Association had not yet released a statement. The pickets began just after midnight, after talks between the ILA and the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents ocean carriers and port operators, apparently failed to yield a new contract. Workers were seen picketing near the Dundalk Marine Terminal in Baltimore, Maryland.

The two sides have not met face-to-face since June. They appear to be far apart on key issues. The alliance asked for an extension Monday, a request that went unanswered by the union.

Despite pressure from House Republicans and more than 170 industry groups, who warned that a strike will have a devastating impact on the economy, the Biden administration is standing firm in its decision to let the collective bargaining process play out.

""I don't believe in Taft-Hartley,"" President Biden told reporters on Sunday, citing the federal law that allows the President to call for an 80-day cooling off period when the nation's safety is at risk.

How big an economic impact the strike will have depends on how long it lasts.

The strike affects work at 14 ports along the East and Gulf Coasts, according to the U.S. Maritime Alliance. They are the Ports of Boston, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Norfolk, Wilmington, Charleston, Savannah, Jacksonville, Miami, Tampa, Mobile, New Orleans and Houston.

More than $2 billion worth of goods typically flow through these ports daily, from cars and clothing to bourbon and bananas.

That includes more than half of all cargo containers coming into the U.S., or about a million containers a month. It also includes more than three-quarters of the containers carrying exports out -- about 327,000 per month -- according to the freight-tracking company Vizion.

Those volumes dropped sharply in recent days in anticipation of the strike.

""If it goes on for weeks, it's going to be a massive headache,"" said Vizion CEO Kyle Henderson. ""If it's just days, it's probably just a blip.""

Trade groups warned in a letter to President Biden that an extended strike would have dire consequences for the U.S. economy.

""It is imperative that the parties return to the table without engaging in disruptive activities that could harm the economy and the millions of businesses, workers and consumers who rely on the seamless flow of goods, both imports and exports, through our East Coast and Gulf Coast ports,"" the groups' letter said.

The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States notes more than three-quarters of imported liquor typically flows through the affected ports, along with more than 40% of the American spirits sold overseas. Halting those shipments could be particularly costly in the run-up to the Christmas shopping season.

""Consumers love to buy your favorite bottle of American whiskey or scotch or Irish whiskey or cognac as holiday gifts,"" says Chris Swonger, the council's CEO. ""Even a day's strike could have repercussions along the line.""

Companies have made contingency plans to blunt some of the economic impact.

Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a freight forwarding company, says customers already have diverted cargo to the West Coast in anticipation of the work stoppage.

""Really starting at the beginning of the year, it became very clear that this was going to be a major issue,"" says Petersen.

In recent days, he says, Flexport's focus has been on getting cargo out, so as not to incur hefty fees for containers left at East and Gulf Coast ports, and shoring up operations at West Coast ports in anticipation of a surge of activity.

Goods that are already on ships headed to ports affected by the strike will just have to sit offshore until the strike is over, Petersen says.

""The reality is, there's only so much you can do,"" says Jeff Sloan of the American Chemistry Council, whose members rely heavily on ports along the Gulf Coast and in New Jersey and New York. ""For large volume materials like plastic resins, there's just no way to feasibly divert that to other ports or to ship it in some other way.""

Two major sticking points are wages and automation.

In a statement Monday, the U.S. Maritime Alliance says the two sides had traded counteroffers on wages in the past 24 hours.

The alliance said its latest offer would increase wages by nearly 50% and triple contributions to employee retirement plans.

The International Longshoremen's Association had rejected earlier offers, calling them ""stingy,"" given the shipping industry's massive profits in recent years.

""Even a $5.00 an hour increase in wages for each year of a six-year agreement only amounts to an average annual increase of approximately 9.98 percent,"" ILA President Harold Daggett said in a statement last week.

Wage increases under the last contract, signed in 2018, were far more modest, with only $1-an-hour increases in four of the six years, bringing the top hourly wage to $39.

Jobs at the ports have traditionally been among the best-paying blue-collar jobs in the country, often topping $100,000 a year. But Daggett says the port operators should pay workers more.

""When they made their most money was during Covid, when my men had to go to work on those piers every single day,"" he says in a video posted by the union. ""They died out there with the virus. We all got sick with the virus. We kept them going.""

On automation, Daggett has been warning dockworkers that the foreign companies that operate the ports are seeking to replace them with machines.

The U.S. Maritime Alliance has said it's offered to keep the current ban on fully automated equipment and the requirement that any use of semi-automated equipment be negotiated.

At ports around the world and even on the West Coast, advanced technology is already being used to move shipping containers.

But at East and Gulf Coast ports, the International Longshoremen's Association remains staunchly opposed.

How many jobs would be lost in a transition to automated terminals isn't entirely clear. The shipping industry, backed by researchers at UC Berkeley, argues that automation helps ports stay competitive and handle more goods, which in turn creates demand for highly skilled workers.

The Biden administration says it's encouraged all parties to keep negotiating and to do so in good faith.

On Friday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su met with the shipping companies' representatives. They'd also ""been in touch"" with the dockworkers' union throughout last week, according to the White House.

It's clear the union has not been happy with Biden.

""Where's the president of the United States? He's not fighting for us,"" Daggett said in the union video posted in September.

The sharp rebuke came nearly four years after Daggett endorsed Biden in the 2020 election, citing his friendship and support while criticizing former President Trump for filling courts with anti-union judges and supporting so-called right-to-work laws, aimed at weakening unions.

In July, shortly after the first assassination attempt on Trump, Daggett posted a photo of himself with Trump, offered prayers on behalf of the union membership, and recalled ""a wonderful, productive 90-minute meeting"" at Mar-a-Lago with Trump in November 2023.

""I expressed to President Trump the threat of automation to American workers,"" he wrote. ""President Trump promised to support the ILA in its opposition to automated terminals in the U.S. Mr. Trump also listened to my concerns about Federal 'Right To Work' laws.""

While Biden and Vice President Harris have the support of the leaders of most labor unions, the same is not true for many rank-and-file union members.

In 2022, freight rail workers were deeply angry with Biden for signing a measure that imposed a contract on them, blocking a nationwide rail strike.

Now with dockworkers on strike and the presidential election five weeks away, the administration likely does not want to risk major blowback from labor groups."

These are some of the top tech stories from the past week.

Happy Tuesday. Here's your Tuesday Tech Drop, the past week's top stories from the intersection of politics and the all-inclusive world of technology.

Republicans in Congress are already hard at work doing billionaire Elon Musk's bidding, in just about the most literal way possible. On Monday, Republicans on the House Oversight Committee announced an investigation into the Federal Communications Commission's 2022 decision not to award a nearly $900 million bid for Musk's Starlink to provide broadband internet to rural areas.

The move comes after Musk, a staunch Trump supporter, used his social media platform X to claim that the government's decision not to grant Starlink the bid was ""illegal"" and cost lives in North Carolina. In another tweet, he promoted false claims -- later amplified by Donald Trump -- that the government was preventing Starlink servers from being delivered to victims of Hurricane Helene.

A Monday letter from the House Oversight Committee to the FCC demands documents for a probe on whether the FCC's decision ""followed established processes and is not improperly using the regulatory process for political purposes.""

In 2022, the FCC said the decision was because Starlink didn't meet its internet speed requirements. And the agency stood by that decision in a statement last December. But Republicans seem eager to bow to Musk every opportunity possible. One can only imagine the level of fealty he'll likely be paid if Trump wins the presidency in November.

California's effort to curtail the use of election-related deepfakes was halted last week when a federal judge paused a law meant to crack down on the deceptive videos. The pause followed a conservative influencer's claim that California's law, Assembly Bill 2839, violated the First Amendment.

Jewish officials working on the response to Hurricane Helene have faced antisemitic attacks online as right-wingers have spread vile conspiracy theories suggesting that nefarious figures are playing some kind of role in worsening the hurricane's fallout.

Antisemitic conspiracy theories accusing Jewish people in North Carolina of orchestrating Hurricane Helene are spreading like wildfire on Elon Musk's social media platform, X, according to a new report from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

In a recent interview on CNN, Hillary Clinton came out in support of stricter regulation of social media companies that allow harmful content to be posted on their platform. Clinton, who knows from experience how social media misinformation can influence politics, has been outspoken about the need to combat this misinformation in recent years.

Report says Trump White House obstructed FBI probe into allegations against Kavanaugh,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-kavanaugh-fbi-investigation-sexual-misconduct-rcna174548,2024-10-08T22:34:58Z,"The Trump administration did not allow the FBI to conduct a full-scale investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh that threatened his Supreme Court confirmation, according to a new report, disputing then-President Donald Trump's public claims at the time.

The report, released Tuesday by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., six years after he launched a Senate inquiry, says that the Trump administration ""exercised total control over the scope of the investigation"" and prevented the FBI from interviewing certain witnesses and following leads. As a result, the probe into the allegations against Kavanaugh was ""flawed and incomplete"" and ""unworthy of reliance by the Senate,"" the report says.

Kavanaugh's confirmation to the court in 2018 had been in jeopardy due to allegations of sexual misconduct by Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, which he denied. The FBI launched a supplemental investigation into the claims after Kavanaugh and Ford testified separately before the Senate Judiciary Committee and prior to the Senate vote on his confirmation.

The FBI concluded at the time that there was ""no corroboration of the allegations made by Dr. Ford or Ms. Ramirez."" (Swetnick's allegation was not included in its investigation.) Kavanaugh was ultimately narrowly confirmed to the high court.

The Senate report is a damning rebuke to the Trump administration's insistence that it gave the FBI ""free rein"" to conduct the investigation into the allegations. Trump said at the time that he wanted the agency ""to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion."" The findings corroborate reporting over the years that Trump officials worked to hamstring the investigation.

According to the new Senate report, the Trump administration not only ""kneecap[ed] FBI investigators' ability to adequately investigate those allegations, but the lack of transparency misled the Senate and the public about the investigation's thoroughness.""

The Senate inquiry's yearslong review comes so belatedly because of a lack of cooperation from the executive branch, Whitehouse said. The Trump administration stonewalled the Senate investigation and, although the Biden administration was more cooperative, the senator said ""investigators still struggled to secure direct answers to written questions, faced considerable delays in receiving answers to those questions, and often received incomplete answers or answers that fully ignored lines of inquiry.""

The FBI didn't comment on the Senate report to CNN, but told the outlet that it ""follows a long-standing, established process through which the scope of the investigation is limited to what is requested.""

Kavanaugh did not respond to The Washington Post's request for comment sent to the Supreme Court. A spokesperson for Sen. Chuck Grassley, who chaired the Judiciary Committee for the confirmation, told the Post that the report ""doesn't offer any legitimate, substantive new ground.""

Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Axios that the report is ""another attempt to delegitimize the Supreme Court."" Ford's attorneys, on the other hand, told Axios that the report confirmed the ""sham effort directed by the Trump White House to silence brave victims and other witnesses who came forward and to hide the truth."""
Why a federal judge appointed by Ronald Reagan is slamming the Trump immunity ruling,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-trump-immunity-judge-stephen-trott-rcna174539,2024-10-08T21:06:19Z,"Stephen S. Trott, a senior judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote in an op-ed that the decision in Trump v. United States has left us ""a kingdom within our republic.""

The Supreme Court decision granting Donald Trump broad criminal immunity has had no shortage of critics. But it's still notable that a federal judge just came out with an op-ed in The Washington Post blasting the ruling authored by Chief Justice John Roberts.

In the opinion piece published Monday, Stephen S. Trott, a senior judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote:

It's worth underscoring here that Trott was appointed to the federal bench by a Republican president, Ronald Reagan. He wrote that the result of the ruling from the court's GOP majority in Trump v. United States is that: ""The president and his agents are free to break the laws that apply to every other person in the nation.""

Not just the fact but the breadth of Trott's critique is noteworthy, in his estimation of how the ruling would apply beyond former presidents. That's because a question raised by the immunity decision is whether and how it would extend beyond Trump (or another former president), because the decision focused on former presidents. The issue could need further clarification from the justices if it arises in a case against someone who was allegedly engaged in criminality with or at the direction of a president.

At any rate, Trott's criticism is correct as he concludes: ""Nowhere in the Constitution or the Federalist is there any provision, suggestion, or hint that the president can with impunity commit crimes against the state or lawlessly abuse citizens without recourse. But that is what the Supreme Court has left us: a kingdom within our republic."""
"Trump says Gaza 'could be better than Monaco,' but 'they never took advantage of it'",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-gaza-better-than-monaco-israel-hugh-hewitt-rcna174475,2024-10-08T20:25:45Z,"Trump also claimed he has been to Gaza. An aide later suggested that visiting Israel counted because ""Gaza is in Israel.""

Donald Trump said that Gaza ""could be one of the best places in the world"" -- better even, he said, ""than Monaco"" and lamented that people ""never took advantage of it.""

In an interview with conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, Trump said: ""It could be better than Monaco. It has the best location in the Middle East, the best water, the best everything,"" referring to the Palestinian territory, which has been bombarded relentlessly by the Israeli military for the past 12 months, creating a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.

""They never took advantage of it. You know, as a developer, it could be the most beautiful place -- the weather, the water, the whole thing, the climate,"" he said.

Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Jewish Democrats and denigrated Palestinians while claiming to be Israel's staunchest ally, said that Gaza was ""a rough place ... before all of the attacks and before the back-and-forth of what's happened over the last couple of years."" The Republican presidential nominee also claimed that he had visited Gaza, despite there being no record of him doing so, as president or otherwise.

Afterward, a Trump campaign official given anonymity by The New York Times said that Trump has been to Israel, stating incorrectly that ""Gaza is in Israel.""

Trump's estimation of the real estate potential of the Gaza Strip echoes that of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who said in an interview with the faculty chair of Harvard's Middle East Initiative in February that ""Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable."" Kushner also suggested that, if he were in charge, he would ""try to move people"" from Rafah, in the south of Gaza, into the Negev desert, ""so you can go in and finish the job"" of eliminating Hamas.

Trump's comments speak to how he might approach the fraught and widening tensions in the Middle East if he wins the election. They are also deeply disconnected from the realities of life in Gaza under Israel's extensive blockade and what human rights experts have called the illegal Israeli occupation of the West Bank. After Hamas assumed governance of Gaza in 2007, Israel removed its military presence and swiftly imposed an air, sea and land blockade. Israel has largely controlled who enters and leaves the Strip; severely limited the import and export of food, medical supplies, infrastructure materials and commercial goods; violently restricted access along the coast of Gaza; and cut off access to farmland. Before the current war, two-thirds of the population in Gaza was supported by food assistance.

Multiple conflicts between Hamas and Israel over the years have exacerbated those issues. Israel's current war in Gaza, launched after Hamas' attack killed 1,200 people in October 2023, has displaced more than 90% of the population in the Strip, according to the United Nations. Gaza health officials say at least 41,000 people have been killed."
John Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett could vote to uphold Biden's 'ghost guns' regulation,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ghost-guns-john-roberts-amy-coney-barrett-rcna174502,2024-10-08T18:46:39Z,"The chief justice and the Trump appointee sided with the government in earlier litigation on regulating the weapon kits. They might do so in the final ruling, too.

The Supreme Court split 5-4 last year when it temporarily approved the Biden administration's regulation of so-called ghost guns, pending a final resolution of the litigation. If Tuesday's oral arguments in the dispute are any indication, the justices could be on their way to fully allowing government regulation of the kits for making untraceable weapons.

Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett were in the majority last year alongside the court's three Democratic appointees, over the dissent of the remaining four Republican appointees. Roberts' and Barrett's questions at Tuesday's hearing suggested that their votes in the final resolution of the case could track their earlier votes.

To be sure, oral argument is never a guaranteed sign of how the court will rule, so we'll have to see how the justices come down in the decision, which is expected by late June.

But following the hearing, the challengers to the regulation might not feel great about their prospects. At one point, Barrett said one of their arguments sounded ""a little made up."" Roberts questioned their claim that the kits are enjoyed by people who like building guns in the way that people like working on their cars over the weekend. And the court's three Democratic appointees were expectedly favorable to the government, bolstering the possibility that the court's temporary vote last year could mirror its permanent one.

As I noted in a preview of the case, the appeal stems from a challenge to a 2022 rule from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that regulates the ghost gun kits and parts. The agency isn't banning ghost guns but rather wants to treat them like regular firearms, meaning they need serial numbers, licensed dealers and background checks. The legal question basically comes down to whether the agency is within its rights to regulate the kits under federal law, or whether, as the challengers argue, the agency acted beyond its congressional authorization.

Responding to the challengers' contention that ghost gun kits are for hobbyists, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar called that ""a questionable proposition, given that if it only takes 20 minutes, the hobbyist is probably not going to get his money's worth and won't actually have the experience of building a gun."" She also said that the claim is ""contradicted by the facts on the ground. Because what the evidence shows is that these guns were being purchased and used in crime. They were sold to be crime guns."""
Opinion | A tit-for-tat war with Israel will not turn out well for Iran,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/iran-regret-attack-israel-missiles-hezbollah-rcna174375,2024-10-08T18:37:58Z,"Last week, and for the second time this year, Iran launched a missile strike against Israel. This one, however, the military equivalent of poking a sleeping bear, is likely to provoke a fearsome Israeli response.

Iran's first direct attack in April, which targeted non-civilian areas and was telegraphed in advance, looked more like a demonstration project than a serious strike. It was Tehran's response to Israel assassinating a top Iranian general in Syria, but it appears to have been purposely narrowed to prevent a significant Israeli retaliation. Israel delivered a token response (attacking a single long-range air defense system) and, at least for a time, the threat of greater escalation diminished.

Last week's strike, a response to the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah (a close ally of Iran) in a southern suburb of Beirut was qualitatively different. Iran fired missiles directly at civilian areas of Tel Aviv -- and sent millions of terrified Israelis into their safe rooms.

From a military standpoint, the Iranian attack accomplished little. While it caused some damage to targeted intelligence and military bases, there were few civilian casualties (A Palestinian man in Jericho died in the attacks, and two people were injured in Tel Aviv). More important, it barely put a dent in Israel's military capabilities.

According to Yonatan Touval, a foreign policy analyst at Mitvim, an Israeli think tank, ""Iran might have thought this was a measured strike it could get away with, and that at worst would provoke a symbolic counter-strike. But Israel perceives this differently and will likely launch a major retaliatory strike.""

As a geographically small country, deterrence has long been an essential element of Israel's strategic mindset. It has generally responded with disproportionate military force to acts of war. The response to Iran's missile attack will likely be no different. Touval said, ""Israel cannot let this pass if it is to reestablish deterrence and convey the message that it is not a sitting duck waiting to be hit at will.""

As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday, Oct. 8, ""Iran made a big mistake tonight -- and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and to retaliate against our enemies.""

But there's another consideration for Israel's leaders. For years, Israel has wanted to launch a military strike on Iran to diminish or even out wipe out the country's nuclear program. Successive U.S. administrations have consistently discouraged Israel from doing so. Indeed, the attention devoted to the Iranian nuclear program -- and the signing of the Iran nuclear deal in 2015 by the Obama administration -- was motivated, in large measure, by a desire to avoid a conflict between Israel and Iran that could potentially drag in the United States.

But with last week's strike, Iran handed Israel a casus belli and legal basis for an attack, and the U.S. will be hard-pressed to stop Israel from responding. While it will be difficult for Israel to hit Iran's nuclear targets without direct U.S. involvement, one can imagine significant Israeli attacks on Iran's military and even economic infrastructure in an effort to humiliate the regime in Tehran.

So why did Iran do it?

Iran's decision-making seems to have been influenced not by military considerations but by reputational ones. Nayyera Haq noted last week in an MSNBC column that ""despite new leadership in Iran, there remains the long-standing need to appear strong in the Middle East and also on the world stage.""

To be sure, Iran was in a difficult situation, but it was one it created. For a year, Iran has supported Hezbollah as it, unprovoked, sent thousands of rockets and missiles into Northern Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas. Perhaps Hezbollah and its patrons in Iran believed that Israel would not aggressively respond (yet another deadly miscalculation). But once Israel launched a major military attack, taking out Nasrallah and most of Hezbollah's leadership, and employed an audacious attack in which it blew up pagers that killed and wounded thousands of Hezbollah fighters, Iran's choices went from bad to worse.

""Doing nothing"" in response to the killing of Nasrallah would send a message that Israel could bloody its nose with no repercussions. But ""doing something"" risked unleashing another Israeli military strike. Iran chose the latter course -- and by doing so likely made a huge strategic error. Provoking a much stronger military rival is never a good idea. Iran has now opened the door to a military retaliation that will likely cause significant physical damage and could, ironically, undermine the regime in the eyes of Iranian civilians. What has Iran's expansionist foreign policy, support for terrorist networks and nuclear program brought the country other than economic devastation -- and now likely physical pain?

Iran's leaders likely believed they had no choice but to ""do something,"" but their apparent failure to fully consider how the missile strike would be viewed in Israel -- and the potential ramifications -- has put a target squarely on the country's back.

The same is true of Israel, it must be said. Any military response to last week's attack will need to be calibrated in order to prevent significant escalation. Ever since then-President Donald Trump foolishly pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, there has been no international monitoring of Iran's nuclear program. So it's impossible to know how far along Iran is in producing the fissile material necessary to construct a nuclear weapon. While it's highly unlikely that Iran is close to having a nuke that it can actually deliver, Israel may still want to tread lightly for fear of pushing Iran's leader into a desperate position.

Still, that doesn't mean Israel will sit this one out. Iran has provoked a far stronger military rival that has been itching at the chance to attack them. The consquences will be dire."
Ali Velshi: Trump's Project 2025 would unleash an imperial presidency,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-project-2025-power-presidency-supreme-court-rcna174366,2024-10-08T18:10:54Z,"Republicans are trying to create a federal government that answers only to the president and a president who answers to no one.

In July 2019, then-President Donald Trump offered his take on the constitutional limits of the presidency, telling a crowd of teenagers and young adults at the Turning Point USA Teen Student Action Summit in Washington that the Constitution gives him the right to do ""whatever I want as president.""

Five years later, in July, the Supreme Court handed down its ruling on Trump v. United States and sided with Trump, declaring that presidents were immune from criminal prosecution for ""official acts,"" a term the court chose not to define.

Trump and the court's conservative majority were in lockstep with each other but out of step with two centuries of constitutional precedent. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, ""The relationship between the President and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably. In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law.""

And according to Project 2025, the conservative playbook for a second Trump presidency, the president should be a king, with every lever of government serving him alone. The blueprint vows to slash the federal workforce and replace what's left of it with Trump loyalists. That's because all sorts of policy laid out in this handbook would be impossible to implement without loyalty to a president and an administration -- not to the Constitution -- across the government, especially because some of its plans are so radical that pesky things like, say, expertise would simply get in the way.

Page 21 of Project 2025 states, ""The next Administration must not cede such authority to non-partisan 'experts.'"" It proposes achieving that goal by removing protections for thousands of career civil servants, often experts in their fields, and replacing them with politically loyal appointees who answer only to the president.

So picture, hypothetically speaking, a scientist who studies the effects of chemicals in our water being replaced with someone who has no scientific background but a solid track record of supporting Trump's ideas.

Across the 900-plus pages of Project 2025, this strategy is spoken in code. On page 552, for example, it suggests, ""The Director of the FBI must remain politically accountable to the President.""

""Politically accountable"" is code for obedient. That's what they want -- an FBI that works at the whims of the president, arresting his political opponents, journalists, prosecutors, critics and even judges who don't do their bidding.

Remember, one of Trump's first big scandals as president was firing FBI Director James Comey for not publicly saying Trump wasn't under investigation in the Russia probe. That's according to the Mueller report.

""Political appointees,"" Project 2025 code for ""our guys,"" are to replace civil servants at every level possible. This would leave Trump unchecked if he is enabled to go after his perceived enemies, which he has promised to do time and again on the campaign trail. In total, ""political appointees,"" aka Trump's would-be goons, are mentioned in the massive book 99 times.

In the chapter on Homeland Security, on page 136, Project 2025 suggests that when a leadership role is vacated and the next person in line is a career civil servant, that person should be passed up for a political appointee.

On page 45, discussing the kind of person who should run the Office of Budget & Management, Project 2025 writes, ""No Director should be chosen ... who is not aggressive in wielding the tool on behalf of the President's agenda, or who is unable to defend the power against attacks from Congress.""

""Attacks from Congress"" should be the telltale sign here that no one involved in Project 2025 has any interest in a government of checks and balances. Congress is a co-equal branch of government, according to our Constitution. But according to Project 2025, Congress should bug off, too.

In the chapter on the State Department, it's put more bluntly. Page 173 states, ""The main suggestion here is that as many political appointees as possible should be in place at the start of a new Administration.""

Transforming our federal government from groups of qualified experts to unblinking yes-men would mean serious breakdowns in our government's ability to serve. For example, when Americans need crucial aid from federal agencies, the difference between civil servants and political appointees shows:

Just days ago, a former policy director on the National Security Council during the Trump presidency alleged that Trump initially refused to approve disaster aid for California during its deadly 2018 wildfires. The official told Politico's E&E News, ""We went as far as looking up how many votes he got in those impacted areas ... to show him these are people who voted for you."" Trump wound up reversing his decision.

In the playbook's forward, Project 2025 makes four promises for the next conservative presidency, the second being, ""Dismantle the administrative state and return self-governance to the American people."" So the architects of Project 2025 must have been overjoyed when the Supreme Court assisted them in this effort, too, by overturning the 40-year precedent of the Chevron doctrine, which allowed federal agencies broad ability to interpret and enforce regulations.

With the administrative state weaker than it's been in four decades, the time is ripe for the broad structural changes Project 2025 seeks. In concert with the Supreme Court's summer decisions, Project 2025 could create a federal government that answers only to the president and a president who answers to no one."
The problem(s) with the probes into the Trump rally shooting,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-probes-trump-rally-shooting-rcna174529,2024-10-08T18:10:45Z,"The official congressional investigation into the Trump rally shooting is struggling, but the unofficial congressional investigation is vastly worse.

Nearly three months after being targeted by a would-be assassin, Donald Trump returned to Butler, Pa., over the weekend for a follow-up campaign rally. The event also served as a reminder that members of Congress are investigating the incident from July, hoping to come to terms with how the former president was nearly killed.

How's that process going? Not especially well.

There is, of course, an official congressional task force, with bipartisan membership, though House GOP leaders stacked the panel with some very conservative conspiracy theorists. It was against this backdrop that the task force invited two other House Republican conspiracy theorists to testify as witnesses during an official hearing, prompting a Democratic boycott.

But if the official congressional investigation is struggling, the unofficial congressional investigation is vastly worse.

As we discussed in late August, two GOP members -- Arizona's Eli Crane and Florida's Cory Mills -- announced that they were overseeing a ""parallel investigation"" because they ""don't trust the federal government to actually do the job necessary.""

Crane added in an interview around the same time that he was concerned that government officials might've been involved in the shooting -- a radical idea that even other Republicans have avoided.

But as The New York Times reported, the Arizonan is determined to pursue his rather off-the-wall theories -- for which there is no evidence -- including bizarre claims that there might be a secret mole within Trump's Secret Service detail; the FBI might hide the truth; the would-be assassin might've had confederates; and the second would-be assassin might've been an ""asset"" of a foreign adversary who was being ""handled.""

Literally everything we know about the incidents suggest Crane's theories are baseless. He doesn't appear to care.

At this point, some might be inclined to shrug. An odd congressman is wasting time pursuing odd ideas, which has a familiar ring to it. But consider this tidbit from the Times' report:

And therein lies the rub: Key House GOP officials aren't embarrassed by Crane and his weird conspiracy theories, they're encouraging Crane and his bizarre pursuits.

Indeed, when Democrats recently boycotted a task force hearing, it was in large part because the official investigation panel agreed to give Crane a platform.

I won't pretend to know what will become of the investigation, House Republicans aren't exactly inspiring confidence."
A new foreign policy dividing line emerges in Republican politics,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-foreign-policy-dividing-line-emerges-republican-politics-rcna174507,2024-10-08T16:49:53Z,"As Donald Trump and JD Vance celebrate Hungary's Viktor Orbán, a growing number of Republican senators are pushing back in the opposite direction.

In last month's presidential debate, Kamala Harris bested her Republican rival on a variety of fronts, but one point seemed especially brutal. ""I have traveled the world as vice president of the United States,"" the Democratic nominee said, ""and world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump.""

Given a chance to respond, Trump clung to a curious defense. ""Let me just tell you about world leaders,"" he replied. ""Viktor Orbán, one of the most respected men -- they call him a strongman. He's a tough person. Smart. Prime minister of Hungary.""

In other words, the former president wanted to present proof that he wasn't an international laughingstock, and he immediately touted the support he's received from Orbán -- a Russia-aligned leader who's aggressively chipped away at Hungary's democracy.

Trump's rhetoric was not, however, surprising: The Republican has spent months turning to Orbán for validation, publicly celebrating him, having private conversations with the Hungarian, and even welcoming Orbán to Mar-a-Lago. The more the prime minister's authoritarian takeover of his country generated international outrage, the more Trump extended his over-the-top support to the prime minister.

His running mate has made similar comments. As recently as May, for example, Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio appeared on CBS and said the United States ""could learn from"" Orbán when it comes to targeting universities. (It fell to ""Face the Nation"" host Margaret Brennan to remind the senator that the Hungarian strongman has ""seized control of state universities"" and put them under the control of foundations run by his allies.)

But as unsettling as the GOP ticket's embrace of Orbán is, it would be a mistake to assume the entirety of the party is aligned with the prime minister. The Hill reported over the weekend:

The five Republican signatories were Arkansas' John Boozman, Maine's Susan Collins, Texas' John Cornyn, North Dakota's John Hoeven, and Kansas' Jerry Moran.

The joint statement was no doubt well received by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who's gone to extraordinary lengths to try to drag his party away from Orbán.

It was five months ago, for example, when the Kentucky Republican, still hoping to salvage what remains of the GOP's traditional foreign policy vision, condemned Orbán and urged fellow conservatives to reject the far-right strongman. McConnell pushed the same line in July, reminding his party that Orbán is ""completely in bed with the Chinese and the Russians.""

A few weeks ago, the Senate Republican reiterated the message, declaring, ""I've spoken before about Hungary's decadelong drift into the orbit of the West's most determined adversaries. It's an alarming trend. And nobody -- certainly not the American conservatives who increasingly form a cult of personality around Prime Minister Viktor Orbán -- can pretend not to see it.""

The letter from five senior GOP senators last week suggests McConnell has allies within his party on the issue, but it's clear that Trump and Vance are pushing in the opposite direction. Indeed, the more Orbán's Republican critics denounce the Hungarian's Russian ties and hostility toward democracy, the more one wonders whether Trump sees the criticisms as praise.

Either way, those looking for meaningful divisions in the Republican Party's vision for the near future should start here."
"In key Senate race, Montana's Sheehy faces overlapping messes",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/key-senate-race-montanas-sheehy-faces-overlapping-messes-rcna174479,2024-10-08T15:35:21Z,"In one of the nation's most important Senate races, Tim Sheehy isn't just facing one self-imposed mess, the Montana Republican is actually facing several.

The U.S. Senate is up for grabs in the 2024 election cycle, and it's far from clear which party will be in the majority for the next two years. It's likely that the entire national effort will come down to a contest in one state: Montana.

Democratic incumbent Sen. Jon Tester is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success, and it won't hurt his chances that there's an abortion-rights ballot measure on the statewide ballot. At the same time, however, Montana has earned a reputation as a reliably red state, which Donald Trump will almost certainly win easily.

Candidate quality, however, still matters in competitive races -- and in Big Sky Country, the Republican candidate keeps running into trouble. NBC News reported:

""Young people, listen up, they've been indoctrinated for too long. We don't even try to talk to them anymore,"" Sheehy said at an event in late 2023, according to audio obtained by NBC News.

In case that weren't quite enough, the Republican went on to say, ""It's called murder. That is the position of the American Democrat [sic] Party.""

Tester's spokesperson responded to Sheehy's rhetoric, saying, ""Tim Sheehy calling young women 'indoctrinated' because they value reproductive freedom just goes to show how out of touch he is with Montanans. In Montana, we don't want the government telling us what to do -- and Sheehy's position that politicians should get the final say over our health care is one of the many ways he's trying to change Montana for the worse.""

This is probably the sort of story the GOP candidate would prefer to avoid four weeks before Election Day, but complicating matters for Sheehy is that this is the latest in a series of overlapping messes.

The Republican Senate hopeful, for example, has also used racist rhetoric when talking about Native Americans -- which is indefensible under any circumstances, and which is especially foolish in a state with a sizable Native population.

There's also the lingering controversy surrounding Sheehy's gunshot wound, which he admits to having lied about, and which he refuses to explain in more detail.

Unfortunately for the GOP candidate, the list keeps going. For example, Sheehy has also been accused of plagiarism. He's also been accused of doctoring footage in a campaign commercial to obscure his association with a group that has advocated in support of transferring public lands, which is a big issue in Montana.

In August, NBC News reported that Sheehy's claims about success in the private sector aren't quite what they appear to be.

CNN reported last week, meanwhile, that the Republican -- a 38-year-old political novice who's never held elected office -- has also ""gone to extreme lengths to avoid press scrutiny"" during his campaign.

With all of this in mind, a casual observer might assume that Tester is trouncing Sheehy. That's not the case: The latest polling suggests the challenger is actually leading the incumbent.

There's no great mystery as to why: Sheehy has an ""R"" after his name in a red state. That's it. That's the whole explanation.

But if Tester manages to outperform the polls and hang onto his seat for another term, expect a whole lot of ""candidate quality"" conversations in GOP circles in the weeks and months following Election Day."
"Asked about targeting his foes after the election, Trump hedges (again)",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/asked-targeting-foes-election-trump-hedges-rcna174469,2024-10-08T14:56:15Z,"Fox News keeps trying to get Trump to say he won't prosecute his political enemies in a second term. Unable to help himself, he keeps missing the cues.

Late last year, Fox News' Sean Hannity asked Donald Trump if he had plans to ""abuse power, to break the law, to use the government to go after people."" The obvious point was to have the former president say he had no intention of breaking the law or abusing his authority. Trump, however, missed the point and deflected.

So, the host tried again to get his guest to say the sensible thing. ""Under no circumstances, you are promising America tonight you would never abuse power as retribution against anybody?"" Hannity asked. Trump responded by saying he wanted to create a temporary American dictatorship.

Six months later, the duo tried again. ""Will you pledge to restore equal justice, equal application of our laws, end this practice of weaponization?"" the Fox host asked, pointing to developments that have no basis in reality. ""Is that a promise you're going to make?"" Trump eventually responded, ""Look, I know you want me to say something so nice, but I don't want to look naive.""

In the same interview, Hannity also noted those who ""want people to believe that you want retribution, that you will use the system of justice to go after your political enemies."" Once again, the former president missed the prompt.

""Look, when this election is over, based on what they have done, I would have every right to go after them,"" Trump replied.

This week, it was Laura Ingraham's turn. It went about as well.

The Fox host began by asking the GOP nominee how he intends to ""restore faith in our Justice system,"" adding, ""A lot of people will say, 'Well, he's just going to do to them what he they did to him back at them.'""

Trump continued to miss the cues. ""A lot of people say that's what should happen, right?"" Trump replied and the nearby audience murmured its approval.

Ingraham tried again. ""Punitively using government institutions is what got us in this mess in the first place,"" she said, pointing to imaginary circumstances that don't exist. ""In our townhall we did back in February, one of the lines that really resonated, I think, with people is when you said, 'My revenge is going to be success.'""

It appeared that the Fox host was trying to guide the candidate to safer ground. It also appeared that he didn't care.

""Well, I do believe that, but I will say this: They have started a terrible precedent,"" Trump said. ""We've never had this. We do have that in Third World countries, banana republics, a lot in South America, where they go after somebody politically that's an opponent.""

It led Ingraham to try a third time to get the Republican to say the responsible thing. ""But you're not going to do that,"" she said. ""When you get into office, you're going to look at all your political enemies?""

Trump didn't exactly answer the question directly.

""No, I want to make this the most successful country in the world. That's what I want to do,"" he replied.

To be sure, part of Ingraham's line of inquiry was problematic. She treated it as a given, for example, that the Biden administration has weaponized federal law enforcement, despite the fact that this hasn't happened; the ridiculous conspiracy theories have been thoroughly and repeatedly discredited; and there's unambiguous evidence pointing in the opposite direction.

But Trump's answers were far worse.

The Republican not only took deliberate and abusive steps to target his perceived foes while in office, he's effectively running on a retaliatory 2024 platform: Trump wants to prosecute his perceived domestic political enemies, and he doesn't seem especially interested in hiding his intentions. On the contrary, he talks about his desire to abuse presidential powers all the time, even raising the specter of military tribunals for his opponents.

A recent New York Times analysis noted that Trump has effectively put the rule of law ""on the ballot."" Fox News hosts keep trying to help the former president take the issue off the ballot, but the GOP candidate, hellbent on revenge, simply can't help himself."
Trump picks an odd time to ignore the GOP's antisemitism problem,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-picks-odd-time-ignore-gops-antisemitism-problem-rcna174455,2024-10-08T13:57:55Z,"The presidential candidate wasn't just wrong to pretend the Republican Party doesn't have an antisemitism problem. He also had incredibly bad timing.

Like many prominent political figures, Donald Trump recognized the anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel. What was notable, however, was the Trumpian way in which he honored the day. The New York Times reported:

""The anti-Jewish hatred has returned even here in America, in our streets, our media and our college campuses and within the ranks of the Democrat [sic] Party in particular, not in the Republican Party, I will tell you,"" the former president said at an event held at one of his resorts.

Trump added: ""The Republican Party has not been infected by this horrible disease. And hopefully it won't be. It won't be as long as I'm in charge, I can tell you that.""

The rhetoric was obviously ugly and false, but it was also poorly timed.

As Trump pretended that the GOP doesn't have an antisemitism problem, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia continued to insist, over and over again, that ""they"" have a secret ability to ""control the weather"" -- and as my MSNBC colleague Ja'han Jones explained, ""Greene didn't specify whether 'they' are Jewish in this weather control scenario, but such claims about people nefariously controlling the weather have documented links to antisemitic conspiracy theories.""

A few days earlier, Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee thought it'd be a good idea to condemn George Soros as a ""money changer of the worst kind.""

It came against a backdrop in which the public learned that North Carolina's Republican gubernatorial candidate, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, allegedly described himself as a ""Nazi"" and praised Adolf Hitler's ""Mein Kampf.""

Let's not forget far-right media personality Tucker Carlson, who received a prominent speaking slot at the Republican National Convention, who recently interviewed and praised a Holocaust revisionist, and who nevertheless remains close with the party's presidential ticket.

And then, of course, there's Trump himself, who, just a few weeks ago, publicly suggested that he intends to blame Jews, at least in part, if he loses the 2024 race. A month earlier, after seeing Gov. Josh Shapiro's remarks at the Democratic National Convention, the former president decided to take a rhetorical shot at his critic. The Pennsylvania Democrat, the former president wrote online, is a ""highly overrated Jewish Governor.""

In context, there was no reason for the Republican to reference Shapiro's faith. Trump did it anyway.

It was not an isolated incident. As regular readers might recall, it was earlier this year when Trump also invoked a familiar dual loyalty trope by claiming that Jewish voters who support Democrats hate Israel.

It was part of a larger pattern. During his 2016 campaign, for example, Trump spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition and said, ""You're not gonna support me because I don't want your money. You want to control your politicians."" He added, ""I'm a negotiator -- like you folks.""

Several months later, in the run-up to Election Day 2016, the Republican promoted antisemitic imagery through social media. In the closing days of the campaign, Trump again faced accusations of antisemitism, claiming Hillary Clinton met ""in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.""

While in office, the then-president used some highly provocative rhetoric about Jews and what he expected about their ""loyalties."" Trump also spoke at the Israeli American Council's national summit, where he suggested Jewish people are primarily focused on wealth, which is why he expected them to support his re-election campaign.

There was also his ugly reaction to a racist event in Charlottesville in 2017, in response to torch-wielding bigots chanting, ""Jews will not replace us.""

After his defeat, Trump kept this going, whining that Jewish voters ""don't love Israel enough,"" dining with prominent antisemites at Mar-a-Lago, and arguing that Jews need to ""get their act together"" and ""appreciate"" Israel ""before it is too late.""

In late 2022, the former president went so far as to declare that Jewish leaders ""should be ashamed of themselves"" over their ""lack of loyalty."" Around the same time, he added to the list, using related rhetoric about Jews with a documentary filmmaker.

And yet, there was Trump on the anniversary of Oct. 7, boasting that he'll ensure that his party isn't ""infected"" by antisemitism. What a relief that must be to the Jewish community."
"Trump, Vance and Musk push lies about immigration app CBP One",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/cbp-one-app-trump-vance-musk-rcna174400,2024-10-08T13:51:49Z,"Donald Trump, JD Vance and Elon Musk have spread lies about the U.S. Customs and Border Protection app. Here are the facts.

Donald Trump and the Republican Party are spreading lies about a mobile app used to assist migrants -- and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection -- with the asylum process.

The latest lies align with the Trump campaign's racist fearmongering about migrants weeks out from the election.

During his debate against Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz last week, Trump's running mate, JD Vance, made the following absurd claim:

Trump made a similar claim in Wisconsin last week:

Trump has referred to the CBP One app as ""the Kamala phone app for smuggling illegals,"" but the app was actually launched during his administration. And tech billionaire Elon Musk, who is no stranger to peddling conspiracy theories, claimed last week that ""it takes less than 5 minutes and zero documentation to get approved"" for entry into the United States using the CBP One app.

All of these assertions are flat-out lies. As The Verge explained, the true nature of the app is almost the polar opposite of what Trump and Vance have claimed. The outlet reported:

In other words, the suggestion that the CBP One app is aiding migrants' unfettered entry into the U.S. would be a surprise to the hundreds of thousands of migrants who've used the app. In reality, many migrants have complained about glitches and other malfunctions on the app that have caused delays in the asylum-seeking process. Migrant rights activists have denounced the app's collection of biometric data belonging to the migrants who use it. And Haitian and African migrants, whom Trump and Vance have demonized, have claimed the app's facial recognition software has impeded their immigration process because of its failures to detect darker skin tones.

In the name of stoking anti-immigrant invective, Trump and Vance are filling the MAGA trough with putrid lies and telling their followers to eat up."
Harris turns Trump's Helene lies into election-season scandal,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/harris-turns-trumps-helene-lies-election-season-scandal-rcna174446,2024-10-08T13:26:14Z,"The consequences of Trump's duplicity are real: As my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim explained, officials have said that the election-season lies and conspiracy theories ""are hindering relief efforts,"" while forcing agencies to waste time and resources combatting lies that too many people are falling for.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who started the week with an on-the-ground visit to North Carolina, has started pushing back against her GOP rival in earnest. NBC News reported:

""It's extraordinarily irresponsible,"" the Democratic nominee said, adding in reference to Trump, ""It's about him; it's not about you.""

It was an important point. For months, at the heart of the Democratic Party's election-season messaging was a straightforward condemnation of the former president: Trump's only priority is what's best for Trump. Period. Full stop.

It's against this backdrop that the Republican saw devastated communities and human suffering, which apparently led him to see a political opportunity: If he repeatedly lied about the heartbreaking circumstances, Trump concluded, it might benefit his campaign.

The whole idea behind so-called ""October Surprises"" is that there are sometimes unexpected developments that jolt the public conversation in the runup to Election Day and affect the results. Except, in 2024, Trump has arguably imposed an October Surprise on himself: With four weeks remaining, the Republican Party's presidential nominee got caught trying to exploit human suffering, lying about a deadly natural disaster to advance his own interests.

As it turns out, we have a word in American politics for situations like these. That word is ""scandal."" Trump actions -- drawing fresh attention to his lack of integrity and character -- deserve to be seen and characterized as scandalous.

Making matters worse, these developments also offer a timely reminder that Trump's own record related to responding to disasters is abysmal -- a point the Harris campaign hopes to drive home in a hard-hitting new television ad."
"Opinion | Biden pledged to restore order as president. In the Middle East, he's failing.",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-iran-war-biden-hezbollah-election-rcna174262,2024-10-08T10:47:49Z,"The president's poor leadership has brought us closer to a regional war that could cause enormous suffering and hurt his own party.

One of Joe Biden's promises in his 2020 presidential campaign was that he would restore strong U.S. leadership abroad and rein in the chaos that Donald Trump had unleashed in the international order.

But if you take a look at the Middle East right now, Biden hasn't done a very good job of fulfilling that pledge.

Under Biden's watch, the Middle East is growing less stable. In the past few weeks, Israel has begun a new war with its invasion of Lebanon, against the public wishes of the Biden administration. Iran has fired around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, the second time it has ever launched such a direct assault on Israel from its own land. Israel has since promised it will retaliate against Iran -- and that if the tit-for-tat continues for an additional round, strikes on Iran's nuclear sites are on the table. Meanwhile Israel's war in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks continues to rage with no end in sight. As a result of the instability, the price of oil is rising, and attacks on oil production in the region could cause it to surge more.

In other words, the Middle East is slowly inching toward breaking out into a full-scale regional war that could shake up the global economy, create a gigantic crisis in U.S. foreign policy and result in the deaths of countless civilians.

This is not good news for the Democrats as Election Day approaches: Just the rumblings of an imminent crisis or potentially surging gas prices could hurt the electoral appeal of Democrats, who are already suffering from their association with inflation.

The growing specter of wide-scale war in the Middle East is not some kind of approaching weather event or natural disaster. It is the product of choices. And our president has made some terrible ones that helped us get to this point. After Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, it was inevitable that Israel was going to retaliate. What was not inevitable was that the Biden administration would give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a far-right leader with neocolonial extremists in his Cabinet, carte blanche to retaliate against the entire population of the Gaza Strip however he wished to.

The Biden administration has appeared to use leaks and statements to suggest that it believes Netanyahu has gone too far in his brutality toward the civilians of Gaza, but in practice it has greenlighted all of Israel's actions. The Biden administration has been a staunch defender of Israel at the United Nations, shielding it from legally binding Security Council resolutions. It has given Israel billions in military aid. Aside from a brief, temporary and ultimately symbolic pause in arms transfers, Biden has not threatened to cut off aid, or even condition aid on Israel's compliance with international or U.S. law. The Biden administration, to keep weapons shipments intact under U.S. law, has reportedly ignored findings from the State Department and USAID that Israel had blocked U.S. humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Netanyahu's takeaway from Biden's support is that he can take U.S. backing as unconditional and do whatever he wants not only toward Palestinian civilians, but in the region more broadly. Netanyahu has embraced a ""shoot first, notify Biden later"" attitude toward many high-stakes and escalatory actions against adversaries in the Middle East, such as when Israel struck the Syrian headquarters of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, or when Israel leveled several buildings in Beirut in a bombing that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's operations in Lebanon -- against Biden's public wishes -- have already displaced close to a quarter of Lebanon's population and killed hundreds of civilians, according to PBS' NewsHour. And Netanyahu has demonstrated he feels no obligation to listen to U.S. calls to wind down the bloody military operation in Gaza, which is why Israel and Hezbollah have locked horns in the last year.

As Atlantic Council fellow Nicholas Blanford explained to me, Israel's escalation with its adversaries in the region increases the likelihood of a regional war. If, for example, Israel decides to entrench itself in a more wide-scale war in Lebanon, it could nudge Hezbollah to unleash its most destructive firepower, such as its precision-guided missiles that it has so far refrained from using. And if Iran were to fear that Israel is about to wipe out Hezbollah at some point, it could ""activate all [its] proxies across the region"" against Israel, dragging several other countries directly into the conflict.

We don't know exactly how Netanyahu would act if Biden were to condition or cut off aid to Israel. But given that U.S. military support is vital to Israel's national security and military operations, Netanyahu would be far more likely to behave conservatively in his military campaigns and targeted strikes across the region.

Netanyahu is aware that the timing of his more aggressive maneuvering comes at an acutely sensitive time for Biden politically. Biden is likely in the weeks before Election Day to be particularly hesitant to initiate an upheaval in U.S.-Israeli relations by cutting off weapons shipments or demanding that Netanyahu act like more of a cooperative U.S. ally. But at the same time Biden looks rudderless and weak by not doing anything.

When asked at a press conference Friday if he believed Netanyahu was trying to influence the U.S. election, Biden said, ""I don't know."" And when asked by another reporter, ""How long are you OK with Israel bombing Lebanon? What is acceptable to you?"" he smiled and walked away from the podium.

Biden has gotten himself into this bind through his record of unconditional support for Israel, no matter how badly it deviates from basic morality in warfare, international law or U.S. interests. One can't help but wonder if Biden's poor leadership in the Middle East might just mark a historic first: a president inadvertently springing an October surprise on his own party."
Opinion | The GOP is feeling the stress of Trump's anti-early voting stance,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-early-voting-election-day-rcna174284,2024-10-08T10:47:23Z,"Between disparaging early voting and cutting get-out-the-vote efforts, Donald Trump is making it harder to pull out a win in November.

The polls still show Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in a close race both nationally and in most swing states. With the results likely falling on a knife's edge, the deciding factor may well be which side is best able to drive voters to the polls. But if that's the case, Republicans are acting at a disadvantage that can only be ascribed to Trump himself.

Modern elections are more of an ""election month"" in many states, with early voting and mail-in ballots offering opportunities to cast votes long before Election Day. This was previously a nonpartisan issue, but things have been thrown into disarray for Republicans since Trump's 2020 re-election campaign. Democratic-led states in particular had moved to set up more ballot drop boxes, pre-emptively send out mail-in ballot request forms and otherwise help people vote safely in the middle of a pandemic.

Naturally, Trump quickly began falsely claiming that mail-in voting leads to mass voter fraud, a claim that formed the backbone of his attempts to overturn his loss that year and soured many of his supporters on early voting. No such mass fraud has ever been discovered, but that hasn't stopped Trump from periodically returning to the matter. There are times when he's managed to stop promoting conspiracy theories long enough to praise early voting -- but he always returns to old habits soon enough. Just two weeks ago, he told a crowd in Pennsylvania, a state he needs to win, that early voting is ""stupid.""

Republicans have begun to realize how much Trump's rhetoric is impeding their efforts to stockpile votes before polls open next month. ""The whole idea behind absentee voting is you're banking that vote, you've got that person, you know they're going to vote for you, you get them off the list,"" Republican strategist Mark Graul recently told Politico. ""This is how you get the extra 5,000, 10,000 votes that may decide the election.""

Rather than heed that advice, the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have focused on Election Day. An increased reliance on day-of turnout would be a risk any year, but especially given how Trump has bound the RNC's hands ahead of this election. Upon becoming the nominee this year, Trump decreed that the GOP should invest less in traditional get-out-the-vote efforts in favor of more ""election integrity"" programs.

The resulting cuts have led to outsourcing most turnout programs to outside groups, taking advantage of newly revised Federal Election Commission rules that allow increased cooperation between campaigns and super PACs. Those outside groups haven't exactly been impressive in their efforts, leading some battleground Republicans to question how effective they'll actually prove at getting people to the polls. For example, Turning Point USA, the group run by conservative activist Charlie Kirk, has told Semafor that its lofty goals for voter outreach had been narrowed to mostly focus on Arizona and Wisconsin.

The Elon Musk-backed group America PAC has shown the most promise so far, hiring veteran GOP operatives and spending more than $50 million on voter engagement this cycle. That money has gone into hiring hundreds of canvassers in swing states like Michigan and North Carolina. America PAC also on Monday put even more of Musk's money on the table, promising $47 for each registered voter recruited to sign a petition pledging support for the First and Second amendments, building out the group's engagement lists.

The Trump campaign, for its part, points to the unpaid ""Trump 47 Captains"" it's recruiting to prove it isn't fully giving up the GOTV game. ""Each volunteer initially receives a list of 10 neighbors to mobilize,"" The Guardian's Hugo Lowell wrote about the program, which offers campaign merchandise to those who hit their goals. ""If they meet that target, the next tier involves canvassing 24 out of 50 likely Trump voters, followed by canvassing 45 out of 100 voters, with new perks at each tier."" (If that sounds like the same framework as a multilevel marketing scam to you, don't worry, I'm right there with you.)

It's an idea also being pushed on a website called 10xVotes, which encourages conservatives to ""find 10 friends who don't vote."" The site, which is available in a few swing states, including Michigan and Arizona, appears to draw from voting records to allow users to search for registered Republicans nearby to ""claim"" for contact. It's unclear who exactly owns 10xVotes, which has been pushed by the likes of former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's ""War Room"" podcast.

The Trump campaign appears to be working off a theory wherein if it can't win over the swing voters that Harris is also courting, it can draw out the sort of ""low propensity voters"" who propelled him to office in 2016 -- for example, the cringeworthy push to court young, white males, the kind who feel disaffected but love the hypermasculinity offered on right-wing podcasts and in the MMA ring. One major issue with that strategy: These are also exactly the voters who can't be counted on to turn out on Election Day without frequent contact.

Taken together, Republican operatives aren't feeling especially confident about the ground game that's in place in key states. As National Review's Noah Rothman has noted, the efforts are looking more like 2012 GOP candidate Mitt Romney's doomed initiative than President Barack Obama's dominant GOTV program that year. Other candidates might be thinking about shifting where their funds are going to offset those worries.

Not Trump, though, not when he's ready to blame a failure to win enough votes on what Axios described as a ""detailed catalog of excuses for rejecting the results of the 2024 election -- if he loses."" The guarantee that this will be his response to a loss helps explain his overall nonchalance about getting people to their polling places. After all, it's much easier (and cheaper) to try to throw out Democratic votes than bother paying people to knock on doors."
Trump-supporting billionaires are enabling his white supremacist rantings,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-backing-billionaires-enabling-white-supremacy-rcna174186,2024-10-08T00:54:52Z,"Some of Trump's wealthiest backers say they like his economic policies, so they keep quiet about his racism and xenophobia.

According to polls, the top issue in this year's presidential race is inflation/the economy. But at Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, last week, there was just about no applause when he stated, ""We will end inflation and make America affordable again. We're going to get the prices down."" When did his audience explode with energy? When Trump gave them lines targeting immigrants, like ""On day one of my new administration, the invasion ends and the deportations begin. We get them out."" And, speaking of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, ""Do you trust her to stop the invasion?"" In response, the crowd loudly chanted, ""We need Trump! We need Trump!""

Regardless of what the polls say the top issue is, Trump knows that his rallygoers get most excited when he gives voice to white supremacy. Two weeks ago, at another rally in Pennsylvania, Trump claimed Black migrants were destroying the character of Springfield, Ohio, and then declared, ""You have to get them the hell out. You have to get them out!"" In response, the crowd delivered a bone-chilling chant: ""Send them back! Send them back!""

Over the weekend, Trump told Wisconsin voters that he ""will liberate Wisconsin and our entire nation from this mass migration invasion of murderers, child predators, drug dealers, gang members and thugs."" The facts don't back up Trump's claims of a migrant crime wave. (As Frank Figliuzzi noted in an MSNBC column Sunday, the feds just made a huge bust of a white supremacist gang trafficking in fentanyl.) But Trump doesn't care about facts. He cares about scaring his predominantly white base and then persuading it to see him as the guardian of white America.

We know exactly which immigrants Trump is talking about given his long history of demonizing Latino immigrants and the comments he made when he was president, when he referred to Black nations such as Haiti as ""shithole countries."" His supporters know that when Trump promises ""mass deportation"" -- one of the themes of this year's Republican National Convention -- he means Black and brown people.

Everyone understands what Trump is about. But for too long there has been a tendency to excuse Trump's wealthy supporters -- like Elon Musk, who appeared at Trump's rally on Saturday -- as being on the Trump train only for the tax cuts or other financial gain -- as Trump has explicitly promised them at big-ticket fundraisers. However, these wealthy and often well-educated people see the same headlines we do. They should understand that the most visible part of Trump's campaign is racism, and it's long past time they are called out for enabling Trump's racist agenda.

As Forbes magazine detailed in its article on Trump's top billionaires, some are outspoken, while some support Trump for unspecified reasons.

Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who posted after Jan. 6 attack that Trump should ""resign and apologize to all Americans,"" changed his tune in July when he announced he would endorse Trump. At the time Ackman wrote on social media, ""We are in the midst of a perilous moment for our democracy."" (Seeing Trump, who is facing criminal charges for attempting a coup and called for the ""termination"" of the Constitution, as a guardian of democracy is laughable.)

New York Jets owner Robert ""Woody"" Johnson said this year on Fox News that he is backing Trump again because ""Americans remember how good it was or how much better it was on the border and inflation and gas prices and grocery prices, all that, during the Trump administration, and they want to get back there."" The Winklevoss twins, famously depicted in the film ""The Social Network,"" about the founding of Facebook, donated more than $1 million each to support Trump, citing Trump's ""Pro-Bitcoin Pro-Crypto Pro-Business"" position.

But every one of these billionaires is telling us that in exchange for the policy goals they want, they are on board with or at least comfortable with Trump's bigotry. After all, if racism were a deal-breaker for them, would they still be funding his 2024 campaign?

Others, like Musk, though, appear to be more openly on board with Trump's extremist agenda. Musk has peddled the same types of bigoted attacks Trump has about Black migrants in Ohio, demonized DEI programs while suggesting white people are inherently smarter than Black people. And Ackman has been vocally critical of DEI programs with posts on X such as ""DEI is inherently a racist and illegal movement in its implementation even if it purports to work on behalf of the so-called oppressed.""

Trump has become the head cheerleader for white victimhood and the defender of symbols of white power. This explains why on Friday he told supporters at an event in North Carolina he would rename the local military base to again honor the slave-owning Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg, who, as part of the Confederacy, fought to preserve chattel slavery.

""Should we change the name Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg?!"" Trump asked, and the crowd exploded with cheers. (The name of that base, like others that honored Confederates, was changed in 2020 when Congress overrode Trump's veto of the bill.) Trump vowed that if wins, he is ""doing it."" This syncs up perfectly with Trump's defense of monuments honoring white supremacy as ""beautiful"" when he was president.

Those who claim that they're supporting Trump for his promises of tax cuts or deregulation don't get a pass when he's using such racist language and promising to carry out racist policies. If a candidate campaigning on white supremacy is elected to the presidency again, they won't be able to evade accountability with the claim that that's not why they supported him.

""I think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country,"" Trump told Time magazine in April. He is reportedly planning a second-term overhaul of anti-discrimination law that his allies say would ""dramatically change the government's interpretation of Civil Rights-era laws to focus on 'anti-white racism' rather than discrimination against people of color."" And as the American Civil Liberties Union has recently warned -- citing the mandates of Project 2025 -- if Trump wins there will be a dismantling of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs because he and his supporters have characterized them as ""anti-white racism."" Indeed, 84% of his supporters are worried about ""anti-white"" discrimination.

Trump isn't hiding his bigotry. In fact, it's the cornerstone of his campaign. And if he's returned to office, then everybody who helped him get there is responsible: those who voted for him because of the white supremacy and those who say they had other reasons but didn't treat the white supremacy as disqualifying."
Harris attacked MAGA misogyny head-on in 'Call Her Daddy' interview,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-interview-alex-cooper-rcna174337,2024-10-07T21:05:54Z,"The Democratic presidential hopeful's appearance on the popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast was a clear rebuttal to Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. And Harris pulled no punches.

Kamala Harris sat for an interview on the popular podcast ""Call Her Daddy,"" for an episode that was released over the weekend. The podcast, helmed by host Alex Cooper, is known for being particularly popular with young women.

The interview was part of the Democratic presidential campaign's ongoing strategy of using sit-downs with nontraditional media sources to spread its messaging to targeted groups. Harris recently did an interview on ""All the Smoke,"" a sports-focused podcast known for its popularity among men of color. On Tuesday, she will be interviewed by Howard Stern, a longtime shock jock with a large male audience.

Trump also has gone on a tour of nontraditional media, though his podcast-heavy schedule has seemed structured almost entirely to shore up his support with men (albeit in some pretty juvenile ways). Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview was the antithesis of that.

Where Trump and his movement have embraced the chauvinism of the 19th and 20th century and obsessed over ""tradwives"" -- women defined by their roles as homemakers and caretakers -- the Democratic candidate spoke to the podcast's massive audience of women and encouraged them to define themselves.

Harris said her mom had taught her and her sister ""the importance of us being able to express how we were feeling,"" that they ""had agency"" in how their lives played out, and that they ought to ""figure out how you can take charge of a moment.""

When Cooper asked Harris about Trump's thinly veiled sexist attacks, in which he has called her ""crazy, weak, fake and dumb,"" the VP replied: ""I think it's really important not to let other people define you.""

At one point, the conversation shifted to the crisis of domestic and sexual violence against women. Cooper said many of her listeners have described the shame and the terror they feel about coming forward, but Harris -- a former prosecutor -- told listeners not to ""quietly suffer"" and advised them to ""tell someone that you trust.""

And when Cooper asked about how we can make the country safer for women, Harris did an effective job of explaining how women's economic independence factors into the equation. She said:

This narrative about empowering women economically runs counter to the GOP's attack on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that can assist women in the workplace.

Harris also spoke about the impact of abortion bans, describing the harrowing reality of women who are forced to travel out of state to receive reproductive care -- assuming they even have the money and means to do so.

And she attacked conservatives' arcane view of women when asked to address Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' claim that Harris ""doesn't have anything keeping her humble"" because she does not have biological children. (The vice president, of course, has two stepchildren.)

""I don't think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble,"" Harris said of Sanders. ""Two, a whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life and children in their life, and I think it's really important for women to lift each other up.""

The interview was essentially a message to young women that they don't have to accept the MAGA movement's restrictive roles for them -- and that the Harris campaign supports them leading more self-determined lives."
Ali Velshi: Why a future hurricane season with Trump in the White House should worry you,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/hurricane-helene-florida-damage-fema-trump-project-2025-rcna174351,2024-10-07T20:44:50Z,"In a second Trump administration, the desperately needed resources Americans depend on after major weather events could be gone.

The Southeast is bracing for Hurricane Milton, with the massive storm expected to make landfall in Florida on Wednesday. Residents there are still reeling from Hurricane Helene, which tore across the same region just days ago, killing at least 227 people and becoming one of the deadliest storms of this century. The worst of the damage is in the Big Bend region of Florida, where the storm made landfall, and in western North Carolina, where the storm battered mountain towns and caused catastrophic flooding that destroyed whole neighborhoods in and around the city of Asheville.

In response, the Biden administration has deployed hundreds of active-duty National Guard members along with Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, personnel. But instead of focusing all of their energy on disaster response and recovery as FEMA is meant to do, the agency, local governments and the Biden administration are currently fighting rumors, misinformation and conspiracy theories about FEMA's activities.

There are so many conspiracies about FEMA right now that they have set up a ""rumor response page"" to try to curb the spread of falsehoods. Like, for instance, the completely made-up lie, which Donald Trump himself has been pushing, that the Biden administration is spending federal disaster relief money on housing and other assistance for migrants who are in the country illegally.

Now, what FEMA actually does is provide life-saving rapid response and relief after disasters, giving individual and public financial assistance to help communities recover after homes, belongings and public infrastructure are damaged or lost. It also runs the National Flood Insurance Program, which provides one of the only comprehensive flood insurance options in the country.

Unsurprisingly, Project 2025 has another vision for the future of American disaster preparedness. Under the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for the next conservative administration, FEMA would be gutted.

On page 135, its authors suggest, ""Privatizing ... the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program, reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government, eliminating most of DHS's grant programs.""

It also recommends that Congress change the cost-sharing agreement so the federal government only covers 25% of costs for small disasters, with the cost-sharing reaching a maximum of 75% for ""truly catastrophic disasters."" That would likely leave poorer states and communities out to dry, unable to fully recover from disasters.

Additionally, Project 2025 recommends raising the per-capita threshold, a threshold used by FEMA to determine whether a disaster has caused enough damage to qualify for federal assistance. Along with knee-capping FEMA's assistance programs, the blueprint suggests eliminating the Small Business Association Disaster Loans completely.

Looking deeper into Project 2025, it becomes clear that, taken together, the mandate's policy proposals would wreak havoc on communities trying to get through major weather events and other disasters.

If anything, Hurricane Helene has highlighted areas that need to be bolstered. We need to continue to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure. We need to continue to invest in understanding the ways in which our communities are vulnerable to these increasingly likely major disasters.

Project 2025 risks undermining our ability to measure climate risks at all. Instead of understanding the threats to our communities, instead of preparing for these events, Project 2025 aims to dismantle the agencies we rely on for climate and weather-related information, like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, The National Weather Service and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Without trustworthy, robust climate data and regulatory oversight, it will be much harder to future-proof our communities against the rising threats of worsening natural disasters like flooding, storms and wildfires.

Combined together, Project 2025's proposals to dismantle these agencies will mean that we will know less about natural disasters and our vulnerabilities to them. We'll be less prepared for those disasters when they happen, and our communities will likely get less help to deal with the aftermath.

Rather than taking a proactive approach to the threats of climate change, rather than facing the risks before us, rather than equipping ourselves with good information and readily helping impacted areas rebuild with resilience in mind, Project 2025's proposals would force our heads in the sand. It would put the most vulnerable communities at greater risk with less information and would leave us with less help on the other side of catastrophe."
"Katie Phang: As questions swirl over Trump's mental fitness, is Vance ready to be president?",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/vance-25-amendment-trump-presidency-rcna174325,2024-10-07T20:08:02Z,"In some ways, vice presidents are like understudies; you may never need them to step into the breach but they're there just in case something goes wrong.

And as we inch closer to November's election, I want you to consider this: If elected, Donald Trump -- who is currently 78 years old, regularly frequents McDonald's, and loves his Diet Cokes -- would end his second term as the oldest person ever to serve as president of the United States. On the final day of his presidency in January 2029, Trump would be 82 years, seven months and six days old.

The former president's rambling, meandering speeches on the campaign trail have led some mental health experts to go on the record, raising concerns about his potential cognitive decline. Despite these concerns, Trump refuses to release even the most basic information about his health.

So what happens if Trump wins in November and then, days, weeks, months or years into his presidency, dies or becomes incapacitated and can no longer serve? Well, according to Section 1 of the 25th Amendment, in that event, the vice president would become the president automatically.

To state it plainly: Sen. JD Vance is a heartbeat away from the presidency of the United States. The same Vance who, right now, has poll numbers labeling him the least popular vice-presidential candidate of the 21st century -- unsurprising given his many extremist views on everything from child care to the truth of who won the 2020 election. I mean, not admitting your running mate lost the last election is a huge red flag that you have an issue with the truth.

During last week's vice-presidential debate, Vance got caught in another lie. The senator claimed he never supported a national abortion ban. However, in 2022 while he was running for the Senate, Vance said on a podcast he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally.""

Then there's his extremist stances. Also during that 2022 run for the Senate, Vance delivered a 30-minute speech titled ""The Universities are the Enemy"" at the National Conservatism Conference.

""I think if any of us want to do the things that we want to do for our country and for the people who live in it, we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country,"" the then-candidate told the crowd. ""Ladies and gentlemen, the universities do not pursue knowledge and truth, they pursue deceit and lies, and it's time to be honest about that fact.""

Now, in my opinion, the best way to pursue a good and fulfilling life is through education, but it seems Yale-educated Vance wants to overhaul the education system in his image. Under Project 2025, a Trump-Vance administration could eliminate the Department of Education, privatize K-12, and dismantle the current collegiate system.

He's a threat to everything Americans hold dear: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And if something were to happen to Trump, the big job would go to Vance: the guy who refuses to acknowledge that Trump lost the 2020 election, promotes anti-immigrant hate rhetoric, and supports a national abortion ban.

And let's be clear, 40-year-old Vance is fully aware that Trump is 78 years old. You're kidding yourself if you think he didn't consider Trump's physical and mental health issues when contemplating his career advancement and upward mobility prospects as the Republican VP nominee.

So, before you cast your ballot in this year's election, you should remember this: Any vote for Donald Trump is a vote for a potential automatic JD Vance presidency. Vote accordingly."
Ayman Mohyeldin: How Elon Musk went from Trump critic to 'Dark MAGA' cheerleader,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/elon-musk-donald-trump-butler-rally-endorsement-rcna174314,2024-10-07T18:21:09Z,"The man once seen as a real-life Tony Stark will now be known as the man who traded in his reputation and self-professed principles to bend the knee to Trump.

Two years ago, when billionaire Elon Musk bought what was once called Twitter, he vowed to keep it a nonbiased platform. In fact, that was his mission statement. Just days after purchasing the platform, Musk said, ""For Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally.""

It was a message he repeated frequently in interviews after purchasing the platform. ""The goal of new Twitter is to be as fair and even-handed as possible. So not favoring any political ideology,"" Musk told Fox News. But that quickly turned out to be a hollow sentiment.

Instead, Musk used his immense influence on his own platform to tell his followers to vote for Republicans in the 2022 midterms. He also voiced his support for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the Republican presidential primary.

But there was one prominent Republican whom Musk wasn't a fan of: Donald Trump. Musk had previously said the former president was ""too old"" and that he should ""hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.""

As you can imagine, Trump didn't take to that advice very well. In 2022, during a rally in Alaska, Trump addressed Musk's comments, telling the crowd that Musk said he voted for Trump in 2016.

Trump escalated the feud when he took to his own social media website, Truth Social, and claimed Musk came to the White House begging for his help on his projects. ""I could have said, 'drop to your knees and beg,' and he would have done it,"" Trump wrote in 2022. The former president would also go on to savagely mock Musk's notoriously glitch-filled campaign launch for DeSantis on X.

But after the campaigns of Musk's preferred candidates, DeSantis and later Vivek Ramaswamy, went down in flames, the billionaire planned a spring trip to Mar-a-Lago. In March, he met with Trump, who just so happened to be seeking a cash infusion to help his campaign.

Afterward, Musk was asked about the meeting and if he'd donate money to Trump or then-candidate President Joe Biden. ""While I'll voice my opinion, I don't want to put a thumb on the scale monetarily that is significant,"" he told Don Lemon.

But by July, we learned Musk was already donating a sizable amount to a political group working to elect Trump. The day after that was reported, Musk publicly endorsed the former president following the attempted assassination of Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. Last month, Musk was asked about the impact of that endorsement and he did not respond to requests for comment.

That brings us to Sunday, when Trump took to the podium again in Butler, nearly three months after that failed assassination attempt. Except this time, Trump was joined by his friend Musk -- the same man who once proclaimed he would keep his social media platform politically neutral and the same man who once stated Trump wasn't the right candidate to lead this country.

""As you can see, I'm not just MAGA. I'm dark MAGA,"" Musk told the crowd. He then urged attendees to ""fight,"" and that Trump ""must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America.""

I'm not sure about ""dark MAGA"" -- I much prefer comedian Mike Drucker's interpretation: ""dork MAGA."" But let's take this moment in. What happened on that stage on Sunday in Butler will be the legacy of Elon Musk. The man once seen as a tech visionary, a real-life Tony Stark, will now be known as the man who traded in his reputation and his self-professed principles to become nothing more than a reactionary Lex Luthor in a MAGA hat."
"With focus on immigration, Trump laments those with 'bad genes'",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/focus-immigration-trump-laments-bad-genes-rcna174267,2024-10-07T15:25:31Z,"A year ago this week, Donald Trump complained about migrants ""poisoning the blood of our country."" Now, he's concerned about those with ""bad genes,"" too.

In the runup to the 2020 presidential election, Donald Trump campaigned in Minnesota and took some time to share some unscripted thoughts about genetics.

""You have good genes, you know that, right?"" the Republican told Minnesotans in late September 2020. ""You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes. Isn't it, don't you believe? The racehorse theory. You think we're so different? You have good genes in Minnesota.""

A Daily Beast report explained soon after, ""The 'racehorse theory' of genetics holds that some human beings are born genetically superior to others, and Trump has reportedly attributed his success to his genes.""

In the runup to the 2024 election, the former president has a similar message in mind. Raw Story reported:

The former president specifically complained, ""We got a lot of bad genes in our country right now.""

Alas, this isn't altogether new. As Time magazine reported around this time seven years ago, ""President Trump brags a lot about his genes. In interviews over the years, Trump has credited his genes for everything from his health to his success, and he's noted that his children and grandchildren will benefit from them as well.""

The New York Times and CNN have documented related patterns, which date back to 1988, when he told Oprah Winfrey that a person had ""to have the right genes"" in order to achieve great fortune.

Decades later, as Trump expects to return to the White House, he's apparently eager to get those with ""bad genes"" out of the United States.

The Republican has not elaborated on exactly which groups of people have ""bad genes,"" though the former president is on record saying he'd welcome more immigrants from countries such as Norway and Denmark -- which he considers to be ""nice"" countries.

It's against this backdrop that Trump continues to peddle anti-immigrant views with unsubtle subtexts. In fact, it was exactly one year ago this week when he first started using anti-immigrant rhetoric that echoed Adolph Hitler's ""Mein Kampf,"" complaining about those whom he believes are ""poisoning the blood of our country.""

After he started repeating the line with unnerving frequency, Trump was reminded in an interview that his language mirrored Hitler's. The GOP nominee shrugged with indifference.

Seven months later, the Republican who's long been fascinated with the ""racehorse theory"" of genetics is now complaining about immigrants with ""bad genes.""

It's quite a provocative move for a major-party nominee, burdened by a history of racism, just 29 days before Election Day."
"Ocasio-Cortez, Raskin demand answers from Chief Justice Roberts following NYT report",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/ocasio-cortez-raskin-supreme-court-alito-thomas-roberts-rcna174240,2024-10-07T14:11:49Z,"Unanswered questions about Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas linger as a new Supreme Court term begins.

The Supreme Court's new term starts Monday, with plenty of open questions about whether and how the justices will be involved in deciding the 2024 presidential election, as well as how they'll resolve a host of disputes over guns, transgender rights and much more.

But a letter sent Friday from House Democrats to Chief Justice John Roberts underscores open questions that still linger from last term about how the Roberts Court operates in deciding its biggest cases while under an ethical cloud.

The letter, from Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, cited a New York Times report from last month that said Roberts took over authorship of a Jan. 6-related opinion from Justice Samuel Alito after the Times reported in May that a symbol of the Stop the Steal movement flew outside Alito's home following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.

We already knew that Roberts authored the 6-3 ruling in Fischer v. United States, which narrowed obstruction charges against Jan. 6 criminal defendants -- including, potentially, Donald Trump.

But Alito having been initially assigned to write it was a new detail from the Times report last month. When he's in the majority, the chief has the power to assign who writes the opinion; otherwise, it's the senior-most justice. (NBC News and MSNBC didn't independently confirm the Times report, which was based on ""justices' private memos, documentation of the proceedings and interviews with court insiders, both conservative and liberal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because deliberations are supposed to be kept secret."")

The Times report suggested, but made clear it wasn't stating, that the change in authorship was due to its reporting on Alito, which prompted calls for the Republican appointee's recusal from Jan. 6-related cases (he declined). In any event, as I noted in the wake of last month's report:

Writing to the chief justice in their roles as ranking member and vice ranking member of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, Raskin and Ocasio-Cortez likewise observe that Roberts' reported maneuver ""suggests that you recognized that Justice Alito's partisan ideological activity called into question his impartiality with regard to the Fischer matter."" They continued:

The representatives posed a series of questions to Roberts, including (among others) whether he decided to replace Alito as the drafter of the Fischer opinion and whether he spoke with Alito or Thomas about their participation in Jan. 6 cases in light of legal requirements for recusal when judicial impartiality might reasonably be questioned.

Given his past refusals to cooperate with Congress, we shouldn't expect substantive answers from Roberts. But if he did take over the opinion from Alito for optics concerns, then that only makes things worse. The passage of time as we enter a new term doesn't change that."
Why Republican dodges about the 2020 election (still) matter,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republican-dodges-2020-election-still-matter-rcna174242,2024-10-07T12:54:48Z,"Like JD Vance, Speaker Mike Johnson refuses to acknowledge the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, saying it's irrelevant. He's mistaken.

House Speaker Mike Johnson's record related to the 2020 presidential election is plainly indefensible. As longtime readers might recall, it was the Louisiana Republican, for example, who helped spearhead an ill-fated effort to convince the Supreme Court to keep Donald Trump in power despite the voters' verdict -- shortly before he voted with his party to reject certifying the results of a free and fair election. Johnson also echoed some of the wilder conspiracy theories about the race

Nearly four years later, the far-right GOP leader still can't bring himself to say out loud that the rightful winner of the 2020 race was, in fact, the rightful winner of the 2020 race. The Washington Post reported:

Johnson refused to give a straight answer, saying only that ""this is the game that is always played by mainstream media with mainstream Republicans. It's a gotcha game.""

The House speaker was willing to acknowledge that President Joe Biden is, in fact, the president -- hardly a bold concession on the congressman's part -- but Johnson wouldn't say that the Democratic incumbent was the legitimate victor in the nation's most recent presidential election.

""When we're talking about the future,"" Johnson concluded, ""we're not going to talk about what happened in 2020.""

His party's vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, spent most of last week saying effectively the same thing, echoing the talking point again on Friday afternoon.

I suspect there will be some voters who might find this vaguely persuasive. With a critically important election four weeks away, why focus on the last election from four years ago? Why not focus on the near future instead of the recent past?

A few reasons, actually.

Right off the bat, credibility and accountability still matter. It's not as if Johnson, Trump, Vance, and their partisan allies have expressed some degree of regret or contrition for launching an unprecedented plot to overturn the results of a national American election. The more they refuse to acknowledge their own wrongdoing and alleged crimes, the less voters can trust them to honor future elections and the rule of law.

Relatedly, it's a mistake to see this question as inherently retrospective. Both members of the GOP's national ticket have refused to accept the legitimacy of the 2020 race. The same goes for the party's House speaker. Meanwhile, a CNN report noted over the weekend, ""At least 23 of this year's 51 Republican nominees for governor, state elections chief or the US Senate have rejected or contested the legitimacy of Joe Biden's 2020 victory over Trump.""

The line between the recent past and the present, in other words, is quite blurry.

But even if we put all of that aside, it's not ""the media"" that keeps talking about the legitimacy of the 2020 election; it's the Republican Party's national nominee.

""We won. We won,"" the former president declared as recently as Thursday. ""We did win. It was a rigged election. It was a rigged election."" A day earlier, Trump wrote on his social media platform, ""I didn't rig the 2020 Election, they did!"" pointing to a version of reality with no resemblance to our own.

What's more, as we discussed last week, the former president also refuses to say whether he'll accept the results of this year's contest. On a routine basis, he also falsely tells the public that his foes are cheaters and election results are suspect -- unless he says otherwise.

As NBC News reported, Trump has also begun referring to just about everything as ""election interference,"" evidence be damned, as part of a multifaceted effort to pre-emptively delegitimize the 2024 race, just in case he loses.

To hear the House speaker tell it, this entire conversation is unnecessary. Those who care about democracy should know better."
"What Trump's lies about Springfield, Helene recovery have in common",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-lies-springfield-helene-recovery-common-rcna174235,2024-10-07T12:14:01Z,"Local officials in Springfield, Ohio, pleaded with Trump to stop lying. He ignored them. With Hurricane Helene recovery, the same thing is happening.

It was roughly a month ago when Donald Trump and JD Vance started heavily promoting racist conspiracy theories about immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. The dangerous consequences -- bomb threats, closed buildings, canceled events, terrified residents, death threats, etc. -- soon followed. What's more, those consequences are still ongoing as the Republican Party's presidential ticket continues to lean into their lies.

But from a purely political perspective, one of the things that made the GOP's Springfield fiasco notable was the division within the party. In fact, while the Republicans' message at the national level focused on imaginary pet-eating thieves from Haiti, the Republicans' message at the local level was qualitatively different.

Springfield's GOP mayor and Ohio's GOP governor not only pushed back against the Trump-Vance lies, they also urged their party's candidates to stop deceiving the public.

About a month later, a similar dynamic is unfolding in the wake of Hurricane Helene.

Just as with Springfield, Trump has spent several days brazenly lying about the governmental response to the deadly storm. And just as with Springfield, the former president's lies are causing real on-the-ground harm. As my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim explained that officials are warning that the election-season lies and conspiracy theories ""are hindering relief efforts.""

After Trump's lies about Springfield were exposed, and local officials from his own party pleaded with him to be more responsible, the GOP candidate decided to keep lying anyway.

And after Trump's lies about the Helene response were exposed, and officials -- some Democrats, some Republicans, and some without any meaningful connection to politics at all -- also pressed him and his conspiratorial allies to be more responsible, the former president again decided to keep lying anyway, indifferent to the dangerous consequences.

Indeed, Clarissa-Jan's report ran on Saturday morning, the day after the GOP candidate kept up his disinformation campaign related to the hurricane relief efforts. Hours later, Trump, no doubt aware of the fact that his lies had been discredited, kept repeating the same false claims.

A day later, Trump pushed the same garbage. The day after that, he did it again.

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said in a written statement, ""The last thing that the victims of Helene need right now is political posturing, finger-pointing, or conspiracy theories that only hurt the response effort.""

That's true, but what Helene's victims ""need right now"" is of little interest to the Republican Partys presidential candidate: What matters to Trump with 29 days remaining before Election Day is Trump, not suffering families and communities.

The Charlotte Observer's editorial board added over the weekend, ""Shame on Donald Trump for worsening [the] tragedy with political lies."" Of course, if the former president were still capable of shame, he wouldn't be engaged in such indefensible antics in the first place."
Republican talking points on crime rates run into reality (again),MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republican-talking-points-crime-rates-run-reality-rcna173490,2024-10-07T10:31:22Z,"Why do Americans believe crime is getting worse, despite the evidence? In part because Republican officials keep pushing demonstrably false claims.

In recent months, Americans have received quite a bit of information about crime rates in the United States, and fortunately, pretty much all of it has been encouraging. As CNN reported, the news about crime so far this year looks heartening, too.

NBC News has confirmed the release of the data from the FBI.

To be sure, the current calendar year is ongoing, but there's reason to take the FBI data seriously: It's not only encouraging, it's also in line with similar research from the Justice Department and the Major Cities Chiefs Association, both of which published separate findings pointing to reduced crime rates.

If the good news sounds encouraging, it's not your imagination: It was nearly two weeks ago when the FBI also released more comprehensive data for last year, pointing to lower crime rates -- including violent and property crimes -- in 2023. NBC News' report on the FBI's findings added, ""The most serious crimes went down significantly: murder and non-negligent manslaughter were down an estimated 11.6% -- the largest single year decline in two decades -- while rape decreased by an estimated 9.4%.""

The same report added, ""Public perception of crime is often out of step with the facts, especially in the age of social media, ease of digital communications between neighbors and doorbell cameras, when Americans may be more aware of individual crimes than they would have been in the past.""

That's true, but we can also go a step further: Public perceptions are also often wrong because of one of the nation's two major political parties keeps telling Americans to believe a version of reality that's wildly at odds with the evidence.

Last week, for example, Donald Trump said anyone who believes the evidence presented by American law enforcement has ""a serious brain problem."" A week later, the former Republican president added that crime rates are ""through the roof,"" adding that ""only a stupid person"" would accept the evidence as real.

It's not that the GOP candidate has competing information or raised credible concerns about the process through which the data was collected. Rather, the evidence challenges Trump's assumptions, which in his mind, necessarily makes the evidence ""fake.""

But in Republican politics, the former president is hardly alone. Sen. Tim Scott recently told a national television audience that Americans are confronting ""a wave of violent crime that we have not seen literally in five decades."" The use of the word ""literally"" was a nice touch, but the South Carolinian was brazenly lying to the public.

Around the same time, House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York railed against Biden's ""violent crime crisis."" House Speaker Mike Johnson made similar comments, declaring, ""We can't survive the dramatic increases in violence, crime and drugs that the Democrats' policies have brought upon our communities.""

I'm reminded anew of a line in a recent Axios report that stood out for me: ""Polls show crime is a top concern ahead of the 2024 election -- and it's an issue where Republicans regularly edge Democrats. But falling homicide rates could take the steam out of the crucial GOP advantage.""

That's true; they could. That said, it's difficult to have confidence that they will.

Prominent Republican voices likely know that crime rates are falling. That apparently doesn't stop them from telling the public the opposite of the truth, working from the assumption that many voters will simply believe the falsehoods and never hear about actual crime data.

Circling back to our recent coverage, political campaigns have long followed some intuitive rules. Those looking to win tend to identify rivals' areas of weakness and focus attention accordingly. Similarly, candidates have also taken care to learn about their foes' strengths and steer their races away from those issues.

But crime offers a great example of how contemporary Republican politics rejects the intuitive rules for a different model. The evidence makes clear that the Democratic administration has a compelling story to tell: Crime rates, most notably murder rates, spiked toward the end of Trump's term. Under Biden/Harris, Americans are now safer.

Common sense might suggest that GOP officials would see the news and try to move the public conversation away from this area of strength for Democrats. But as it turns out, they find it far easier to effectively say, ""Why don't we just make stuff up and wait for the public to buy it?"""
"On crime fighting, Trump flunks another test of self-awareness",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/crime-fighting-trump-flunks-another-test-self-awareness-rcna173709,2024-10-07T10:31:12Z,"As Donald Trump pitches himself as a ""crime fighter,"" the election-season message might be more effective were it not for the Republican's rap sheet.

A couple of months ago, Donald Trump complained that Americans are ""living in a Pro Criminal Atmosphere."" Around the same time, he declared with confidence, ""You're not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal."" A day later, the former president echoed the line at an unrelated event.

""A criminal is a criminal,"" the Republican nominee said. ""They generally stay a criminal, and we do not have time to figure it out.""

About a month later, the GOP candidate's campaign spokesperson said he ""believes anyone convicted of a crime should spend time behind bars.""

Evidently, Trump and his team aren't quite done failing this rather obvious test of self-awareness. At an event in Milwaukee, for example, the GOP candidate claimed, ""Kamala [Harris] and Joe [Biden] are crime creators. We are crime fighters.""

Hours earlier, the former president pushed the same line via his social media platform, except he put the message in all-capital letters and added an exclamation point (he loves exclamation points).

All of this might be a more effective election season pitch if Trump weren't a criminal.

This need not be complicated. As recently as May, a jury found Trump guilty of 34 felonies. This is not to be confused with a different jury finding Trump liable for sexual abuse or the case in which a court found that Trump oversaw a business that engaged in systemic fraud.

He's also still facing several dozen other pending felony counts, across multiple jurisdictions. (He has pleaded not guilty.)

What's more, the former president has also surrounded himself with other criminals. ""With Lincoln, they had a team of rivals,"" presidential historian Douglas Brinkley recently noted. ""With Trump, you have a team of felons.""

In case that weren't quite enough, during his failed presidency, Trump had a habit of issuing scandalous pardons to politically aligned criminals. And if elected to a second term, the Republican has promised to issue even more pardons to politically aligned criminals, including those who violently clashed with police officers.

With this in mind, as the former president boasts that he and his team ""are crime fighters,"" it's probably worth reminding the Republican operation that a little self-awareness goes a long way."
Dems take a newfound interest in Ted Cruz's and Rick Scott's races,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dems-take-newfound-interest-ted-cruzs-rick-scotts-races-rcna172684,2024-10-07T10:31:05Z,"It's not a secret that Senate Democrats are on the defensive this cycle, but the party is eyeing a new offensive in Texas and Florida.

It's not exactly a secret that Senate Democrats are on the defensive this election cycle. The party currently has a one-seat majority in the chamber, but with Sen. Joe Manchin retiring in West Virginia, Republicans have, for all intents and purposes, already flipped one seat.

As we discussed last week, to secure a majority, Republicans will need to win only one additional seat, which is hardly unrealistic: Democrats are having to fight tooth and nail to hold on to competitive seats in Montana, Ohio, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Maryland. To have a chance of a 50-50 split in the Senate, Democrats would have to win literally all of those races, some of which are being held in states where Donald Trump is all but certain to win easily.

And so, the party is on the defensive. But what if the map could grow? The conventional wisdom suggests every incumbent Senate Republican is all but certain to win re-election, but what if the conventional wisdom is wrong?

The Washington Post reported over the weekend that a ""small but vocal number"" of Senate Democrats believe the party is leaving potential pickup opportunities on the table, and are ""pushing party leaders and political operatives to pour money into trying to knock off GOP incumbents.""

And not just any Republican incumbents.

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has finite resources, and it doesn't want to see any of the party's incumbents lose due to lack of investment. That said, Axios reported that Democratic leaders are telling their party's biggest donors that their perspective is evolving.

This isn't just scuttlebutt from unnamed partisan operatives: Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the current chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, confirmed to Axios this week that the races in Florida and Texas ""are real and we hope to get resources into those states.""

The report added that airtime hasn't yet been officially booked in the race against Rick Scott, though ""Democratic sources tell us they expect the DSCC to make a splash in Florida in the coming weeks.""

All things considered, it'd be overstating matters to describe the Senate races in Texas and Florida as among the nation's most competitive, but this shift in focus isn't rooted in pie-in-the-sky optimism.

Revisiting our recent coverage, Cruz barely won a second term in 2018, and this year, Rep. Colin Allred looks like a candidate with plenty of crossover appeal. It was against this backdrop that Chris LaCivita, a senior campaign adviser for Donald Trump, wrote via social media two weeks ago, ""What the hell is wrong with the Senate race in Texas?""

LaCivita added that, as far as he's concerned, it's ""time to get some real professionals in to save"" Cruz. Implicit in the message, of course, is that Cruz needs saving.

Meanwhile, Florida's Scott -- who has won three statewide campaigns by incredibly narrow margins -- last month started dumping quite a bit of his own money into his re-election campaign. What's more, a handful of recent statewide polls have shown former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell trailing the far-right incumbent by 5 points or less, raising Democratic hopes of a possible upset.

In case that weren't quite enough, there's Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska, a Republican who was widely seen as a shoo-in for re-election -- up until very recently.

There is no Democratic nominee in the race, but independent Dan Osborn -- best known for having led a labor strike at a Kellogg's plant in 2021 -- appears to be faring better than expected.

How do I know that for sure? In part because of fresh polling showing Osborn within striking distance, and in part because Republicans are starting to target Osborn with attack ads, and if he weren't picking up support, they wouldn't bother spending money in one of the nation's reddest states."
Opinion | Texas and Florida are too big an opportunity for Dems to pass up,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/senate-texas-florida-democrats-cruz-scott-rcna174071,2024-10-07T10:26:25Z,"With the path to maintaining their Senate majority narrowing, Democrats are going on the offense against Sens. Ted Cruz and Rick Scott.

Democrats can look at Florida and Texas in a couple of ways. From one angle, the states are both places where victory has been just out of reach -- a tantalizing ""what if?"" From another, they offer an unlearned lesson in heartbreak, a constant loop of Lucy yanking the football away from Charlie Brown at the last second.

For now, the former point of view is winning out as Senate Democrats look to hold on to their slim majority. A new wave of money and interest has begun to pour into Florida and Texas as polls show tightening races and Election Day fast approaches. And with incumbents like Republican Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas as their targets, it's not hard to see why Democrats see going on the offense as a risk worth taking.

The electoral map was never a good one for Senate Democrats this cycle, forced to defend far more seats than their Republican counterparts. With the GOP set to claim a seat from retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., the upper house is already starting from a 50-50 split. The odds for Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., pulling off an upset in his now deep-red state have continued to narrow, forcing Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to look elsewhere for a path to a majority. And that road requires knocking off at least one of the two least likable members of the GOP caucus.

Things are looking tight in Texas again this time around, with Democratic Rep. Colin Allred closing in on Cruz. Most polls still have Cruz ahead by around 3 points, but an outlier run by Morning Consult had the congressman up by 1 point. That's still within the margin of error, but the numbers have galvanized Democrats' hope that the state might be a jump ball. Accordingly, the Cook Political Report shifted the rating in that race from ""likely Republican"" to ""lean Republican"" on Tuesday, reflecting Allred's momentum.

Cruz at least is extremely aware of his own vulnerability. He roared into the Senate in 2012 and quickly made a name for himself as a darling of the far-right tea party movement. But his bid for president in 2016 faltered and his first re-election bid in 2018 ended up a squeaker that he won by less than 3 points. In the last two years, as he's prepared to face voters again, Cruz has sought to refashion himself as a bipartisan moderate, a hard task when you've built your whole brand on being a provocateur and ideological bomb-thrower.

Scott, on the other hand, hasn't bothered following Cruz's lead in playing for the middle (despite winning his seat that same year by just 0.1 points). Instead, the first-term senator is angling to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., at the top of the GOP caucus and take the title of majority leader, if all goes according to plan. But his time at the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee during the most recent midterms wasn't exactly a wild success, nor was his bid to pounce against McConnell last year.

Former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell isn't faring quite as well against Scott as Allred is against Cruz, but she is gaining traction. Five Thirty Eight's polling average has Scott up by 4 points, which is half of the lead he held over the summer. Mucarsel-Powell has also been set on making the race into a referendum on reproductive rights. In doing so, she's hoping to draw enough support from the abortion amendment on the ballot to negate any benefit Scott could get from riding former President Donald Trump's coattails.

The optimistic view is that each contest could be won with either more dedicated discipline from local Democrats or greater resources and attention from the national party. But recent history has shown that neither is a guarantee of success. Cruz's challenger in 2018, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, was popular both locally and nationally, seen as a real contender at finally winning a statewide race in Texas after a more than 20-year drought for Democrats. Likewise, former Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., transformed her race in 2022 against Sen. Marco Rubio into a national referendum on the GOP, but neither managed to unseat their opponent.

Those two races raised -- and spent -- a jaw-dropping amount of money in the process. O'Rourke's campaign drew in a staggering $80 million, the most a single U.S. Senate candidate has ever raised. Demings managed to raise almost as much for her race, considerably outspending Rubio in the process. This year, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced in late September that both Mucasal-Powell and Allred will get support in the form of a multimillion-dollar ad buy in their states, but the DSCC has yet to disclose exactly how much is going to each candidate.

The two biggest unknowns in these races are factors outside of the individual candidates' control: infrastructure and demographics.

Florida was once the biggest swing state in the country but has shifted to the right in the last decade, producing blowout wins for the GOP in the 2022 midterms. It doesn't help that the Democratic Party there has been a bit of a mess, if we're being honest, which has left a vacuum for Trump to fill in his new home state. And Scott, who has already spent $8 million of his own money in this race, is sure to keep shoveling in cash to offset the DSCC's investment.

Conversely, Texas is deep Republican territory that Democrats have spent the last decade trying to transform into a purple state. An influx of people into the Austin and Houston metro areas has come with a boost in liberal voters. A major question mark hovers over how the state's Latinos wind up voting this year, as the GOP has been making major inroads with border communities. Meanwhile, Texas' Republican attorney general has been cracking down on voting rights, potentially alienating Latinos in the process.

With less than four weeks to go, this is not an ideal scenario for Democrats. There's plenty of reason for cynicism in the face of these odds and so many prior disappointments. But with this much on the line, there's little choice but to square up and take a running start at that football again. Better to land flat on your back than be left wishing you'd taken the chance at dispatching the likes of Scott and Cruz."
Court officers receive threats after election-denying former county clerk sentenced to prison,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/tina-peters-sentenced-judge-threats-rcna174152,2024-10-06T11:49:31Z,"The threats received by the judge and court staff follow a pattern of public officials facing a surge of harassment and threats in recent years.

A Colorado judge has been getting multiple threats after he sentenced an election-denying former county clerk to prison for orchestrating a security breach to further a conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Tina Peters, a former Mesa County clerk, was sentenced to nine years behind bars for providing unauthorized access to the county election system to someone associated with MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell, a Trump supporter who has falsely claimed that voting machine companies rigged the last presidential election.

Will Sightler, the court executive for the 21st Judicial District in Colorado, said in a statement Friday that the court has been ""receiving threats and compliments regarding Judge [Matthew] Barrett's sentencing of Tina Peters."" The Mesa County Sheriff's Office told The Associated Press that law enforcement is reviewing those threats and has provided increased security at the courthouse as a result.

Considered a hero to election-denying conspiracy theorists, Peters was convicted in August on three counts of attempting to influence a public servant; and one count each of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty, and failing to comply with the secretary of state. After the verdict, she continued to espouse false claims about the election on social media and on Steve Bannon's podcast.

Peters was handed her lengthy sentence in a hearing on Thursday after Barrett excoriated her for her crimes, saying she used her position as a county clerk ""to peddle snake oil"" and to chase fame.

""Your lies are well documented and these convictions are serious,"" Barrett told her, adding that the damage she caused was ""immeasurable.""

""I'm convinced you would do it all over again if you could,"" he said. ""You're as defiant a defendant as I've ever seen.""

Officials did not provide details on the number or nature of the threats made against court staff. But the threats follow a pattern of public officials reporting a surge of harassment and threats in recent years, reflecting a deeply polarized society and the embrace of violent rhetoric by prominent politicians -- most notably Trump -- against their political rivals."
Opinion | MAGA-friendly centrists are yada yada-ing over Trump's threats,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-politically-tribeless-maga-centrists-yada-rcna174109,2024-10-06T11:49:30Z,"Even after everything that's happened (and could happen), a lot of ""politically tribeless"" commentators are still making excuses for Trump.

In a classic ""Seinfeld"" episode, George Costanza's new girlfriend abbreviates her dialogue by saying ""yada yada yada,"" often eliding the most pertinent parts of a story. George adopts the habit, too, and he and his girlfriend end up yada yada-ing over ""little"" details like criminality and an untimely death. It's hilarious and patently absurd -- the conversational equivalent of burying the lede in journalism.

This is what a lot of self-identified heterodox political commentators do when they talk about former President Donald Trump. You can see it often on ""Real Time With Bill Maher"" panels, hear it on any number of ""politically homeless"" podcasts or read it daily on scores of Substack sites. These ostensible independents view ""the establishment"" -- which includes everything from centrist Democrats to anti-Trump conservatives to non-right-wing media -- as the true threat to freedom and the American way. They might concede Trump's vulgarity is distasteful or that he's sometimes incompetent and often incoherent, but when it comes to confronting his incorrigible criminality, corruption, racism and misogyny, and his relentless dishonesty on matters both trivial and existential, they typically yada yada past the gory details and pivot into pathological whataboutism and both-sidesism.

In just the past 30 days, Trump has helped whip up a racist, xenophobic furor against Haitian immigrants in Ohio based on lies; suggested that people who criticize Supreme Court justices should be imprisoned; and mused that police should be allowed free rein to commit wanton violence on retail thieves over the course of ""one real rough, nasty"" day. I could list so many more of his outrageous, inexcusable words and deeds, but it wouldn't matter.

Yada yada to all that, Trump's useful centrists will argue. Only the humorless, Trump Derangement Syndrome-afflicted could possibly take the former president's rhetoric seriously: ""That's just Trump being Trump, shooting from the hip, flying off the handle, being funny in his uniquely Trumpian way that triggers the hated establishment.""

Last week, Judge Tanya Chutkan released special counsel Jack Smith's 165-page brief laying out evidence that he says shows Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election was a private matter and not in the capacity of a sitting president. (The Supreme Court ruled this summer that a president acting in his or her capacity as president is essentially immune from prosecution.) It's all there: Trump knew he lost the election very early, but Smith's filing says he engaged in numerous criminal acts to overturn it anyway. Smith's brief says he also encouraged the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, refused pleas from his own staff to call for calm, and after being told by an aide that Vice President Mike Pence's life was in danger thanks to his own instigations, he reportedly replied, ""So what?""

As I've previously written, if Trump hadn't ever given his riot-inciting speech on the Ellipse on Jan. 6, he still attempted a self-coup through alleged fraud, intimidation and threats of violence. But high-profile MAGA-adjacent ""independents"" have spent the past four years yada yada-ing away the whole thing as an unfortunate and brief act of mob violence. Some have even suggested it might have actually been a trap laid by Democrats.

So don't expect to hear anything louder than throat clearing about the Smith brief (if even that) from Trump's useful centrists. They're still having a fit over Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz's stupid, discrediting lie about being in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests (he was most likely in Nebraska at the time).

As someone who is actually without a political tribe -- in that I don't neatly fit into any ideological box and feel no need to carry water for either party -- I've concluded that Trump is, by leaps and bounds, the greater threat to American democracy and rationality.

And yet, I still say go ahead and nail Walz on his lies. Make him squirm. Hold Vice President Kamala Harris' feet to the fire on any of her untrue or misleading statements, too. Make all power-hungry politicians feel uncomfortably accountable when they mislead the public.

And then look back at Trump. On the ledger of politicians' falsehoods, do statements like Walz's mistruths about whether he was in China 35 years ago (he claims he ""misspoke"") even remotely measure up to Trump's attempted self-coup or his racist incitements against immigrants?

At the vice presidential debate last week, Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, refused to answer the direct question of who won the 2020 election. You'd think a true political independent -- no matter how much they're triggered by the ""woke"" or the ""establishment"" -- would see Vance's nonanswer as a craven cop-out, given how thoroughly adjudicated the legitimacy of the 2020 election has already been. But not if you're Free Press columnist Abigail Shrier, who lamented during the debate, ""Dear Lord, more January 6 questions?!""

Heaven forfend a candidate for the second-highest office in the land, whose running mate tried to steal the previous election, be asked about it. We nonpartisans really ought to just move on, I guess.

Many anti-anti-Trumpers yada yada'd through 2022's Jan. 6 Committee hearings -- where remarkable video evidence and testimony from ex-Trump White House officials (including Trump's own daughter) and other Republicans laid bare Trump's grand conspiracy to overturn a free and fair election. Trump and his allies have also spent the past four years plotting to do it again -- and thanks to state-level election overhauls and a sympathetic judiciary, they're much better equipped to do so now. Also poisoning the discourse are pro-Trump billionaires like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, who publicly spread the fiction that Democrats are cheating -- already, they say -- to win the 2024 election. Axios recently reported, ""Through public remarks, Truth Social screeds and more than 100 preemptive lawsuits, Donald Trump is assembling a detailed catalog of excuses for rejecting the results of the 2024 election -- if he loses.""

Yada yada yada, Walz lied about parts of his biography.

I used to think Trump-sympathetic nonpartisans suffered from a failure of imagination. Ever since Trump's escalator descent in 2015, warnings that Trump could do unthinkable things (like try to steal an election he lost, then preemptively discredit the next one) have been dismissed as the panicked bleatings of basic establishment Chicken Littles.

But Trump is a known quantity in 2024. He was president. He's been the GOP nominee three consecutive times. He's been convicted of felonies and found liable for sexual abuse. He's threatening to use the Department of Justice to jail his political rivals.

At what point do Trump-sympathetic independents think it's OK to take Trump at his word when he promises to do horrible things -- like once again pre-emptively attempting to overturn an election based on nothing?

To be clear, I'm not here to police anyone's political preferences. It's perfectly respectable to be a nonpartisan who thinks Harris and Democrats are worse. But you can't credibly make the case that Dems are worse by blithely waving away Trump's most egregious offenses.

I've unequivocally criticized left-wing excesses and liberal threats of censorship, as well as Biden's and Harris' records. And yet, I'm reminded of the late legendary libertarian humorist P.J. O'Rourke, who despite leaning right his entire adult life, explained his vote for Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016 on the basis that ""she's wrong about absolutely everything, but she's wrong within normal parameters.""

Yes, you can reject political tribalism and still choose a side in an election. But if your criticisms of Trump, MAGA and Republicans are rare, trivial and half-hearted -- and you denounce Trump opponents (including those exiled from the center and the right) as TDS-afflicted liberals -- you're not politically tribeless and you're not fearlessly independent. You've got a tribe; it's Trump's, and you're a reputation sanitizer for his presidential campaign."
Opinion | How the DOJ's major takedown of a neo-Nazi group contradicts MAGA's worldview,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/peckerwoods-gang-indictments-fentanyl-rcna173853,2024-10-06T11:49:11Z,"A significant component of America's crime problem is made up of hardened, U.S.-born criminals who traffic in the drugs, guns and violence plaguing our country.

The federal indictment of 68 defendants accused of being members of (or being associated) with a criminal gang driven by race-based hate followed an investigation that led to the seizure of Nazi paraphernalia, including Adolf Hitler posters, and 97 pounds of fentanyl, federal officials said Wednesday. U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada, who announced the charges, called it one of the ""largest takedowns in the history of the Department of Justice against a neo-Nazi, white supremacist, violent extremist organization."" That announcement landing in the final weeks of a presidential election prompts us to contrast the facts of our crime problem with the fiction that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, would have us believe.

The dismantlement of the group that called itself the Peckerwoods, a San Fernando Valley arm of the notorious Aryan Brotherhood white supremacy organization, came in the form of charges for alleged racketeering, firearms trafficking, drug trafficking and financial fraud. If convicted as charged, some members, who adorn themselves with tattoos of swastikas and other hate symbols, could face life behind bars. The group was so heavily armed and so violent that the FBI deployed its elite Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, to support the arrests. According to the U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, the Peckerwoods, a derogatory name historically used against white people, ""has as its mission to plan attacks against racial, ethnic, religious minorities.""

Agents seized an arsenal of illegal guns, ""bomb-making components"" and dozens of kilograms of fentanyl, methamphetamine and heroin, according to law enforcement officials.

The details of this multifaceted investigation reveal a significant component of America's crime problem: hardened, U.S.-born criminals who traffic in the drugs, guns and violence plaguing our country. This contrasts with the fact-free fearmongering fabrications being sold to MAGA believers. It's not that minorities don't commit crimes; nor is that migrants never murder or rape. But Trump and Vance want voters to believe our gun, drug and violence problems are being driven by migrants when the opposite is true.

Take Trump's claim that Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua took over an entire apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado. It's a scary story, but it's not true. Just ask Aurora's police chief. Facts be damned, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott fell in line with Trump and claimed a hotel in El Paso was taken over by Tren de Aragua, which he declared a foreign terrorist organization. Again, it's a frightening scenario, but it's devoid of evidence.

During the vice presidential debate, Vance claimed the vast majority of illegal guns used in crimes here come from Mexican cartels. The truth is quite different; it's the U.S. that's arming Mexican cartels. We have detailed data demonstrating the extent to which American weapons are fueling the violence in Mexico, right down to the make and model of the guns found at crime scenes across the border.

Continuing their ""migrants are criminals"" mantra, Trump and Vance repeatedly make false claims about Haitian migrants eating household pets and bringing diseases to Springfield, Ohio, lies that officials including the local police chief and Ohio governor have forcefully refuted. There's no evidence that Haitians are harming the people of Springfield, but there is evidence that the U.S. is exporting violence to Haiti in the form of black-market guns found in the hands of gang members who have wreaked havoc on Port-au-Prince. The U.S. is spending millions to help Haiti battle gang violence, while most of the weapons those gangs have are from the U.S.

In Tuesday's debate, Vance implied undocumented migrants are responsible for smuggling fentanyl into the U.S., a problem he blamed on what he characterized as the Biden-Harris administration's weak posture on border security. The truth is that almost 90% of fentanyl enters the U.S. through legal ports of entry, transported by people who have a legal right to be here. Almost half of them are Americans. Importantly, recent indicators show a fentanyl supply shortage in the U.S., an encouraging sign that Biden's efforts to counter the drug flow from Mexico and put pressure on China to stem the manufacture of precursor components may be working.

There's no clear evidence that migrants commit crimes at any higher rate than U.S.-born citizens. In fact, we'd be hard-pressed to prove that undocumented migrants pose a greater crime threat than those 68 white supremacist gang members who, according to this week's indictment, were part of a major California criminal enterprise.

The Trump-Vance falsehoods about crime are a cornerstone of their strategy to win votes through fear. The reality is that crime in the U.S. has continued to drop through the last six months. The latest FBI crime report shows that murders in the period from January to June dropped 23% from the same period in 2023, while violent crime fell 10% and reported rapes decreased by 18%. Aggravated assaults during that period decreased 8% year over year, according to the data, while robberies fell 14% and reported property crime was down 13%. The murder rate fell at the fastest rate ever last year, and shows no sign of stopping.

At a recent campaign event in the Detroit area, Trump said of the majority-Black city, ""You can't walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. You get shot, you get mugged, you get raped."" The Detroit police chief begged to differ and invited Trump to walk the streets with him. Trump won't do that, of course, because the sight of people in Detroit walking around without fear wouldn't fit his narrative. Sadly, you likely won't hear Trump or Vance talk about the takedown of a white supremacist criminal enterprise in California or denounce what that gang stands for. That's why it's on us to separate fact from fiction, and reality from their ticket's reckless disregard for the truth."
Trump's conspiracy theories about Hurricane Helene are hurting relief efforts,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-hurricane-helene-conspiracy-theories-relief-rcna174141,2024-10-05T19:21:05Z,"The spread of misinformation about the storm's aftermath has been staggering, in large part due to the Republican presidential nominee's attempts to politicize the disaster.

As emergency relief agencies scramble to respond to the devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene, Donald Trump and his allies have pushed conspiracy theories about the federal response that officials have warned are hindering relief efforts.

""STOP this conspiracy theory junk that is floating all over Facebook and the internet about the floods,"" North Carolina state Sen. Kevin Corbin, a Republican, wrote in a post on Facebook. ""Example: FEMA is stealing money from donations, body bags ordered but government has denied, bodies not being buried, government is controlling the weather from Antarctica, government is trying to get lithium from WNC, stacks of bodies left at hospitals, and on and on and on ... It is just a distraction to people trying to do their job.""

The spread of misinformation about Helene has been staggering, in large part due to the Republican presidential nominee's attempts to politicize the disaster. In the past week, Trump has falsely claimed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has no money for disaster relief because its funds were spent on ""illegal migrants,"" and that Vice President Kamala Harris ""stole"" FEMA funds for undocumented immigrants to encourage them to vote for Democrats. He baselessly accused the administration of ""going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas"" -- a move he himself was reported to have considered as president, due to the state's Democratic leanings, after wildfires devastated California in 2018. Trump also claimed that President Joe Biden had not spoken to Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, one of the hardest-hit states, an assertion that Kemp himself disputed.

Those lies have been amplified by the likes of billionaire Elon Musk, professional conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and the scandal-plagued GOP nominee for North Carolina governor, Mark Robinson. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a staunch Trump ally, also alluded to a ludicrous conspiracy theory that Hurricane Helene was a man-made weather event -- a claim rooted in antisemitic conspiracy theories, as my colleague Ja'han Jones has pointed out -- in a purported attempt to influence the election against Republicans.

Disaster relief organizations and lawmakers from Trump's own party are urging people to stop spreading unsubstantiated rumors about relief efforts. The American Red Cross issued a statement disputing false claims about its response, saying such misinformation ""disrupts our ability to deliver critical aid and affects the disaster workers who have put their own lives on hold to assist those in need."" FEMA even resorted to launching a misinformation page on its website to debunk rumors about its Helene response.

The White House slammed the conspiracy theories about Helene recovery efforts in a memo on Friday, saying that Republicans are spreading ""bald-faced lies"" and using the tragedy ""to lie and divide us."""
Trump: Vow to put a Confederate general's name back on Army base is 'secret to winning',MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-fort-liberty-confederate-general-fort-bragg-rcna174136,2024-10-05T17:29:05Z,"Trump has a history of defending monuments and institutions that honor Confederate figures.

Donald Trump said he will revert the name of a North Carolina military base back to its prior name honoring a Confederate general, and suggested his pledge to do so will lead to ""winning absolutely"" in the election.

Speaking at a town hall in neighboring Fayetteville, Trump said that if elected, he would change Fort Liberty's name back to Fort Bragg, after Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg, who enslaved people and is widely regarded as one of the worst and most loathed generals of the Civil War.

""I think I just learned the secret to winning absolutely and by massive margins. I'm going to promise to you, as I said at the beginning, that we're going to change the name back to Fort Bragg,"" Trump told the crowd, before referencing a person who had been booed after identifying as an ""active-duty soldier at Fort Liberty.""

""Because I think when that word gets out -- I just see this great-looking soldier just accidentally said 'Fort Liberty,' and he got almost booed the hell out of the place,"" Trump added.

The base was renamed alongside eight other installations that honored Confederate soldiers after a recommendation from a congressional commission in 2022. In one of his final acts as president, Trump vetoed a military spending bill that included a provision to rename those nine military bases. Congress later overrode his veto.

Trump has a history of defending monuments and institutions that honor Confederate figures. He has publicly opposed the removal of Confederate statues and repeatedly praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, endearing himself to white supremacists, whom he has refused to condemn.

But the former president has also long denigrated military officials and military families. Over the summer, he accused the military's highest ranks of being ""woke"" and threatened to fire them if elected. At the end of his town hall on Friday, he agreed with a former Air Force pilot's suggestion to create a panel to keep out ""woke generals."""

The hateful lie pushed by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating their neighbors' pets not only endangered those migrants, it also led to an Ohio sheriff three hours away threatening citizens who show support for the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.

In a Sept. 13 Facebook post that he later claimed ""may have been a little misinterpreted,"" Portage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski suggested tracking ""all the addresses of the people who had [Harris] signs in their yards"" so that ""when the Illegal human 'Locust' (which she supports!) Need places to live...We'll already have the addresses of their New families...who supported their arrival!""

There's no misinterpreting the racism in that post, described to me by the county's NAACP president as ""vile and egregious."" There's no excusing the lie from the sheriff that Springfield's Haitians -- who are there as part of a federal humanitarian program for migrants -- are here illegally. On top of that, referring to human beings as pests (ravenous pests, at that) has preceded too many global atrocities for Zuchowski's hateful statements to be excused.

And that's before we get to heart of the matter, which is that Zuchowski veered into unconstitutional territory with the suggestion that residents lawfully expressing a political opinion warrant law enforcement's attention. Zuchowski's defense -- that he has a ""First Amendment right"" to post what he did -- is doubly offensive. His status as a public servant ought to come before his desire to express his opinion, and his post made his constituents afraid their government would be monitoring their constitutionally protected expression of speech.

Zuchowski, who has declined to speak to NBC News and multiple media outlets, took down his post after the Portage County NAACP and the League of Women Voters complained to the Ohio secretary of state, and as the Ohio ACLU was gearing up to sue him. But if Zuchowski succeeded in making people afraid that he and his deputies are watching their political activity, it seems unlikely that his deleting the post is enough to make them breathe easy.

On its face, the story out of Portage County, where I happen to have multiple loved ones who vote, is evidence that a malignant lie about an innocent immigrant population metastasized into a threat against innocent citizens hours away. But it's also part of what appears to be a larger campaign from conservatives to bully everybody else into political inactivity or silence.

In Florida, voters who signed a petition that put that state's abortion referendum on the ballot cried foul at being questioned by Gov. Ron DeSantis' election police unit. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton executed search warrants against members of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), one of America's oldest Latino civil rights groups, about two weeks after LULAC endorsed Harris' presidential campaign. He says he was investigating ""allegations of election fraud and vote harvesting"" in 2022. The Republican National Committee's so-called ""Protect the Vote"" project aims to recruit people from the suburbs to monitor the polls in urban Democratic strongholds, which it has falsely declared are hotbeds of voting fraud.

""I've never felt less protected and more scared than I do right now,"" a resident of Ravenna, Ohio, wrote Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. At least 59 residents complained to Yost's office, the paper reported. Zuchowski ""has made me feel unsafe in my home of 24 years,"" a Kent resident said.

Portage County NAACP President Renee Romine said at the emergency meeting her organization held about Zuchowski's post that there were ""people almost in tears"" and ""not wanting to go to the voting polls"" because Zuchowki's office provides security for in-person absentee voting. ""People did not even want to go and vote if they were going to be there.""

The county's board of elections voted to remove the sheriff's office from that security role, which Romine described as a ""big win for the people."" But to Freda Levenson, the legal director of the ACLU of Ohio, the win was Zuchowski removing the offending post.

""We were going to ask a federal judge to make him take down his post. So as soon as he took down his post, we no longer had anything to ask for,"" she said. ""He backed down, which is what we wanted. Not just what we wanted, it's what the Constitution required him to do.""

But what the ACLU counts as a win may be cold comfort to Portage County voters. He made a post about monitoring who's supporting Harris. There's no reason they should believe that his being forced to take the post down has been accompanied by any change of heart."
Opinion | Striking dock workers just set an example for all working folks,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dock-workers-strike-sent-powerful-message-bosses-workers-rcna173849,2024-10-05T11:58:58Z,"Dockworkers strike on a picket line outside of the Port of Houston Authority in Texas on Oct. 1.Brandon Bell / Getty Images

On Tuesday, dockworkers went on strike, shutting down ports across the East Coast and Gulf Coast to demand higher wages and a guarantee that automation won't be used to throw many of them out of work. It was a massive demonstration of the power of working people to grind the gears of the economy to a halt by simply refusing to show up.

The bosses caved in record time. Both sides agreed to a tentative deal Thursday. The dockworkers will return to work in exchange for a 62% pay increase over the next six years. That's a very good thing.

What's alarming is that even as the workers were being demonized by right-wing media outlets like The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, many liberals were fretting that the economic chaos resulting from foreign goods not coming into American ports would cost Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris the election. Even some otherwise left-of-center journalists were criticizing the workers for having the audacity to strike or even calling on President Joe Biden to force them back to work.

Naysayers had argued that the workers were greedy. As they saw it, dockworkers already made more than enough money. Others argued that by blocking automation, the workers were standing in the way of progress. Many observers said that collective bargaining is all well and good within reasonable limits, but shutting down this much of the flow of goods coming into the country was too much of an economic disruption to be allowed.

All of those arguments missed the mark by a mile. The only structural power the working class has in a capitalist system is the power to disrupt the economy by withdrawing its labor. That's the entire point of union organizing.

In this case, the union members stuck to their guns and won. Their victory is a victory for everyone who has to sell their working hours to a boss to make a living.

There were breathless headlines about dockworkers who make ""six-figure salaries,"" but those were about the top earners. As Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pointed out in his statement of solidarity with the striking workers, the average income for these workers is $60,000 a year, with ""many East Coast port workers mak[ing] as little as $20 an hour -- the same wage that a fast food worker in California currently makes."" And loading and unloading cargo ships is demanding work, often involving very long hours. The idea that these workers are overentitled clashes jarringly with these basic realities.

There's a much bigger problem, though, with the idea that striking dockworkers didn't deserve support because they already made good wages. That argument assumes that labor activity is just a way of procuring charity for workers who are poor and desperate enough to need it. That's exactly the wrong way to think about it. The labor movement exists to give the working-class majority of a society a say in what goes on at the workplaces where they spend half their waking hours and some input into how the profits created by their hard work are divided up. It imposes some small measure of democracy on the economy. The more that happens, the more everyone who works for a living benefits.

Every dollar that doesn't reach the pockets of workers pads the profits of already wildly profitable companies. The ocean carriers have made record profits in the last few years: $400 billion since 2020. Meanwhile, the dockworkers whose labor does so much to produce those profits are actually making 12% less than they were two decades ago, when adjusted for inflation. Why should the bosses hoard the benefits of the industry's success? If some dockworkers make more money than you do at your job, then why should your conclusion be that the dockworkers are greedy and not that you should organize with your co-workers for a better deal?

It's all too easy to think of corporate CEOs and shareholders raking in money as the inevitable order of things and working people trying to get a bigger piece of the pie as an imposition. Similarly, we just take it for granted that advances in automation will be used to throw some workers into unemployment while the ones lucky enough to keep their jobs have to work as hard as ever as they see their employers' profits skyrocket.

But that's not the only way things could work. Imagine that these companies were collectively owned by the workers themselves. In that scenario, labor-saving technology could actually be used to save labor for everyone. Workers could all work shorter hours for the same income, spread the work that still needs to be done by humans more thinly among themselves and give themselves more time to spend with their loved ones.

In the world we live in, though, ownership and labor are separated, so bosses decide how automation will be implemented. This is a problem that's going to impact every corner of the economy as technology advances, and any workers who want to avoid being left in the cold at the end of the process need to be ready to follow the dockworkers' lead and draw a line in the sand.

And people who profess to be workers' allies need to take their heads out of the sand.

Lee Fang, a heterodox left-wing journalist I'd expect to be sympathetic to organized workers, assailed the dockworkers on the grounds that Biden has been a pro-labor president and the strike had the potential to ""cause crippling inflation only 1 month out from the election."" He said this ""might take the cake"" as an extreme example of ""self defeats of organized labor.""

Dylan Matthews of Vox went so far as to call for Biden to invoke Taft-Hartley, a notorious piece of union-busting legislation passed in the 1940s, lest the dockworkers' strike ""cause inflation to come roaring back weeks before an election."" Matthews said ""you can support bargaining"" without tolerating the ""sabotage"" of the economy that would come from shutting down traffic at East Coast ports.

But what incentive are employers supposed to have to give concessions if workers can't back up their bargaining demands with a credible threat to walk off the job? That's the only way workers have ever been able to build real power.

As it happened, the bosses caved before the supply chain disruptions could cause inflation. Even if things hadn't worked out this way, though, it's disturbing that Matthews was willing to throw striking workers under the bus for the ""greater good."" If Biden had taken Matthews' advice, the ""pro-labor"" president using a union-busting law to shut down a major strike would have had demoralizing ripple effects throughout the rest of the organized working class.

Even if all you care about is Democrats winning elections, screwing over dockworkers would still have been a bad idea. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is already being supported by a higher percentage of union households than any other Republican candidate in the last 40 years. A Democratic president invoking Taft-Hartley to shut down a high-profile strike would likely only make things worse.

As Chris Isidore and Vanessa Yurkevich point out at CNN, if the union had continued to work under a contract extension, thus delaying any strike until after the presidential election, then they ""would have lost bargaining leverage"" by losing the chance to shut down the ports before the ""pre-holiday shipping season"" really got going. In telling the workers to throw away their best chance to win this massive pay raise to make sure Harris won, Fang and Matthews were essentially telling them not to take action themselves but to trust politicians to look out for their interests. But workers can't exert much influence on the political process if they don't start by building power for themselves where they work.

It's true that in many ways, Biden has been more pro-labor than recent presidents. But his record is more mixed than Fang suggests. He came into office promising to pass the PRO Act, which would make it easier for workers to organize unions, but it hasn't passed and never seemed to have been a high priority for his administration. And two years ago, in a situation much like this one, Biden invoked the Railway Labor Act to prevent a major rail strike. It's good that this time around he did the right thing -- he told reporters that he didn't ""believe in Taft-Hartley"" -- but these blotches on his record show the limits of trusting politicians to be benevolent toward workers.

While Republicans are certainly worse on labor issues, the sad fact is that the working class has relatively limited influence in both parties. There's no way to change that more basic reality without building a bigger and more militant labor movement, one that's not afraid to flex its muscles at times that might be inconvenient for others.

And if you work for a living, then that's exactly what you should want to happen."
Opinion | JD Vance claimed Democrats are censoring the internet. He's lying.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-claim-democrats-censoring-conservatives-rcna173859,2024-10-05T11:58:51Z,"By Nina Jankowicz, expert on disinformation and democratization

During this week's vice presidential debate, Sen. JD Vance attempted to present Donald Trump's agenda to the American people in a gentler light. The Vance that voters have seen in his cable news and podcast appearances -- invoking ""childless cat ladies"" and asserting parents should have more voting power than nonparents -- was nowhere to be found. Instead, for much of the debate, Vance presented himself as a slick, Ivy League debater with an ""aw, shucks"" exterior.

But by the end of the night, that facade had disappeared, replaced with the extremely online right-wing zealot his public record shows him to be. When Vance was asked if he would seek to challenge the results of the 2024 election if he and Trump lost, he deflected. ""I believe that we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country,"" he said. ""It is the threat of censorship."" Vance later added, ""Kamala Harris is engaged in censorship at an industrial scale.""

If you were baffled as to why Vance chose to bring up ""industrial"" censorship at that moment, you're not alone. This answer wasn't for you -- or for most audience members. It was a flare to Vance's followers, who for years have been told that their right to free speech is under attack. Republicans (and some on the far left) have manufactured a crisis about a ""censorship industrial complex."" They argue that anyone who does research about rumors online, implements social media platform rules that protect safety and health, or talks about either of the above with public or private partners is engaged in unfair censorship.

The narrative that government, academia and the private sector have been supposedly colluding on a massive scale for years to suppress Americans' political opinions has grown from its roots on the fringes of the internet to the halls of Congress. This manufactured controversy preys upon genuine concerns: It would indeed be bad if the U.S. government were coercing social media platforms to remove speech. But its thin record relies heavily on scaremongering, context collapse and research mistakes that would make a grade schooler blush.

One example appeared in the debate itself, when Vance alleged to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, ""You yourself have said there's no First Amendment right to misinformation."" What he -- and the conservative influencers who made this old quote go viral over the summer -- didn't tell viewers was that Walz was speaking about misinformation in the context of voter intimidation and disenfranchisement, neither of which are protected speech.

That's just one example, but there have been many more across the years of this conservative fever dream. At the American Sunlight Project, of which I am a co-founder, we recently published an investigation unpacking these baseless claims. We found a clear and concerted pattern of ""information laundering,"" in which allegations that are light on facts migrate from online influencers to conservative political groups to lawsuits and congressional investigations. By falsely accusing researchers, governments and social media companies of censorship, these groups have successfully eroded public confidence in essential fact-checking and critical thinking processes before the fast-approaching 2024 election.

We are not the only ones who have highlighted that these claims lack evidence. At another point in the debate, Vance seemingly referenced a recent Supreme Court case in which Missouri and Louisiana alleged the Biden administration had coerced social media platforms to remove Covid falsehoods. ""Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?"" Vance asked. Apparently this Yale Law graduate is not current on his Supreme Court decisions; in June, the court threw the case out. In her opinion for the six-member majority, Trump-appointed Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote, ""The plaintiff cannot rest on 'mere allegations,' but must instead point to factual evidence.""

A new study on anti-conservative bias published in the journal Nature also casts doubt on the very premise of Vance's allegations. It found that while conservatives were suspended from Twitter more frequently than liberals, ""users who were pro-Trump/conservative also shared far more links to various sets of low-quality news sites -- even when news quality was determined by politically balanced groups of laypeople, or groups of only Republican laypeople -- and had higher estimated likelihoods of being bots.""

In other words, conservatives were more often sharing content that was likely to fall afoul of pre-existing policies, even as assessed by those with similar beliefs. We all agree to abide by social media companies' terms and policies when we sign up to share cat pics or political memes; the implementation of those policies is not ""censorship"" any more than a bar refusing service to shoeless patrons.

Beyond facts and policy, Vance's use of ""censorship"" is a signal to voters who have been told again and again that Democrats are communists, fascists or worse. His use of the term is easy shorthand to solidify an enemy. ""Censorship,"" apparently, is what Vance believes is a serious threat to democracy akin to an armed mob storming the Capitol. The difference between the two is that one of them actually happened."
Jack Smith's immunity brief wasn't the only important filing this week in Trump's case,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-fischer-jack-smith-immunity-brief-rcna174061,2024-10-05T11:58:40Z,"The GOP presidential nominee argued that yet another Supreme Court ruling -- Fischer v. United States -- could be used to curb his charges in the federal election interference case.

The big news this week in the federal election subversion case is special counsel Jack Smith's monster motion, which argues for why the Supreme Court's immunity ruling doesn't block Donald Trump's prosecution. But another new filing shows that immunity isn't the only thing threatening the case.

Two of Trump's four charges in his Washington indictment involve the obstruction charge. So it makes sense that his lawyers are citing the new precedent that's favorable to Jan. 6 defendants. To that end, they argued to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan:

To be sure, Trump's obstruction charges don't automatically go away after Fischer. The theory of the case against him is different from the narrower cases against rioters. He's accused of a broader scheme to subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election in a way that could still fit within Fischer even if rioters benefit from the ruling. Trump has pleaded not guilty.

Still, the Republican presidential nominee argues that not only his two obstruction charges but also his other two charges -- conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and conspiracy against rights -- should fall. His lawyers wrote:

It's safe to say this is an aggressive argument. But so was the immunity claim before the Supreme Court made it a reality, so we can never be sure until the justices weigh in. With that in mind, consider how Trump's lawyers frame the Fischer case against the backdrop of the last term's Trump-friendly trio of appeals on immunity, obstruction and clearing him to run for office again despite the Constitution's insurrectionist ban. ""The Supreme Court's decision in Fischer v. United States ... is yet another key application of the rule of law to reject lawfare overreach targeting President Trump,"" they wrote in Thursday's motion, citing the immunity and ballot eligibility cases.

To the extent that that language is meant for a legal audience, it might be more directed toward the justices who'll eventually review Chutkan's latest round of work -- that is, if Trump doesn't win in November and kill the case before it can go back up the appellate chain."
Jen Psaki: Liz Cheney goes to bat for Kamala Harris,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/trump-liz-cheney-kamala-harris-endorsement-rcna174114,2024-10-05T11:58:40Z,"This week, former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney made headlines by joining Vice President Kamala Harris on the campaign trail in Ripon, Wisconsin -- which is also the birthplace of the Republican Party.

Cheney joins hundreds of high-profile Republicans who have broken away from Trump to endorse the Harris-Walz ticket. Among these defectors is former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who recently declared ""Donald Trump and JD Vance cannot be trusted with the Constitution, cannot be trusted to uphold our rule of law, and cannot be trusted to enact responsible policy."" Hutchinson noted she was ""proud as a conservative to have the opportunity to vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in this election.""

But with just over 30 days to go before the election, what are all the other anti-Trump Republicans waiting for? Utah Sen. Mitt Romney has voiced concerns that Trump would target him and his family if re-elected. Former President George W. Bush has been castigated and attacked by Trump at every turn. Former Trump chief of staff John Kelly said that Trump ""has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law."" And when an aide told Trump that his Vice President Mike Pence's life was in danger on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump reportedly replied: ""So what?""

I am not saying it's easy to go against your own political party. Cheney knows that well, having been essentially excommunicated after a lifetime of loyal service. But as Harris put it during the Wisconsin event, ""There are many who know it is wrong, and then there are those who have the courage to speak out loudly about it and the conviction to speak truth.""

For Romney, Bush, Kelly and Pence, time is running out. If you don't speak up loudly now, you may lose your chance. And the history books will remember.

On Thursday, Judge Tanya Chutkan unsealed new evidence in the federal election case against Trump. The filing from special counsel Jack Smith's team argues there is ample evidence to convict Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, despite the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling this summer.

We'll be talking to Andrew Weissmann this Sunday about this new filing. Here's a sneak preview ahead of the interview:

What's new in this filing that we haven't seen before?

Direct evidence from Republicans who were in Trump's administration and campaign proving Trump's knowledge that he lost and intentional lies that he won, and efforts to undermine the presidential vote nonetheless.

How do you think this indictment will hold up under the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling?

Four justices already found that the state pressure scheme is not immune; it is very hard to see how there will not be one more vote agreeing with at least that part of the case going forward. But all of this assumes that Trump is not elected, because once in office he will simply order the DOJ to drop the case.

Some Republicans are claiming this filing represents ""election interference"" because it was unsealed so close to the election. Are you surprised by Judge Chutkan's timing?

Judge Chutkan is carrying out her responsibilities within the parameters dictated by the Supreme Court, after Trump prevailed there. I am not surprised she is fulfilling her duties without fear or favor to either side.

While Vance and Walz traded mild-mannered barbs onstage this week, the breakout star of the VP debate was Oakland University student and civics guru Marcus Johnson.

Johnson went viral for the impromptu ""civics lesson"" he gave post-debate at an OU watch party hosted by MSNBC's Jacob Soboroff, where he fact-checked Vance on the powers of the vice president, quipping that anyone who took high school civics should know the answer.

If MSNBC hosts have anything to do with it, this won't be the last time we benefit from Johnson's wisdom. Joy Reid already locked him in as a co-host for an OU town hall with Harris, should she accept. And you can find more of Johnson's insightful, fact-based commentary on his X profile, where he's rocketed to 27,000 followers (from just 100 before the debate).

Hurricane Helene has had a devastating impact on the Southeast, with at least 200 deaths and hundreds still missing. Hundreds of thousands of homes are without power, and many returning evacuees are finding their communities and homes destroyed, especially in North Carolina.

If you're wondering how you can help the communities affected, here are several organizations providing aid and accepting donations.

Chris Hayes: How the Trump campaign is gaslighting Americans,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-vance-lies-gaslighting-debate-fact-check-rcna174067,2024-10-05T01:12:38Z,"Sen. JD Vance lies with such ease that even sometimes when you're paying attention, you don't know you're being lied to and, frankly, it drives me insane.

Just take this moment from Tuesday night's vice presidential debate:

But that's just not true: The United States, under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, already produces more energy than any other nation on earth. Biden's Energy Department helped open the second of two nuclear reactors in Georgia in May. These were the first new reactors built in the United States in more than 30 years. And in July, Biden signed a bipartisan bill into law aimed at vastly growing domestic nuclear energy.

So, what do you call it when someone says the opposite of the truth? Let's just call it the Trump-Vance campaign: an entire political movement premised on Americans not believing their lying eyes and directing hate and rage at out-groups, rather than dealing with the thorny work of attempting to solve real problems with actual solutions.

Vance proved as much with his debate performance Tuesday night. He claimed there were 25 million unauthorized immigrants in the country, a made-up figure he's repeated often on the campaign trail. The actual number, experts say, is less than half of that. He then suggested Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, were ""illegal immigrants"" when they in fact hold protected status.

He falsely claimed that Mexican cartels were running guns across the border into the U.S. But everyone who covers the border knows guns flow from America, where they're readily available, to Mexico which has some of the strictest gun laws in the world. Vance also said crime, inflation and border crossings are up. The opposite is true; they are all falling.

But my favorite lie from Tuesday's debate was when Vance said -- in a manner so assured that I literally had a moment where I thought I maybe was missing something -- that Donald Trump spearheaded a bipartisan effort to save the Affordable Care Act.

Again, this just isn't true. In 2016, Trump ran on a promise to kill the ACA. And, as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, pointed out during the debate, Trump came within one Senate vote of succeeding in killing it.

Look, this isn't about two parties having good-faith disagreements on whether some policy will have the promised effects. It's about Trump and Vance gaslighting you into not knowing what to believe. Creating this alternate reality has become a central part of their campaign."
Marjorie Taylor Greene pushes baseless conspiracy theory that 'they' can control the weather,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/marjorie-taylor-greene-they-control-weather-hurricane-helene-rcna174107,2024-10-04T22:52:02Z,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is back to doing what she's best known for: spreading conspiracy theories.

The Georgia Republican, who infamously boosted a conspiracy theory about Jewish space lasers in 2021, seemingly tried to imply that Hurricane Helene was the product of someone -- an ominous but otherwise unidentified ""they"" -- who can control the weather.

Greene wrote on X late Thursday:

That grim warning followed a post earlier in the day with a map showing areas affected by Helene and their political leanings:

To state it plainly: The idea of weather-inducing technology that's powerful enough to generate a weaponized hurricane has been debunked by experts. (Is cloud seeding a thing? Yes, but that doesn't seem to be what's under discussion here.)

Greene didn't specify whether ""they"" are Jewish in this weather control scenario, but such claims about people nefariously controlling the weather have documented links to antisemitic conspiracy theories.

Together, Greene's posts certainly give the impression that she thinks Hurricane Helene was the result of some artificial technology to harm Republicans. Which is taking a claim that Donald Trump and others in the GOP have been making -- suggesting that federal agencies are deliberately denying aid to Republican residents and giving it to undocumented immigrants instead -- and really launching it into the stratosphere, so to speak. For the record, FEMA has denounced and corrected Trump's claims.

As my MSNBC colleague Steve Benen noted, Trump's lie is particularly egregious in light of new Politico reporting (which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News) that on multiple occasions as president, Trump ""hesitated to give disaster aid to areas he considered politically hostile.""

The only thing I'm worried about being projected into the atmosphere are Republicans' dangerous lies."
Opinion | Hurricane Helene's destruction is an urgent call to action for Harris,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hurricane-helene-trump-jd-vance-republicans-climate-change-rcna174085,2024-10-04T22:21:25Z,"By Henna Hundal, MD candidate at the Stanford University School of Medicine

When Hurricane Helene made landfall as a Category 4 storm last week, it ravaged the Southeast. The official death toll has surpassed 200, and many victims are still missing. Active-duty soldiers are descending across the region to disperse essential supplies, as residents grapple with billions of dollars in damages. The images emerging from the disaster, the flooded streets, collapsed homes, and debris stretching as far as the eye can see, are hard to bear.

What's also hard to bear is certain politicians' refusal to come to terms with a key driver of this disaster: climate change. Such was the case with Ohio Sen. JD Vance in Tuesday's vice presidential debate when he and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz were asked to comment on the harrowing fallout of Hurricane Helene and Americans' overwhelming desire for meaningful climate action.

""I think it's important for us, first of all, to say Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water,"" Vance meandered. ""We want the environment to be cleaner and safer, but one of the things that I've noticed some of our Democratic friends talking a lot about is a concern about carbon emissions. This idea that carbon emissions drives all the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true, just for the sake of argument, so we're not arguing about weird science.""

But Hurricane Helene itself is a grim reminder that the science, as ""weird"" as some may find it, cannot be ignored. What was striking about Vance's circuitous response is how he surgically bifurcated Hurricane Helene from climate change, addressing the two topics as if they're as distinct as apples and oranges. He also employed a strategic ""if-then"" construct, proposing what should happen if people believe that anthropogenic emissions drive climate change, but not personally accepting the premise as fact.

This muddled nonanswer comes on the heels of sobering findings about just how deeply the climate crisis and Hurricane Helene are connected. Early research from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory indicates that climate change may have increased the rainfall from Hurricane Helene by up to 50% in some locations. Other estimates suggest that climate change was a likely culprit for the storm's rapid intensification, as its winds became increasingly ferocious. These findings mirror wider trends. With sea surface temperatures ramping up, stronger storms are in store.

This most recent storm also opens a critical window for Vice President Kamala Harris to step in where Vance and Trump have so egregiously fumbled: In the month remaining before Election Day, Harris should lean into communications that underscore the public health threats arising from climate change. Not only are these threats acutely evident in the wake of Hurricane Helene, but this framing could also stir bipartisan coalescence around actually addressing the climate crisis.

A nationally representative study of registered American voters found that 69% trust their primary care doctor for climate change information, with 57% of conservative Republicans among them. In fact, conservative Republicans are more likely to trust the American Medical Association as a source on climate change than the Environmental Protection Agency.

Reconstituting climate change discourse as a matter of public health and safety taps into mutually aligned priorities. It serves as a powerful reminder that climate change is no back burner issue, but is already intertwined with voters' central concerns about their communities.

Vance's tap dance around this issue may align with his own political calculus, but it'll ultimately prove to be a misguided approach. As debate moderator Norah O'Donnell pointed out while posing the climate change question, a majority of young Republicans want to see climate solutions, too.

Public Health Emergency declarations were swiftly issued for the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida, as the profound health effects of the disaster began to manifest. While fatalities stand out as the most visible consequence and tend to be documented more consistently, the true public health toll runs far deeper.

The almost 100,000 residents of Asheville, North Carolina, could face weeks without clean water, heightening the risk of waterborne disease transmission. As of Thursday, power was still unavailable for almost 1 million customers across the Southeast. For people who need to refrigerate medications or use medical devices, a power outage can be deadly.

And this is to say nothing of how local health care systems become strained to their breaking points, of how hospitalization rates for substance use disorders rise, or of how post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health impacts linger well after the debris is cleared.

These are not mythical scenarios of a doomsday future. This is the present plight of life in a climate emergency.

Hurricane Helene has been the most devastating wake-up call about climate change in recent years. Vance, and Trump, demonstrate over and over that they deeply misunderstand how Americans tangibly, viscerally, feel climate impacts in a way that is gradually transcending party lines. Harris must not miss this critical moment to emerge as the unifying messenger we so urgently need."
Ask Jordan: Could the Supreme Court stop presidential immunity reform?,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-presidential-immunity-reform-rcna174051,2024-10-04T20:53:17Z,"""Deadline: White House"" legal reporter and former prosecutor Jordan Rubin answers your questions about the Supreme Court, Trump's trials and other legal issues.

""If Congress passes a law that says a president isn't immune from criminal acts committed in office, could the Supreme Court decide the law is unconstitutional even though there's nothing in the Constitution about it? Could it stand (assuming this partisan Court followed the law for a change)? Or does this horrible immunity decision make that impossible?""

Yes, the current Supreme Court could (and likely would) say that such a law is unconstitutional. While I agree with you that the immunity ruling in Trump v. United States was unfounded, the Supreme Court is nonetheless seen as the decider of constitutional meaning. With that in mind, the ruling takes issue with your premise that there's nothing in the Constitution about immunity, because the court framed its decision against the backdrop of ""our constitutional structure of separated powers.""

To be sure, there are situations where Congress can override a Supreme Court ruling by passing a law. If there's a decision about what a law means (as opposed to what the Constitution means), Congress can pass a new law addressing that ruling. For example, then-President Barack Obama signed into law the 2009 Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which overrode a 2007 case that was decided on statutory (not constitutional) grounds. The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had noted in her 2007 dissent that ""the ball is in Congress' court"" -- and Congress acted.

The political response to the immunity ruling highlights this reality. The background I laid out above is probably the reason that President Joe Biden's court reform support includes a constitutional amendment saying former presidents aren't immune from prosecution, as opposed to a regular law saying so. An amendment is of course more difficult to accomplish, though it has happened 27 times before -- with agreement of two-thirds of the House and Senate, plus three-quarters of the states.

More from 'Ask Jordan': What happens in Trump's cases if he loses the election? Does the public have a right to speedy trials against Trump? Is Trump really above the law?

Another long-shot way to overturn the immunity ruling is for the court to do so directly. Absent an unlikely change of heart by the current justices, that would hinge on a new court composition, which could take years to happen, if it ever does. The 2022 Dobbs ruling overturning 1973's Roe v. Wade was the product of a decades-long conservative legal movement push to remake the courts. Dobbs has likewise sparked a backlash, but whether it prompts a movement that remakes the Supreme Court remains to be seen. Without a similar movement in response to this era's rulings, we may be stuck with them."
Stephanie Ruhle: By all measures we have a strong economy. So why don't Americans feel that way?,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/job-report-inflation-economy-biden-rcna174092,2024-10-04T20:53:06Z,"The Biden administration woke up to some good news on Friday. The U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs in September, blowing past the 150,000 expected. Not only did September's numbers beat economists' expectations, but data from previous months were also revised upward and the unemployment rate fell from 4.2% in August to 4.1%.

This is good news. By almost all measures, we've got a strong economy, except for one thing that matters an awful lot: how Americans feel about it. It's a reason why Donald Trump continues to poll better among likely voters on handling the economy.

That feeling is largely frustration that prices are still too high. I'm not talking about the pace of inflation -- just the fact that everything seems to cost more.

Now, the administration and the Harris campaign point to all the recent positive economic news, but they don't always connect the dots to one reason behind those prices: the rise in wages.

Yes, price increases can be due to ""greedflation."" Corporations have held wages low for years while raising prices and pocketing big profits. Many businesses could increase wages and benefits without higher prices. That's why many politicians, including Vice President Kamala Harris, want to investigate and go after those engaging in price gouging.

However, a lot of workers -- especially lower-wage earners -- have gotten a raise in recent years. And when wages go up, prices likely do as well. We want lower-wage earners to be able to support their families, but if you're paying people who work at fast-food joints or pizzerias $20 an hour, then you're not likely going to get $1 menu items anymore, and you're not going to get a pizza that costs less than $20.

Here's an example: My son works at a deli and takes home $20 an hour for making sandwiches. When my mother rolls in to pick him up from work, she can't understand why the sandwiches are $22.

But it's not just about ""greedflation"" and price gouging. Employers are paying people more and it's going to impact all kinds of companies. And if employers pay their workers more, especially small business owners, it has to come from somewhere, and often that means raising prices for consumers.

Let's not forget, this increase in wages is also good news. Wage growth has been rising fastest for the lowest-wage workers. That's a good thing, even if it means we might have to pay a little more for fast food, pizza and sandwiches."
Opinion | The Trump Supreme Court is back for another term as Election Day nears,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-cases-2024-trump-deadline-newsletter-rcna174030,2024-10-04T20:52:53Z,"Welcome back, Deadline: Legal Newsletter readers. As if there isn't enough going on with Election Day just weeks away, the Supreme Court is starting a new term. Chief Justice John Roberts and company are coming off a term that featured (among other things) them giving Donald Trump broad criminal immunity and approving his latest presidential run despite his involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection.

A big open question heading into November is: Will the Republican-appointed majority find a way to put the Republican nominee back in office?

For a brief refresher on how this works: The court hears oral arguments in two-week sessions through April, issuing rulings on a rolling basis and usually wrapping up by late June. Sometimes, the justices stretch into July, as they did when capping off last term with the immunity case. They can also get emergency appeals at any time, which is how last-minute election challenges could reach them on the so-called shadow docket.

So, what legal mischief awaits, besides the election (a big ""besides,"" I know)? It's a developing story because the court adds cases as the term proceeds. The court just granted a bunch Friday, including one about gun-maker liability. Heading into the last term, the court hadn't yet added some of the most significant disputes, like the immunity appeal the justices took up in February. An example of another pending petition the court could still accept is former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows' bid to move his Georgia state election subversion charges to federal court; that would add yet another wrinkle to the already-hobbled case against Trump, Meadows and others.

But so far, some of the cases the justices are slated to hear involve transgender rights, ""ghost guns"" and a First Amendment challenge to a Texas law requiring age verification to access sexual content online.

The ""ghost guns"" appeal -- over regulating kits for making untraceable weapons at home -- will be heard Tuesday at the court that OK'd deadly bump stocks last term. Wednesday features an unusual capital case hearing from Oklahoma, where even the state says that death row inmate Richard Glossip should get a new trial because of prosecutorial misconduct. But instead of just ordering a new trial outright, the court that backed the Trump-era execution spree has appointed a third party to argue why Glossip -- who maintains his innocence -- should still be put to death. Even former Trump administration official Ken Cuccinelli thinks the court shouldn't force this execution.

On the election front, the court has already fielded some emergency appeals in recent weeks. The justices divided in partially backing Republican efforts to restrict Arizona voting in August, while last month unanimously rejecting third-party bids from Jill Stein and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be on the ballot in Nevada and New York, respectively. We'll be closely watching the beleaguered court -- which faces calls for reform -- as more voting-related appeals inevitably reach Washington in the coming weeks. While the justices declined to save Trump from his 2020 defeat, they're coming off an unusually Trump-friendly term.

The former president's four criminal cases make the election stakes very real for him. If he wins in November, he can dismiss his two federal prosecutions: the election subversion case in Washington and the classified documents case in Florida. The election case is back in the D.C. trial court, where U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is tasked with figuring out what the high court's vague immunity test means. The justices can review Chutkan's work again before any trial goes forward, which wouldn't happen until long after the election (that is, if Trump loses and can't kill the case). Smith is separately appealing U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon's documents case dismissal to a federal appeals court, where outside groups are calling for the Trump-appointed judge's ouster.

And finally, presidents can't pardon or dismiss state cases, but Trump's Georgia and New York ones could be even further delayed if he wins next month's election. The Georgia case is already tied up with a pretrial appeal over the defense bid to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Meanwhile, after Election Day, Judge Juan Merchan in New York is set to decide Nov. 12 whether the immunity ruling upends Trump's May guilty verdicts for falsifying business records. The GOP nominee's already-delayed sentencing is set for Nov. 26, but only if Merchan rules against the defense on immunity. Yet, even if Merchan rejects Trump on Nov. 12, the latest sentencing date is still uncertain, because the former president will likely launch an immediate appeal, potentially all the way to the justices.

So whether it's in the election, Trump's legal cases or both, the high court has multiple opportunities ahead to shape Trump's -- and the country's -- future."
Jack Smith pinpoints Trump's lies about noncitizens voting in federal elections,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/jack-smith-trump-noncitizens-voting-lies-rcna173958,2024-10-04T20:10:04Z,"Jack Smith's redacted filing in the federal election interference case includes evidence of Team Trump's lies about noncitizens committing voter fraud.

Special counsel Jack Smith's redacted briefing this week arguing Donald Trump isn't immune from prosecution in his federal election interference case takes direct aim at lies Trump and his allies have spread about noncitizens voting in federal elections.

Trump and the GOP have staked their election hopes this cycle in part on anti-immigrant fearmongering, and in particular, false claims that Democrats are bringing undocumented immigrants to the United States to have them vote illegally.

In reality, these plainly racist claims align with the ""replacement theory"" nonsense we've seen pushed by far-right personalities and referenced in mass shooters' screeds. And Smith's court filing takes direct aim at these claims. On Page 15, the filing references a White House staffer who allegedly overheard Trump tell family members that ""it doesn't matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell."" And in the next line, Smith's team explains how the Trump campaign's accusations about noncitizen voters were part of that strategy.

The proof, according to Smith's team, is that the Trump campaign's numbers kept changing.

According to the filing:

Each of the numbers listed comes with redacted footnotes that appear to reference when and where these claims were made. It seems like Smith has zeroed in on Trump's tendency to spew fake statistics to bolster his claims in public. And the filing suggests Smith intends to use that against Trump and his associates while blowing a hole in one of the most bigoted lies of Trump's 2020 and 2024 campaigns.

Joy Reid broke it down further on Thursday's episode of ""The ReidOut,"" in a segment with NBC News' Vaughn Hillyard. Check it out here:"
A Trump-backed Bible seems a suspicious fit for Oklahoma's narrow school text criteria,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-bible-oklahoma-schools-ryan-walters-god-bless-america-rcna174042,2024-10-04T19:57:19Z,"The superintendent wants Bibles in classrooms but outlined requirements that disqualify thousands in the market. But Trump's ""God bless the USA"" Bible is somehow tailor-made.

A mandate for Oklahoma public schools to teach the Bible in class went into effect in August amid sharp national criticism and opposition from local school districts. This week, Oklahoma's Department of Education opened bids for a contract to provide 55,000 Bibles for classrooms across the state, with criteria so specific as to exclude thousands of available Bibles -- but not Donald Trump's infamous ""God bless the USA"" Bible.

According to the state's specifications, the Bible must be in the King James version -- and must also contain the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance, the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. It ""must also be bound in leather or leather-like material for durability.""

As The Oklahoman points out, many -- if not most -- Bibles in the marketplace don't fit those criteria. But one that does tick all the state's boxes is a $60 Trump-endorsed ""God Bless the USA"" Bible, which began selling in March and from which Trump has made $300,000 in royalties, according to his latest financial disclosure from August. (A version with Trump's signature sells for $1,000.)

Another Bible that meets the criteria is a $90 ""We The People"" Bible, which Donald Trump Jr. promoted in late 2022.

Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters, the Republican who imposed the school Bible mandate, is a staunch Trump supporter. He endorsed Trump for president last year, saying that he was ""excited to see him dismantle the Department of Education.""

A spokesperson for the superintendent told The Hill that ""it would be inappropriate to comment while bids are being placed"" for a Bible supplier and described the process as ""open and transparent"" and ""consistent with the norms for state procurement.""

""There are hundreds of Bible publishers, and we expect a robust competition for this proposal,"" the spokesperson said.

Walters has come under fire for enacting a Christian nationalist agenda in Oklahoma's public schools through his position as state superintendent. Among other things, he has quashed LBGTQ rights in schools, pushed for book bans, denounced ""critical race theory"" (he said last year that teachers should tell students that the Tulsa race massacre was not about race), and appointed the creator of the far-right doxxing account Libs of TikTok to a state education committee.

Walters' mandate for Bible instruction in public schools, issued over the summer, drew massive outrage, and many critics called it blatantly unconstitutional. Several school districts have maintained that their educators will not teach the Bible in class. Walters has warned that he ""will use every means to make sure"" teachers comply, but it's still unclear how his office intends to enforce that requirement, since Oklahoma school districts set their own curricula.

When the Trump-endorsed Bible was announced in 2021, Paul Miller, a professor at Georgetown University, pointed out to The Washington Post one reason why many Bibles don't include additional texts like the Constitution: ""The Bible includes a passage in the Book of Revelation that says anyone who adds to the words of the Bible will be cursed, which leads many Christians to believe that adding anything to scripture would be blasphemous,"" Miller said."
Why Trump's odd complaints about Fox News' election ads matter,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-odd-complaints-fox-news-election-ads-matter-rcna174075,2024-10-04T18:25:35Z,"We've reached the point at which Donald Trump thinks Fox News ""shouldn't be allowed"" to air attack ads that he disagrees with.

At a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last week, Donald Trump went on an impromptu riff about one of his favorite subjects: Fox News.

""You ever notice on Fox, they put me on -- I do a great job -- and then they follow me with a horrible commercial,"" the former president said. ""Roger Ailes never allowed bad commercials. What's the purpose of me doing a nice show, and then they put nine horrible commercials on, which are all lies?"" he added.

Wrapping up his thought, the Republican concluded, ""Fox should put just the good people on the people that want to make America great again.""

This comes up with surprising frequency. This past weekend, for example, Trump complained that the network aired a speech from Vice President Kamala Harris. The Hill reported:

Fox, the GOP candidate told a Wisconsin audience, ""shouldn't be allowed"" to show the Democratic candidate's remarks.

A day later, he used his social media platform to argue that Fox News ""shouldn't allow negative Ads."" Though he didn't elaborate, I have a hunch he wasn't referring to attack ads aired by his own campaign. Trump added soon after that Fox should stop ""constantly putting on Liberal Democrats"" who end up ""nullifying"" conservative guests.

If all of this sounds at all familiar, it's because he made similar comments during his White House tenure. In May 2019, the then-president whined online that Fox was going too far ""in covering the Dems,"" referring to Democratic presidential candidates. Trump added that Fox News executives should instead prioritize ""the people who got them there.""

A Washington Post analysis added soon after that it was a remarkable sentiment because it was ""an explicit expression of his expectation that Fox News will at least play down coverage of Democratic issues and candidates, if not shut them out entirely.""

Quite right. As we discussed at the time, Trump was making clear that he saw Fox News, not as a news organization, but as a Republican entity, which exists to advance a Republican cause.

Indeed, the same week, the then-president insisted that if the network was ""putting more Democrats on than you have Republicans,"" than Fox News was necessarily straying from what Trump saw as its proper mission.

The Post's analysis added that Trump not only saw a ""symbiosis"" between the network and his political operation, the president also ""expects Fox News to box out anti-Trump voices in the name of staying true to a group he views as their shared base.""

That was five years ago -- and the Republican is still making the case that the network ""shouldn't be allowed"" to broadcast Democratic speeches that he doesn't like.

Complicating matters, Trump isn't making any effort to hide these sentiments. It'd be one thing if he whined to Sean Hannity during one of their private chats, but the GOP candidate is taking his complaints to the public, apparently in the hopes of pressuring Fox News into compliance with his electoral plans.

I can't say whether the network and its employees consider Trump's rhetoric insulting, but they probably should."
"Trump steps on Vance's message, clings to 'rigged election' lie",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-steps-vances-message-clings-rigged-election-lie-rcna174049,2024-10-04T17:07:09Z,"JD Vance suggested that no one should care anymore about who won the 2020 presidential race. Soon after, Donald Trump said the exact opposite.

Near the very end of this week's vice presidential debate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz asked Ohio Sen. JD Vance a question, the relevance of which lingered long after the event. ""Did he [Donald Trump] lose the 2020 election?"" the Democratic nominee asked.

His GOP rival refused to answer -- the senator would only say that he's ""focused on the future"" -- and the Harris campaign quickly turned Vance's dodge into a campaign ad.

A day later, the Republican vice presidential nominee was asked the same question, which he dodged again, while accusing news organizations of being ""obsessed"" with the election from four years ago. That same evening, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer appeared on CNN and asked Kaitlan Collins, ""What are you doing, talking about something that's four years ago?"" The Minnesota congressman added, in reference to the 2020 race, ""This is something that you folks, in the media, want to focus on, on a regular basis.""

It was against this backdrop that Trump, a day later, made his running mate and congressional ally appear rather foolish. NBC News reported:

""We won. We won,"" the former president declared despite reality. ""We did win. It was a rigged election. It was a rigged election.""

It's not exactly a secret that Republican officials have pleaded with Trump, publicly and privately, to stop pushing his ridiculous conspiracy theories about his 2020 defeat -- what many have labeled the former president's ""big lie"" -- in large because it's a losing message that much of the electorate doesn't want to hear.

But Trump simply can't help himself. Despite Vance and other leading GOP voices occasionally telling the public that the party and its ticket are ""focused on the future,"" Trump has a habit of fixating on the past.

Indeed, it's a staple the Republican nominee's message. A HuffPost report noted, even before Vance dodged the 2020-related question, ""Trump had already brought up the stolen election repeatedly in the past week -- he brings up 2020, unprompted, pretty much every time he speaks in public, though he doesn't always explicitly say it was 'rigged.'""

That was, however, the word he used at his latest event in Michigan. It was also the word he used by way of his social media platform on Wednesday night, after special counsel Jack Smith's brutal court filing was unsealed. ""I didn't rig the 2020 Election, they did!"" the former president wrote, pointing to a version of reality with no resemblance to our own.

The problem is not just that Trump is lying. What's more, the fact that the Republican presidential nominee and vice presidential nominee are offering contradictory messages about the 2020 race is amazing, but it's not the most important detail.

Rather, what ultimately matters most is the fact that Trump, who laid the groundwork to reject the results of his re-election bid long before Election Day 2020, is doing the same thing again.

As we've discussed, the former president refuses to say whether he'll accept the results of this year's contest. On a routine basis, he also falsely tells the public that his foes are cheaters and election results are suspect -- unless he says otherwise.

As NBC News reported, Trump has also begun referring to just about everything as ""election interference,"" evidence be damned, as part of a multifaceted effort to preemptively delegitimize the 2024 race, just in case he loses.

The Republican's efforts four years ago were a deliberate assault on democracy. As he reads from the same script, the scam has not improved with age.

If Democrats are fortunate, Trump won't change course at all, and the final 32 days of the election cycle will feature the GOP candidate, at one event after another, peddle the same whiny lie that most Americans tired of quite a while ago."
"Despite his promises, Trump's medical records remain under wraps",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/promises-trumps-medical-records-remain-wraps-rcna174031,2024-10-04T17:07:02Z,"The 78-year-old former president said nearly seven weeks ago that he'd ""very gladly"" release his medical records. Has he kept that promise? Of course not.

In mid-August, Donald Trump spoke briefly to CBS News, which asked the former president a good question. ""You will release your medical records to the public?"" correspondent Caitlin Huey-Burns asked the Republican.

""Oh sure,"" Trump replied. ""I would do that very gladly, sure.""

At that point, the GOP candidate proceeded to talk about his ""perfect score"" on a cognitive test -- a subject he's long struggled to understand -- and his belief that every candidate should take one.

It's true that Election Day 2024 is still 32 days away, and it's at least possible that the Republican nominee will follow through on his earlier promises related to transparency. But I wouldn't count on it: As regular readers know, Trump has long adopted a rather untraditional approach to sharing medical information.

It started before he took office. In late 2015, during the race for the Republican presidential nomination, Team Trump released an unintentionally hilarious, four-paragraph letter from the late Dr. Harold Bornstein, asserting that Trump's ""physical strength and stamina are extraordinary"" and that his lab tests results were ""astonishingly excellent."" The doctor added at the time, ""If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.""

We learned several months later that Bornstein wrote the letter in five minutes while a limo, dispatched by Trump, waited for the document.

In the years that followed, disclosures did not improve -- even when the then-president was hospitalized with a Covid infection.

Last fall, Trump released the first updated report on his health in more than three years, but it came by way of a statement issued by one of his golf club customers, and it omitted basic details such as his blood pressure and medications.

More recently, the former president and his team also ignored calls for basic medical details after he was shot in the ear.

It's against this backdrop that Trump said nearly seven weeks ago that he'd ""very gladly"" release his medical records, which will probably reach the public right around the time he releases his tax returns."
Why the race for control of the U.S. Senate is intensifying,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/race-control-us-senate-intensifying-rcna174013,2024-10-04T17:04:32Z,"Which party will control the U.S. Senate next year? With 11 closely watched contests, the chamber appears to be up for grabs.

As most fair-minded observers would probably agree, the race for the White House remains anybody's guess. No matter who wins the presidential contest, however, he or she is going to look to the U.S. Senate to help govern, and as it turns out, figuring out which party will be in the chamber's majority next year isn't easy, either.

As regular readers know, the Senate Democratic conference currently has a one-seat majority, but with Sen. Joe Manchin retiring in West Virginia, Republicans have, for all intents and purposes, already flipped one seat.

With this in mind, Republicans will need a net gain of just one additional seat to secure a majority, which is hardly unrealistic given the number of tough races in states where there's currently a Democratic incumbent -- including races in states where Donald Trump is all but certain to win easily.

So where do things stand with 32 days remaining? Let's take stock.

There are, by most measures, 11 Senate races that could credibly be described as ""competitive."" Taking them one at a time, in alphabetical order:

Arizona: Incumbent independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is retiring

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego has led failed Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake in nearly every poll for months, and with an abortion-rights ballot measure likely to boost turnout, Gallego is the clear favorite.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Despite Lake's baggage from her 2022 race, the election denier isn't being blown out, and the fact that the race is competitive is keeping Democratic money flowing into the state, instead of other contests.

Florida: Incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: The far-right incumbent is not well liked; he has no accomplishments or record of successes; an abortion-rights ballot measure likely to boost turnout; and polls suggest former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is keeping this contest far more competitive than most thought possible.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: At the end of the day, Florida is a red state, filled with voters who probably won't care about the senator's awful record; Scott is able to invest heavily thanks to his considerable personal fortune; and Mucarsel-Powell is struggling to keep up financially in a massive state with several expensive media market.

Maryland: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin is retiring

Why Democrats feel good about the race: In one of the nation's reliably blue states, Angela Alsobrooks' polling lead appears to be growing, and it won't hurt that there's an abortion-rights ballot measure on the statewide ballot.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Larry Hogan remains popular in the state, and the former governor is benefiting from massive investments from Republican megadonors.

Michigan: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is retiring

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Most recent polling shows Elissa Slotkin well positioned to prevail in a state that has elected a Republican senator only once in the past 50 years.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Despite former Rep. Mike Rogers' baggage -- he moved to Florida after retiring from Congress -- he's keeping the race close.

Montana: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is seeking a fourth term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Tester is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success, and it won't hurt that there's an abortion-rights ballot measure on the statewide ballot.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Polls suggest Tester is nevertheless losing to a struggling Republican businessman who's facing controversies surrounding his racist rhetoric, his record of dishonesty about a gunshot wound, and alleged plagiarism in his book.

Nebraska: Incumbent Republican Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Independent Dan Osborn has stunned much of the political world by running a strong race -- Republicans have scrambled in recent weeks to start airing ads in a state they expected to ignore -- and polls suggest he's within striking distance of an upset victory. The fact that the ballot will include measures on abortion policy might also help tip the scales.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: At the end of the day Nebraska is a reliably ruby-red state.

Nevada: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is seeking a second term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Nevada is one of the nation's most closely divided battleground states, but polls suggest Rosen is well positioned to prevail. Nevada is also one of the states with an abortion-rights measure on the statewide ballot.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Republican Sam Brown isn't far behind the incumbent, and there's still a lot of GOP money backing his candidacy.

Ohio: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is seeking a fourth term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Like Tester in Montana, Brown is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success. Unlike Tester, recent polling shows Brown hanging on to a small lead.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Bernie Moreno isn't exactly an impressive candidate, and he isn't exactly running a good campaign, but he's still within 3 points of a popular senator, thanks in large part to the fact that Ohio is becoming a reliably red state.

Pennsylvania: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey is seeking a fourth term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Like Tester in Montana and Brown in Ohio, Casey is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success. The latest polls also show the senator with modest but steady leads.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Despite his carpetbagger problem, Dave McCormick is still within striking distance of defeating a longtime incumbent.

Texas: Incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is seeking a third term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Democratic Rep. Colin Allred is exactly the kind of candidate who can appeal to a broad audience in Texas -- ""Republicans for Allred"" has some established and well-known figures on board -- and many GOP insiders have started to express real anxiety in response to surprisingly close polls.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: For all of Cruz's many troubles, he still has an ""R"" after his name in Texas. With Trump expected to win the state with relative ease, are there really a significant number of voters who will vote for Trump and Allred on the same ballot? GOP insiders believe the answer is no.

Wisconsin: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin is seeking a third term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Like Tester in Montana, Brown in Ohio, and Casey in Pennsylvania, Baldwin is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success. The latest polls also show the senator with modest-but-steady leads.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: In a dynamic similar to the Ohio contest, Eric Hovde isn't exactly an impressive candidate, and he isn't exactly running a good campaign, but he's still within 5 points of a popular senator."
Liz Cheney's remarks at a Harris campaign event evidently struck a nerve with Trump,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/liz-cheney-kamala-harris-campaign-trump-republicans-rcna174009,2024-10-04T16:48:17Z,"Cheney, one of Trump's fiercest Republican critics, called the former president petty, vindictive and cruel.

At a Harris campaign event Thursday evening, former Rep. Liz Cheney urged voters to ""reject the depraved cruelty of Donald Trump."" Hours later, Trump lashed out at his fellow Republican on Truth Social, posting a long screed against her and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has also endorsed Harris.

Trump criticized the former Wyoming representative for her role in the Jan. 6 House select congressional committee and trashed her father for ""our ridiculous journey into the Middle East, where Trillions of Dollars were spent, millions of people were killed.""

""What a pathetic couple that is, both suffering gravely from Trump Derangement Syndrome,"" he wrote in his post.

Trump's long-held animosity toward Cheney stems from her vocal criticism of his role in the Jan. 6 riot and her vote to impeach him afterward. Her fierce opposition to Trump arguably contributed to her primary race loss in 2022 by a huge margin.

Yet, Cheney has remained one of Trump's most relentless Republican critics, and her remarks at the event at Ripon, Wisconsin, clearly struck a nerve with him.

""I was a Republican even before Donald Trump started spray-tanning,"" Cheney said early in her speech. She also criticized Trump for inciting the violent attack on the Capitol and said he ""is not fit to lead"" the country. ""What January 6 shows us is that there is not an ounce of compassion in Donald Trump,"" Cheney said. ""He is petty, he is vindictive and he is cruel.""

She also made the case for Harris, praising the vice president for ""working to unite reasonable people all across the political spectrum.""

As I've noted before, Cheney's decision to campaign with Harris is not surprising, despite their party affiliations. Cheney endorsed Harris last month and her father followed soon after.

Harris has been working hard to win over Republicans who don't want to vote for Trump, even as those efforts are criticized by some in her party. It's unclear how much sway the GOP endorsements of Harris can have but they could also backfire by turning some Democrats away: Dick Cheney, for example, was widely reviled by the American public when he left office for his leading role in then-President George W. Bush's disastrous ""war on terror,"" and he is still a deeply polarizing figure among many Democrats."
Opinion | How Israel's invasion of Lebanon could spiral into a massive regional war,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-lebanon-war-iran-hezbollah-biden-rcna173364,2024-10-04T16:30:43Z,"An expert explains why Israel's intensifying war on Hezbollah is risky for the region.

Israel moved military forces into southern Lebanese territory Monday, an invasion that marks a major new level of intensity in about a year of conflict with Hezbollah. The paramilitary organization fired rockets at Israeli positions in the Shebaa Farms the day after Oct. 7 ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinian people after Hamas' attacks on Israel. (That area is a disputed territory which Lebanon and Syria say belongs to Lebanon, and Israel controls and says belongs to Syria.) Hezbollah, sometimes called a state within a state, is backed by Iran and does not have widespread support in Lebanon.

Then Tuesday, Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, citing last week's assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and, this summer, the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

The Biden administration has long opposed an Israeli incursion into Lebanon. But in the past year, the administration has also been unwilling to take any meaningful steps to rein in Israel's behavior, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is acting boldly to assert more dominance in the region and degrade Israel's adversaries -- with a continued disregard for civilian lives. Israeli airstrikes have struck medical facilities and already killed hundreds of civilians in Lebanon. The probability of a regional war seems to be growing by the day.

To better understand the unfolding conflict, I called Nick Blanford, a Beirut-based fellow at the Atlantic Council and the author of ""Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel.""

Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.

Zeeshan Aleem: What is happening right now and how do we know when to say whether this is a new war?

Nicholas Blanford: I think you have to put the developments of the last few weeks into some context. One day after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Hezbollah staged a pro forma attack against Israeli positions along the Lebanon-Israel border, and it dedicated this attack to its allies -- Hamas in Gaza. But very quickly it turned into a kind of a tit-for-tat, daily attacks. The Hezbollah guys would attack Israeli military positions along the border; the Israelis would retaliate with artillery fire airstrikes into south Lebanon. And this really continued from October almost uninterrupted.

There was a clear moment in September when Israel's patience ran out. And they escalated in a very dramatic fashion, by detonating thousands of pagers which they'd been able, apparently, to booby trap. The following day, they detonated hundreds of walkie-talkies. That was followed up by intense airstrikes across areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah has a presence. And those attacks have intensified over the past two weeks, climaxing on Sept. 27 with the massive airstrike on Hezbollah's underground headquarters in south Beirut, which killed the veteran Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, who has led the group for 32 years. The latest development is the advance of some elite Israeli army units into southern Lebanon where they have reportedly already taken some casualties.

So I would say we are in a war but it is not yet full scale. Both sides are mainly hitting military targets, not infrastructure as well, although hundreds of civilians have been killed in Lebanon.

Could you give us a brief primer on Hezbollah? How it emerged, what it is, what it believes in and its social function in Lebanon?

Blanford: Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim organization that follows the Iranian, theocratic system of rule. Hezbollah has a secretary general -- most recently the late Nasrallah -- but the true leader of Hezbollah is the spiritual leader of Iran, currently, Ali Khamenei. He's the ultimate authority and, in general, the Iranians will set the strategic agenda.

Hezbollah emerged after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to kick out the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was deployed in strength in south Lebanon. The Israelis in '82 reached all the way to Beirut and then they gradually withdrew. By 1985, they were occupying a border strip along the Lebanon-Israel border and Hezbollah became the main resistance force against that Israeli occupation. Particularly during the 1990s, Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran but also supported by neighboring Syria, was able to deal blow after blow to the Israeli occupation forces, and that culminated in May 2000 with Israel pulling out of south Lebanon.

Hezbollah refused to put down its arms after the Israelis left. They said, 'We need to keep our arms, our military force, to deter Israel from coming back into south Lebanon.' But there was also another unspoken reason, which is that Hezbollah gradually became a source of deterrence for Iran -- especially after the war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 when it expanded very quickly and acquired a great deal of weaponry from Iran, Syria and elsewhere. So, for Iran, Hezbollah has now become a major force multiplier.

Hezbollah has a slightly schizophrenic character, because it is ideologically beholden to the Islamic leadership of Iran, but of course it is a Lebanese organization. It survives or falls depending on the support it gets from the Lebanese Shia community, which is why, since the beginning, Hezbollah has invested a lot in social welfare organizations.

The Shia population of Lebanon tends to be traditionally fairly downtrodden. They live in the poorer areas of the country, traditionally neglected by central governments. And Hezbollah really stepped in with schools, with hospitals, with repairing war damaged houses, even things like helping farmers with agricultural aid. It's become an indispensable organization for the Lebanese Shia community. So they've been able to maintain that support since the early 1980s.

Other communities: the Christians and Sunnis, in particular, the Druze, to an extent, [say] 'Well, hang on a minute. We do have a national army. Why do we need a Shia militia, armed to the teeth, stronger than many armies around the world, to defend Lebanon?' So there have been growing calls for Hezbollah to disarm, and this is why Hezbollah has moved deeper into Lebanese politics, particularly over the last 19 years, since the 2005 parliamentary elections.

What are the fundamental dynamics driving how Hezbollah and Israel's government see each other, both in terms of geopolitical interests and domestic political interests?

Blanford: Ideologically, Hezbollah and Iran want to see the end of Israel, and the restitution of Palestine to the Palestinians. They have in the past assisted Palestinians during the Al Aqsa Intifada. They would help the Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza fight the Israelis. But in the past, they didn't get directly involved. When they kicked the Israelis out of Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah didn't immediately rush across the border into Israel and say, ""We're going to go and liberate Jerusalem now."" There's an acknowledgment that it's up to the Palestinians to liberate themselves, but Hezbollah is definitely there to help.

When you look at it more realistically, the reason why Hezbollah is so powerful now is because the Iranians want them to be. We go back to this notion of Hezbollah forming a key role in Iran's deterrence architecture: The stronger Hezbollah becomes, the safer Iran feels.

The Institute for National Security Studies, a leading think tank in Israel, has for the past few years described Hezbollah as Israel's greatest threat, which is quite remarkable in itself, because we're not talking about a country, we're talking about an organization, albeit one that is backed by a powerful regional country.

The Israelis have watched Hezbollah grow stronger and stronger. What the Israelis are doing now is something they haven't dared to do before, and that is to really go for broke with Hezbollah. What's interesting is I think the Israelis are gambling that Hezbollah and the Iranians do not want a full-scale war with Israel right now. Why? Because if there is a full-scale war, whatever the outcome, Hezbollah will take a huge battering, as indeed we're seeing now, and there's no guarantee that Hezbollah will be able to rebuild, rearm and re-equip as quickly as it did after the 2006 war to continue serving as a deterrence for Iran. In other words, if Hezbollah gets engaged in a full-scale war now, Iran could lose its major deterrence factor in that war, and all this would be for the sake of coming to the support of Hamas in Gaza. Hamas is small fry compared to Hezbollah -- Hezbollah is much, much, much more important to Iran than Hamas. Which is why Hezbollah is still acting with a certain amount of restraint despite Israel's escalated action against it. Hezbollah still has not used its arsenal of precision-guided missiles.

It's a dangerous gamble. It could go wrong. Especially now that Israeli troops are operating on the ground in south Lebanon, Hezbollah's home turf. The current conflict could spill into a major war. We're still below that threshold moment, but if it happens, it has a potential to go regional, dragging in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Can you walk us through the different scenarios you see unfolding here?

Blanford: The least likely one is that a cease-fire comes in. The Americans and the French had an idea for a 21-day cease-fire to calm things down along the Lebanon-Israel border. Netanyahu has rejected it. So that's not going to happen..

A second scenario is that what we're seeing now continues. The Israelis haven't started hitting Lebanese infrastructure, power stations, bridges, roads, the airports, seaports; they are focusing on Hezbollah military targets by using air power and now ground forces, albeit in a limited manner. Hezbollah, by the same token, is striking back at Israeli military targets. They haven't been hitting Israeli infrastructure. Now this could go on even at this heightened rate. But under current circumstances, I suspect that Hezbollah will continue doing what it's doing -- in other words, absorb these blows that the Israelis have inflicted, and keep firing rockets into Israel.

In some respects, the Israeli ground maneuver could play right into Hezbollah's hands, as the Israelis are entering terrain that Hezbollah has had for 18 years [and Hezbollah has been able] to prepare for exactly this eventuality. When the Israelis did move into Lebanon in 2006 after two weeks of aerial bombing, they came in for a big surprise. They didn't understand Hezbollah's underground bunker networks, its ambush positions, firing positions.

You could have a similar scenario this time round, albeit on a larger scale, where the Israelis, who have a better understanding of what Hezbollah is about these days, could come in in force for what they would describe perhaps as a limited incursion to basically rubble-ize and depopulate this broad strip of south Lebanon. But they risk losing a lot of troops because they're going to be operating in Hezbollah's environment. And at the end of it, if the mission is successful, what do you do then? Do you reoccupy south Lebanon? If so, you've gone back to the situation between 1978 and 2000 and that didn't end too well for the Israelis. But if you pull back to the border, then what is to stop Hezbollah basically moving back into the border district and beginning to rebuild?

There could come a point when the Israelis say, 'We've hit all the targets from the air and our soldiers are fighting on the ground but Hezbollah is still firing rockets across the border.' And this is where perhaps a third scenario can kick in: The Israelis conclude that, well, we're going to have to escalate this even further by deploying a larger number of troops into Lebanon to expand the target set to include Lebanese infrastructure as well. It could be at that point that Hezbollah, with Iranian blessing, feels it has no choice but to launch its precision-guided systems at Israeli military and infrastructure targets. This is where the conflict could go regional.

What role does the U.S. have in all this, and what advice would you give to the Biden administration on how to prevent a full-scale regional war from breaking out?

Blanford: Yes, a regional war potentially could happen. If the Iranians assess that Hezbollah is about to get bludgeoned by Israel, they may conclude, 'We've got nothing left to lose. We're about to lose Hezbollah. Let's go large. We'll activate all our proxies across the region, and we'll give it a go and see what happens to Israel.'

I think the Biden administration is in a difficult position. President Biden is enormously frustrated with Netanyahu, partly because of the Gaza conflict going on for so long. But he has been urging Netanyahu since the get-go to not open a second front with Hezbollah. Now you could argue that a second front was open anyway, because of these simmering tit-for-tat attacks that have been going on across the Lebanon-Israel border since October. But these attacks were containable. Hezbollah has said, 'Look, this is a support front that we're doing. Once the war in Gaza ends, we're going to stop.' So the emphasis has been very much on trying to conclude a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which will then have a trickle-down effect and should stabilize the Lebanon-Israel border. But of course, we haven't had a Gaza cease-fire. The conflict continues, and now the Israelis clearly have lost patience with Hezbollah and have gone large.

There's very little that the Biden administration feels it can do, particularly when you've got a very close election coming up in just over a month now. So the Biden administration could do what it's done before, and then suspend arms shipments to Israel, but this time do it properly. Cut off all military support to Israel. That would put a lot of pressure on Netanyahu to start picking up the phone and listening when Biden calls. But I don't think they're going to do that because there'll be a political backlash in the United States, and that could affect Kamala Harris' chances against Donald Trump. I think Netanyahu is taking advantage of this and is going for it."
"On politicizing aid, Trump reportedly did what he accused Biden of doing",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/politicizing-aid-trump-reportedly-accused-biden-rcna174001,2024-10-04T12:59:20Z,"As Donald Trump lies about Democrats politicizing federal disaster aid, there's new evidence suggesting he did what he's falsely accused others of doing.

As this week got underway, Donald Trump traveled to Georgia, ostensibly to survey Hurricane Helene damage, where the former president told a series of bizarre lies. The Republican said Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp hadn't been able to reach President Joe Biden, which wasn't true. He said the Biden administration and North Carolina's Democratic governor were ""going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas,"" which was insane.

Trump also accused Vice President Kamala Harris of staging a photograph of her talking on the phone with FEMA officials, told reporters that ""nobody"" could have predicted Hurricane Helene, and insisted that it's ""late in the season for the hurricanes."" All of these claims were completely false.

Three days later, the GOP candidate started peddling a new and related falsehood, claiming at a campaign rally that the White House lacks the resources needed to address Helene's aftermath because ""they spent it all on illegal migrants."" Trump added that, as far as he was concerned, Biden administration officials ""stole"" FEMA money as part of an elaborate conspiracy to get undocumented immigrants -- who can't vote -- to support Democratic candidates.

The former president's claims were, of course, ugly and indefensible lies. But they also helped open the door to a related conversation, which the Republican nominee would probably prefer to avoid.

In fact, as Trump lies about the Biden administration politicizing federal disaster aid, there's fresh evidence that suggests it was Trump who actually did what he's falsely accused Democrats of doing. Politico reported:

While the reporting hasn't been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, one former official -- Mark Harvey, who was Trump's senior director for resilience policy on the National Security Council staff -- went on the record, noting that the former president, while in office, ""initially refused to approve disaster aid for California after deadly wildfires in 2018 because of the state's Democratic leanings.""

Harvey was able to change his mind, not by appealing to the then-president's sense of decency or compassion, but by noting that there was extensive damage in Orange County, California -- where there were many Trump voters.

""We went as far as looking up how many votes he got in those impacted areas ... to show him these are people who voted for you,"" Harvey told Politico.

As the report highlighted related incidents, Harvey went on to shed light on Trump's twisted perspective. ""It just goes into this pattern of, 'We're not awarding that, these aren't my people.' That general sense of, 'I am here to help my people, and these aren't my people, so I don't have a responsibility to help,'"" he added.

Biden highlighted the Politico report via social media, and told his nearly 39 million followers, ""You can't only help those in need if they voted for you. It's the most basic part of being president, and this guy knows nothing about it.""

That's true, though there's no reason to stop there. If these allegations are true, I'd argue that they also constitute the kind of governmental abuse that would almost certainly warrant impeachment.

What's more, they offer a timely warning to American voters about the kind of antics they should expect if Trump is returned to power.

Indeed, Olivia Troye, a former Trump White House homeland security adviser, was explicit on this point, telling Politico that if the former president prevails, he'll view disasters through a political lens that values personal loyalty over damage considerations.

""It's not going to be about that American voter out there who isn't even really paying attention to politics, and their house is gone, and the president of the United States is judging them for how they voted, and they didn't even vote,"" Troye concluded."
Trump reshares a video portraying himself as God's gift to earth,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/god-made-trump-video-christian-nationalism-masculinity-rcna173945,2024-10-04T10:38:48Z,"""I need somebody with arms strong enough to wrestle the deep state and yet gentle enough to deliver his own grandchild.""

That creepy line comes from a video called ""God Made Trump,"" which Donald Trump has shared in the past and did so again Wednesday. It's essentially an ad that portrays the Republican presidential nominee as God's gift to Earth.

As Phoebe Jones wrote for California's Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey earlier this year, the video -- which plays on Paul Harvey's ""So God Made a Farmer"" speech -- shows how Trump and the Christian nationalist movement he leads are steeped in toxic notions of masculinity:

At one point, the ad literally says God needed a man who cares for the flock, as if to reiterate God's purported preference. Trump has leaned into this kind of messianic masculinity with some of his recent rhetoric.

And evidence suggests that all of this is likely to appeal to Trump's base, given the conservative movement's evangelical beliefs and arcane ideas of manhood and masculinity. A Public Religion Research Institute poll from September, examining the connection between authoritarianism and Christian nationalism in the U.S., found that nearly 7 in 10 Republicans think society has become too soft or feminine.

The poll also found Christian nationalist ""adherents"" or ""sympathizers"" were more likely than others to agree with these statements:

Today's fiercely Christian conservative movement in the U.S. has become a hypermasculine cult of personality with Trump at the helm. He has permitted Christian men to cloak their desires for domination and power in religiosity -- and is even selling Trump-branded Bibles.

And men in this movement have made hay with their shamelessness, openly promoting misogynistic policies like bans on abortion and trying to end no-fault divorces (along with discouraging abused women from divorcing their partners).

This hypermasculinization of the American church has coincided with a perhaps predictable trend. As The New York Times reported last week:

My suspicion is that this is a byproduct of MAGA masculinity pervading American Christianity -- and crowding out young women who, given the choice, don't want to suffer underneath it."
Opinion | Harris could win these three Southern states if late deciders show up,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-florida-georgia-north-carolina-rcna173735,2024-10-04T10:34:05Z,"The polls can't capture the procrastinators who aren't yet engaged in the election.

More than a million Americans have already cast their ballots in the presidential election, but the ones who may prove decisive may not have even started paying attention.

For political junkies like me who have been following every twist and turn in this election for the last two years, the next 32 days are the most stressful as we wait to see what voters will decide.

If you already know which candidate you're supporting in the presidential race between Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris -- not to mention everything from governor down to local school board -- it can be frustrating to wait for these seemingly indecisive, procrastinating Americans to get to it.

But late deciders are important, and this year, I think they are the reason that Harris may have a chance to win Georgia, North Carolina and Florida.

No, that's not a typo. I said what I said. President Joe Biden won Georgia in 2020, and North Carolina has been close for a while. But Florida? The one state where the promise of a ""red wave"" in the 2022 midterms actually materialized? The state that has voted for Trump both times he's been on the ballot? It's still close enough that a late-breaking group of Harris voters could make a difference.

Now, it's important to understand who these voters are. I think of them as intentional voters, because they'll usually tell you what they think of the candidates and the race or that they don't intend to vote at all. Months out from the election, if you were to ask whom they'd vote for, they'll give a reflexive response. They'll cite something they heard in an ad or skimmed in a news article that may or may not closely approximates which candidate they're leaning toward. In fact, that candidate may not be whom they end up supporting.

But, as we get closer to Election Day, these voters become more engaged. Their intentions begin to shift and may even harden into support as they read up on the two candidates, listen closer to their arguments, and shift their attitudes. When they do, they can change the political landscape dramatically in short order.

That's especially likely in the 2024 election, which has seen a lot of tumult so far.

Consider when Biden dropped out of the race and Harris became his successor. The country saw 40,000 new voter registrations in just 48 hours, according to Vote.org CEO Andrea Hailey. That's a 700% increase in the site's daily registrations, and young voters accounted for 80% of them. According to ActBlue, the campaign and its joint fundraising committee raised more than $86 million from online donors, many of whom were donating for the first time. This averaged out to around $65 per person from more than a million people. That's a lot of voters who were activated quite suddenly.

Or look at Taylor Swift's influence. Her Instagram post endorsing Harris and urging her fans to vote regardless of their candidate led to at least 337,000 visits to Vote.org. That's a large group of potential voters who were quickly activated and are not likely to be casting their ballot for Trump.

There are also signs that Trump's own popularity has been slipping. Those signs aren't coming from polls, but from his actual performance in the primaries as his own voters shift in their intentions since the Republican convention, as career political adviser Mike Madrid recently noted.

Finally, there's the potential for local issues to have a dramatic effect on turnout.

North Carolinians may turn out to rebuke Trump-endorsed Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson in the state's gubernatorial race. Robinson recently made headlines for allegedly referring to himself as a ""Black Nazi"" on a porn site forum, among a litany of other disgusting comments, all of which he denies making. That's in addition to his extremist views on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.

Trump has distanced himself from Robinson but not pulled his endorsement, and it's not clear if that would even help at this point.

Then there's Georgia. In past elections there, we've seen controversial voting policies be met with determination and expanded turnout due to the resilience of Peach State voters, pushing Democrats to statewide victory in a presidential election and three Senate races. It's possible some of the last-minute, ham-fisted changes to election rules by the state Board of Elections will also provoke a backlash.

And in Florida, voters will also be considering ballot measures to legalize recreational cannabis and codify abortion rights -- popular policies that align with the Harris-Walz agenda.

To be clear, I'm not saying that Harris will outright win Georgia, North Carolina or Florida -- or even that she'll win at all. What I am saying is that the polls can't yet capture what these late deciders intend to do. It happened in 2016 when Trump won unexpectedly, in 2020 when Biden won even as down-ballot Republicans did well, and in 2022 when a much-prophesied red wave failed to materialize. Yeah, those late voters can be pretty intentional

So, as you're going over the polls and casting about for some kind of clue as to what may happen, remember that there's still a lot of uncertainty. The only thing you can do is cast your own ballot, encourage your friends and family to do the same and volunteer to help out a campaign and persuade as many intentional voters as you can along the way. After that, all you can do is wait as they make their intentions known."
Opinion | Jack Smith's immunity filing is no 'Comey letter',MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jack-smith-immunity-filing-comey-letter-rcna173831,2024-10-04T10:33:47Z,"The biggest factor in the timing behind the special counsel's filing isn't Election Day; it's Donald Trump's push to delay the proceedings.

In October 2016, FBI Director James Comey threw a bombshell into the presidential election. It was a choice that has been scrutinized ever since as the potential catalyst for Donald Trump's surprise victory days later. Eight years later, Trump and his allies are now accusing special counsel Jack Smith of doing the same in a massive pretrial filing unsealed Wednesday.

As ever with Trump, his outrage is a case of reflexive reflection. When confronted with his own wrongdoing, he instinctively attempts to claim that he is the victim of an identical transgression. But it's still worth unpacking the ways Smith's 167-page filing differs from Comey's one-page missive and the wildly different circumstances surrounding the two.

In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Trump v. United States, the long-delayed federal case against Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election's results has finally begun to move forward again. That decision granted the former president presumed immunity for his ""official acts."" Smith's filing to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is his argument that Trump was engaged in ""unofficial acts,"" taken as a candidate for office, not as an officeholder, when he was scheming with his co-conspirators.

""They rigged the election. I didn't rig the election,"" Trump said in an interview with NewsNation on Wednesday evening. ""They should have never allowed the information to be, to come before the public. But they did that because they want to hurt you with the election. It's pure election interference.""

Trump repeated that assertion on Truth Social, pointing to the informal Justice Department ""quiet period"" within 60 days of an election that frowns upon taking actions that could sway voters. He'd previously claimed that Smith's superseding indictment, obtained after the Supreme Court's immunity ruling, violated DOJ's rules. That claim is especially frivolous, as Smith was narrowing the case against Trump, rather than attempting to expand it.

To repeat, this is projection on Trump's part, as the case is for election interference. But there are some supporters of the comparison between Smith and Comey, including former federal prosecutor Elie Honig, who, in New York Magazine, asks, ""What's the distinction? Both violated ordinary procedure to take public steps, shortly before an election, that plainly would have an impact on that election.""

But the distinctions are very real on both practical and political levels. Saying the two situations are similar is a matter of comparing apples and oranges -- or, if you rather, like comparing a rumor that an elephant might be in the room with being locked in a room with a very real, and very menacing, elephant.

Comey's letter was, at best, meant to protect him from scrutiny. He'd previously testified that an investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state had been closed. When several emails from that server were found during a separate investigation, he informed Congress that the case had been reopened. There was little to say beyond that simple statement, as no information was provided about the contents of the emails -- but it reignited the firestorm of criticism that had been Trump's main line of attack against her.

Comey would write in his memoir that he was attempting to protect the election's integrity: ""It is entirely possible that, because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next president, my concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in the polls. But I don't know.""

Those newly discovered emails did nothing to change the investigation into Clinton, which was closed again on Nov. 6, 2016, two days before the election. The only impact it had was in potentially making Clinton more vulnerable with key voters. Clinton has blamed her narrow loss at least part on Comey's breathing new life into the ""but her emails"" narrative.

Smith, whose filing is part of an ongoing criminal case that is making its way to trial, had no control over the timing of the decision to make his document public -- that was Chutkan's choice. And the judge has made it clear that the election is of little concern to her as she attempts to get the case back on track after months of delay.

As MSNBC contributor Glenn Kirschner noted, part of the Supreme Court's order to Chutkan and other judges was to rule on whether certain acts qualify for presidential immunity. Smith's filing is his reasoning for why the case should proceed, with most of the evidence itself still under seal.

Finally, we must all keep in mind that the timing of this is as we're only this close to Election Day because of Trump's motions that delayed things. If Smith had his druthers, he'd have presented his case to a jury more than six months ago. We'd have had a ruling on the matter, and while Trump would have likely still appealed, the time crunch he's now whining about would have been a nonfactor. Instead, we're in a position where Trump's crimes are still being litigated. It is only because his legal strategy was a success that we're seeing the evidence against him drop the month before the election."

These include fresh fruit, especially bananas, and some alcoholic beverages and seafood, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation, which represents the agricultural industry.""

Harris campaigning with Liz Cheney shows the effort to win over anti-Trump Republicans,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/liz-cheney-kamala-harris-wisconsin-ripon-rcna173912,2024-10-03T21:33:17Z,"Cheney's appearance alongside Harris is notable -- especially given the deep political divisions in the country -- but it shouldn't be surprising.

Former Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the most vociferous anti-Trump Republicans in the last Congress, is campaigning with Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday in a Wisconsin town widely known as the birthplace of the Republican Party.

Cheney, who endorsed the Democrat for president last month, will join Harris' rally in Ripon, where the meeting that led to the establishment of the Republican Party took place. (Cheney's father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has also endorsed Harris.)

The Wyoming Republican's appearance with Harris is notable -- especially given the deep political divisions in the country -- but not surprising. Cheney has been a fierce critic of Donald Trump over his role in the Jan. 6 riots, and she stoked both his ire and that of his allies with her involvement in the congressional investigation of the attack on the Capitol.

Meanwhile, Harris is making a huge effort to win over disaffected Republicans, in part to demonstrate the Democrats' big tent. Several prominent Republicans had speaking slots at the Democratic National Convention in August, and Harris has said she is willing to appoint a Republican to her cabinet if she's elected. On Thursday, NBC News reported that her campaign is releasing two ads in battleground states aimed at Republican voters and former Trump supporters.

Wisconsin is a must-win state for Harris, and holding the event in Ripon has symbolic significance. One of the major arguments made by anti-Trump Republicans against the current GOP nominee is that he has rendered the party unrecognizable from its traditional values. In a town with such historical connection to the Republican Party, Cheney will once again make the case to voters that, party aside, it is simply too dangerous to elect Trump to the White House again."
Opinion | Walz's little embellishments are still a big problem,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-misspoke-vice-president-debate-china-rcna173650,2024-10-03T21:24:05Z,"The Minnesota governor has made something of a habit of misrepresenting his personal life. It needs to stop.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz had an awkward moment at Tuesday's vice presidential debate when moderator Margaret Brennan asked him to respond to a report that he was not in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, contradicting a claim he has made on multiple occasions.

Walz initially responded by sharing various unrelated details of his past as a teacher and a politician and describing himself as ""a knucklehead at times,"" but he did not acknowledge the specific discrepancy: Though Walz did travel to Hong Kong and China later that year, he did not arrive in either country until months after the protests. Pressed again by Brennan, he then said, ""I got there that summer, and misspoke on this."" But then, confusingly, he proceeded to seemingly reverse his clarification: ""I was in Hong Kong and China, during the democracy protests, went in.""

The strange pattern continued at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania the next day. Walz both admitted again that he had misspoken and subsequently repeated a misstatement about being in Hong Kong during the democracy protests.

What's going on?

The most charitable explanation is that Walz genuinely misremembered his timeline. Those protests happened between April and June of 1989. According to Walz's corrected timeline, he traveled first to Hong Kong -- then a British colony -- in August, and then mainland China for a teaching gig. It is conceivable that Walz scrambled the order of events tied to a distant memory. For a visiting American that August, the political discussion, travel warnings and emotions surrounding the vicious crackdown on the recent protests must've been top of mind. The less charitable explanation is that Walz fudged the facts in order to make himself look more intrepid.

Either way, Walz has been corrected publicly multiple times now and he is still causing a mess with language that suggests he was somewhere he wasn't. He seemingly tried to brush this off during the debate as getting ""caught up in the rhetoric."" But at this point it's not excusable.

Let's be clear: There is absolutely no equivalence between Walz's small-scale false statements and Donald Trump, JD Vance and their allies' gigantic fascistic fabrications about issues such as election results and the dietary habits of immigrants in Ohio. But ""not Donald Trump"" is not an acceptable standard for any politician. Walz ought to get his story straight and speak clearly to the American people. This is all the more important because embellishment about his personal life seems to be something of a habit for him. That the Republican presidential ticket is made up of agents of mass deception does not relieve Walz of his burden to speak honestly -- it only makes it more significant.

This isn't the first time Walz has faced controversy for inaccuracy about his personal biography. He exaggerated the rank he held at retirement from the Army National Guard. He has also falsely suggested that he saw combat by stating that he carried weapons ""in war,"" but he has not. (NBC News reports that his time in the military included ""serving overseas and supporting forward units, but he was not deployed to a combat zone."")

Walz also misstated his family's experience with fertility treatment. As in vitro fertilization (IVF) came under attack from conservatives earlier this year, Walz said that he and his wife had their daughter through IVF. But more recently Walz's wife said in a statement that they relied on a different process called intrauterine insemination, or IUI, which involves putting sperm directly into the uterus. As PBS notes, ""IUI is often attempted before IVF but doesn't face the same level of political controversy because it doesn't risk destroying unused embryos that anti-abortion advocates say equate to unborn children."" Both are forms of assisted reproductive technology, and fertility doctors say they're often conflated, but they do have different political valences. In other words, this is another case where Walz could've made a sincere mistake, but he also could have seen it as politically advantageous to misrepresent his experience.

A public servant must be honest about factual matters on the level of principle -- making false statements undermines trust in government. That it's not uncommon for some politicians to embellish their accomplishments doesn't change the fact that it's also bad politics. Walz's little misstatements may be tiny next to Trump's serial mendacity, but they still end up providing ammo to Walz's opponents -- accusations of stolen valor or phonieness. They also distract from the issues that Walz is right to draw attention to. Walz does not need to say he had front row seats to the Tiananmen Square protests to persuade the public of his knowledge of foreign affairs or credibly make his crucial points about engagement with China. He does not need to have personally relied on IVF to make the case for defending it. He doesn't need to imply he served in war to convince people he knows his way around guns or sound more authoritative on gun control.

Walz has strikingly high favorability with the American public so far, in no small part because his persona is that of the genuine, salt-of-the-earth kind of politician. But if he keeps up with these embellishments he will squander what may be his most valuable asset."
What MSNBC's top legal minds make of Jack Smith's new brief in the Trump election case,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jack-smith-trump-filing-legal-experts-election-interference-rcna173725,2024-10-03T20:41:16Z,"MSNBC legal analysts Andrew Weissmann, Neal Katyal, Barbara McQuade and Chuck Rosenberg give their biggest takeaways from the special counsel's new filing.

On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan unsealed a key filing from special counsel Jack Smith's election inference case against Donald Trump. The 165-page brief provides extraordinary new details about the former president's scheme to cling to power in the days after the 2020 election.

Smith's filing makes the case for why the government thinks Trump can still face trial, despite the Supreme Court ruling in July that he is immune from prosecution for official acts.

While you might have not been able to make your way through the massive filing yet, MSNBC legal analysts have broken down the most damning allegations during on-air appearances this week.

Andrew Weissmann, who served as a lead prosecutor in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, described Smith's brief as delivering ""bombshell after bombshell,"" and compared the revelations to Watergate.

Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general of the United States, called the filing ""an exquisitely written document.""

""It's really lawyering at its best, and it tries to tell the story of what Donald Trump did on Jan. 6 and in the days before,"" he said Wednesday evening.

That includes new details about how Trump reportedly tried to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence. Pence wasn't the central character in the House Jan. 6 committee's report, because, as Weissmann explained, the panel had far fewer tools to collect evidence than prosecutors. But in Smith's unsealed brief, Pence is the ""principal player,"" Weissmann said.

""In many ways, the Jan. 6 committee report -- because they had this gap -- was a little bit like 'Hamlet' without Hamlet,"" he told MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell. ""And here ... he [Pence] is very active. He is sitting there watching what he thinks is the last gasp of his administration.""

According to prosecutors, on Jan. 1, 2021, Trump verbally attacked Pence during a phone call, after the then-vice president filed a brief opposing a lawsuit brought by Trump and his allies seeking to force Pence to help overturn the election.

On the call, Trump told Pence that ""hundreds of thousands"" of people ""are gonna hate your guts"" and ""people are gonna think you're stupid,"" according to Smith's brief. Trump called Pence ""too honest,"" prosecutors said.

""What [Smith] is saying is that when Trump did all this stuff, like pressuring Pence, that wasn't part of any presidential power in Article 2 of the Constitution. That was a guy who just wanted to keep his job,"" Katyal told ""11th Hour"" host Stephanie Ruhle.

What stood out most to Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney, was ""the strength of the corroborating evidence"" in the brief.

In the filing, prosecutors alleged that a Trump White House aide overheard the former president tell his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, ""It doesn't matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell.""

""One of the elements here will be [to prove] that Donald Trump engaged in fraud,"" McQuade said on ""Morning Joe"" on Thursday. ""I think those kinds of details will help this case withstand cross-examination at trial and, perhaps, the skepticism of 12 jurors who have to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant is guilty.""

But before Smith can make it to a trial, Chutkan has to decide whether the case can move forward.

As former U.S. Attorney Chuck Rosenberg explained, ""All of this is intended to convince her [Chutkan] that these are all prosecutable acts, that they're not immune,"" Rosenberg said Thursday on ""Morning Joe.""

""All it [the Supreme Court] had to do was pronounce a rule. Judge Chutkan has the really hard job implementing the rule, and he [Smith] is trying to give her a path, a roadmap, to implement the rule in a way that they believe means that Mr. Trump still may be prosecuted for all of these unofficial acts as a candidate."""
"Despite debate denials, Trump admits Biden beat him 'by a whisker' in 2020",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/debate-denials-trump-admits-biden-beat-whisker-rcna172848,2024-10-03T20:41:08Z,"The more Donald Trump concedes he lost the presidential election to Biden ""by a whisker,"" the more legally relevant the Republican's rhetoric could become.

Donald Trump's latest event in North Carolina was ostensibly supposed to focus on manufacturing and job creation, but true to form, the Republican candidate strayed from his script.

This included some curious comments about the results of the 2020 presidential election:

For the record, his assessment was uncharacteristically accurate. In 2016, the Republican ticket received roughly 63 million votes, which worked out to be approximately 46% of the popular vote. Four years later, amid higher turnout, Trump finished with more than 74 million votes -- which would've been great, were it not for the fact that Joe Biden finished with more than 81 million votes.

Nevertheless, as a video excerpt of the GOP candidate's comments makes clear, he didn't appear to be kidding.

And that's what makes this story rather weird.

About a month ago, Trump appeared at a far-right event in Washington and said, in reference to Biden, ""He beat us by a whisker. It was a terrible thing."" Five days later, the former president said effectively the same thing, telling a podcaster that he had ""lost by a whisker"" in 2020.

As just about everyone familiar with American politics knows, Trump has waged a relentless campaign against his 2020 defeat, desperately trying to convince the public that he secretly won the race he actually lost. The former president has lied about this so often and with such ferocity that it's become known as the Republican's ""big lie.""

All of which made it odd when he started telling people -- out loud and in public -- that he lost to Biden ""by a whisker.""

This came up during the recent presidential debate, when ABC News' David Muir reminded Trump of his ""by a whisker"" rhetoric. The GOP nominee immediately pushed back.

""I said that sarcastically,"" Trump replied. ""You know that. It was said, 'Oh, we lost by a whisker.' That was said sarcastically.""

The response didn't make sense. The former president has long struggled to understand what ""sarcasm"" actually means, and this didn't help. The videos of Trump's public comments made clear that he was not, in fact, being sarcastic.

And now, he has said the same thing once again, without a hint of sarcasm or intended humor.

As for the potential legal relevance, The New Republic noted, ""Of course, it's important to know that pretty much every time Trump opens his mouth, his words are admissible in court. So admitting that he didn't win the election could potentially hurt the former president in court -- specifically, in his election interference case in Washington, D.C., where special counsel [Jack] Smith is seeking to prove that Trump knew he lost the 2020 election but still tried to overturn the results."""
Election denying ex-county clerk receives 9-year prison sentence,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/election-denying-ex-county-clerk-receives-9-year-prison-sentence-rcna173916,2024-10-03T19:44:46Z,"Plenty of election officials who bought into Donald Trump's election lies, but Colorado's Tina Peters, who's headed to prison, is a special case.

There's no shortage of local election officials who bought into Donald Trump's lies about his 2020 election defeat, but by any fair measure, Tina Peters is a special case. Indeed, as NBC News reported, the Colorado Republican is now headed to prison.

As a local prosecutor explained, Peters was ""a fox guarding the henhouse,"" adding, ""It was her job to protect the election equipment, and she turned on it and used her power for her own advantage.""

It's been more than two years since the GOP conspiracy theorist was first indicted after she used her office to help leak election machinery data in pursuit of a conspiratorial plot that apparently never existed in reality.

As part of her efforts, Peters was celebrated by the likes of Steve Bannon -- he argued that she was targeted because of her fight against ""this globalist apparatus"" -- though a Colorado jury came to a different conclusion, convicting the election denier in early August, finding her guilty of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state.

Ahead of sentencing, Peters showed no remorse.

As the notorious election denier begins her sentence, there are a couple of broader angles to this that are worth keeping in mind. The first is the election-season message this sends to other right-wing conspiracy theorists elsewhere.

""Today's verdict is a warning to others that they will face serious consequences if they attempt to illegally tamper with our voting processes or election systems,"" Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement after Peters' conviction.

It's not exactly a secret that there are plenty of conspiratorial election officials considering provocative and legally dubious steps this fall. Whether the developments in Colorado get their attention remains to be seen.

But I'm also struck by the broader partisan circumstances: Trump lied, and Peters took those lies seriously. Nearly four years later, she's headed to a prison cell, while there's a decent chance that he's headed back to the Oval Office."
Trump says he'd revoke legal status of Haitian migrants and deport them if elected,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-haitians-tps-deport-springfield-ohio-rcna173841,2024-10-03T18:58:53Z,"""Absolutely I'd revoke it, and I'd bring them back to their country,"" Trump told NewsNation on Wednesday when asked about Springfield's Haitian residents. For weeks, he and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have leveled racist attacks against that community.

""We cannot destroy our country. You had a beautiful, safe community, everyone's in love with everybody, everyone's nice, it was like a picture community, and all of a sudden in a short period of time they have 32,000 more people in there,"" Trump said. ""It doesn't work, it can't work. It has nothing to do with Haiti or anything else.""

The Trump campaign has claimed that Haitian migrants in Springfield are eating people's pets and spreading communicable diseases, despite city officials repeatedly refuting those claims. The false accusations have put Springfield under national scrutiny. Most of the Haitians in Springfield are legally in the U.S. under the federal government's temporary protected status program, known as TPS, but the Republican presidential ticket has nevertheless falsely claimed that they are ""illegal aliens.""

First established by Congress in 1990, TPS is a form of humanitarian relief that allows foreign citizens who face undue hardship in their home countries to remain in the U.S. During his first term in the White House, Trump tried to end the program for Haiti and other countries as part of his anti-immigration crackdown. His efforts were largely stalled in federal courts, and his successor, President Joe Biden, later expanded the status to some 300,000 Haitians.

Springfield has been inundated with violent threats since earlier this summer as a result of Republicans' racist lies. Haitian residents have reported being harassed and feeling scared to leave their homes, and public officials have dealt with bomb threats and hateful emails and phone calls. Springfield's part-time Republican mayor, Robert Rue, whose family has been the target of personal threats, has also pleaded for his city to be kept out of the debate on immigration."
Trump's newest economic claim is even more wrong than usual,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-newest-economic-claim-even-wrong-usual-rcna173850,2024-10-03T17:59:30Z,"Donald Trump says he's responsible for creating the best economy ever -- even if we include data from 2020. That's demonstrably ridiculous.

It's not uncommon for Democrats to note that Donald Trump left the White House with the worst record on job creation since the Great Depression, with a net loss of over 2 million jobs over four years. Technically, that's true, but I've never been altogether comfortable with the talking point because it lacks context.

To be sure, if we simply tally up all of the monthly job totals from January 2017 (the month of Trump's inauguration) to January 2021 (the month he grudgingly stepped down), the results look dreadful: The Republican was the only president since Herbert Hoover to leave office with the United States having fewer jobs than when he came in.

But the context matters: To arrive at this conclusion, one has to include the Covid-era data, when the pandemic sparked a sudden and sharp recession. To hold Trump directly responsible for the fact that the U.S. economy lost over 20 million jobs in April 2020 has never struck me as altogether fair.

A better assessment, I've long argued, is to focus on the first three years of Trump's term, which have never been as amazing as he's claimed.

The GOP candidate, however, has apparently concluded that my approach is all wrong -- and that there's no reason to exclude the 2020 data. Trump sat down with personal-finance author and radio host Dave Ramsey this week and boasted:

None of this is true. Not even a little.

If we exclude 2020, and focus just on the former president's first three years, Trump's economic record appears fine, but underwhelming. Job growth during the Republican's first three years, for example, not only fell short of his pre-election promises, they were also lower than the job growth from Barack Obama's final three years in office.

How has Trump explained why job growth slowed down after he took office? So far, he hasn't. Instead, he claims the job numbers ""were the best ever,"" which is demonstrably wrong.

Meanwhile, economic growth during the Trump era -- again, before the Covid crisis -- wasn't bad, but it failed to reach 3% GDP growth, it fell short of the kind of growth we saw under other modern presidents, and it didn't come close to the growth the Republican promised to deliver during his 2016 campaign.

But in light of his latest comments, if we take the former president's advice, ""go all four years,"" and include the 2020 data, all of the data looks even worse.

I'm mindful of the fact that Trump might very well win a second term, largely because Americans have been told ad nauseum that his economic record is amazing. But reality tells a very different story."
Rachel Maddow: Jack Smith's new filing shows Vance's Jan. 6 revisionist history is nonsense,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jack-smith-immunity-unsealed-motion-trump-vance-maddow-reacts-rcna173826,2024-10-03T17:45:16Z,"The Supreme Court tried to sink the government's election interference case. A new unsealed motion shows us it failed.

On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan unsealed a new filing in special counsel Jack Smith's election interference case against Donald Trump, the case that includes allegations about Jan. 6.

Now, you may be asking yourself, why does this 165-page motion even exist? The prosecutors already put forward a superseding indictment in the case in August. The intention behind this document, which was filed by Smith's team last week, was to show Judge Chutkan that the immunity ruling from the Supreme Court didn't sink the government's case.

The filing contains an incredible level of specificity, arguing that Trump was not carrying out these acts as president of the United States, but was instead taking these actions as somebody who was trying to win a next term as president. It's full of very clear and quotable lines like, ""The Executive Branch has no authority or function to choose the next President."" As the filing contends, the extent to which Trump was trying to effect that choice was as a candidate and an interested party, not as president.

Another important line reads, ""As President, the defendant had no official responsibilities related to the states administration of the election or the appointment of their electors."" So when Smith explains how Trump pressured state officials about choosing their electors, the special counsel argues that Trump is doing something for which there is no presidential, official responsibility. That means Trump cannot be immune from prosecution for those actions, according to Smith's filing.

It's also important to note this filing was released less than 24 hours after Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, rolled out some of the most shameless, smooth-talking revisionist history about what the former president did on Jan. 6 and what happened at the end of the 2020 election. Usually, that kind of stuff is delivered to a MAGA audience, but on Tuesday night, it was delivered to more than 40 million people by a guy who portrayed it as if it were no big deal.

Smith's filing shows the American people that Vance's revisionist history is absolute bunk; it's nonsense. And should the court move forward on the basis of this filing and say Trump is not immune and that he should be prosecuted, this shows that the criminal case against Trump is very strong and very detailed."
Opinion | North Carolinians need help. Trump is feeding them lies.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hurricane-helene-storm-trump-biden-harris-rcna173639,2024-10-03T16:37:10Z,"You would think the partisan hacks would give it a rest while people are dead, dying, or missing.

At least 202 people are dead across six states following Hurricane Helene, and no place was hit harder than North Carolina, where I'm from. Western North Carolina's tumbling landscapes, remote communities, and already swollen rivers made the region especially primed for disaster, and now disaster has arrived. ""This is one of the most catastrophic events that our state has ever seen,"" the state's transportation secretary said Tuesday.

And at least 40 people around Asheville, the area's largest city, died in the storm. Residents in hard-to-reach places desperately need food and water and medical supplies. It's a tragedy in real time.

You would think the partisan hacks would give it a rest while people are dead, dying, or missing. But folks out here were only spared the election gimmicks for about 100 hours. On Monday, former President Donald Trump, who's slipping behind his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris in swing states like North Carolina, began lying about the recovery efforts, at least the ones led by Democrats, falsely characterizing them as nonexistent.

""At a time like this, when a crisis hits, when our fellow citizens cry out in need ... We are not talking about politics,"" Trump said Monday, surveying the damage from Valdosta, Georgia.

Then he immediately made it about politics, claiming falsely that Biden was ""sleeping"" and couldn't be reached by leaders in hard-hit areas, and that government officials were ""going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas."" He claimed Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, couldn't get Biden on the phone, but that was directly contradicted by Kemp just hours before. That didn't stopTrump and his MAGA surrogates in the Republican Party and right-wing media from repeating and amplifying those falsehoods and others.

Some lies should be left to wither and die. Others demand a response. I'm a longtime journalist in North Carolina. Here's what's actually happening here:

Federal aid has been coming in since Saturday, a day after the storm, when President Biden responded to Gov. Roy Cooper's request and issued a disaster declaration, an important procedural step in hastening federal aid. Biden visited North Carolina Wednesday, and Cooper said he'd spoken with the president about using military assets at nearby Camp Lejeune and Fort Liberty to help out.

Biden's head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Deanne Criswell, has been on the ground since Monday and says FEMA plans to stay as long as they're needed. More than 57,000 people in North Carolina had requested federal aid from her agency by Tuesday, and some have already received it.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, members of the National Guard airlifted hundreds of thousands of pounds of food and supplies to desperate communities. State transportation leaders say their crews have been working around the clock to clear damaged roads and interstates for rescue workers and utility companies. Many of these isolated mountain roads were rendered impassable by mudslides and flooding which is why the progress can be heartbreakingly slow. However, Interstate 40 was reopened around Asheville Tuesday morning.

North Carolina healthcare leaders are working to assist nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other healthcare centers cut off from power, water, and supplies. Volunteers were mobilizing to deliver food and water. And state workers were fielding an ""unprecedented"" number of phone calls to a hotline designated for people who can't reach a lost loved one.

""No matter who and where you are in western North Carolina,"" Cooper said Tuesday, ""if you need help, we are working around the clock to reach you.""

That's just a portion of federal, state and local officials' recovery work, which is boosted by private donors, businesses, and various nonprofits. Of course, Helene's victims need more. They will for years. But all these efforts aren't nothing. And they don't square with Trump and his MAGA allies' attempts to convince people that Helene is Biden's Hurricane Katrina, especially because their motivations appear to be cruel politics, not humanitarian concerns.

Communication is difficult in parts of western North Carolina right now, but imagine being there and reading Trump's lies that the cavalry isn't coming. Mark Robinson, the Trump-approved candidate for governor of North Carolina, is taking a similar approach to distract voters from his latest scandal, this one involving inflammatory posts he allegedly made on a porn messaging board between 2008 and 2012.

When the storm hit, Robinson started posing in front of broken roads with highway patrolmen, showing up and claiming credit for a supply drive run by a local county sheriff's office, and, on his X account, spreading misinformation about Cooper, ""hob-nobing"" (sic) in New York instead of preparing for the storm.

Like everything else about Robinson's candidacy, the story cracks under scrutiny. A report from North Carolina journalists found that, as the storm approached the southeastern United States last week, Robinson, who is also the state's lieutenant governor, was the only member of North Carolina's Council of State that didn't respond to Cooper's call for emergency powers, which allowed the governor to mobilize rescue efforts.

Some people who work in politics will tell you the stagecraft is part of the job, to make your candidate look like a serious leader -- whether or not it's true. They'll tell you that and then wonder why so many people hate politics.

But people know when a politician is there to help and when that politician is there to treat a disaster zone like a photo op. And hurting people, who've lost everything in the space of a few hours, like the folks out in western North Carolina, see that more clearly than most.

There's no room for artifice when you can't find your mom or your children, or if you can't get oxygen for your grandmother who depends on it.

To add insult to injury, there's the staggering hypocrisy for the MAGA politicians.

In 2017, after Hurricane Matthew killed dozens and left huge portions of eastern North Carolina underwater, then-President Trump denied North Carolina more than 99% of the federal relief funds that were requested. A good Southerner forgives but never forgets.

Rep. Virginia Foxx, a western North Carolina MAGA Republican, was also photographed helping a supply drive in the region this week, but Foxx was one of 11 Republicans who voted against providing federal aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Then there's Sen. Ted Budd, who's demanding more federal aid but has voted against FEMA aid and hurricane relief for other people on multiple occasions. So has Congressman Dan Bishop, who promised Monday to ""make sure the federal government is supporting our state.""

That they're hypocrites doesn't mean North Carolina doesn't need the help, but it's meaningful. They have no mercy for others but demand it for themselves.

While in office, Trump also delayed aid for hurricane-hit Puerto Rico until just before the 2020 election and moved money from FEMA's budget to shuttle more migrants back to Mexico.

And Trump and his allies have repeatedly referred to climate change as a hoax and resisted efforts for any meaningful resistance to global warming, even though climate scientists tell us that we can expect more mammoth storms like Helene in the future.

It's not about liberal versus conservative ideology. There are plenty of well-meaning public servants in the Republican Party, the party of Ronald Reagan, John McCain, and Mitt Romney. It's about real versus fake, and death and destruction has a way of making the fake stand out.

These Republicans are frauds. They respond to emergencies like con artists and ambulance chasers, not like leaders. It takes courage as a political leader to stand in front of people who've lost everything in a disaster. You're there to listen and to try to help them. Based on Trump's stop in Georgia, he seems to be there to talk and be helped -- in this case, by scoring political points against his Democratic rivals.

In times of crisis, some politicians are there to help and some are there to stand and talk. We've seen enough of Donald Trump and his MAGA allies to know which kind they are."
"Vance's views on the 2020 race matter, whether he likes it or not",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/vances-views-2020-race-matter-whether-likes-not-rcna173798,2024-10-03T15:24:34Z,"The Republican vice presidential nominee says he doesn't understand the interest in his beliefs about the 2020 race. So, let's try explaining it to him.

When it comes to election denialism, Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio has not always been shy. The year after Donald Trump's defeat, for example, ahead of his own first bid for elected office, Vance claimed, in reference to the 2020 election, ""There were certainly people voting illegally on a large-scale basis.""

That wasn't even close to being true, but it was a sign of things to come. Indeed, in the months and years that followed, the Ohioan continued to publicly question -- without, of course, presenting any evidence -- the integrity of the last presidential race. As recently as last month, Vance admitted that had he been vice president in January 2021, he would've ignored the legal path that then-Vice President Mike Pence followed and instead ""asked the states to submit alternative slates of electors.""

But at this week's vice presidential debate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz asked his GOP rival, ""Did [Trump] lose the 2020 election?"" Vance refused to answer -- and the Harris campaign quickly turned his dodge into a campaign ad.

A day later, as NBC News reported, he dodged the question again.

As part of the same exchange, the GOP vice presidential nominee accused news organizations of being ""obsessed"" with the election from four years ago.

I have a hunch the young senator is smart enough to know why his views on the 2020 race matter, and he's only pretending to be confused, but just for the sake of conversation, let's say Vance is genuinely baffled as to why his perspective matters. Maybe he sincerely has no idea why this question keeps coming up, and why people care about his refusal to answer.

So let's explain it to him.

Part of the problem, of course, is Vance's unexplained shift. He went from someone who was only too pleased to undermine public confidence in the integrity of the 2020 election to someone who no longer wants to talk about it. Why did he change his posture? As it turns out, he doesn't want to talk about that, either.

Another piece of the puzzle is understanding the senator's comfort levels with evidence and reality. Vance, by any fair measure, is still very new to politics, having only taken office last year. Before he's elected to the nation's second highest office, Americans deserve to know whether he values the rule of law and the will of the electorate.

These aren't abstract concepts. Either he accepts election results, or he doesn't. Either he believes Americans settle their differences at the ballot box, or he doesn't. Either he's prepared to honor legal guardrails, or he isn't. Given the weight of these issues, ""I'm focused on the future"" isn't a credible response.

But perhaps most important of all is his refusal to acknowledge the simple fact that these underlying questions are not entirely retrospective in nature. Donald Trump, right now, refuses to say whether he'll accept the results of this year's contest. On a routine basis, the former president falsely tells the public that his foes are cheaters and election results are suspect -- unless he says otherwise.

Headed into Election Day 2020, Trump went to outrageous lengths to lay the groundwork to reject results he didn't like, and four years later, he's doing it again. This time, he has plenty of company: House Speaker Mike Johnson, as recently as last week, said he'll accept the 2024 results -- but only if they meet his amorphous and undefined standards.

It's against this backdrop that Trump's running mate refuses to acknowledge the obvious outcome of the 2020 race, pretending the past irrelevant.

But if you'll forgive a cliché, I believe it was Faulkner who famously wrote, ""The past is never dead. It's not even past."""
The problem with Tim Scott's 'abstract' defense of Trump's agenda,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problem-tim-scotts-abstract-defense-trumps-agenda-rcna173788,2024-10-03T13:44:09Z,"Asked about one of Donald Trump's worst economic ideas, the senator said the former president ""talks in the abstract."" This sparked laughter for a reason.

As 2024 got underway, Susie Wiles, one of Donald Trump's top advisers, spoke with wealthy Republican Party donors at a luxurious Florida hotel. That wouldn't have been especially notable, except for the fact that Wiles delivered a curious message to her deep-pocketed audience.

As NBC News reported at the time, she specifically warned the GOP donors that they'd probably hear the former president say all kinds of ridiculous things in the coming days, weeks, and months, and they should simply disregard those comments. The prospective campaign contributors were instead told to focus on the fact that Trump was likely to win, whether his public comments made sense or not.

This came to mind watching Sen. Tim Scott appear on CNBC and try to defend the former president's stated plans for inflation-driving tariffs. HuffPost noted what happened after the South Carolina Republican was asked to defend Trump's threat to hit John Deere with a 200% tariff in a possible second term.

It was at that point when CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin interjected, asking, ""What are we supposed to believe then?""

That need not be a rhetorical question.

In reality, the GOP senator almost certainly knows that Trump's increasingly bizarre tariff agenda would be a disaster. I can say this with some confidence because Scott is on record already having said so.

The result, of course, was a challenge for the South Carolinian: He was on national television to serve as a surrogate for Trump, whose tariff plan he opposes. And so, asked about his party's nominee and his bad idea, Scott was reduced to saying that Trump ""talks in the abstract.""

This generated on-set chuckling, and for good reason. For one thing, as far as the former president is concerned, there's nothing ""abstract"" about his economic and trade plans, which he talks up on a nearly daily basis.

For another, to Sorkin's point, we're in the midst of a presidential campaign. The stakes couldn't be much higher. If Americans are supposed to see the Republican Party's presidential nominee and perceive his promises as ""abstractions,"" the result is a race in which no one will know -- or even can know -- what the candidate actually intends to do with power."
Trump and Diddy highlight hip-hop's toxic masculinity problem,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-diddy-hip-hop-toxic-masculinity-problem-rcna173739,2024-10-03T13:43:45Z,"Hip-hop's longtime love for Donald Trump and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs highlights some artists' disturbing infatuation with powerful abusers.

This post is the fourth in ""MAGA and Masculinity in 2024,"" an ongoing series examining the societal fallout from right-wing hypermasculinity -- and the people fighting its toxic messaging by positively redefining what it means to be a man. You can read the first post here, the second here, and the third here.

There's been a lot of reporting this election cycle about Donald Trump's campaign aligning with rappers in an effort to woo young Black men. I recently wrote about a pro-Trump rap concert scheduled for cities Trump has baselessly demonized.

As a Black man, I've found this outreach -- and frankly, some of the news coverage framing rappers as Black community spokespeople -- insulting of Black men's intelligence. I don't know what else to make of the presumption that Black men look to Lil Pump and Waka Flocka Flame -- both Trump supporters -- for political insight. (My personal love for ""Grove St. Party"" notwithstanding.)

I also think some of this coverage has missed the mark by portraying hip-hop's occasional ties to Trump as something bizarre or novel. Historically speaking, it's not. And none of us should be surprised that a genre criticized for promoting the degradation of Black women and the violent destruction of Black men includes artists who support a candidate who seems to stand for these things. Trump has a history of demeaning Black women. He embraces policies and rhetoric known to subjugate Black people. In those ways, he embodies the same toxic masculinity, cruelty and crassness that many hip-hop artists -- and the wealthy record companies behind them -- advertise.

It's notable that Trump, who's been found liable for sexual abuse, touts rap endorsements from one artist who pleaded guilty to first-degree assault in a rape case, and another who faced backlash in 2020 over resurfaced tweets in which he said he wanted to drug one of his social media followers and ""rape her a-- all night."" (Side note: Semafor noted that Trump's support from Black sports figures includes multiple men who've committed sex crimes. I'm sensing a trend.). Trump has also welcomed endorsements from rappers currently facing violent crime charges -- including conspiracy to commit murder -- as he and his followers have sought to discredit the criminal charges against him and boost his bad boy image to Black men they think will enjoy it.

I'm skeptical of this election strategy. But I do think Trump's hip-hop alliances, and the fact he and his followers seem so thirsty to promote them, are revealing. They signal to voters the type of Black men he supports, and the Black men he feels are inclined to support him: criminals, abusers and offenders of varying types. Men enamored by the same type of hypermasculine gangsterism he is, in all its violence and misogyny.

For hip-hop, I see the Trump associations as a crisis on par with the entertainment industry's longtime celebration of music mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, who is facing dozens of sexual assault accusations, including from some minors, and was federally indicted last month on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, among others. (Combs has denied any wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty to the federal charges.)

Combs is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn while he awaits trial. But the controversy surrounding him threatens to expose an industry that seems to have enabled or ignored his violent machismo for years. In both scenarios, we see a genre infatuated with toxic masculinity -- artists and an industry that glamorize powerful men who show strength through conquest, domination and self-enrichment."
Opinion | Trump tried to block Jack Smith's immunity brief. It backfired.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-immunity-jack-smith-brief-trial-redactions-rcna173649,2024-10-03T10:27:11Z,"The former president's lawyers objected to the special counsel's redactions.. Their reasons were absurd.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is about to wade into uncharted legal waters, deciding which of Donald Trump's alleged election subversion crimes are official acts of an American president and hence at least presumptively immune from prosecution. The Supreme Court directed Chutkan to undertake this unprecedented litigation by creating out of whole cloth a doctrine of criminal immunity for a president's ""official acts."" On Tuesday, Trump's lawyers made a last-ditch attempt to prevent this maiden legal voyage from setting sail. On Wednesday, that attempt backfired, as a brief from special counsel Jack Smith's team with new evidence was made public.

To comply with the Supreme Court's command, Chutkan needs to see all the evidence of Trump's conduct on and around Jan. 6, 2021. Last week, Smith filed the lengthy motion, which laid out Trump's conduct as the basis of the four charges in his criminal indictment. There is also an even lengthier appendix providing the evidence (e.g., grand jury transcripts, FBI write-ups of witness interviews and the like) supporting the narrative laid out in the motion.

Smith redacted any information from his court filing that would compromise ongoing investigations or reveal sensitive or classified information. Chutkan then set two deadlines for Trump's lawyers: Oct. 1 to object to redactions in the motion, and Oct. 10 to object to redactions in the appendix materials.

The first filing, objecting to the motion's redactions, landed Tuesday, and it was absurd in the extreme. The document's tone was less a sober legal argument than an unhinged, 2 a.m. social media post (saying, for example, Smith's filing is a ""politically motivated manifesto to the public""). It made three primary arguments as to why Smith got the redactions all wrong and begged Chutkan not to release anything in advance of the November election.

Trump's first argument was that Smith's positions have been inconsistent over time. Earlier in this case, Smith argued that the evidence should not be disclosed publicly earlier than necessary. Now, Trump's lawyers contended, Smith was newly determined to reveal evidence against the former president to the public. They insist Smith is doing so to interfere in the upcoming election.

But the reality is Smith has ""changed"" his position because the circumstances have changed. The Supreme Court directed that the evidence be disclosed and litigated. In our criminal justice system, the Sixth Amendment's right to a ""public trial"" means virtually all litigation is public. According to Trump, Smith should have said, ""I don't care about the Supreme Court"" -- a ludicrous stance to take.

Trump's second complaint was that Smith wanted to reveal the evidence in this case, but in Trump's Florida prosecution for unlawfully retaining classified documents, obstructing justice and violating our nation's espionage laws, the special counsel insisted on keeping the evidence under wraps. Again: duh! Those alleged crimes were committed after Trump left the presidency. So there is no presidential immunity issue to be litigated in the Florida case, which means there is no need to publicly disclose evidence.

The first two Trump arguments were empty allegations of hypocrisy. The third was simply laughable. Trump argued that disclosing evidence to the public would ""pose risks to potential witnesses."" This supposed fear comes from a defendant who has been gagged in both civil and criminal cases to keep him from saying things that would put potential witnesses in harm's way. This complaint falls under the weight of its own frivolity.

On the upside, Trump's new court filing made Chutkan's job much easier. It was so unpersuasive that Chutkan simply set it aside, concluded that Smith's proposed redactions struck the right balance and ordered his motion to be filed on the public record so she can move on to the litigation the Supreme Court has directed her to oversee.

We can now see why Trump was so desperate to keep Smith's filing secret from the American people. The motion is essentially a 165-page opening statement, and it includes evidence that is sharply and directly incriminating of Trump and his co-conspirators. Early on in the brief, Smith offers this eloquent summary:

The former president's frivolous legal filing disrespected the legal process. But for the rest of us, it was good news: Trump inadvertently may just have hastened the day when he finally faces justice for his democracy-busting Jan. 6 crimes."
Opinion | The House GOP's problems have only multiplied in the year since ousting McCarthy,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/house-gop-kevin-mcarthy-2024-election-rcna173269,2024-10-03T10:27:07Z,"GOP members of Congress are trying to pitch voters on another term in the majority. There's not much for them to sell.

Thursday marks the first anniversary of House Republicans' defining moment this term: removing the speaker they'd spent 15 rounds of voting to install just nine months earlier. The decision to oust Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., wasn't something that makes for a great campaign ad -- not for GOP members trying to earn second terms. But there's not much on the books from the last two years that makes a great case for granting Republicans another shot at the majority next year.

And yet, that's exactly what House Republicans are doing right now, taking a break from the hard work of failure to spend the next few weeks campaigning. Irrespective of what an abject catastrophe the last two years have been, roughly two dozen swing-seat Republicans are trying to convince Americans that they deserve to be the majority in the 119th Congress, as well. It's a level of audacity that should be disqualifying, not rewarded with another two years of, at best, mediocrity and, at worst, enabling the end of democracy in a second Trump administration.

While McCarthy's undignified boot from the speakership was a lowlight, the House majority hasn't exactly spent the rest of the time covering itself in glory. With only a lame-duck session awaiting after the election and another spending fight along with it, no major legislative push is planned to take advantage of those final weeks. Accordingly, the 118th Congress will go down in history as having enacted the fewest laws in modern history.

The best thing you could say for the House the last two years is that it kept the lights on in Washington -- barely. There have been five shutdown threats in that time as Republicans spent more time arguing among themselves about spending levels than debating with Democrats in the Senate and President Joe Biden in the White House. That total includes the one that got McCarthy booted after agreeing to a short-term spending bill his right flank opposed. He was on thin ice already with it, though, thanks to his decision to avoid a default by agreeing to raise the debt ceiling in April 2023.

The outrage over protecting the full faith and credit of the United States was centered in a cluster of far-right MAGA members I've dubbed the ""chaos caucus."" Their maximalist posturing was a headache for both McCarthy and his successor as speaker, Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who both have tried to appease their capricious whims. As a result, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., was at times left struggling to pass even routine measures to clear the path for what were essentially messaging bills.

In fact, most of the credit for even the simplest tasks belongs to the minority Democrats, who were willing to swoop in and save the GOP from itself. One of the few major pieces of legislation to pass this term was a funding package providing aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. It was brought across the finishing line without a majority of the GOP caucus' support to even have the bills be debated. It also lacked the immigration bill that Republicans first insisted be included in any aid package, then it tanked at the urging of former President Donald Trump.

Even things that were nominally in Republicans' control failed to coalesce into anything substantive. Their promise to restore ""regular order"" and pass all of the 12 annual spending bills on time has once again hit a wall, without any real effort from Democrats to hinder them. Likewise, their efforts to find some sliver of pretense to impeach Biden ended with a sad fizzle, in the form of a lackluster report released after he'd ended his campaign. But, seemingly lacking anything better to do, the House Oversight Committee has pivoted to trying to find dirt on Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

This new fishing expedition against the Democratic ticket is taking place in a leaky boat with nothing but frayed lines and almost no bait to dangle. If something truly damaging does turn up as a result, it will be more due to coincidence than cunning on the part of Oversight Committee Chair Rep. James Comer, R-Ky. That said, the House did manage to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on bogus charges, but he remains in place. The same can't be said for former Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., whom the House did manage to expel after considering the multiple crimes he committed in the process of running for his seat.

This is the absolute mess that Republicans slunk back to their districts to sell to voters when the House recessed last week. It's only thanks to partisan gerrymandering and the rightward drift of the GOP primaries that most of those who chose to run for re-election will find themselves back in Washington next year. Those few who represent swing districts are essentially on their own to figure out what messaging to offer old-fashioned voters who expect their members of Congress to show results.

Beyond their general lack of interest in governing, Republicans have good reason to feel comfortable in their audacity. As The New York Times recently noted, ""lawmakers benefit from the bar being very low: For years, the vast majority of voters have said they hold a dim view of Congress and think it is already broken, according to polls."" It stands to reason then that the GOP's core voters not only are OK with the current state of play but want members who continue to enact the same fumbling playbook. How fortunate for the House Republican caucus -- and how unfortunate for anyone hoping to see Congress get anything done next year."
Opinion | JD Vance tried to mansplain his way into the good graces of women. It didn't work.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-vice-presidential-debate-fail-rcna173598,2024-10-02T23:54:23Z,"Vance admits Republicans have a problem when it comes to women's trust. That doesn't mean he has a plan.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance arguably had one job going into Tuesday night's debate: convince the American public that he, and his party, don't hate women.

Even with that painfully low bar, I'd say he failed to do the job. The once anti-Trump senator did wear a pink tie, but did not face up to his past comments about menopausal women, ""childless cat ladies"" and a historically low favorability rate. Instead, he used most of his allotted speaking time to mansplain his views to the two women who were moderating, women who vote, and even his own wife.

During a question on immigration, Vance tried to talk over CBS moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, after he regurgitated dangerous lies about Haitian immigrants living in Springfield, Ohio. To Vance's dismay, Brennan reminded the audience that the immigrants in Springfield are there legally.

""The rules that you were not going to fact-check,"" Vance quipped, referring to CBS' statement that it would leave it to Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to fact check each other during the debate. ""And since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

Vance talked over and interrupted both O'Donnell and Brennan as they tried to move forward with the debate.

""Thank you, senator, for describing the legal process,"" Brennan said, before the network then muted Vance's mic.

""The audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get into. Thank you for explaining the legal process,"" she added, in a tone every woman sitting in a cubicle, boardroom or classroom knows deep in her bones.

Unlike his windmill-, shark- and Hannibal Lecter-obsessed running mate, Vance deftly wields a very specific type of misogyny that, while far less obvious, is just as insidious -- one that can come off as empathic, but is undeniably condescending as it normalizes the most draconian right-wing policies.

One example of this was Vance consistently referring to Brennan -- a woman he does not personally know -- by her first name rather than addressing her appropriately. The slight-of-hand misogynistic move may have been Vance's attempt to appear likable and down-to-earth, but many viewers saw it differently: condescending, patronizing and rude.

Vance himself admitted that the Republican Party has a problem when it comes to women's trust. He reminded women watching Tuesday that they do not trust Republicans when it comes to abortion and the human right to bodily autonomy -- yet failed to explain how he, his running mate and his fellow party members plan to address the problem.

""We've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue where they, frankly, just don't trust us,"" Vance said, before claiming that is ""one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do.""

To demonstrate his party's commitment to earning that end, Vance lied about not supporting a nationwide abortion ban, the realities of abortion care later in pregnancy, and Minnesota's PRO Act, signed by his opponent, Gov. Tim Walz. Because nothing says ""trust me, I know what's best for you"" like holding an impromptu masterclass on gaslighting.

While Vance was able to appear far more level-headed than Trump in his fateful debate performance against Vice President Kamala Harris last month, it was Vance's faux praise of his wife while discussing the necessity of child care that truly embodied his very specific type of mansplaining and misogyny.

""I speak from this very personally because I'm married to a beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids, but is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator, and I'm so proud of her,"" Vance began. ""But being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult.""

It's telling, when a man publicly laments the challenges his working wife faces, yet doesn't seem to face those same challenges as a working father. While appearing to appreciate all his wife does, Vance still chose to mansplain how hard it is to work outside the home while managing the majority of child care and household responsibilities without structural support -- the exact structural support Republicans have historically opposed.

For his bropropriating coup de grâce, Vance then pontificated on the importance of giving a ""family care model that makes choice possible.""

""The cultural pressure on young families, and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model they want,"" Vance said, ignoring how anti-abortion laws make it difficult, dangerous and in some cases impossible for women to choose when and how to start creating a ""family model"" in the first place.

Overall, it's true that during Tuesday's debate Vance succeeded in portraying himself as a level-headed, somewhat ordinary politician (if the definition of ""ordinary"" is calmly discussing the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history). But that is perhaps what makes Vance far more Machiavellian than Trump even. And it's what should put us all on high alert as we prepare to head to the polls in November."
How Jack Smith's giant motion tries to pass John Roberts' vague test on Trump immunity,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-filing-trump-immunity-supreme-court-roberts-rcna173728,2024-10-02T23:32:39Z,"Special counsel Jack Smith's big immunity brief is here. The 165-page (somewhat redacted) motion lays out why, in the government's view, the Supreme Court's immunity ruling doesn't stop Donald Trump from standing trial in his federal election interference case.

As an example of what the motion seeks to accomplish, consider the discussion of the alleged evidence related to former Vice President Mike Pence, whom Trump pressured to subvert the 2020 presidential election.

To understand the Pence analysis, recall that Chief Justice John Roberts' July 1 ruling in Trump v. United States granted absolute immunity for ""core"" presidential acts, presumptive immunity for all other official acts, and no immunity for unofficial acts. While the high court's Republican-appointed majority said that it's up to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to perform the immunity analysis in the first instance, the justices gave the Washington judge a head start in some parts, including with Pence. They said that whenever Trump and Pence discussed ""their official responsibilities"" -- namely regarding Pence's certification of Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, 2021 -- they had engaged in ""official conduct.""

That means Trump would have presumptive immunity for those alleged actions, which Smith would need to rebut. Roberts' opinion (rather vaguely) said that can be done by showing that the prosecution wouldn't ""pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch."" So that's why Smith wrote in the motion that because that branch ""has no role in the certification proceeding -- and indeed, the President was purposely excluded from it by design -- prosecuting the defendant for his corrupt efforts regarding Pence poses no danger to the Executive Branch's authority or functioning."" (The vice president is involved in certification via the office's role as president of the Senate.)

The special counsel further wrote that Trump ""sought to encroach on powers specifically assigned by the Constitution to other branches, to advance his own self-interest and perpetuate himself in power, contrary to the will of the people."" Therefore, Smith wrote, prosecuting Trump wouldn't ""pose any danger of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch; rather, it would advance the Constitution's structural design to prevent one Branch from usurping or impairing the performance of the constitutional responsibilities of another Branch.""

Smith's team also made clear in the filing that prosecutors intend to introduce more evidence at trial related to Pence, who is not accused of any wrongdoing. For instance, they want to introduce evidence of what they call unofficial communications that Trump had with Pence in their capacity as candidates (not as president and vice president), including when Pence ""tried to encourage"" Trump ""as a friend"" when news networks began to call the 2020 race for Joe Biden, and later when Pence suggested that Trump should recognize the process was over and run again in 2024. Even if those communications were deemed ""official,"" Smith wrote, the immunity presumption would be rebutted there too, he argued.

To be sure, the Pence evidence is only part of the case that Smith wants to bring against Trump, who has pleaded not guilty. And if the former president wins next month's presidential election, he'll be empowered to dismiss the case entirely.

But if Trump loses, then Chutkan would have a heavy task ahead in weighing the voluminous allegations and evidence Smith presents in the monster filing and deciding whether it passes the high court's (again, rather vague) immunity test. Ultimately, whatever the judge rules will be subject to review again by the justices before any trial can go forward. That won't happen before the election.

The case will either be killed soon by way of a Trump victory or will linger on for months, if not years, to first determine whether the Supreme Court will even let Trump stand trial over any of these allegations."
"Trump, who has insulted Jewish voters who don't support him, to attend Oct. 7 memorial event",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-october-7-memorial-event-golf-club-rcna173678,2024-10-02T21:46:48Z,"The Republican presidential nominee intends to speak at the event, which is scheduled to be held at the Trump National Doral Miami, one of his golf courses. (It's unclear if the Trump campaign is also organizing the event; the campaign did not respond immediately to a request for comment.)

""President Trump has always condemned antisemitism and will continue to do so once he is back in the Oval Office,"" his campaign said in a statement. ""He will hold accountable those who perpetuate violence against the Jewish people, and as such, America will be safe and patriotic again.""

Trump has long claimed to be the most pro-Israel U.S. president in history. He has accused the Biden administration of not being supportive enough of Israel, even as the White House has provided unconditional military and financial support to its ally despite the soaring death toll in Gaza. (Trump's anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian beliefs are also well documented.)

Yet Trump himself also has a history of invoking antisemitic tropes and has rubbed shoulders with white nationalists and Holocaust deniers. He singled out Jewish Democratic lawmakers, like Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, for attacks. In a radio interview in July, Trump claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris ""doesn't like Jewish people"" and appeared to agree when the host called Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, a ""crappy Jew.""

Trump has also repeatedly denigrated Jewish Democrats in remarks about the election, even at events focused on combating antisemitism. He said that any Jewish person who votes for a Democrat ""hates their religion"" and that ""they should be ashamed of themselves."" He claimed that Jewish and Black people vote for Democrats out of ""habit"" and said that if he loses the 2024 election, Jewish voters ""would have a lot to do"" with it -- a line that drew outrage from Jewish groups."

The people who knew Vance before he decided to become a Trumper had said that he was a nice and charming guy, and he tried to show that on the debate stage.

It's almost as if Vance realized that when this election ends, he doesn't want to be completely tied to Donald Trump. While Trump likes going to war nonstop against everybody all the time, you get a sense that Vance knows he still may have a future in politics ahead of him. No matter what happens in November, Vance wants to salvage that political career -- even if Trump goes up in flames.

However, Vance threw that all away in the closing minutes of the debate. He was asked directly by Gov. Tim Walz whether Trump lost the 2020 election and refused to answer. It was one of the most clarifying moments in any presidential or vice presidential debate I've ever seen.

In that moment, Vance told every viewer watching that if you hate American democracy when things don't go your way, vote for me. If you hate everything James Madison and Alexander Hamilton put together in the Constitution, vote for me. If you hate the tradition of the peaceful transfer of power that defines and ensures American democracy, vote for me. If you hate U.S. elections unless Trump wins, vote for me.

I am not a Democrat. I'm not a Republican. I'm an independent. I'm one of those people who looks at both sides. People always ask me, why don't you support the Republicans? Well, Vance answered that question for me on Tuesday. It's because one side is anti-democratic and the other side is pro-democracy, pro-constitutional republic, pro-James Madison, and pro-checks and balances.

On that debate stage, Vance refused to answer whether he supported the peaceful transfer of power and, as Robert Frost would say, ""that has made all the difference."""
"Judge unseals Jack Smith's filing in case on Trump, 2020 election",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/judge-chutkan-jack-smith-unsealed-presidential-immunity-motion-rcna173721,2024-10-02T20:31:05Z,"There are still plenty of pending criminal charges against Donald Trump, including special counsel Jack Smith's indictment related to the former president's efforts to overturn the result of the 2020 election. The developments in that case are still unfolding in provocative ways. NBC News reported:

The full court filing, with redactions, has been published online.

In late August, prosecutors filed a superseding indictment -- written to accommodate a recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity -- and charged the former president anew with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights.

It was against this backdrop that the special counsel's office last week submitted a 165-page filing, under seal, explaining how and why the case should proceed, despite the Republican-appointed justices' findings.

Trump and his team were not eager for this filing to reach the public ahead of Election Day. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has now unsealed it anyway.

With this in mind, the newly unsealed court filing makes the case that the Supreme Court's ruling does not negate the criminal allegations pending against the former president. ""At its core, the defendant's scheme was a private one; he extensively used private actors and his Campaign infrastructure to attempt to overturn the election results and operated in a private capacity as a candidate for office,"" the filing argued."
Opinion | Why JD Vance's abortion debate answer sounded eerily familiar,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/vance-abortion-debate-trump-ban-rcna173646,2024-10-02T18:55:09Z,"By Susan Rinkunas, freelance reporter covering abortion, reproductive health, and politics

Ohio Sen. JD Vance acknowledged during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate that Republicans have a believability problem on abortion. It's a notable admission, given that he and his running mate are asking voters to trust that they won't enact a national abortion ban after the demise of Roe v. Wade -- the Supreme Court precedent that the GOP swore was safe, until it wasn't.

Vance said during his debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz that the GOP has ""got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue where they, frankly, just don't trust us."" He then claimed that Trump believes the proper way to handle the issue is to ""let the individual states make their abortion policy.""

Trump himself fired off a social media post during the debate that stressed this talking point in capital letters. ""EVERYONE KNOWS I WOULD NOT SUPPORT A FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WOULD, IN FACT, VETO IT,"" he wrote, ""BECAUSE IT IS UP TO THE STATES TO DECIDE BASED ON THE WILL OF THEIR VOTERS (THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE!).""

It's not the first time Trump and Vance have downplayed the chances of a national ban. But people have zero reason to trust them: A federal abortion ban is absolutely on the table. From the top of the presidential ticket on down, Republicans are using condescending language eerily similar to what conservatives said in past elections: that Democrats and women, especially, are fear-mongering about a federal ban and are being hysterical.

At a Sept. 23 rally in Pennsylvania, Trump said that ""all [Democrats] can talk about is abortion and it really no longer pertains"" because, he claims, abortion is a state issue and ""a vote of the people."" In a bit of wishcasting, Trump added that if he wins, women ""will no longer be thinking about abortion."" That line was a rehash of another deranged, all-caps Truth Social post from three days earlier -- his repetition of this message shows how desperate he is for voters to believe the lie that abortion access won't get worse if they elect him.

During the presidential debate in September, Trump told moderator Linsey Davis that he ""won't have to"" veto a federal ban, because it would never pass Congress. That pat dismissal came after another answer in which Trump said Vance didn't know his stance on a nationwide law, and twice declined to say he'd veto a ban if it came to his desk.

Since that debate, Vance has parroted the line that congressional action was highly unlikely and really dialed up the dismissiveness -- stopping just short of calling women crazy. He told NBC News' Kristen Welker that a federal abortion ban was ""kind of a ridiculous hypothetical,"" adding that it would get about 10 votes in the Senate. When pressed by Welker, Vance said that Trump ""thinks it's ridiculous to talk about vetoing a piece of legislation that isn't going to come before the president in the first place.""

Ohio GOP Senate candidate Bernie Moreno made explicit what Vance kept implicit: At a Sept. 20 town hall, Moreno said suburban women are ""crazy"" for being single issue voters on abortion. Other Republicans have stuck to minimizing voters' concerns. Trump ally and battleground member of Congress, Florida GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna claimed: ""The Supreme Court said, as a federal legislator, that my opinion on the matter doesn't really matter."" Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., made a similar argument. Nowhere did the court say that Congress can't pass abortion laws. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, suggested that such a bill wouldn't pass: ""Thinking about the politics, it doesn't seem like that's really on the table.""

All this dodging is reminiscent of conservatives' dismissive reassurances in years past when they said Roe would never be overturned. Then-Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., notoriously said in 2018 that women protesting the Brett Kavanaugh nomination were engaging in ""hysteria."" It was ""absurd,"" he argued, to suggest that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe and women would die as a result. Supreme Court architect Leonard Leo told Fox News even before Kavanaugh was chosen that Democrats only talked about the fall of Roe as a ""scare tactic"" to mobilize base voters.

Trump himself famously claimed in a September 2020 debate that neither Joe Biden nor anyone watching could possibly know how his nominee Amy Coney Barrett would rule on Roe. ""There's nothing happening there,"" Trump said. ""You don't know her view."" (This is the same man who, in 2016, said he would only appoint anti-abortion justices and that Roe would be overturned ""automatically."") Just months after that debate, the court took up an abortion case out of Mississippi and, about a year later, Roe was gone -- with Barrett voting to overturn it.

Another telling debate moment, about the very meaning of the word ""ban,"" epitomized the Republicans' shell game. When the moderators asked Vance about his past support for a 15-week abortion ban, he claimed the proposal wasn't a ban but rather a ""minimum national standard."" Maybe Trump and Vance believe ""ban"" means a total abortion ban but make no mistake: A federal ban at any gestation would override state laws, in direct contradiction to their ""states' rights"" argument. Even more chilling, a second Trump administration could also enact a national ban by enforcing the 19th-century Comstock Act, which could ban abortion pills nationwide, if not all procedures.

Two years ago, a nearly 50-year precedent Republicans had argued was safe was overturned. Now, women are bleeding in hospital parking lots, losing fallopian tubes and, yes, dying. Obscenely yet predictably, they're trying to tell women reporters and women voters across the country that everything is fine but we know it's not. Vance is right that people don't trust Republicans on abortion and they shouldn't."
"Judge Cannon sets quick trial date for Ryan Routh, as she did at first in Trump's documents case",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/cannon-ryan-routh-trial-date-trump-rcna173600,2024-10-02T18:06:06Z,"U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon set a trial for next month in the case against Ryan Routh, the 58-year-old man charged with attempting to assassinate Donald Trump last month.

Technically, yes, but don't bank on a trial happening then.

Ask Jordan questions during his Reddit AMA on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET, where he will discuss the biggest cases of the Supreme Court's next term.

Cannon issued a similar order setting a quick trial date in Trump's classified documents case when he was indicted in June 2023. And we all know that the Republican presidential nominee still hasn't gone before a jury for that one.

As I noted in the former president's case at the time:

I might've understated matters on the normalcy front, given Cannon's subsequent strange handling of the case against the defendant who appointed her to the bench, culminating in her dismissing it entirely this summer.

But while we don't know how the case against Routh, who pleaded not guilty this week, will proceed, it's fair to say that it's not a typical one either. Even if it was, it's not unusual for trial dates to push back for any number of reasons.

Trump was initially charged in the documents case on June 8, 2023. Cannon issued an order on June 20, 2023, that said (among other things): ""This case is hereby set for a Criminal Jury Trial during the two-week period commencing August 14, 2023, or as soon thereafter as the case may be called."" Likewise, following Routh's indictment last week, Cannon's order this week said (among other things): ""This case is hereby set for a Criminal Jury Trial ... during the two-week period commencing November 18, 2024, or as soon thereafter as the case may be called.""

So the order in Routh's case might not tell us much about when a trial will happen -- if one ever does. Most cases end with pleas.

What's more notable, perhaps, is that Cannon -- whose pro-Trump bias is being called out in the pending appeal of her documents case dismissal -- seems intent on handling the Routh case. Whether the defense seeks her recusal remains to be seen. But if Cannon winds up presiding over Routh's trial, it could be months at least before that happens."
"In classified docs case, Trump falsely claims he was 'fully exonerated'",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/classified-docs-case-trump-falsely-claims-was-fully-exonerated-rcna173657,2024-10-02T17:46:55Z,"As Donald Trump falsely claims he was ""fully exonerated"" in his classified documents scandal, it's worth asking whether he knows what ""exonerated"" means.

For those who've kept an eye on Donald Trump's rhetoric over time, he has some unmistakable tells. When the former president tells stories, for example, about big, burly men who profess their love for him while crying, he's lying. When he vows to release information in ""two weeks,"" he's lying.

And similarly, when the Republican uses the word ""exoneration,"" he's lying. Take his latest comments about his classified documents scandal, for example.

""I was exonerated from my case,"" the GOP candidate said at a news conference in Milwaukee. ""That was a big case, as you know. Down in Florida we had a, I don't know the judge, but a brilliant judge. Totally brilliant judge. And I was exonerated. And fully exonerated.""

So, a few things.

First, the idea that U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon is a ""totally brilliant judge"" is impossible to take seriously. As a New York Times report summarized in June, in reference to the documents case, ""Judge Cannon has exhibited hostility to prosecutors, handled pretrial motions slowly and indefinitely postponed the trial, declining to set a date for it to begin even though both the prosecution and the defense had told her they could be ready to start this summer.""

She also repeatedly gave observers reason to question her competence, lent credence to questions that legal experts consider absurd, refused to assign pretrial motions to a more experienced magistrate judge for reasons that were difficult to defend, and justified procedural delays by pointing to logjams that she had created.

""Brilliant"" is not the first adjective that comes to mind.

Second, Cannon didn't ""exonerate"" Trump. Rather, the controversial Trump-appointed judge threw out the charges based on misguided concerns about special counsel Jack Smith's appointment. She did not, however, rule on the merits of the felony charges against the Republican candidate.

And third, let's not lose sight of the amazing larger pattern.

In March 2018, Trump claimed that the House Intelligence Committee had completely exonerated him in the Russia scandal. That wasn't true.

In June 2018, Trump said the Justice Department inspector general's office had ""totally"" exonerated him in the Russia scandal. That was both wrong and kind of bonkers.

In February 2019, Trump claimed that the Senate Intelligence Committee had also exonerated him in the Russia scandal. That also wasn't true.

In March 2019, Trump claimed the judge in a Paul Manafort trial exonerated him, too. That also wasn't true.

In June 2021, Trump claimed he'd been ""totally exonerated"" by testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn, which was largely the opposite of the truth.

In February 2023, Trump insisted that a special grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia, had rewarded him with ""total exoneration."" That not only didn't happen, that same special grand jury criminally indicted him soon after.

And in October 2024, Trump again claimed that he'd been ""fully exonerated"" in the classified documents scandal, which was still completely wrong.

There's no great mystery as to the former president's motivations. The GOP nominee has faced a series of controversies, each of which has caused political damage, and he's been desperate to convince the public that he's been cleared -- in every instance -- of any meaningful wrongdoing.

But either Trump doesn't know what ""exonerated"" means or he has spent years trying to deceive the public about his culpability in a variety of serious scandals -- or, more likely, both."
Trump's comments about assassination attempts veer in a weird direction,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-comments-assassination-attempts-veer-weird-direction-rcna173648,2024-10-02T17:46:51Z,"From North Korea to Iran to trade tariffs, the more Donald Trump talks about recent assassination attempts, the stranger his comments become.

Ahead of the vice presidential debate, Donald Trump held a couple of odd events in Milwaukee, including a news conference in which he reflected on recent assassination attempts. The New York Times highlighted one of the former president's stranger comments:

It was an odd comment on its face, in large part because Kim Jong Un hasn't tried to kill Trump and has no reason to do so.

But as curious as the rhetoric was, this was not the only strange thing the Republican has said recently about attempts on his life.

Late last week, for example, the GOP candidate suggested to a Michigan audience that the assassination attempts against him might have been caused by foreign opposition to his tariff proposals.

Two days earlier, Trump suggested -- without a shred of evidence, of course -- that Iran might have been involved in two recent attempted assassinations against him.

A New York Times report explained that the former president had received an intelligence briefings about threats from Iran, and intelligence officials were tracking a potential Iranian assassination plot against him, ""but officials have found no evidence to link Iran to either the Pennsylvania gunman or the man who the authorities say tried to shoot Mr. Trump at his golf course in Florida"" last month.

In other words, it appears the Republican might've just thrown some relevant details together and started connecting dots in a bizarre and baseless way.

Two days earlier, Trump issued a ridiculous written statement, accusing the Justice Department of ""downplaying"" an alleged assassination plot, and alleging that federal officials have a conflict of interest ""since they have been obsessed with 'Getting Trump' for so long.""

The rant, which made odd references to his Russia scandal and referred to Jan. 6 as a ""hoax,"" went on to say, ""OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS CORRUPT AND DISCREDITED, especially as it pertains to the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.""

To be sure, the former president's rhetoric on the subject has long been problematic. In July, for example, after he was shot in the ear, the Republican started blaming his critics for the shooting -- again, without any evidence -- and amplifying conspiracy theories.

Trump eventually blamed the Biden administration for the attempt on his life -- officials ""weren't too interested in my health and safety,"" he told television personality Phil McGraw -- and after another conservative media ally questioned whether the shooting might've been an ""inside job,"" the former president responded, ""You do have to wonder.""

You do not, in fact, have to wonder.

But as Election Day nears, Trump's comments on the issue appear to be getting even weirder."
Trump downplays importance of troops with brain injuries (again),MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-downplays-importance-troops-brain-injuries-rcna173596,2024-10-02T15:16:18Z,"After an Iranian missile attack injured U.S. troops in 2020, Trump downplayed their brain injuries as ""headaches."" Nearly four years later, he did it again.

Tensions in the Middle East reached a new level when Iran targeted Israel with a ballistic missile attack. Asked about the developments, Donald Trump thought largely about himself.

The former president not only claimed that the violence ""would have never happened"" were he still in office -- a baseless assertion, to be sure -- the Republican added there were no similar events during his White House term.

That, of course, was problematic in important ways. After all, many of us still remember the fact that Iran was responsible for a January 2020 missile attack that targeted U.S. forces stationed in Iraq. It was in response to a drone attack that killed Iranian general Quasem Soleimani.

The attack injured several dozen American servicemembers, many of whom were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. The Pentagon ultimately approved Purple Hearts for 39 U.S. soldiers wounded in the attack.

Trump, the then-president, dismissed the importance of the injuries to his own country's troops -- he called them little more than ""headaches"" -- prompting the Veterans of Foreign Wars to ask the Republican to apologize for minimizing the service members' injuries. Trump ignored the request.

Nearly four years later, he did it again. The Washington Post reported:

As difficult as this was to believe, five weeks before Election Day, the Republican Party's presidential nominee downplayed the importance of American troops who had traumatic brain injuries in response to an Iranian missile attack. Trump did this out loud, on camera, on purpose, and on the record.

""So, first of all, 'injured.' What does 'injured' mean?"" the GOP candidate asked rhetorically. ""Injured means -- you mean because they had a headache? Because the bombs never hit the fort. So just so you understand, there was nobody ever tougher on Iraq."" (Yes, he confused Iran and Iraq.)

The first time Trump made comments like these, the VFW called the ""headache"" comments ""misguided."" Nearly four years later, they have not improved with age.

But making matters worse is the larger context. It was, after all, just six weeks ago when the former president, hoping to impress a party megadonor, downplayed the significance of the Medal of Honor -- comments the Veterans of Foreign Wars described as ""asinine"" -- before sparking a related controversy with a political appearance at Arlington National Cemetery.

As regular readers know, Trump has also reportedly denigrated those who serve in the military and condemned fallen American heroes as ""suckers."" (He denies doing so.) Trump has also complained bitterly about American military leaders, reportedly disparaged wounded veterans, blamed military leaders for failed missions he approved, feuded with Gold Star families, and famously declared in reference to American prisoners of war, ""I like people that weren't captured, okay?""

What's more, as a candidate, Trump liked to say he ""felt"" like he had served in the military because his parents sent him to a military-themed boarding school as a teenager. He went so far as to boast that his expensive prep school gave him ""more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military,"" which was a precursor to Trump pointing to bone spurs as part of an apparent effort to dodge the draft.

It was implausible that the Republican candidate could make matters worse -- right up until he expressed indifference to troops with traumatic brain injuries."
"In Helene's aftermath, Trump's views on climate change get worse",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/helenes-aftermath-trumps-views-climate-change-get-worse-rcna173612,2024-10-02T15:16:03Z,"In the deadly aftermath of Hurricane Helene, JD Vance's and Donald Trump's approach to the climate crisis appears to be getting worse, not better.

Early on in the vice presidential debate, Sen. JD Vance described climate change as ""a very important issue."" For a fleeting moment, that seemed encouraging.

The moment didn't last. The Ohio Republican quickly added that many Americans ""are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water.""

Part of the problem with the answer was the simple fact that air and water quality in the United States got worse, not better, during Trump's presidency. But just as notable was the disconnect between the question and the answer: In GOP senator's mind, the key to understanding climate change is focusing on air and water quality, as if they're all the same thing. They're not, no matter how many times the former president -- and now his running mate -- pretend otherwise.

But if the Republican vice presidential nominee's approach to the climate crisis was a mess, Trump's was worse. NBC News reported on the former president's remarks at a press conference in Milwaukee, where he delivered ""sometimes hard-to-follow comments.""

None of this made any sense. The planet hasn't gotten cooler; the climate crisis and the weather aren't the same thing; the climate crisis is also unrelated to air and water pollution; and no sane person could seriously describe Trump as ""an environmentalist.""

But he said all of this with a straight face anyway.

But that's not all he said. In the deadly aftermath of Hurricane Helene, the Republican also suggested no one cares about climate change anymore. Two days earlier, he told a Pennsylvania audience that the climate crisis is ""one of the great scams of all time.""

Eight years ago this week, Hillary Clinton reminded voters that then-candidate Trump referred to climate change as ""a Chinese hoax."" The former secretary of state was correct -- he really was on record saying that -- but the Republican denied it. Two years later, the then-president even conceded, ""I don't think it's a hoax.""

At the time, the GOP nominee seemed to realize that much of the American electorate was concerned about the intensifying effects of global warning, so it made political sense for him to distance himself from overt climate denialism.

In 2024, however, Trump just doesn't care. He seems to now believe that overt climate denialism will not stand in the way of his White House ambitions at all.

This is causing no shortage of international anxieties. As a Politico report summarized this past weekend, ""Pro-climate government officials and environmental activists have had months to think about a strategy for preventing a second Donald Trump presidency from disrupting their efforts to save the world. They've come up with one main idea: Hope Vice President Kamala Harris wins."""
Why JD Vance's 'fact-checking flashpoint' in the debate mattered,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vances-fact-checking-flashpoint-debate-mattered-rcna173588,2024-10-02T13:23:12Z,"The Ohio senator spent much of the vice presidential debate brazenly lying. No wonder he grew agitated in response to a brief fact-check from a moderator.

About a third of the way into the vice presidential debate, the discussion turned to Springfield, Ohio -- a community torn apart by a racist and false conspiracy theory promoted by the both members of the Republican Party's presidential ticket. It was against this backdrop that Sen. JD Vance, who ostensibly represents the city, referred to ""millions of illegal immigrants"" and parts of the country that have been ""destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border.""

The Republican senator was peddling a multi-layered lie: The border isn't ""open""; the vice president isn't responsible for the nation's immigration laws; and Springfield's Haitian immigrants entered the country legally. Indeed, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee, took the opportunity to note that his rival had ""vilified a large number of people who were here legally.""

At that point, one of the debate's moderators, CBS News' Margaret Brennan, told viewers, ""To clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

The GOP nominee was not having it. The New York Times referred to it as the debate's ""fact-checking flashpoint,"" and NBC News' report summarized it this way:

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" the senator complained.

In reality, even that wasn't quite true: As the Times' report noted, CBS News executives had indicated ahead of the event ""that the moderators may choose to clarify a fuzzy point if they determined it had been left unclear.""

Or put another way, Vance lied about fact-checking after having lied about immigration policy.

But the on-air clash had a larger significance. The Ohio Republican wasn't upset because the debate moderators were wrong; he was upset because the debate moderators were telling the public the truth.

And as Vance made clear over the course of the evening, telling the truth simply wasn't part of his debate strategy.

Much of the post-event analysis has focused on the fact that the young senator appeared polished, smooth, and well-prepared for much of the debate, while Walz, who missed some opportunities, seemed nervous and at times unsteady. Those assessments are largely fair. But more important than the GOP candidate's presentation and style was the fact that he spent much of the evening peddling an alternate reality with little resemblance to the real world.

I recently wrote a book about Republican efforts to rewrite recent history, and even I was amazed at Vance's brazenness when it came to waging war against the recent past.

The GOP nominee lied about Trump and the Affordable Care Act. He lied about the ""peaceful"" transfer of power after Trump's 2020 defeat. He lied about his earlier support for a national abortion ban. He lied about his party's regressive 2017 tax breaks. This is a small sampling from a much longer list of obvious falsehoods.

A separate New York Times analysis said Vance showed ""a knack for revising history,"" which was a polite way of saying the senator spent the evening lying to the electorate about matters large and small. A Washington Post report added that Vance ""dominated on the falsehood meter.""

No wonder he seemed quite agitated about moderators telling the truth: The Republican was busy trying to pull a con on the American electorate, and the CBS News anchors were interfering with his scam.

A couple of weeks ago, Vance conceded that he's willing to ""create stories"" to advance his goals. It was hard not to think of this line during this year's only vice presidential debate."
Opinion | JD Vance played Trump's part better than Trump,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-vp-debate-trump-better-rcna173108,2024-10-02T13:23:06Z,"Trump sells MAGA at his rallies; Vance sells MAGA on TV. It's a perfect Trumpian partnership.

Sen. JD Vance turned out to be exactly the vice presidential pick that former President Donald Trump always wanted -- handsome, smooth, smart, glib, polished and, most importantly, great on TV.

Let me be clear: I don't trust JD Vance. Not one lick. He has zero integrity. Just a few short years ago he said he worried Trump had the potential to be an American ""Hitler."" And the political philosophy he espouses today is utterly at odds with the JD Vance who wrote ""Hillbilly Elegy."" His extreme political makeover is cynical and self-serving. But none of that matters to Donald Trump. What matters to Trump is someone who can make the case for Trump on TV. And Vance did that Tuesday night.

What a turn of events it's been. We're only a few weeks removed from daily discussions that Vance's unpopularity could lead to him getting kicked off the ticket. Vance's approval ratings have been abysmal from the get-go, and then clips from innumerable weird podcasts kept resurfacing. Suddenly, the bestselling author and avatar of MAGA's future was best known for the many cruel and retrograde things he's said about women.

But to Vance's credit, throughout this barrage of bad press that continued right up until Tuesday night's debate, he kept his head down, ignored the noise and stayed out there day after day, plodding along at rally after rally and TV interview after TV interview. Unable to connect with voters in the wild, at the debate he was able to perform as a perfectly slick TV news pundit.

Certain politicians excel at retail politics, always out shaking hands with real people at events in diners and coffee shops. Then there are other politicians who excel at wholesale politics -- giving speeches or making the case in debates, all in front of that television camera. Vance excels at the latter, and he proved it at the debate.

The final requirement for any Trump vice president: Be utterly shameless, say anything, no matter the truth. To work for Trump, you must lie for Trump. And Vance -- from his utterly shameless dishonesty about how Trump saved Obamacare (it wasn't Trump, it was Barack Obama) to his risible claim that there was a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election -- surely made Trump proud.

Vance had polish, and, unlike Trump at the last debate, he never lost his cool. He and Walz were strangely cordial to each other all night. This made Vance a far better spokesperson for Trump than Trump himself. And for Trump, that's all that matters.

Trump took a lot of heat even from his own base over the Vance pick. I bet a lot of them see it differently now. Trump sells MAGA at his rallies; Vance sells MAGA on TV. It's a perfect Trumpian partnership. And if the MAGA ticket doesn't win in 2024, Vance's wholesale political skills are clearly making him the MAGA heir apparent in 2028. After all, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis -- Vance's closest MAGA heir apparent competition -- is one of those rare politicians who isn't very skilled at either retail or wholesale politics.

I'm sure Trump is still smiling from his protégé's debate performance, and Vance can probably stop worrying about getting a late boot from the ticket."

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz reminded viewers of the rioters, the ""hang Mike Pence"" chants, the dozens of injured police officers, and the dangers Donald Trump posed to democracy. Given a chance to respond, Vance began by claiming that his running mate ""peacefully gave over power"" at the end of his term, which probably came as a surprise to viewers who remember the insurrectionist attack on the Capitol that the former president was responsible for.

The Democratic nominee pressed further, asking a question that was both simple and important: ""Did [Trump] lose the 2020 election?"" As NBC News reported, the question went unanswered.

Given an opportunity to answer the question, yes or no, the GOP candidate paused before ultimately saying, ""Tim, I'm focused on the future.""

Walz called the response ""a damning non-answer,"" which was more than fair given the circumstances. Indeed, a New York Times report noted, ""By the end of the evening, the Harris campaign said it was making an ad off the Jan. 6 moment.""

Hours later, Walz promoted a new 30-second ad via social media, punctuated by comments Walz made at the end of the exchange: ""America, I think you've got a really clear choice on this election of who's going to honor that democracy and who's going to honor Donald Trump.""

Vox's Zack Beauchamp described this as ""the only moment from the VP debate that mattered,"" adding, ""Ultimately, every issue discussed earlier that night comes in second to the fundamental question of whether America's democratic institutions deserve to endure. On that question, Vance truly is radical, and his exposure as such was the only truly important moment of the night.""

To be sure, Vance's record on this was problematic long before he took the debate stage. The young Ohio Republican hadn't yet been elected to Congress on Jan. 6, but as recently as last month, Vance admitted that had he been vice president in early 2021, he would've ignored the legal wrote that Mike Pence followed and instead ""asked the states to submit alternative slates of electors.""

In case there were any lingering doubts about whether democracy is on the 2024 ballot, the GOP's vice presidential nominee presented voters with a timely reminder."
"Opinion | The VP debate left me with one big, lingering question",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-tim-walz-vp-debate-vice-presidential-rcna172751,2024-10-02T10:48:08Z,"The vice presidential debate is over, which means the pundits will now spend the next 48 hours talking about who ""won."" Here's my answer: nobody. Certainly not the American people. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen JD Vance of Ohio spoke to their respective audiences. I doubt they did much to convince undecided voters. And they did nothing at all to inspire. At the end of the night, I was left with just one question: Is this the best we've got?

Let's start by giving the howler of the night to Vance, who said he has been ""extremely consistent"" in his views on former President Donald Trump and Trump-style politics. Sure, and Joe Biden is planning to run the New York City Marathon next month.

Back when he was the iconoclastic author of ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" Vance worried Trump could be ""America's Hitler,"" which seems like something you say about a guy you are not super-fond of. He continued to hold such critical views of Trump until 2020.

So how did Vance end up as Trump's running mate? During the vice presidential debate Tuesday night, Vance said he had ""believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of [Trump's] record."" Right, that must be it: The guy who wears his time at Yale Law as lightly as a cinder block lacked the sophistication to properly judge Trump's record. In fact, he seems to have judged it pretty well, until his ambition kicked in.

So there was the MAGA convert extraordinaire and least popular vice presidential candidate in recent memory onstage at the CBS News studio on 57th Street, shilling for a man he once likened to a genocidal dictator. Politics sure does sound like a lot of fun, doesn't it?

Vance declined to walk back the lies he has promulgated about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio. And his thoughts on school shootings were crushingly meager: ""We have to make the doors lock better,"" he said with what appeared to be a straight face. In 1991, former President Ronald Reagan came out in favor of an assault weapons ban. And now the party he once led is talking about better locks. His daughter Patti Davis recently wrote in The New York Times that he would ""weep"" for America today.

To be fair, conservatives seem to think Vance did a fine job of defending Trump's record. Alyssa Farrah Griffin, a former Trump White House staffer who now opposes him, offered that Vance was a ""very good communicator,"" though one who ""lacks authenticity."" Sure enough, Vance wasn't Sarah Palin or Dan Quayle. But it's a sad comment on our politics that those are standards on which we judge our candidates.

For that matter, I can't say that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, his Democratic opponent and Kamala Harris' running mate, did all that much better. He doesn't creep me out the way Vance does, with his undercooked musings on demography, but he doesn't thrill me, either.

When he was introduced by Harris as her running mate several years ago (what, that was only August?) Walz said he couldn't wait ""to debate the guy,"" promptly making a joke about Vance romancing a couch. After months of watching Biden plod through the motions of campaigning, Democrats were happy to laugh. But when the debate finally came, there was much less to celebrate.

In old clips from the Minnesota State Fair, Walz perfectly plays the part of the normie dad. But in a suit, onstage, he is just like another politician -- and not an especially adept one, at that.

He looked nervous, and his voice sounded thin. Asked about a lie he'd told about being in Hong Kong during the protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989, Walz stammered through a largely incoherent response. ""Many times I talk a lot, I get caught up in the rhetoric,"" he finally said. Fair enough, but haven't we had enough political leaders who get caught in their own rhetoric?

Ahead of the debate, Times opinion columnist Pamela Paul wrote that ""we need to hear more from the ticket beyond Harris' broken-record talk about small businesses, middle-class Americans and abortion rights, as safe and winning as those ideas may be."" We didn't. Instead, Walz reiterated that Harris would practice ""the politics of joy,"" whatever that means.

To be clear, I don't think the two candidates, or presidential tickets, are equal. Asked about election integrity, Vance repeated shameless lies about the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, which Trump instigated and most Republicans defended. Asked bluntly by Walz whether Trump lost the 2020 election, Vance started talking nonsensically about ""censorship."" His fear came clearly through my small television screen.

""That is a damning non-answer,"" Walz shot back. I concur with Puck reporter Tara Palmeri, who said that, in that exchange, the Minnesota governor delivered what ""might be one of the best lines of the debate."" It showed who Vance was, how little intellectual courage he has, the enormous compromises he has had to make to reach the summit of Republican politics.

Enjoy the view from Mount MAGA, JD. I don't think you will be there for very long."
"Opinion | Who will win? Election forecasters think it's Harris, but they've been wrong before",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-election-forecasts-predictions-rcna173277,2024-10-02T10:48:06Z,"Models looking at everything from polls to economic conditions show a narrow Harris win.

Can science predict the future? The great science fiction author Isaac Asimov wrote a series of books in which a scientist figures out a way to do just that.

""It was the science of human behavior reduced to mathematical equations,"" Asimov wrote in one of the books in his Foundation series. ""The individual human being is unpredictable, but the reactions of human mobs ... could be treated statistically.""

It's a great concept for a book series -- and a well-reviewed streaming TV show -- but in the real world, it falls flat.

The subject has come up again as we are now just a month out from a hotly contested election that could determine everything from the future of abortion rights to the strength of American democratic institutions. It would be comforting to hear from an expert who can read the tea leaves and tell us who will win.

Demand is so high that multiple models are competing for dominance, and two of the biggest forecasters -- historian Allan Lichtman and close poll reader Nate Silver -- got into an online feud over the weekend over how to read the ""13 keys"" that Lichtman uses to make his predictions. (Lichtman says they predict a Kamala Harris win, but Silver argues they actually favor Donald Trump.)

""Allan let's just say the little tricks you've played with the Keys in the past will come back to haunt you! The Keys shall be respected,"" posted Silver, in what sounded like something the villain in a children's movie shouts shortly before an army of elves overtakes the castle.

If you're not sure about the 13 keys, you could look instead at the Misery Index, a crude measure developed by an adviser to President Lyndon Johnson that combines the unemployment rate and the inflation rate, which will tell you the numbers are looking good for Harris. Or you can check out the more sophisticated Time for Change model, which zeroes in on the popularity of the current president, the state of the economy and the number of terms the incumbent party has been in the White House. That also predicts a narrow Harris win.

Or maybe, like Silver, you favor polls. In that case, you can look at 538's proprietary mix of polls, economic and demographic data to see that Harris is projected to win 57 out of 100 times (Silver is no longer with 538). If you're willing to pay, you can see Silver's own forecast, which is based on his new model. Or you can just look at the state-by-state polls yourself and obsessively play with the maps on 270 to Win while muttering about crucial Waukesha County.

Or perhaps you like the newfangled prediction markets, which ask bettors to put their money where their mouth is. PredictIt has a bet on a Harris win at 56 cents, with Trump as the underdog at 47 cents, while VirtualTout blends PredictIt data with some fancy math to come up with a forecast for a ""strong Democratic victory.""

The good news for these forecasters is that if Harris wins, they'll all get to claim that their models were accurate. And if Trump wins, they can say that, after all, their models showed only a high probability of a Harris win, or they'll switch to talking about the popular vote.

The problem with all of these models, however, is that they attempt to make iron laws out of the scrap metal of past elections. We've had only 59 presidential elections since the Constitution went into effect -- even fewer if you consider only those since the expansion of voting rights, the advent of TV news and the development of sophisticated voter targeting in the 20th century. Statistically speaking, that's just not a lot of data.

More recently, you can throw in the complications the Electoral College has caused since 2000 by diverging twice from the national popular vote, the increasingly intense partisanship and the closely divided elections, and it's basically impossible to make definitive predictions. Would your favored political model have predicted an Al Gore or George W. Bush win in 2000? Did it predict Trump or Joe Biden winning by tens of thousands of votes in a handful of swing states?

If your model assumes how voters will respond to a president running for re-election, how does it factor in the president's dropping out and endorsing his vice president just months before the election? Or a former president's running for a nonconsecutive second term? What about a candidate who was impeached for trying to overturn the results of the last election?

Most models can be useful to a point. They can give us the general sense of the political landscape or enough information to start make contingency plans for after the election. If Harris wins, maybe the models will make at least some voters less open to bogus arguments that the election was stolen. (I'm not holding my breath on that one.) And some can tell us how well a generic Democratic or Republican candidate might have done in a particular environment, which can help the parties review their strategies.

But ultimately, we aren't voting for a generic candidate. We have to choose between two specific people, with their own strengths and weaknesses. And sometimes the polls, the economic models and the betting markets can't measure that.

In Asimov's series, the scientist's predictions of the future are accurate for centuries until, through random chance, a man is born with a mutation that allows him to psychically manipulate other people's emotions, creating fear and devotion in order to rise to power. That proposition -- that predictions of the future ultimately cannot account for the unknown or the unexpected -- is worth keeping in mind as we head into the November election, especially given that we have a candidate on the ballot who's adept at creating fear and devotion.

In the end, election forecasts are not bad at telling us how the future will look, as long as it continues to look like the past."
Opinion | Who won the first (and only) VP debate? It came down to one of the last questions.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/who-won-vp-debate-tonight-vance-lied-walz-polls-rcna173558,2024-10-02T05:15:46Z,"JD Vance is clearly a smooth talker, but eventually his lies caught up with him.

Despite a somewhat slow start and an occasionally halting style, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz produced strong answers on health care, gun violence and reproductive rights. But his standout win -- and indeed one of the most compelling moments of the whole night -- came at the end of the debate, when the issue of election integrity took center stage. Vice presidents are tasked with a final ceremonial role in the process of certifying state electors. Former President Donald Trump tried to exploit this role in 2020 and pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to try to stop the certification. Pence refused. Just as concerning, though, is Trump's reluctance to even admit that he lost the 2020 election.

Tuesday night, Walz asked Sen. JD Vance point-blank whether Trump lost to Joe Biden. It was an easy question, which Vance nonetheless whiffed. Instead of answering with a yes or a no, Vance equivocated, deflected and eventually tried to turn the issue into a confusing and nebulous referendum on ""censorship."" Only then did it become clear that Vance, for all his smooth talking points, is still in many ways just a vessel for Trumpism.

During an extended exchange about the consequences of illegal immigration, CBS News co-moderator Margaret Brennan offered a mild fact-check of Vance, who claimed that in ""Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you've got housing that is totally unaffordable, because we've brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.""

Brennan noted that many of the Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are in fact there legally. This caused Vance to lose his cool. ""Margaret, the rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" he complained. Then, as Brennan's colleague Norah O'Donnell attempted to move on, Vance pushed back again, trying to tie Haitian migrants in Ohio to illegal immigration. Finally, CBS cut his mic.

Putting aside Vance's snarky treatment of the moderators, his seemingly righteous anger here is misplaced. Vance and Trump have repeatedly claimed that Springfield is overrun with Haitian migrants who are causing all sorts of problems, including, incredibly, stealing and eating pets. But according to the city's Republican mayor, Vance's own office called officials in Springfield to check this pet rumor and was told they were baseless.

It was a strikingly emotional reaction from Vance, who attempted to maintain a mostly collegial demeanor throughout the ""Midwestern nice"" debate. And it came off as both overly defensive and disproportionally condescending.

Vance says he ""never supported a national ban"" on abortion. This is, right off the top, not fully accurate. In 2022, Vance said he ""would like abortion to be illegal nationally.""

But in the same breath, Vance admitted he has supported a ""national minimum standard"" for abortion procedures. A ""national minimum standard"" of six or eight or even 15 weeks, however, would restrict abortion access to such an extent that it would become a form of abortion ban. This is a slick rhetorical trick, but it shouldn't fool people who are listening closely."
Vance's Republican Party sounds pretty nice. Too bad it's fantasy.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-republican-party-fantasy-vp-debate-rcna173573,2024-10-02T03:53:04Z,"Like most of the most promising words that come out of his and Trump's mouths, it's absolutely too good to be true.

I can't say I recognize the Republican Party that Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, advocated for on stage during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate. In answer after answer, Vance talked about policies that sounded nothing like anything that any Republican has advocated during this election cycle. It certainly doesn't sound like an administration that his running mate, former President Donald Trump, is likely to put into place should he win in November.

Let's start with abortion, an issue that has been a drag on the GOP since the conservative Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Vance waved off the idea that a national abortion ban is something that many Republicans support. Instead, he tried to humanize the issue, talking about a friend of his who felt she had to terminate a pregnancy and pushing for a string of ""pro-family"" policies that could help American families afford to raise kids. Later on, he added that the federal government should be investing in helping families pay for child care, using funding to help entice more child care workers into the field.

Vance further explained that, of course, the GOP wants to save the Affordable Care Act's ban on insurance companies using pre-existing conditions against people. He said there needs to be more housing made available for people to bring down the amount people are spending to have a roof over their heads. And he implied that Trump facilitated the peaceful transfer of power, downplaying the former president's plot to try to overturn the 2020 election.

On the one hand, this could be what the campaign would have looked like if Trump wasn't the nominee. He's kept the most far-right plank of MAGA extremism, falsely blaming the majority of America's problems on immigration. But he's tried to sand off many of the edges, doing what Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis failed to achieve in his primary campaign, presenting a version of Trumpism that could extend beyond Trump.

But recall Vance's nomination acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in July. None of the sort of ""compassionate conservatism"" redux that he pitched on Tuesday night was present in that speech. And when you hold up his statements to what the GOP has done and proposed in the real world, there's no way to make the two versions align. There is no support among Republicans in Congress for a new federal child care program, nor was there any desire to save the ACA among them. Vance was saying whatever he thought Americans wanted to hear -- same as he will do if ever in a position to challenge Trump as his vice president.

Likewise, Vance worked to assure the audience that there was actually a lot that he and his Democratic opponent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, agreed on and implied that Trump would look for bipartisan solutions if returned to the White House. It honestly sounded nice, a throwback to a semi-mythological era where things got done in Washington as both sides compromised for the good of the country.

But like most of the most promising words that come out of his and Trump's mouths, it's absolutely too good to be true. I'd love it if the Republican Party that Vance promoted was real. But there is no world in which a second Trump administration leads to a new era of common sense solutions. Vance's claim otherwise may be the biggest, most disturbing lie that he told on stage."
JD Vance brings 'sanewashing' to the debate stage,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/vance-walz-debate-sanewashing-trump-rcna173561,2024-10-02T02:54:10Z,"Donald Trump's running mate is trying to wash away some of the former president's most incoherent and outlandish remarks.

Coined in 2020, ""sanewashing"" has recently become a hot term among media critics who think that coverage of some of Donald Trump's speeches ignores his more outlandish remarks.

The term came back into the spotlight last month after the former president delivered a particularly incoherent answer at the Economic Club of New York. After one member asked Trump a very specific question about the rising cost of child care, the Republican presidential candidate responded with a two-minute rant about tariffs, the deficit and fraud.

Yet The New York Times chose to cover Trump's comments this way, headlining their piece on the event, ""Trump Calls for an Efficiency Commission, an Idea Pushed by Elon Musk."" The Times' deliberate choice to lead with that detail and only mention the former president's incoherence briefly in the article drew sharp criticism from media pundits.

On Tuesday, Vance took that same ""sanewashing"" approach to the debate stage in New York. When pressed by the moderators about Trump calling climate change a ""hoax,"" for example, Vance deflected. Instead of answering yes or no, Vance tried to ""interpret"" for Trump."
Opinion | This is the rare vice presidential debate that actually matters,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-tim-walz-vp-debate-vice-presidential-rcna172750,2024-10-01T23:15:15Z,"""Ain't nobody coming to see you, Otis"" is an iconic line from ""The Temptations,"" a 1998 NBC miniseries. Delivered by the actor playing David Ruffin, it's a boast that the audience was not paying to see anyone else in the group, just Ruffin. Conventional wisdom says one could apply this logic to Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.

In a ""normal election,"" a debate between the No. 2s on the ticket would be interesting but not statistically significant. The rule for a vice presidential debate is generally the same election to election: Stick to the top of the ticket's message, draw a contrast with the challenger anchored in that message and, crucially, do no harm. Conventional wisdom says people do not cast ballots because of whom the Democratic or Republican nominee chose as an eventual governing partner. It's the name on the top of the ticket that matters.

However, this is not a normal election, and I disagree with the conventional wisdom. Running mates matter, and tonight's debate is quite significant!

If the nominees' choice for potential governing partner did not matter, then there would no reason to put them on the stage together before the election. Choosing a running mate is the first presidential-level decision a major party nominee makes. It is a statement about who they are and what their agenda and legacy will be if elected president. In selecting the millennial Vance, former President Donald Trump tripled down on Trumpism, cementing it as a key pillar of the Republican Party apparatus and the bedrock of the GOP's next generation.

In selecting Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris signaled that the Democratic tent is big and that she is serious about making her bold plans on child care, reproductive freedom and the economy a reality. Just look at what her running mate has done in Minnesota when it comes to those issues.

Tonight's debate could be the last time voters hear from the campaigns in a forum at which they are mandated to stand next to each other and defend their plans. A literal split screen where the comments of both participants will take center stage. That alone raises the stakes.

Vance will have to answer for his treasure trove of soundbites on everything from likening Trump to Hitler and the racist conspiratorial lies about Haitian people in his home state, to name just two. Walz will be asked to defend his record in Minnesota (because apparently feeding children is too progressive) and his military service record. Regardless of what the moderators ask, a candidate who is well prepared will answer the question then quickly pivot out of the conversation about themselves and back to the issues and their No. 1. This is not always easy to do, but it is critical.

When we first sat down for debate prep in 2020 with then-Sen. Harris, we initially focused on ensuring she knew what then-candidate Joe Biden had said publicly about each issue. It was important she was well versed in his thoughts, so she knew the contours of where and how far to go in discussing any particular topic.

The last thing a campaign wants is the running mate making unauthorized news.

When Vance sat down with my colleague Kristen Welker on ""Meet the Press,"" he emphatically stated Trump would not sign a national abortion ban into law. And yet, during Trump's second debate this cycle, he walked back Vance's answer on national television. Vance will want to avoid making the same mistake tonight, but a large part of being vice president is speaking for the president. If Vance cannot do that in a debate, why would he be able to do it at the White House?

For Walz, he will have to walk the tightrope of part attack dog and part explainer. This is an area where many voters still say they want to know more about Harris' plans, so Walz will have to use his time wisely, find moments to speak directly to the people at home and explain how a prospective Harris-Walz administration would make a difference for families across the country. Much has been said about Walz not being a seasoned debater, but remember he was a high school teacher and a football coach! One could say he honed his oratory skills in the lion's den.

In 2020, during Harris' debate prep, we had many internal discussions about how to handle the question of age if it came up. Tonight, Walz won't have that problem. Harris will turn 60 this month; however, Vance will have to speak to why Americans should trust 78-year-old Donald Trump to sit behind the resolute desk again and if he himself -- a freshman senator with no legislative accomplishments and no other political or government experience -- would actually be ready to lead the country if duty called.

Tonight, while no one will be looking for Otis, all political eyes will be on Tim Walz and JD Vance."
Former Thomas clerk cites old boss to kneecap Civil War-era legal tool,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/qui-tam-mizelle-clarence-thomas-rcna173472,2024-10-01T21:06:30Z,"Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Kathryn Mizelle cited the justice in blocking a long-standing method of False Claims Act enforcement.

When U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed Donald Trump's classified documents case in July, she cited Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' separate opinion in the Trump immunity case that questioned whether special counsel Jack Smith had been lawfully appointed.

Now, another Trump-appointed judge in Florida, a former Thomas clerk, cited another solo opinion from the justice to break new ground in another area of the law. U.S. District Judge Kathryn Mizelle on Monday deemed unlawful so-called qui tam enforcement of the False Claims Act, an 1863 law passed in response to defense contractor fraud during the Civil War. The qui tam provision lets private parties bring suits on behalf of the government.

Dismissing one such case in which a doctor brought allegations of Medicare fraud on behalf of the government, Mizelle, citing Thomas in her ruling, said the person who brought the case ""exercises significant authority, indeed core executive power"" while lacking ""proper appointment under the Constitution.""

Mizelle was confirmed at age 33 in a divided Senate vote in the waning days of Trump's presidency in 2020, after receiving a ""not qualified"" rating from the American Bar Association due to a lack of experience.

Underscoring the practical impact of her ruling, the judge noted that qui tam actions ""now generate increased revenue for the federal government,"" citing settlements and judgments from fiscal year 2023 that totaled over $2.3 billion, compared to about $2.3 million in 1988. The Chamber of Commerce had urged the result that Mizelle reached.

Notably, last year when Thomas struck out on his own in a case to question qui tam enforcement, Justice Brett Kavanaugh issued an opinion in that case, joined by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing that he agreed with Thomas and that the court should consider the qui tam issue ""in an appropriate case."" Mizelle's ruling could bring the issue before the high court, where it takes four justices to grant review."
Opinion | What the hacked JD Vance dossier says about the media and Elon Musk,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-hacked-dossier-elon-musk-rcna173368,2024-10-01T20:47:16Z,"Months ago, Iranian hackers -- part of a larger operation detailed in a recently unsealed indictment -- offered media organizations the Trump campaign's vice presidential vetting file on Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio. All turned it down. Eventually, independent journalist Ken Klippenstein published it on his Substack account.

I'm not linking, because I think this is a national security issue, and we should disincentivize foreign interference by denying rewards as much as possible (if you absolutely must see it, Google Klippenstein). But what's even more instructive than the dossier itself is how the media and Elon Musk reacted to it. It both shows how much the media has evolved for the better since it abetted Russian interference in the 2016 election and provides yet more evidence that Musk is a partisan activist, not an advocate of free speech.

The news media rejected the Vance dossier as stolen material and foreign interference, which drew comparisons to 2016's Russia-hacked Hillary Clinton campaign emails. Some media leaders said nothing in the Vance dossier was ""newsworthy."" But by those standards, Clinton campaign emails weren't, either.

Media organizations won't say they've been more cautious with the Vance dossier as a corrective to their mistakes in 2016, when they let foreign hackers set their agenda. But it's still good that they're resisting. Even now that the Vance dossier is public, widespread rejection followed by publication on one person's Substack account sends the message that the origins are questionable.

But this isn't the first time the media showed a more cautious approach than it did in 2016. The Hunter Biden laptop story got similar treatment.

In 2020, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani shopped around a story that Joe Biden's son Hunter allegedly left a computer at a New Jersey repair shop in a drugged-out haze. The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Fox News and others turned it down. Rudy's story had holes, they couldn't independently verify it, and there was reasonable suspicion of foreign hacking.

Giuliani spent months in Ukraine trying to drum up dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden in the scandal that led to Trump's first impeachment. Russian intelligence had reportedly hacked Burisma, a Ukrainian company for which Hunter had worked. And U.S. counterintelligence had warned the White House that Russia had targeted Giuliani, trying to use him, with or without his knowledge, as a conduit for misinformation.

But Rudy kept offering, and eventually someone published it. The New York Post ran the story, but no regular reporters would put their names on it, so it put it out under that of one who didn't know she'd be in the byline and of a deputy editor who hadn't written a story before and later left for Breitbart.

We still don't know whether the ""laptop"" files were (1) real but stolen and released through a cut-out, like hacked Hillary emails; (2) a mix of real and fake, like the discredited Steele Dossier, in which the true aspects make the fake parts more credible; or (3) did not have any foreign involvement or hacked materials. Given the suspicious source, content -- salacious but not especially newsworthy -- and origins, turning down the story made sense.

The same logic applies to the Vance Dossier, except that it's moved beyond suspicion of foreign interference, with charges filed in court.

Turning down this suspicious material arguably helps Trump by keeping negative info about his VP nominee from the public. Turning down suspicious material in 2020 arguably helped Biden by keeping negative info about his son from the public. But whatever the electoral effect, it's an ethic applied whenever suspicious material arises, not a partisan exercise.

Which brings us to Musk. In 2020, tech companies reacted similarly to the New York Post laptop story. Facebook slowed the spread, and Twitter (under old management) blocked the URL, preventing users from sharing the article for a few days, then allowing it but adding a warning label.

I thought Twitter's URL block was an unnecessary overstep, but the label was reasonable. You might draw the line differently. A lot of content moderation is based on judgment calls.

But the right flipped out. Congressional Republicans held hearings, with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas absurdly denouncing Twitter's actions as ""election interference."" Musk complained, without evidence, that it had a ""material impact on the election."" A lot of this was frustration that a long-gestating political attack didn't land, but they treated it as a grand injustice.

Musk was so incensed about supposedly biased content moderation at Twitter that he bought the website, promising to expose the theorized censorship conspiracy. The result was the ""Twitter Files,"" a pathetic flop that, if anything, demonstrated the opposite. Musk claimed serious violations of the First Amendment, then showed people who aren't in government reporting unauthorized naked photos of Hunter Biden as terms of service violations. (In case you didn't know, declining to disseminate nude photos, hacked or otherwise, is a choice the First Amendment protects.)

After a few years of bloviating that his Hunter Biden laptop stance was about free speech, Musk had Twitter (now called X) censor the Vance Dossier, permanently banning Klippenstein and blocking the URL so no one could post the link.

As of this writing, it's still blocked, making the ban longer and more comprehensive than the one for the New York Post laptop story. Meta and Google have partially suppressed the Vance Dossier, as well.

Musk tried claiming the dossier was ""one of the most egregious, evil doxxing actions we've ever seen"" because it included private addresses. But the Hunter Biden laptop files he publicized had private addresses and other personal information, including nude photos.

This is more than just hypocrisy. It's an articulation of what Musk means by ""free speech"": promote causes he likes, suppress causes he doesn't.

It's apparent in the larger context, which includes Musk's censoring political opposition in Turkey and India at their governments' request but fighting Brazil over requests to shut down misinformation that fueled Brazil's pro-Bolsonaro Jan. 8 riots. Now he has endorsed and promotes Donald Trump and, just this week, Musk said that unless Trump wins this will be the last U.S. election, trying to invert concerns about Trump's threat to constitutional democracy.

The media handled the Vance Dossier pretty well. The mistake most of it made, and too many in it are still making, is going along with Musk's self-description as a champion of free speech, when his actions repeatedly show the opposite."
Opinion | What the right and left still get wrong about Gus Walz,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/gus-tim-walz-son-debate-emotions-dnc-rcna172573,2024-10-01T20:20:18Z,"Gus Walz cries as Democratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 21.Matt Rourke / AP

When Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted the vice presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention, almost immediately everyone zeroed in on his son Gus' emotional reaction in which the teen said, ""That's my dad."" When Vice President Kamala Harris selected Walz as her running mate, the family spoke to People magazine about the fact that Gus a has nonverbal learning disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. That means Gus is multiply neurodivergent.

At the time, I wrote that the Walz family's approach to Gus was a welcome antidote to how parents have long spoken of their neurodivergent children -- because rather than trying to ""fix"" Gus, the family focused on making sure he can live a good life.

As the vice presidential debate between Walz and Sen. JD Vance approaches, it's clear too many people missed that point. Too many people missed that point. Right-wingers engaged in cruelty, with Ann Coulter mocking the younger Walz's show of emotion. This is wholly unsurprising, given the fact that ableism is now a defining feature of the Republican Party -- from its mockery of Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., for using a closed captioning device after surviving a stroke to ridiculing Harris for describing what she looked like for low-vision people during an event with disability rights activists. And who can forget Trump mocking New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has a disability, during his 2016 campaign?

In response, plenty of liberals sought to use the moment to elevate Walz. Case in point, Ana Navarro, a co-host on ""The View"" who served as an emcee at the DNC, said, ""Teens like Gus can have trouble regulating their emotions in social settings,"" adding: ""Leave him the f--- alone, you ghouls."" Author and minister John Pavlovitz responded to Coulter, saying, ""He deals with ADHD, anxiety, and a nonverbal learning disorder. He was overcome with pride and love for his father.""

I understand the impulse behind wanting to defend Gus Walz and the way he expresses himself. But these sympathetic commentators provide a mirror image of the mockery that conservative pundits hurled toward Gus. While conservatives needlessly mocked Gus for the way he expressed himself without understanding his disability, his defenders almost provided an excuse and a rationale.

By saying simply that Gus has a disability and therefore it's OK for him to express himself, they are still implying something is wrong with the way he expresses himself. The true beauty of that moment with the Walz family is not that they love Gus despite his emotionality. Rather, it's that they recognize the way he expresses himself and the love he has for his family as valid and just as worthy as the way his other family members express themselves.

While many were understandably overcome with emotion watching the younger Walz, what made just as strong an impression on me was how mother Gwen and sister Hope reacted to his display for his dad. Rather than tamp him down, they allowed him to show all of himself on an incredibly public stage. They did not stop him or get him to tone it down.

Pundits have spilled gallons of ink on how Tim Walz offers a healthier version of masculinity. They pontificate about how he served his country in the military and was a defensive coordinator for the high school football team where he taught, along with the fact he served as the faculty adviser for Mankato West's gay-straight alliance, as well as his willingness to discuss going through fertility treatments with his wife, Gwen. The Harris campaign has embraced his everyman aesthetic as part of its overtures to white working-class voters.

Walz's embrace of his son Gus should be seen through that lens. Just as the governor sees no daylight between supporting his gay students and shooting pheasants, he seems to embrace how his son is growing into being a man.

This is a positive development. In recent months, I've been writing my second book about autism, neurodivergence and masculinity. While many autistic and neurodivergent women and people assigned female at birth find themselves forced to mask their symptoms, many times, autistic men also do it to try to avoid being ostracized. In the past, I've masked my stims or any visible neurodivergent traits out of fear of ridicule or because I was not ""manly enough.""

But expressions of emotion are just as valid and worthy, including those by men, regardless of their neurotype. Gus may have expressed himself differently than others may choose, but he only expressed the feelings many sons would have if their dad said they loved them in such a public way. Incidentally, former first lady Michelle Obama had a more correct response than some other people. Rather than excusing Gus Walz's expression of affection for his dad as a side effect of his disability, she correctly thanked him for ""showing us all what real love looks like, Gus."" (Her late father, Fraser Robinson, lived with multiple sclerosis.)

This embrace of how Gus Walz expresses himself also has larger policy implications. If society chooses not to see neurodivergent behaviors negatively, then it can start from the point of asking what support systems neurodivergent people need in order to live their fullest selves. This reorients decades of policy that focused on ""combating"" developmental disabilities more toward serving them and changing the world around them.

Far too often, well-meaning people feel the need to defend neurodivergent or disabled people. But Tim and Gus Walz offer a challenge to those same people; not to consistently defend or excuse them, but to treat their types of love as valid as anything else."
Opinion | What 5 political experts will be watching for at Tuesday's VP debate,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-tim-walz-vp-debate-2024-what-to-watch-rcna173348,2024-10-01T18:29:20Z,"JD Vance and Tim Walz will meet in the last time the two campaigns square off face-to-face.

The vice presidential debate Tuesday between Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will likely be your last chance to see the two campaigns square off before the election.

With the two running mates not as well-known as the tops of the tickets, many people will be watching just to get to know them. Others will be looking for how they represent the tickets.

So what should you watch for?

We asked some MSNBC analysts to weigh in on what they will be watching for during the debate. Here's what they said.

Follow live updates covering the 2024 vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz.

There's an underappreciated point of distinction between Walz and Vance: At their debate, one will find it vastly easier to defend his running mate.

When the vice presidential nominees share the stage, I'll be watching to see just how much the Republican senator struggles, not only to defend Donald Trump's latest scandals, lies and missteps, but also to distance himself from his own condemnations of the former president -- some of which he reportedly voiced as recently as 2020.

It's a challenge the Minnesota governor won't have to worry about: He and Kamala Harris were, are and almost certainly will remain on the same page.

Walz has lived a charmed existence since being tapped for VP, but we're about to learn whether he can take a punch. It will be very interesting to see how he handles real scrutiny and tough questions, which he's so far been able to avoid.

Walz's superpower is his relatability. Vance's biggest liability is his inability to connect with human beings. I'll be looking out for Walz to exploit that difference, especially by highlighting some of Vance's more extreme positions on abortion, marriage, reproductive rights and more. We'll see if Vance is suddenly going to run away from all of those Christofascist views that he was so quick to espouse on the right-wing podcast circuit before he became the Republican vice presidential nominee. My guess is that he'll certainly try.

Vance has a hard choice to make: try to show balance and get his historically low favorability numbers up or please Trump. This means he will have to attack but not cough up a hairball. Gov., aka ""Coach,"" Walz must show that he is more than just a nice guy. He must show command of the issues and not fumble the ball.

Quite simply: Will CBS fact-check the candidates, or will it outsource that to the candidates themselves? This seems like an especially important question given JD Vance's serial lies about Haitian immigrants, but it also goes to the question of whether the media has been browbeaten into eschewing its most important function: the dissemination of truth."
"For Springfield, Ohio, the consequences of GOP lies still linger",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/springfield-ohio-consequences-gop-lies-still-linger-rcna173475,2024-10-01T17:04:48Z,"Nearly a month later, Donald Trump and JD Vance aren't done lying about Springfield, Ohio -- and local residents and officials are still feeling the effects.

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer appeared on ABC News' ""This Week"" a few days ago, and host Martha Raddatz asked a good question about the upcoming vice presidential debate: If debate moderators ask Sen. JD Vance about his baseless pet-eating-immigrants claims, should the Ohio Republican acknowledge the truth?

The Minnesota Republican refused to consider the premise of the question. ""The people in the mainstream media want to put up these shiny objects to distract people from what they see happen every day,"" Emmer concluded before changing the subject.

It was a laughable response, in large part because ""these shiny objects"" used to ""distract people"" have come from Emmer's party and its presidential ticket. It was Donald Trump and his running mate who pushed racist and false conspiracy theories about Springfield, Ohio, into the national conversation, and it was the former president and Vance who've continued to repeat their lies for weeks.

Indeed, these ugly efforts are ongoing. Trump continued his rhetorical assault against Springfield's Haitian immigrants on Thursday. And Friday. And Saturday. Two days later, the GOP candidate sat down with Kellyanne Conway for a Fox Nation interview in which -- you guessed it -- he once again said that Springfield ""is going to be destroyed"" by its immigrant population.

The consequences of the Republicans' misinformation and disinformation -- bomb threats, closed buildings, canceled events, et al. -- have been well documented. But they're also not going away. The New York Times reported:

McGregor, whose business makes parts for cars, trucks, and tractors, has spoken publicly about the valuable contributions his Haitian employees have made to his operation -- which in turn has led people to threaten to kill him. His children and his elderly mother have been targeted with hateful calls, too.

""I have struggled with the fact that now we're going to have firearms in our house -- like, what the hell?"" he told the Times.

McGregor is a lifelong Republican who voted for Trump twice. But he nevertheless told the truth about some of his employees, and now he fears for his family's safety.

He's not alone. The Washington Post published a striking letter to the editor from a local resident who's lived in Springfield for 35 years. ""Because Donald Trump and JD Vance have appropriated the town as a set for their racist falsehoods, Springfield lives under a pall of fear,"" the local woman wrote, adding, ""You know who is not afraid to go out and about in Springfield? Proud Boys. Neo-Nazis. People handing out Ku Klux Klan fliers. ... These far-right groups clearly feel as though they have not just permission, but encouragement, from the Republican candidates. It is unsettling to live in this menacing atmosphere.""

The author concluded, ""Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance hope to make every town Springfield, where the angry are emboldened by lies and the people they seek to punish live in fear. As someone who has lived through this transformation, trust me: You don't want to live in Trump's America.""

Meanwhile, Politico reported that Vance, who ostensibly represents Ohio in the U.S. Senate, still hasn't spoken to Springfield's mayor -- who also happens to be a Republican.

The same article quoted Mike DeWine, Ohio's Republican governor, who expressed dismay over the lies from his party's presidential ticket.

""Yeah, after a while, because it got cumulative, and then you keep thinking, 'Well, they're going to stop this,'"" the governor said. ""Well, they didn't stop this, they just keep going.""

The word ""disqualifying"" is often overused. Once in a while, though, it's applicable."
"Ahead of the VP debate, Trump claims event will be rigged against Vance",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ahead-vp-debate-trump-claims-event-will-rigged-vance-rcna173453,2024-10-01T16:09:10Z,"One of the keys to understanding Donald Trump's worldview is acknowledging one of his core, conspiratorial beliefs: The former president believes just about just about everything in American society -- from elections to the judicial system to the Emmys -- has been ""rigged"" by nefarious forces he never identifies.

With this in mind, it's not surprising the Republican has told anyone who would listen that his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris was, of course, ""rigged."" Indeed, Trump sat down this week for a Fox Nation interview with Kellyanne Conway, who heard him continue to whine about the debate he lost three weeks ago.

But that's not all he said: In the same on-camera exchange, the GOP nominee also made a prediction on the eve of the vice presidential debate. Asked by his former White House aide about the prospects for additional debates, Trump said:

As the video makes clear, the former president, who has suggested targeting ABC's broadcast license because he didn't like his recent debate defeat, was not kidding.

To the extent that reality still has any meaning, the vice presidential debate has not been rigged against the Republican nominee. Last month's Trump-Harris debate wasn't ""stacked,"" either. The larger question, however, is why the former president is already attacking a debate that hasn't happened yet.

The answer, of course, is that Trump realizes that his running mate might fare poorly, so he considers it smart to attack the integrity of the event in advance.

As regular readers know, it's a process I like to call preemptive delegitimization.

Fearing possible election defeats, for example, the Republican has consistently taken steps to delegitimize the process to explain away potential losses. Fearing possible legal setbacks, he's also repeatedly tried to delegitimize the justice system to invalidate potential adverse outcomes. And fearing possible debate defeats, he's done the same thing, making pre-emptive excuses for possible failure ahead of his recent debate with President Joe Biden, and then doing it again ahead of his debate with Harris.

Trump approaches effectively every challenge with the same thought: ""If I fail, it can't be my fault.""

This week, Trump took the next logical step and extended his pitiful bubble to include his running mate."
Michael Cohen lodges final brief as Supreme Court weighs whether to take Trump appeal,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/michael-cohen-supreme-court-trump-retaliation-rcna173421,2024-10-01T16:08:37Z,"The filing moves the matter a step closer to a resolution of the former Trump fixer's civil damages claim for Trump-era retaliation.

Michael Cohen has filed his final brief in his bid to get the Supreme Court to review his civil damages claim against Donald Trump and other Trump administration officials for retaliating against him. The high court filing represents the last word for the justices to consider in the litigation before deciding whether to take up Cohen's long-shot appeal.

The former Trump fixer's case stems from when he served time for Trump-related crimes and started writing a book that would be unfavorable to the then-president. Cohen was released during the Covid pandemic but he told the justices that when he didn't immediately agree to waive his free speech rights, he was sent back to prison and thrown in solitary confinement. He was released again after a federal judge found that the government action ""was retaliatory in response to Cohen desiring to exercise his First Amendment rights to publish a book critical of the President and to discuss the book on social media.""

Given the shocking factual backdrop, you might wonder why Cohen's suit would be a long shot in this situation. That's because of the law surrounding the type of relief Cohen seeks, which is a so-called Bivens claim, named for a 1971 Supreme Court case that allowed for a claim of damages against federal officials for alleged Fourth Amendment violations.

The problem for Cohen is that the justices have all but abandoned Bivens claims. Justice Clarence Thomas noted in a 2022 decision that ""[o]ver the past 42 years, however, we have declined 11 times to imply a similar cause of action for other alleged constitutional violations,"" writing that the court will deny claims ""in all but the most unusual circumstances.""

Cohen insists in his reply brief, filed Monday, that his case ""features the most unusual circumstances."" He notes that a federal judge found that the government returned him to prison in retaliation for exercise of his First Amendment rights, and he further notes that the other side in the litigation doesn't claim ""that imprisoning critics for speaking is not the sort of misconduct that needs to be deterred.""

That other side consists of not only the former president -- whose opposition brief cites the recent immunity ruling as further reason to reject Cohen's bid -- but also the federal government itself, which filed a separate brief on its own behalf and on behalf of former Attorney General William Barr and other officials, similarly urging the justices to reject Cohen.

If the justices do reject the appeal, Cohen argues in his latest brief, that will mean ""that the courts will not deter an Executive determined to incarcerate their critics. That statement would threaten the freedoms this country was founded to protect and upon which so many areas of American life depend.""

It takes four justices to agree to review an appeal, so we'll see what sort of statement the court makes in this case."
Trump caught lying repeatedly about response to Hurricane Helene,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-caught-lying-repeatedly-response-hurricane-helene-rcna173407,2024-10-01T13:19:19Z,"What kind of would-be leader lies about a deadly natural disaster? When it comes to Donald Trump and Hurricane Helene, it's not a rhetorical question.

When it comes to hurricanes, Donald Trump's record is an embarrassment. Indeed, some of the low points of the Republican's failed presidency were directly related to his bizarre reactions to brutal storms: From ""Sharpiegate"" to ""big water,"" from his odd unfamiliarity with Category 5 hurricanes to lobbing paper towels as if he were having fun shooting free throws, the GOP candidate's background is tough to defend.

But it wasn't just a matter of gaffes and photo-ops gone awry. As a New York Times report explained, ""As president, he viewed federal aid through the prism of his personal politics, threatening to withhold money from governors of blue states whom he saw as enemies, and promising 'A-plus' treatment for his allies.""

But that doesn't mean his record can't get worse. NBC News reported:

Hours earlier, the Republican governor said the opposite, describing the helpful and constructive conversation he had with Biden, and letting the public know that he appreciated the president's offers of support.

It'd be easier to overlook if this were Trump's only break with reality, but it was not. The former president also falsely argued that the Biden administration and North Carolina's Democratic governor were ""going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas,"" which was absurd on its face, and made worse by the fact that Asheville and the surrounding area is heavily Democratic.

When NBC News asked the Republican to substantiate his aid-related conspiracy theories, he walked away.

Trump also baselessly accused Vice President Kamala Harris of staging a photograph of her talking on the phone with FEMA officials, and his claims immediately fell apart.

Alas, we can keep going. Trump told reporters that ""nobody"" could have forecast Hurricane Helene, which wasn't true, before added that it's ""late in the season for the hurricanes,"" which also wasn't true.

My personal favorite was Trump, during an appearance in Georgia, telling reporters, ""We're not talking about politics now,"" even as he talks about politics. As an Associated Press report summarized, ""Donald Trump repeatedly spread falsehoods Monday about the federal response to Hurricane Helene despite claiming not to be politicizing the disaster as he toured hard-hit areas in south Georgia.""

Part of the problem, of course, is that the GOP nominee was lying to the public about an important crisis five weeks before Election Day. Another part of the problem was Trump's apparent instinct to try to divide people rather than pulling people together in a time of need.

But just as notable is the broader question hanging overhead: What kind of would-be leader lies about a deadly natural disaster?

At a campaign event last week, Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, Trump's controversial running mate, insisted that the ""most important thing"" is ""having a person of character"" in the Oval Office. It was an easy sentiment to agree with. It also set a standard that his running mate can't meet."
"Opinion | What Trump's vision of ""one rough hour"" for police really means",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-purge-police-rough-violent-day-rcna173295,2024-10-01T10:34:42Z,"In the 2013 dystopian thriller ""The Purge,"" America observes a tradition wherein, once a year for a designated 12-hour period, all crime is permissible -- up to and including murder. During the purge, society is rocked by spectacular violence, which is said to have a cathartic effect: It dramatically reduces crime and unemployment. ""The Purge"" provides audiences with a warning about the horrifying consequences of selective observation of morals and a world ruled by a ""might makes right"" ethos. But at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday, former President Donald Trump effectively floated the idea as a good thing. Except in his spinoff version, the twist is that it's only the cops who get to do what they want.

As he often has in the past, Trump complained at the rally that police are ""not allowed to do their job"" because of political pressure and that crime is rampant in President Joe Biden's America as a result. (It is not.) And that's when he proposed his ""Purge""-esque solution: If police were allowed ""one real rough, nasty"" and ""violent day,"" he said, crime would be eliminated ""immediately."" He was taken enough by the proposition that he returned to it later, saying, ""One rough hour -- and I mean real rough -- the word will get out and it will end immediately, you know? It will end immediately.""

A Trump campaign official told Politico afterward that he was ""clearly just floating it in jest."" And Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign's communications director, told Politico that Trump has ""always been the law and order president and he continues to reiterate the importance of enforcing existing laws.""

Let's unpack a few things here. The Trump campaign's ""in jest"" excuse should be dismissed. As I've written before, for the better part of a decade Trump has used a comic tone and ""I'm just kidding"" caveats to float trial balloons for his most extreme ideas.

Even though Trump obviously wouldn't have the authority as president to permit the police to indulge in a day of extreme violence, that he's articulating the idea in public at all is still significant -- and corrosive. It signals an attitude toward police misconduct that helps to set the Republican agenda -- at federal and state levels -- on legislation related to police reform.

It could also affect the day-to-day culture of policing by emboldening police officers to act more aggressively when interacting with citizens. And it could more generally encourage Trump's supporters to consider vigilantism and political violence as a way to address social problems. The latter is not a far-fetched, abstract concern, either, but a real, already-existing social phenomenon that could definitely get worse. In no context is it appropriate for a presidential candidate -- much less a former or sitting president -- to ""joke"" about law enforcement brutalizing the public, especially in a country plagued by police violence.

Cheung's attempt to frame Trump's authoritarian remarks as a reflection of his commitment to ""law and order"" is preposterous. Trump is suggesting that police should be able to operate outside the constraints of the law to achieve the social goal of reducing crime; in other words, suspending regular law to achieve order. And the worldview underpinning Trump's preferred social order is, of course, reactionary -- it's about protecting the powerful and dominating those who challenge them.

Trump's vision of ""one rough hour"" echoes his rhetoric about being ""dictator for one day"" to crack down on illegal immigration and drill for oil wherever he wants. In both scenarios Trump invokes the threat of a crisis (surging crime or migration across the border) to legitimize the idea of extraordinary power (unconstrained executive power or police brutality) to achieve an end.

Trump tries to frame this as compatible with democracy and the rule of law by framing the exercise of that extraordinary power as temporary. This is, of course, a familiar playbook for autocratic leaders, who argue that crises require exceptions (ostensibly temporarily) to the rules to tackle them. But somehow the crises -- and the special rules to solve them -- seem to extend indefinitely. The reality is that rules are rules only because everyone follows them. Once you argue that you alone need an exception to the rule to govern, then you're in effect arguing that you don't believe in rules.

If Trump wins the White House again, would he be able to pursue a special police ""purge""? Not through any conventional laws or institutions. But everything he's said, especially since 2020, has made it clear that he's interested in trying, and the courts and half of Congress seem willing to let him."
Opinion | Trump's brand of masculinity puts his own followers' health at risk,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-masculinity-gun-violence-suicide-prevention-rcna173360,2024-10-01T10:34:37Z,"Trump leads a movement of men who are indifferent to suffering, averse to health guidance and overly agitated. And it's putting America's men in danger.

This post is the second in ""MAGA and Masculinity in 2024,"" an ongoing series examining the societal fallout from right-wing hypermasculinity -- and the people fighting its toxic messaging by positively redefining what it means to be a man. You can read the first post here.

Former President Donald Trump's MAGA movement is a hypermasculine cult of personality, in which men are encouraged to remain stoic, inflict harm on others and ignore experts in favor of the advice of tough-talking podcasters. We've seen the ways this kind of machismo has hurt the movement's perceived nemeses.

Women have suffered -- even died -- while being denied abortion care. And a recent study from the Trevor Project links state-level anti-trans laws to a spike in attempted suicides by trans teenagers. In the name of upholding arcane gender roles, the male-dominated MAGA movement has relentlessly infringed on other people's health and well-being.

But MAGA masculinity poses health risks to its hosts, too, particularly with regard to mental health and susceptibility to gun violence. The MAGA movement's toxic mix of ignorance, vitriol and bravado poses a threat to the men most likely to be drawn to it.

The Covid-19 pandemic was a clear example. Trump and his supporters portrayed defiance of public health measures, like wearing masks and practicing social distancing, as matters of manhood and toughness. Studies have shown that this kind of toxic masculinity was a major driver of vaccine hesitancy in men, which in turn was a contributing factor to the disproportionately high excess death rate for Republicans after the Covid vaccines became available.

Trump has only leaned in to his hypermasculine anti-science agenda by promoting his ""Make America Healthy Again"" slogan with anti-vax conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an archetype for toxic masculinity in his own right, who has reportedly been promised a role in Trump's administration if Trump wins the election and has promoted the idea of banning U.S. agencies from studying infectious diseases.

In 2022, NBC News reported on a study that linked conservative policies to higher mortality rates among working-age people.

According to the NBC News report:

The overwhelming majority of gun violence in the U.S. is committed by men, and activists and researchers have long pointed to hypermasculinity as key to gun culture and a driver of gun violence -- both self-harm and violence committed against others.

And the MAGA movement has done a great deal to discourage men from receiving the mental health care and attention they need to thrive. We see this in the right-wing attack on suicide prevention programs and ""social and emotional learning"" programs in school, which experts have used to help boys better process their emotions. Evidence shows that fear and stigmatization make men less likely to receive the mental health care they need. And yet it even found a way to stigmatize mental health and demonize immigrants at the same time by falsely claiming the Biden administration is welcoming them from ""insane asylums"" and ""mental institutions.""

MAGA men get the message, and it's just one of many ways they've endangered their own health -- and others' -- thanks to their allegiance to Trump."
Opinion | JD Vance isn't ready,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-trump-vice-president-job-qualifications-rcna173109,2024-10-01T10:34:36Z,"The first-term senator doesn't have nearly the experience necessary to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.

Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, hope to use Tuesday night's vice presidential debate to bolster their respective running mates' chances in November. Facing a yawning favorability gap with Walz, Vance is readying via both traditional mock debates -- with Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., standing in for Walz -- and the constant back-and-forth Vance keeps up with reporters on the trail.

But as vice president, Vance would have to be ready for one main task: assuming the presidency. It is a duty that nine vice presidents before him have had to fulfill. It is also a possibility we need to discuss given that if Donald Trump returns to the White House, he would be the oldest person ever sworn in as president. Unfortunately, Vance is in no way ready to step in should Trump be no longer able to function as president.

It's true that the vice presidency itself was originally something of an afterthought for the country's founders. They tasked the vice president with presiding over the Senate only to give the role something concrete to do besides be a backup executive. But Article II, which supposedly lays out what happens if a vacancy occurs in the presidency, isn't crystal clear: It says only ""In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President.""

The lack of specificity was a problem from its first major test, when President William Henry Harrison died in 1841 after just 31 days in office. The question that Vice President John Tyler faced was whether he would be an ""acting"" or ""temporary"" president, one who merely took on the tasks of the presidency, or would he succeed to the office himself. Tyler decided on the latter, immediately taking the presidential oath of office. And though he was never a popular chief executive, nobody seemed inclined to challenge this new precedent regarding presidential succession.

In modern times, the vice president's role has grown beyond the constitutional duties assigned to include whatever policy portfolios the president delegates. But the essential duty remains stepping into the presidency if required. It's almost certain that the debate moderators will ask Vance and Walz whether they feel up to the job at some point during the debate.

Of course, both candidates will say ""yes"" if they are asked; what matters is how many viewers believe their answers. And looking at the experience the two candidates have, there's much more evidence to support Walz's readiness than that of Vance. The Democrat is in his second term as governor of Minnesota, giving him years of practice running an executive office. Before that, he spent 12 years in the House, getting an up-close look at how the federal government functions and the way the legislative sausage gets made.

In contrast, Vance is in just his second year as an elected official. He has passed no major legislation, and several of those bills that he has submitted have had no co-sponsors at all. Before winning his seat in 2022, he was an author and a Silicon Valley gadabout and served four years in the Marines, mostly as a war correspondent.

This makes Vance the least experienced vice presidential candidate since then-Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska was tapped to join the GOP ticket in 2008. The public was deeply skeptical of Palin's readiness to lead after less than two years as governor, according to a USA Today/Gallup poll taken the day Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chose her as his running mate. Of those surveyed, 39% said she was ""ready to serve as president if needed,"" with 33% saying she wasn't and 29% having ""no opinion"" about the then-unknown governor. At the time, that was ""the lowest vote of confidence in a running mate since the elder George Bush chose then-Indiana senator Dan Quayle to join his ticket in 1988,"" according to ABC News.

Incredibly, Vance has managed to beat that record. According to a late July poll from YouGov, only 29% of respondents believed Vance ready to serve as president, with 38% percent saying he isn't and another 33% unsure. Vance performed slightly better in YouGov's August poll -- climbing to 30% who thought he's ready -- but still trailed Walz on that front.

Despite this, if elected Vance could very well become the latest vice president to ascend to the Oval Office in the middle of an administration. It's true that Trump himself had never served in office and held almost no experience to become president when he was inaugurated in 2017. But after four years in the White House, even he has more qualifications than Vance.

It's even more striking when you consider Vice President Kamala Harris' résumé. She's spent her entire career in public service, going from being San Francisco's district attorney to attorney general of California to a four-year senator before her current place a heartbeat away from the presidency. President Joe Biden's quick endorsement of her after he dropped out speaks to his confidence in her. Meanwhile, when Trump was asked whether Vance could step into his shoes ""on day one, if necessary,"" the former president changed the topic entirely to be about himself.

And yet even with that massive gap in their experience, when Harris took over the top of the ticket in late July, Vance claimed to be upset he wouldn't be facing her himself. ""Talk about take-backs,"" he said. ""I was told I was going to get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump's going to get to debate her. I'm kind of pissed off about that if I'm being honest with you.""

That's a level of self-regard that I couldn't even begin to muster. Can you imagine, seeing how well Harris handled Trump while arguing to become the next president, how thoroughly she would have dismantled Vance in an undercard event? Instead, we'll have to settle for Walz's performance on Tuesday, as he makes clear that only one person on that stage can be trusted to take on the second-highest office in the land."

Tim Walz and JD Vance will face each other on the debate stage Tuesday night, with both vice presidential nominees aiming to further introduce themselves to voters and draw a contrast between their visions for the country.

The debate will be hosted by CBS News in its New York studios at 9 p.m. ET, without a live audience. MSNBC will simulcast the debate live, with prime-time coverage beginning at 7 p.m. ET, and MSNBC's live blog will provide updates and expert analysis in real time.

Two of CBS News' veteran anchors, Norah O'Donnell of ""CBS Evening News"" and Margaret Brennan of ""Face the Nation,"" will be the moderators.

The debate may help sway the critical undecided voters whom both campaigns are hoping to win over. Polls have shown Kamala Harris and Donald Trump neck and neck in battleground states, setting up an election that could be decided by potentially razor-thin margins in a handful of states.

Walz and Vance have hit the campaign trail hard since being chosen as running mates, and they each have served a different function for their ticket. Walz, the governor of Minnesota, was selected in part to broaden the Democratic campaign's appeal among voters who are unsure about Harris. Meanwhile, Vance, a U.S. senator representing Ohio, is largely seen as someone who can shore up Trump's support among his base.

Although most voters surveyed have said they are unfamiliar with either VP candidate, polls have consistently shown that more voters have a favorable view of Walz than they do of Vance. Part of that may be due to resurfaced remarks by Vance about women and families, comments that have led to widespread and persistent backlash. Walz, on the other hand, has been targeted by Republicans, but those attacks have not quite caught on outside of conservative circles."
How Usha Vance has played a quietly supportive role in her husband's political career,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/who-is-usha-vance-jd-vance-wife-politics-election-rcna172863,2024-10-01T10:34:23Z,"Despite speculation over her politics, Usha Vance has given no indication that she does not support her husband's shift from being a Never Trumper to the torchbearer of the next MAGA generation.

Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, has played the role of supportive spouse on the campaign trail. Yet the lawyer has been subject to intense scrutiny: Her professional career has been dissected, her image has been contrasted with those of other women in Donald Trump's orbit, and, most of all, her politics have been widely speculated upon.

Usha Vance, who comes from a family of academics, has had a wildly successful career in law. She studied at the prestigious Yale Law School, clerked for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he was an appeals court judge and then was a clerk to Chief Justice John Roberts. She went on to work as a trial lawyer at Munger, Tolles & Olson, a position she left when her husband became Trump's running mate.

A child of Indian immigrants who grew up in a middle-class neighborhood in San Diego, she met her future husband at Yale. The couple married in 2014 and have three children.

JD Vance has spoken highly of his wife. In a 2020 interview on Megyn Kelly's podcast, he said, ""I'm one of those guys who really benefits from having sort of a powerful female voice over his left shoulder saying, 'Don't do that; do that.'"" He added that she now serves as that guiding figure for him.

Her husband's extreme views have become well known, but Usha Vance's politics have largely remained a question mark. Reporting has indicated that she has historically leaned liberal or centrist. According to The New York Times, she was a registered Democrat as recently as 2014. In July, The Washington Post reported that some of her friends and associates watched in ""disbelief"" as she spoke at the Republican National Convention, where her husband was officially nominated as Trump's running mate.

Usha Vance has accompanied her husband on the campaign trail, but she has largely avoided carving out a public persona of her own. She has sat down for only one media interview -- with Fox News -- since her husband's nomination, during which she found herself defending her husband's denigrating comments about ""childless cat ladies"" as just a ""quip.""

She has been the target of racist attacks from the right -- including from white nationalist Nick Fuentes, who has socialized with Trump. Yet she has given no public indication that she does not support her husband's political shift from conservative Never Trumper to the torchbearer of the next generation of the MAGA movement.

In her interview with Fox News in August, Usha Vance said she and her husband disagree on politics sometimes, but that she has faith in his ""intention.""

""We're two different people -- we have lots of different backgrounds and interests and things like that,"" she said. ""So we come to different conclusions all the time. But that's part of the fun of being married. And what I never doubt about JD, even when I disagree about this or that, is his intention, what it is that he really wants to do."""
"As FEMA prepares for Hurricane Milton, it battles rumors surrounding Helene recovery",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/fema-misinformation-helene-milton-hurricane-aid-recovery-468b036784b1db05937e9a34d0146041,2024-10-08T23:24:46Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The rumors surrounding Hurricane Helene are many. There are false claims that people taking federal relief money could see their land seized. Or that $750 is the most they will ever get to rebuild. Or that the agency's director -- on the ground since the storm hit -- was beaten up and hospitalized.

As the U.S. agency tasked with responding to disasters, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been fighting misinformation since Helene slammed into Florida nearly two weeks ago and brought a wide swath of destruction as it headed north. The false claims are being fueled by former President Donald Trump and others just ahead of the presidential election, and are coming as the agency is gearing up to respond to a second major disaster: Hurricane Milton is set to strike Florida on Wednesday.

FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters Tuesday that she has never seen the disinformation problem as bad as it's been with Helene, which hit hard in North Carolina, a state key to winning the election.

""It's absolutely the worst that I have ever seen,"" an uninjured Criswell said.

She said the online rumors are demoralizing for staff or volunteers who have left family behind to deploy to a disaster zone. And she said there's a real risk that local residents will hear these rumors and be too afraid to apply for the help they're entitled to.

Drew Reisinger, a Democratic registrar of deeds in Buncombe County, North Carolina, said part of the problem is that the affected regions have been largely without means of communication, so outside voices have an easier time setting the narrative.

""It's almost easier to let misinformation happen when all of our phone lines and internet lines have been down for so many days that we can't refute it,"" he said.

For days after Helene hit, his office did wellness checks when relatives or friends reached out to say that they hadn't been able to get in touch with people in the area. The vast majority of people were OK. But at one point, his office said it had done 15,000 wellness checks and that was mistakenly interpreted as meaning 15,000 people were missing.

He pushed back on suggestions that relief supplies weren't getting to people.

""Even in my office and the registered deeds office, we are taking so much stuff out into every holler, and we're finding that there's already so much food and water at every local Baptist church ... at the Elks Club and at the homeless shelter,"" he said.

U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards, a North Carolina Republican, put out a statement Tuesday debunking ""outrageous rumors"" that FEMA is halting trucks from bringing in supplies, abandoning rescue efforts to bulldoze the mountain town of Chimney Rock, is running out of money and more. FEMA also has set up a website debunking conspiracy theories.

But others questioned where FEMA and other help has been. Pete Loftin and Crystal Pierce Clontz were talking Monday outside a donation center set up in Sunny View, North Carolina. They compared notes about how many bars they had been able to get on their cellphones -- not many. Loftin had spent two days trying to cut his way out of his damaged driveway but wasn't sure how he could even apply for FEMA help.

""We all come together and are fending for ourselves,"" he said.

FEMA said Tuesday that federal assistance for survivors of Helene, which has killed 236 people across six states, has hit $286 million. It's also sent about half a million tarps, 210 generators, more than 16 million meals and other supplies to the affected regions.

This is not the first time that rumors have run rampant following a disaster, although experts say social media has supercharged the phenomenon. Criswell said they ran into similar problems in 2023 after a massive wildfire in Maui.

During Helene, false claims have swirled that residents will only get $750 from FEMA and nothing more. That amount specifically refers to one-time payments that people can receive for immediate needs like buying medicine or baby food. People also can apply for a host of other types of assistance, like money for rent while they're displaced or money to store their belongings while they repair their homes.

The agency also has been falsely accused of confiscating donations intended for Helene and pivoting those supplies to Ukraine. Those are separate pots of money distributed by Congress.

The Institute for Strategic Dialogue has tracked the disinformation and misinformation circulating in Helene's wake. The London-based think tank that tracks online hate, disinformation and extremism said it found 33 posts on the platform X containing claims already debunked by FEMA or others that had generated 160 million views as of Monday.

After a disaster, there's usually a period where residents work together to dig out and get supplies to strangers and friends alike, said Jeannette Sutton, an assistant professor at the University of Albany who studies how best to communicate with people during a disaster.

But at some point, there is often a transition where that altruism is replaced by a feeling of competition for resources. She's concerned about what disinformation could do to push communities into competition even faster.

""You can imagine that if people started to come in from the outside kind of stirring things up, that that could help to kind of push people into that more corrosive environment,"" she said.

It's all coming as FEMA is preparing for Hurricane Milton, which is set to hit Florida's Tampa region Wednesday. Agency officials have said repeatedly that they can respond to multiple disasters at once -- a message that Criswell hammered home Tuesday.

""FEMA has done this before. We manage complex incidents. We've managed multiple complex incidents,"" she said.

Craig Fugate, who was FEMA administrator during the Obama administration and before that was Florida's director of emergency management, reinforced that message.

He said the agency historically has been designed to be able to respond to two major disasters at any one time as well as a number of medium to small disasters. They have layers of staffing that can be deployed, ranging from reservists who get called up to work a disaster to staff at headquarters who agree when they're hired to deploy as needed.

The agency can pull staff working on long-term disaster recovery to focus on what's needed immediately -- such as Milton response -- and can pull from other parts of the Homeland Security Department if needed, Fugate said.

Criswell said the agency has enough money right now to respond to both Helene and Milton. But she did raise concerns that the agency could run into problems around December or January if it doesn't get more funding. In that case, they might have to pull back from long-term recovery projects to conserve money for the next big disaster, unless they get more funding from Congress.

Another agency key to disaster recovery is ringing the alarm that funds are running low. The Small Business Administration gives loans to uninsured or underinsured homeowners and to businesses to help them rebuild. President Joe Biden said in a letter to Congress that aid could run out ""in a matter of weeks"" if more federal funding is not approved.

"Trump calls Maine Gov. Janet Mills a man in a mistake-riddled call to supporters, newspaper reports",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-janet-mills-gender-maine-call-64caded389dd4a0c6b39edb7473fe8c4,2024-10-08T22:10:21Z,"BANGOR, Maine (AP) -- Republican Donald Trump mixed up Democratic Gov. Janet Mills' gender on a phone call with supporters in Maine, The Bangor Daily News reported Tuesday.

The newspaper obtained a recording of the call in which Trump attacked Mills on immigration, saying the governor is going to turn Maine into a ""third world"" country. Trump was trying to energize voters on Monday, the first day of early voting in the state.

Trump referred to the state's first female governor as ""he"" several times while accusing her of seeking to ""resettle 75,000 migrants"" at the behest of the Biden administration. ""He's weak and ineffective, and they told him to do so, and he's saying, 'Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. I will do it,'"" Trump said, referring to Mills, who's serving a second term.

Conservatives have conflated a 2019 economic plan that calls for growing the workforce by 75,000 with a separate Office of New Americans created by the governor last year, portraying her as only seeking foreign-born people.

Mills referred to Trump's opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris, in a brief retort on X: ""He better get used to recognizing women. He's about to get beat by one.""

There was no immediate response from the Trump campaign.

Maine is important to Trump. The state is one of two that divide electoral votes by congressional district, and Trump won a single electoral vote in 2016 and 2020 in the state's 2nd Congressional District.

Trump also merged two different parts of the Gulf of Maine -- a 277-square-mile (717-square-kilometer) contested ""gray zone"" near Canada and a national marine monument comprising 5,000 square miles (12,910 square kilometers) that he opened to lobstering while president. The ""gray zone"" is subject of a long-running territorial dispute while the national marine monument is far offshore -- too far for most lobster fishermen to utilize.

""The Canadians are able to fish there, but the Americans aren't. We're going to open it up,"" Trump said. ""You're going to have Maine lobster and you're going to have it right near you. Think of it, 5,000 square miles."""
Georgia State Election Board and Atlanta's Fulton County spar over election monitor plan,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/fulton-county-georgia-election-monitor-state-election-board-def361d5de62242f553c61d1d55416e0,2024-10-08T22:08:48Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- With less than a month to go before voters head to the polls, the State Election Board is embroiled in a fight with Georgia's most populous county over a monitoring team to observe the county's election practices.

The monitoring team was part of a resolution of a complaint against Fulton County stemming from the 2020 election. The State Election Board in May found that the county violated some parts of the state election code. It voted to issue a letter of reprimand, which included instructions for an agreement on a mutually acceptable monitor to be entered into by the board's August meeting.

But the county and state election boards have been unable reach agreement. The county favors a team proposed by Ryan Germany, a former chief lawyer for the secretary of state's office, and the Atlanta-based Carter Center. The Donald Trump-endorsed majority on the State Election Board has proposed an alternative slate that includes people who questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election.

In late August the county went ahead and hired its team without agreement from the state board, and it has been in place monitoring pre-election practices for over a month. But the disagreement between the county and state boards continued to fester and escalated significantly this week.

On Monday the Fulton County board filed a lawsuit asking a judge to declare that the state board lacks the authority to force it ""to accept, and Fulton County to pay for, additional monitors for the 2024 election that have been hand-picked by certain State Election Board members.""

At a State Election Board meeting Tuesday, member Janice Johnston said the county doesn't seem to be holding up its part of the bargain. She had voted against the agreement because she didn't believe the investigation into the original complaint was complete and has repeatedly tried unsuccessfully to reopen it.

Johnston proposed subpoenaing a trove of 2020 election documents from the Fulton County clerk of court. She and the other two Republican members of the board voted for the subpoena over the objections of the lone Democratic member and the nonpartisan chair, who pointed out that the state attorney general said the case was closed and could not be reopened.

An Aug. 19 legal opinion written by state Attorney General Chris Carr and obtained by The Associated Press says final decisions of the State Election Board are ""preclusive"" and that ""re-litigation of all claims which have already been adjudicated, or which could have been adjudicated, is therefore prohibited."" Fulton County attorneys assert that the approval of the motion at the May meeting and resulting reprimand meant the case is closed and can't be reopened, and that ""argument is likely correct,"" Carr wrote.

Asked about the attorney general's guidance, Johnston said, ""That was opinion. That's not a legal finding. That was their advice or opinion. We have different opinions about that.""

Fulton is home to about 11% of the state's electorate and includes most of Atlanta. Problems with its elections, including long lines and slow reporting of results, have drawn national scrutiny. Then-President Trump falsely asserted that widespread voter fraud in Fulton County during the 2020 presidential election cost him the state.

After a particularly problematic primary that year, the county and the State Election Board formally agreed to assign an independent monitor to examine county's election practices during the general. He documented ""sloppy processes"" and ""systemic disorganization"" but found no evidence of illegality or fraud.

Fulton County's elections have been closely watched since then, and the State Election Board voted last year not to take over its elections after a performance review found the county showed marked improvement.

The county and the secretary of state's office both signed off in July on a team proposed by Germany, who also was part of the team that did the performance review. The county also rejected a proposal from Johnston.

The Republican majority on the State Election Board repeatedly said during meetings in August that they did not approve of the county's team. But the county board reaffirmed its selection, and county commissioners voted to approve the contract days later.

The state board Republicans in September repeated their dissatisfaction, and Johnston suggested that she and board chair John Fervier meet with Fulton County election board chair Sherri Allen.

Fervier said at Tuesday's meeting that they met last week, that Johnston proposed that the monitoring team be expanded and that the state board sent a list of eight proposed members. Allen told them the county commissioners would have to make the change, and Fervier said he believed no action was taken on that front.

Fervier then said he was alerted that morning about the Fulton board's petition to the judge. Johnston said she interpreted that as a rejection of the monitoring team members they proposed and accused the local board of not complying with its obligation under the agreement."
Democrats hope the latest court rulings restricting abortion energize voters as election nears,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-rulings-election-trump-harris-texas-georgia-b17211cd0fe92a6454878169b1730207,2024-10-08T21:13:59Z,"CHICAGO (AP) -- Two court rulings this week have delivered major blows to reproductive rights in Texas and Georgia but, during a crucial time in the election cycle, Democrats are seizing on them in an attempt to energize voters who support abortion access.

Advocates hope the rulings will serve as reminders about what's at stake in a post-Roe America just weeks before a presidential election that has been partly defined by competing visions of abortion rights and the sometimes harrowing consequences for women living in states with abortion bans.

""Every time our opponents say the policies we have in place are fine and not as extreme as you think, this continual drumbeat of headlines illustrates the reality and galvanizes voters,"" said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, which is providing money and other support for several ballot measure campaigns hoping to preserve or strengthen abortion rights.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday left in place a lower court decision that bans emergency abortions that violate Texas law. The same day, the Georgia Supreme Court halted a ruling that had struck down the state's near-total abortion ban.

Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, took the opportunity to remind voters of the threats her campaign says a second Trump presidency poses to reproductive rights and his role in overturning Roe v. Wade, which once granted a federal right to abortion. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the constitutional right to abortion that had stood for 50 years.

""Because of extreme Trump Abortion Bans in states across the country, including Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia, women are facing horrific consequences to their health and lives -- even death,"" Harris posted on X. ""Let me be clear: Donald Trump is the architect of this health care crisis.""

Monday's rulings are just the latest court decisions around reproductive rights to ripple through this year's races for president and Congress. In February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos can be considered children, a decision that temporarily halted in vitro fertilization treatments and threw the lives of couples seeking fertility treatments into chaos.

In April, the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a near total abortion ban from 1864 -- when the state was only a U.S. territory. The Legislature repealed it months later, but not until after the issue had galvanized abortion rights supporters in a state that will help determine the presidency and control of the Senate.

Kristi Hamrick, spokesperson for the national anti-abortion group Students for Life Action, accused Democrats of ""latching onto anything and blaming losses on anyone but themselves in a desperate attempt to get votes."" She celebrated the two rulings Monday and expressed hopes the anti-abortion wins will instead energize voters against abortion.

""We're grateful for these wins and hopeful they may add some wind in our sails,"" she said.

In Texas, the state's abortion ban - one of the strictest in the country - is playing a role in the Senate race between the Republican incumbent, Sen. Ted Cuz, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred. The weekend before Monday's ruling, Allred vowed to restore Roe v. Wade at a campaign event in Fort Worth.

Other Democrats in the statehouse, including Texas Rep. Donna Howard, also expressed outrage at the rulings. She accused the courts of ""willfully ignoring the dangerous reality many pregnant Texans are forced to endure if they experience severe pregnancy complications.""

In Georgia, one of the seven presidential battleground states, the state supreme court's ruling comes on the heels of outrage over the deaths of Georgia women Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, who died after being denied immediate care that was attributed to the state's restrictive laws.

Georgia voters are watching these stories about the impact of the state's abortion restrictions and ""they will bring that to the polls"" during the presidential election, said Jessica Arons, a director of policy and government affairs at the ACLU. But these headlines might also energize voters in contests up and down the ballot, including citizen-led ballot measures in nine states aiming to protect abortion rights, she said.

Support for legal abortion has risen since the Supreme Court eliminated protections two years ago, according to a July poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Around 6 in 10 Americans think their state should generally allow a person to obtain a legal abortion for any reason if they don't want to be pregnant. That represents an increase from June 2021, a year before the Supreme Court decision, when about half of Americans thought legal abortion should be possible under these circumstances.

Many experts and advocates have credited this shift to Americans' reactions to the abortion restrictions affecting a wide swath of the country since Roe was overturned. Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy while another four ban it after six weeks -- before many women know they're pregnant.

""It's hard to say how much voters are following each development, but it's clear abortion is still an incredibly salient issue, and these are reminders of why as we head closer to November,"" Arons said. ""As courts and politicians continue to play ping-pong with women's lives, ballot measures will be especially important.""

Only about half the states allow citizen-led ballot initiatives. Georgia and Texas, states where Republicans control the Legislature and governor's office, are not among them.

Lauren Brenzel, campaign director for a coalition aiming to enshrine abortion rights into the Florida Constitution, said the Georgia Supreme Court ruling only adds to a ""public health crisis in the Southeast.""

Florida is the only state in the Southeast that allows citizen-led ballot initiatives, Brenzel said. If Floridians vote in favor of abortion rights, the state may become a major access point for Georgians seeking abortions. The Florida amendment needs at least 60% support to pass.

""It raises the stakes for us here in Florida,"" Brenzel said.

After the Arizona Supreme Court revived the Civil War-era ban on nearly all abortions, a coalition organizing around a statewide ballot measure to protect abortion rights reported a surge in donations, volunteers and interest. Laura Dent, the coalition's political director, said it's evidence that voters are paying attention and taking action.

""Arizonans are seeing these headlines,"" she said. ""This and all the whiplash we've seen since the Dobbs decision really brought into focus for Arizona voters how we need to protect this right, and I think that will be reflected in November.""

Lawsuit seeks to reopen voter registration in Georgia after Hurricane Helene,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-elections-registration-lawsuit-hurricane-helene-b8b034f7b1dfb3fa3dee0f61e1423a72,2024-10-08T21:11:21Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- Three voting rights groups are asking a federal judge to order the state of Georgia to reopen voter registration for November's elections due to Hurricane Helene.

The groups argue in a lawsuit filed Monday in federal court in Atlanta that damage and disruptions from Hurricane Helene unfairly deprived people of the opportunity to register last week, in advance of the state's Monday registration deadline.

The lawsuit filed by the Georgia conference of the NAACP, the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda and the New Georgia Project seeks to have registration reopened through Oct. 14. All three groups say they had to cancel voter registration activities last week. Historically, there's a spike in Georgia voter registrations just before the deadline, the plaintiffs said.

""Absent action by this court, the likely thousands of voters who could not register while power was down, roads were impassible and county election and post offices were closed will be unfairly disenfranchised, an injury that can never be undone,"" the plaintiffs wrote in court papers seeking a temporary restraining order reopening registration from U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross.

The judge scheduled a Wednesday hearing on the request.

A spokesperson for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who oversees statewide voter rolls, declined to comment Tuesday, saying the office doesn't talk about pending lawsuits.

Georgia has 8.2 million registered voters, according to online records from Raffensperger's office. But with Georgia having been decided by only 12,000 votes in 2020, a few thousand votes could make a difference in whether Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris wins the state's 16 electoral votes. A number of issues related to elections in Georgia are already being litigated.

The lawsuit says the storm kept people with driver's licenses from registering online because of widespread power and internet outages in the eastern half of the state, and kept people from registering in person because at least 37 county election offices were closed for parts of last week. The lawsuit also notes that mail pickup and delivery was suspended in 27 counties, including Augusta, Savannah, Statesboro, Dublin and Vidalia.

The suit notes that a court in South Carolina extended that state's registration deadline after Helene and that courts in Georgia and Florida extended registration deadlines after 2016's Hurricane Matthew. In North Carolina, which was more heavily impacted by Hurricane Helene, the registration deadline isn't until Friday. Voters there can also register and cast a ballot simultaneously during the state's early in-person voting period, which runs from Oct. 17 through Nov. 2.

The Georgia plaintiffs argue that the shutdown of voter registration violates their rights under the First Amendment and 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection and due process to all citizens. They also say the shutdown violates a provision of the 1993 National Voter Registration Act that requires states to accept voter registrations submitted or mailed up to 30 days before an election.

At least 40 advocacy groups asked Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Raffensperger to extend the registration deadline in affected counties before the Georgia lawsuit was filed.

The NAACP Legal Defense Fund also sent a similar letter to Florida officials, including Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and Secretary of State Cord Byrd."

""I say: Bring your pet. Bring your dog and cat. I am a Haitian, and I am not going to eat them,"" said the Rev.

It was the first of several laugh-triggering allusions that speakers made in reference to a Sept. 10 debate remark by former President Donald Trump, who falsely alleged that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are ""eating the pets of the people that live there.""

Such rumors, which spread like wildfire on social media, have been debunked. But advocates remain concerned about the effects of hostile rhetoric aimed at Haitians and other immigrants.

The Blessing of the Animals is an early October rite observed by various Christian denominations in honor of St. Francis, a widely loved Medieval saint known for cherishing the poor and the animal kingdom. Owners bring household pets and sometimes livestock to receive a clerical blessing that acknowledges their importance to God.

This year in New Hampshire's capital, however, the service was also about depicting an embattled immigrant group as worthy of trust and empowerment to offer blessings on God's behalf. That reframing drew new participants who wanted to show solidarity.

""This year the Blessing of Animals takes on a new, even prophetic, meaning,"" wrote the Rt. Rev. Robert Hirschfeld, Episcopal bishop of New Hampshire, as he invited the whole diocese in Concord to participate. ""Our gathering of blessing, instead of cursing, can be seen as an act of resistance to a culture that is fomenting violence of thought, speech, and action.""

At the event, Hirschfeld compared the church's response to that of Jesus, who defies Herod in Luke 13 and keeps on blessing the people.

""This is a way of turning the energy of the world on its head,"" Hirschfeld said after the event. ""Let's turn this into a blessing rather than continuing with the vitriol.""

For observers of New Hampshire politics, the event got noticed as politically notable.

Andrew Smith, a pollster and professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire, said the event keeps Trump's remark in the public consciousness ""for at least another weekend ... and if you're explaining, you're losing.""

""We may be having a little bit of ecumenical trolling going on by the Episcopal Church against Republicans and particularly against the message that's coming out of Springfield, Ohio,"" Smith said. ""I won't be surprised if this is intentionally pushed out to the wider U.S. by the organizers and sponsors of the event in a way that really makes a point about Haitian immigrants.""

Debra Ragen-Coffman of Concord said she had never before attended a Blessing of the Animals but thought it was ""especially important"" to take part this year. She was inspired to bring Tula, her Coton dog, after a friend passed along a post about the ""blessing as resistance.""

""I would not have come just for a Blessing of the Animals, but I definitely wanted to be here to participate in a community of love and resistance to the hatred that is being spread around our country,"" Ragen-Coffman said.

Organizers sought to maximize visibility for what's normally a low-key affair. The event normally happens indoors, but this year it moved outdoors, where downtown dog walkers could easily jump in or delight in seeing all the creatures assembled to be blessed by a Haitian priest in a collar.

Concord Mayor Byron Champlin brought extra attention to the event by taking part and sharing thoughts on the New Testament idea of being united as one body.

Pets and their owners got a few extra helpings as Beniste made the most of his role as blesser. He prayerfully laid hands on every dog, printout photos of cats and electronic images of deceased pets displayed on cell phones. He later moved among the crowd feeding treats to dogs and sprinkling owners with holy water.

""I like doing this!"" Beniste, who has been pastor at St. Paul since December, said with a big smile as he shook droplets of holy water on bowed heads under a bright, warm October sun.

As fun as the event was for Beniste and other participants, the priest also used it to remind people that Haitians are ""having a very hard time"" in Springfield, in Haiti and elsewhere.

The event's invitation included a call to contribute to the Haitian Community Help and Support Center in Springfield. Next year, the event in Concord is apt to be even broader in its scope, reach and meaning.

""I want to make it bigger,"" Beniste said of the annual Blessing of the Animals at St. Paul's. ""Next time, I want to connect with all the animal shelters and the police station. Anywhere that we have animals, we can bring people together."""
"US scrambled to urge Putin not to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Woodward book says",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-putin-biden-nuclear-weapons-90cb3bb3499a5e211095b3f93173a575,2024-10-08T20:33:08Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Months into Russia's war in Ukraine, the United States had intelligence pointing to ""highly sensitive, credible conversations inside the Kremlin"" that President Vladimir Putin was seriously considering using nuclear weapons to avoid major battlefield losses, journalist Bob Woodward reported in his new book, ""War.""

The U.S. intelligence pointed to a 50% chance that Putin would use tactical nukes if Ukrainian forces surrounded 30,000 Russian troops in the southern city of Kherson, the book says. Just months before, in the far northeast, Ukrainian troops had stunned the Russians by recapturing Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and were pivoting to liberate Kherson, strategically located on the Dnieper River not far from the Black Sea.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan stared ""with dread"" at the intelligence assessment -- described as coming from the best sources and methods -- in late September 2022, seven months after Russia's invasion, the book says. It caused alarm across the Biden administration, moving the chance of Russia using nukes up from 5% to 10% to now 50%.

According to Woodward's account, President Joe Biden told Sullivan to ""get on the line with the Russians. Tell them what we will do in response.""

He said to use language that was threatening but not too strong, the book says. Biden also reached out to Putin directly in a message, warning of the ""catastrophic consequences"" if Russia used nuclear weapons.

The famed Watergate reporter's latest book also details Donald Trump's conversations with Putin since leaving office, Biden's frustrations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and more. The Associated Press obtained an early copy of Woodward's book, which is due out next week.

The book provides intriguing inside details about the U.S. assessment of the possibility of Putin deploying nukes, but the Biden administration's concerns that Russia might use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine were not secret. From the president on down, numerous officials warned Putin against it.

Putin and other Kremlin voices also have frequently threatened the West with Russia's nuclear arsenal. In a strong, new warning to the West late last month, Putin said any nation's conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country.

The threat was aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with longer-range weapons and appears to significantly lower the threshold for the possible use of Russia's nuclear arsenal. Biden has held off on allowing Ukraine to hit military targets deeper inside Russia with U.S.-provided missiles over fears of escalating the war, even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleads for permission.

In another heated conversation laid out in Woodward's book, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confronted his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, in October 2022.

""We know you are contemplating the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine,"" Austin said, according to Woodward. ""Any use of nuclear weapons on any scale against anybody would be seen by the United States and the world as a world-changing event. There is no scale of nuclear weapons that we could overlook or that the world could overlook.""

As Shoigu listened, Austin pressed on, noting that the U.S. had not given Ukraine certain weapons and had restricted the use of some of those it had provided. He warned that those constraints would be reconsidered. He also noted that China, India, Turkey and Israel would isolate Russia if it used nuclear weapons.

""I don't take kindly to being threatened,"" Shoigu responded, the book says.

""Mr. Minister,"" Austin said. ""I am the leader of the most powerful military in the history of the world. I don't make threats.""

The Pentagon noted a call between Austin and Shoigu on Oct. 21, 2022. During the call, Austin ""emphasized the importance of maintaining lines of communication amid the ongoing war against Ukraine,"" according to a readout provided at the time.

U.S. intelligence officials saw China as having the most influence over Russia, and Biden called Chinese President Xi Jinping about the need for deterrence, Woodward wrote.

Xi agreed to warn Putin, according to the book. Biden and Xi met and agreed in November 2022 that ""a nuclear war should never be fought"" and noted their opposition to the use or threat to deploy nuclear weapons in Ukraine, a White House statement said at the time.

In terms of the war starting at all, the book details Biden's criticism late last year of President Barack Obama's handling of Russia seizing Crimea and a section of the Donbas in 2014, at a time when Biden was serving as the Democrat's vice president.

""They f----- up in 2014,"" Woodward wrote that Biden said to a close friend in December, blaming the lack of action for Putin's aggression in Ukraine. ""Barack never took Putin seriously.""

Biden was angry while speaking to the friend and said they ""never should have let Putin just walk in there"" in 2014 and that the U.S. ""did nothing.""

White House spokeswoman Emilie Simons told reporters that ""there are plenty of books that are being written about this administration and others"" and that ""we're not going to comment on each anecdote that may come out of different reporting."""

On an Aleutian island closer to the Russian border than mainland Alaska and more than 4,000 miles from the White House, the question isn't who wins on Election Day. It's who will be the very last American to vote. ""People have a little bit of fun on that day, because, I mean, realistically everybody knows the election's decided way before we're closed,"" said Layton Lockett, the city manager in Adak, Alaska. The country's last polling place to close is the only one still open from midnight ET to 1 a.m., when things wrap up on the island and former World War II military base. The honor of being the last voter was Mary Nelson's in 2012, when the community of a few hundred people did away with early voting in favor of casting ballots in person. She was a poll worker that Election Day, too, meaning her historic moment was short lived. ""When I opened the curtain to come back out, the city manager took my picture ... and they were waiting for us in Nome to call with our vote count,"" she said.

Out of more than 500 counties in the seven battleground states in this year's election, only 10 voted for Trump in 2016 before flipping to Biden in 2020. The first to complete its count this Election Day ought to be North Carolina's Nash County, which by 10 p.m. ET could provide an early indication of which candidate is performing best among the swing voters likely to decide a closely contested White House. That's especially true should there be a decisive winner in the community northeast of Raleigh, unaffected by Hurricane Helene. Two decades have passed since any presidential candidate won Nash by more than a point. Confirmation won't come for hours (or days), but more intelligence will arrive about a half hour later when North Carolina's other Trump-Biden county -- New Hanover on the state's Atlantic Coast -- should wrap up its count. The other eight counties to watch: Erie and Northhampton in Pennsylvania; Maricopa in Arizona; Kent, Saginaw and Leelanau in Michigan and Sauk and Door in Wisconsin.

There's more to Arizona than Maricopa County. Seriously! Yes, it's true that Biden eked out a win in 2020 among the more than 60% of Arizona voters who live in the sprawling home of Phoenix and its suburbs. But Biden may not have won Arizona and its 11 electoral votes without his win in Apache County, where he beat Trump by 11,851 votes out of roughly 35,000 cast. His statewide margin? Just 10,457. Apache County is far from the typical Democratic urban stronghold. Much of the rural county is part of the Navajo Nation, and it also includes lands belonging to the Apache people who gave the county its name. In all, more than 70% of people living there are Native American. America's indigenous population is often overlooked in presidential elections: the states with the largest percentages of Native people - Alaska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and South Dakota - are not often competitive. Arizona's emergence as a battleground makes the voters in Apache County -- and the roughly 5% of Arizonans who are Native American -- a potential factor in this year's election.

Trump won Wisconsin by about 20,000 votes in 2016 - and he and the country had to wait on Milwaukee County to know which way that margin would fall. The state's largest county and Democratic stronghold is one of a handful in Wisconsin that releases results of mail ballots all at once, rather than combining them with other ballots counted at precinct polling places. In 2016, confirmation there weren't enough mail votes left to count in the City of Milwaukee to flip the race from Trump to Hillary Clinton allowed AP to declare the Republican the winner of the state - and the White House. In the 2022 midterms, it was only when AP confirmed there were no ballots remaining to be counted in Milwaukee and Dane County, Wisconsin's other largest source of Democratic votes, that it was able to say incumbent Republican Ron Johnson would return to the Senate. Milwaukee might not be among the final counties in Wisconsin to report its results this year, but don't count out its chances to be the decisive county once it does in this crucial battleground state.

Election officials nationwide found no cases of fraud, vandalism or theft related to the use of drop boxes that that could have affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. And yet no place in this year's election may face more scrutiny than the drop box - a tool designed to make voting easier that's become the source of conspiracy theories that they played a role (they didn't) in stealing the election from Trump (it wasn't). Several states have enacted laws restricting their use since 2020, while in others they remain the subject of fascination. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed itself in July and dumped a ruling that limited drop boxes to only election clerks' offices. Prosecutors are currently investigating allegations that the mayor of Wausau removed the city's drop box last month without consulting with the city clerk. Election officials typically have detailed processes to ensure the security of ballots left in drop boxes, which are often monitored remotely by camera. Still, drop boxes remain a place where opponents wrongly believe their vote is neither safe nor secure."
CBS News says Trump campaign had 'shifting explanations' for why he snubbed '60 Minutes',AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/cbs-60-minutes-trump-pelley-5af94d70ac48f8acf863d902d23ba8a3,2024-10-08T20:19:07Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS News said the Trump campaign offered ""shifting explanations"" for why it backed out of a ""60 Minutes"" interview special with presidential candidates that aired without him.

The network's Scott Pelley appeared on the air Monday night to explain why Republican Donald Trump did not appear on what has become a ""60 Minutes"" tradition: back-to-back interviews with presidential candidates in the last month of the campaign.

Harris was on the show, interviewed by Bill Whitaker. Where Trump was supposed to appear, ""60 Minutes"" instead aired a story about an Arizona official pushing false claims about election fraud.

Pelley said that the Trump campaign ""complained that we would fact-check the interview. We fact-check every story.""

The Trump team also demanded an apology for his interview during the 2020 campaign, where he claimed that correspondent Lesley Stahl said a laptop computer belonging to President Joe Biden's son Hunter came from Russia. ""She never said that,"" Pelley said.

Pelley said that Trump's team had agreed to an interview at the former president's Mar-a-Lago home, with an additional talk in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he returned to the scene of a July assassination attempt.

Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said ""60 Minutes"" ""begged for an interview."" The campaign did have concerns about the show's reporting on Hunter Biden and how it insisted upon editing Trump's comments, he said.

""There was nothing scheduled or agreed upon,"" Cheung said. ""We had already long promised an exclusive in filming at Butler to another national outlet, which turned out the be Fox News.""

Trump's interview with Fox's Laura Ingraham aired an hour before ""60 Minutes"" on Monday night. His absence from CBS was not mentioned in their exchange. Trump apparently, watched, however, posting on Truth Social that the Harris interview ""is considered by many of those who reviewed it, the WORST interview they have ever seen.""

Pelley poked at Trump, noting he had already turned down another opportunity to debate Harris, along with the ""60 Minutes"" interview, ""which may have been the largest audience for the candidates between now and election day.""

Moving ""60 Minutes"" out of its traditional Sunday time slot may have depressed the audience size, however. An estimated 5.4 million people watched on Monday, according to preliminary Nielsen company figures, compared with the 9.6 million who saw the newsmagazine on Sunday, Sept. 29.

No estimate for Trump's audience on Ingraham's show was immediately available. Her show averaged 2.7 million viewers a night last week, Nielsen said.

"Not everything will run perfectly on Election Day. Still, US elections are remarkably reliable",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-voting-election-officials-1979c8ea54aface50641e6ab1241b379,2024-10-08T19:44:57Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- On Election Day, some voting lines will likely be long and some precincts may run out of ballots. An election office website could go down temporarily and ballot-counting machines will jam. Or people who help run elections might just act like the humans they are, forgetting their key to a local polling place so it has to open later than scheduled.

These kinds of glitches have occurred throughout the history of U.S. elections. Yet election workers across America have consistently pulled off presidential elections and accurately tallied the results -- and there's no reason to believe this year will be any different.

Elections are a foundation of democracy. They also are human exercises that, despite all the laws and rules governing how they should run, can sometimes appear to be messy. They're conducted by election officials and volunteers in thousands of jurisdictions across the United States, from tiny townships to sprawling urban counties with more voters than some states have people.

It's a uniquely American system that, despite its imperfections, reliably produces certified outcomes that stand up to scrutiny. That's true even in an era of misinformation and hyperpartisanship.

""Things will go wrong,"" said Jen Easterly, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

None of these will mean the election is tainted or rigged or is being stolen. But Easterly said election offices need to be transparent about the hiccups so they can get ahead of misinformation and attempts to exploit routine problems as a way to undermine confidence in the election results.

""At the end of the day, we need to recognize things will go wrong. They always do,"" Easterly said. ""It will really come down to how state and local election officials communicate about those things going wrong.""

It wasn't that long ago when American voters accepted the results, even if their preferred presidential candidate lost.

Even in 2000, when 104 million votes came down to a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision that effectively made Republican George W. Bush the president, his opponent, Democrat Al Gore, quickly conceded. The republic moved on peacefully.

Times have changed dramatically since then.

The internet, false claims and a voting public susceptible to conspiratorial theories about widespread voter fraud have changed that. Trust in the system is low, particularly among Republican voters whose perceptions have been shaped by a steady drumbeat of lies about the 2020 election by Donald Trump, the former president who is the Republican nominee on the Nov. 5 ballot.

At his campaign rallies, Trump continues to claim that the only way he can lose is if the other side rigs the election. In fact, it would be virtually impossible for anyone to rig a U.S. presidential race given the decentralized nature of the country's elections, which are run by thousands of municipal or county voting jurisdictions.

What is more likely are simple mistakes and technical mishaps that occur during every election.

""When elections are very close and you have to look under the hood, sometimes you find some problems. Almost always those problems are the result of human error, incompetence -- not malfeasance,"" said Rick Hasen, an election law expert and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.

""Both voter fraud and election administrator fraud is currently very rare in the United States. When it does happen, it's not that hard to catch because of the safeguards in the system.""

Distrust in elections is real and has serious consequences. Lies about the 2020 election being rigged were a catalyst for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.

This has come despite Trump and his allies losing dozens of court cases aimed at reversing his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Even a commission Trump created while president to investigate the 2016 election in hopes of identifying widespread voter fraud found none. Special police units established by a few Republican governors came up similarly empty-handed when they searched for widespread fraud during the 2022 midterm elections.

It would be incorrect to say there is never any fraud associated with elections. But in the 2020 election, an Associated Press investigation in the battleground states where Trump disputed his loss found an amount too small to alter the election. In most cases, it was individuals acting alone, not as part of a grand conspiracy to throw the election.

""The story of the last few decades is that voting systems in the United States are very secure,"" said Robert Lieberman, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University.

Basic mistakes, whether human or technical.

In Jackson, Mississippi, a ballot problem was blamed on inexperience and lack of training. In Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, inexperience was again the culprit when polling places ran out of ballots.

Sometimes the envelopes used to return the mailed ballots can create problems. The Pennsylvania Department of State recently announced on X that because of high humidity levels in much of the state, ""some voters are finding that their mail-in ballots have the return envelope already sealed."" It advised voters to contact their local election office for next steps.

Paper was the culprit in a Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022 when the ballot printers had problems and caused large backups in voter lines.

One of the major concerns heading into the 2024 presidential election is the high turnover in election offices across the country, in particular in some of the presidential battlegrounds, said Edward B. Foley, a law professor who leads Ohio State University's election law program.

Before the 2022 midterms, for example, 10 of Nevada's 17 counties had turnover among their clerk or registration positions, which oversee voting.

Threats and harassment from those who believe election conspiracy theories have fueled the attrition. Despite all the training election workers receive, there's no substitute for the experience of going through a major election cycle.

Many of those who have left had years and even decades of experience. In some cases, they have been replaced by people with little or no experience, and who at times have peddled conspiracy theories.

""If you're looking for something to watch out for and be concerned about,"" Foley said, ""that is one place.""

Not all elections look the same. Here are some of the different ways states run their voting,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/ranked-choice-voting-nebraska-california-615e9fbdf7b086dce4227dff01c0df68,2024-10-08T19:44:46Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. general election on Nov. 5 will decide the country's direction, but it is far from a nationally administered contest. The 50 states and the District of Columbia run their own elections, and each does things a little differently.

Here's a look at some notable variations in the 2024 election:

To win the presidency outright, a candidate must receive at least 270 of the 538 votes in the Electoral College. In 48 states, the statewide winner gets all of that state's electoral votes, and that's also the case in the nation's capital.

In Maine and Nebraska, the candidate who receives the most votes in each congressional district wins one electoral vote from that district. The candidate who wins the statewide vote receives another two.

In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden received three of Maine's four electoral votes because he won the popular vote in the state and its 1st Congressional District. Republican Donald Trump received one electoral vote from the 2nd Congressional District. Trump won four of Nebraska's five votes for winning the popular vote in the state as well as its 1st and 3rd Congressional Districts; Biden received one electoral vote for winning the 2nd Congressional District.

In ranked choice voting, voters rank candidates for an office in order of preference on the ballot. If no candidate is the first choice for more than 50% of voters, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Voters who chose that candidate as their top pick have their votes redistributed to their next choice. This continues, with the candidate with the fewest votes getting eliminated, until someone emerges with a majority of votes.

Maine uses ranked choice voting in state-level primaries and for federal offices in the general election. That means Maine voters can rank presidential, Senate and House candidates on ballots that include the Democrat and the Republican who advanced out of their respective party primaries, plus third-party and independent candidates who qualify.

The presidential ballot will include Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris, plus three other candidates. In the six years since implementing ranked choice voting, the state has used it twice in races for Congress in its 2nd Congressional District. The 2020 presidential race did not advance to ranked choice voting, with the winners of the state and in each congressional district exceeding 52% of the vote.

Alaska holds open primaries for statewide offices and sends the top four vote-getters, regardless of party, to the general election, where the winner is decided using ranked choice voting. In all legislative and statewide executive offices, Alaskans can rank up to four names that can include multiple candidates from the same party.

The exception is the presidency, which is eligible for ranked choice voting in Alaska for the first time. This year, there will be eight presidential tickets on the ballot, and Alaskans can rank all candidates if they choose to. The last time the winner of the presidential contest in Alaska failed to surpass 50% of the vote was in 1992, when third-party candidate Ross Perot won almost 20% of the national popular vote.

But in 2022, both Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski won their elections after both went to ranked choice voting.

Another wrinkle this year? In Alaska, where ranked choice voting was implemented by ballot measure in 2020, there's a voter initiative on the ballot this fall to repeal it.

California and Washington hold open primaries in which all candidates run on the same ballot and the two top vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of party. This year, there are two House races in Washington that include candidates of the same party, one with two Republicans and one with two Democrats. There are four in California: three with only Democrats and one with only Republicans.

The winning party in those six districts will be reflected in The Associated Press' online graphic showing the balance of power in the House at poll close, rather than once a winner is declared because the party of the winner is a foregone conclusion.

Louisiana holds what it refers to as its ""open primaries"" on the same day the rest of the country holds its general election. In Louisiana, all candidates run on the same open primary ballot. Any candidate who earns more than 50% of the vote in the primary wins the seat outright.

If no candidate exceeds 50% of the vote, the top two vote-getters advance to a head-to-head runoff, which can end up pitting two Republicans or two Democrats against each other. Louisiana refers to these contests as its ""general election.""

That will change for elections for the U.S. House starting in 2026 when congressional races will have earlier primaries that are open only to registered members of a party. Certain state races will continue to hold open primaries in November, but the change will prevent future members of Congress from waiting until December -- a month later than the rest of the country -- to know whether they are headed to Washington.

In Nebraska, any measure that receives approximately 123,000 valid signatures qualifies for the ballot. This year, two measures relating to abortion met this threshold.

One would enshrine in the Nebraska Constitution the right to have an abortion until fetal viability or later, to protect the health of the pregnant woman. The other would write into the constitution the current 12-week ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the pregnant woman.

This marks the first time since the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade that a state has measures that seek to roll back abortion rights and protect abortion rights on the ballot at the same time.

It's possible voters could end up approving both measures. But because they're competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the measure with the most ""for"" votes will be the one adopted, according to the Nebraska secretary of state.

In primary elections, a handful of states, mostly in the South, go to runoffs if no candidate receives at least 50% of the vote. In races with more than two candidates, runoffs in those states are common. Several states held primary runoffs this year.

Georgia uses the same rules in general elections. The last three Senate races there went to runoffs because a third-party candidate won enough of the vote to prevent the Republican or Democratic nominee from exceeding 50% of the vote.

But this year, runoff possibilities may be confined to downballot races such as state legislature. There's no Senate race there this year, and the U.S. House races have only two candidates on the ballot.

This is common in states that span multiple time zones. In most states, polls close at the same time in each time zone.

The AP will not call the winner of a race before all the polls in a jurisdiction are scheduled to close, even if votes already reported before that time make clear who will win the race. So if there is a statewide race in a state where polls close at 8 p.m. local time, but some of the state is in the Eastern time zone and some of the state is in Central time zone, the earliest the AP can call the winner is 8 p.m. CST/9 p.m. EST.

The AP will still show the results as they arrive from counties with closed polls.

Some of the biggest states with split poll close times are Florida, Michigan, Texas and Oregon. Tennessee is an exception, as even though the state is in both the Eastern and the Central time zones, all counties coordinate their voting to conclude at the same time.

How voting before Election Day became so widespread and so political,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/advance-early-voting-absentee-mail-ballots-0dcd5e94b91410d39c66586a6020464d,2024-10-08T19:44:45Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Voters had plenty to argue about in the 1972 election, but they overwhelmingly agreed that when it came time to vote, they would do so in person on Election Day.

The act of voting was largely a communal experience that year, when roughly 95% of voters went to their local polling places and completed and submitted their ballots in person on a single day, according to a census survey at the time.

That number would fall gradually over the next 50 years as states provided Americans with more options on how and when to vote.

By 2022, only about half of the electorate voted at the polls on Election Day. The share of people voting before Election Day spiked to more than 70% in 2020, and votes cast by mail surpassed those cast on Election Day for the first time ever. That year, many states enacted emergency measures to temporarily expand vote-by-mail options to protect voters from the spread of COVID-19.

""We've been on an upward trend of early voting over time as more states have adopted early voting options and voters have embraced them,"" said University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald, who tracks voter turnout and early voting. ""That's resulted in a greater share of early votes being cast each election cycle.""

For most of that time, advance voting was a nonpartisan feature of elections, but a deep chasm formed between the parties on advance voting during and since the 2020 presidential election.

Voting before Election Day is much more common today than it was roughly 50 years ago. Yet it is highly politicized as voting in the 2024 presidential election is already underway.

Advance voting refers to the range of options that people have to vote before Election Day, whether by mail or in person at an election facility.

The term ""early voting"" can refer collectively to all voting that takes place before Election Day. Sometimes it refers explicitly to votes cast in person at local election offices or voting centers before Election Day.

To avoid confusion, The Associated Press generally uses terms like ""advance voting"" or ""pre-Election Day voting"" to refer to that broader category and ""early in-person voting"" for the narrower one. ""Absentee voting"" usually refers to ballots cast by mail.

Voting before Election Day includes both voting by mail and in-person voting conducted before Election Day.

Early in-person voting tends to mimic the experience of voting in person on Election Day, down to the type of voting equipment used and the locations serving as voting centers. The main difference is that the voting is conducted before Election Day. The length of early in-person voting periods varies by state.

Mail voting can be further divided into at least two smaller categories: ""no-excuse absentee voting,"" where any voter may request a mail ballot for any reason, and ""excuse-required absentee voting,"" where only voters with a valid excuse as to why they cannot vote in person on Election Day may vote by mail.

Requiring an excuse to vote absentee, such as travel or illness, used to be the norm in most states. Today, a shrinking handful of states still require voters to provide an authorized excuse.

A third category of mail voting is a hybrid of mail voting and early in-person voting: in-person absentee voting, where a voter submits (and sometimes fills out) a mail ballot in person at an elections office.

A small but growing number of states conduct their elections predominantly by mail. Those states, plus a few others and the District of Columbia, automatically send every registered voter a ballot.

Variations of absentee voting and voting over multiple days have been part of American elections since the nation's founding. Today's system of mail voting and early in-person voting took root more than a century ago. In 1921, Louisiana paved the way for a formalized early in-person voting system when its constitution specified that ""the Legislature may provide a method by which absentee voting will be permitted other than by mail.""

Voting by mail is even older, but relatively few voters were allowed to take advantage of it as of 1972. Just two years later, Washington became the first state in the nation to allow any voter to request a mail ballot for any reason.

By 2005, more than half the states adopted no-excuse absentee voting. Today, only Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire provide neither early in-person voting nor no-excuse absentee voting.

Yes, but it wasn't always that way.

Voting before Election Day steadily grew more popular in both Democratic and Republican-controlled states after 1972. Although there was a partisan split in some states that sometimes varied from election to election, polling from Gallup shows that nationwide there was little partisan divide on advance voting between 2004 and 2016. But the survey showed that voters' plans to use early voting sharply diverged along party lines in the 2020 presidential election.

AP's VoteCast survey of the 2020 electorate found a similar result, with additional details on how the choice of voting method divided the electorate. About two-thirds of the votes cast by mail in that election were for Democrat Joe Biden, compared with about one-third for Republican President Donald Trump. In contrast, Trump won about two-thirds of the in-person Election Day vote, compared with about one-third for Biden.

When it came to early in-person voting, there was a near-even split, with Trump having only the slightest advantage.

Biden overperformed among those casting votes before Election Day, especially among mail-in voters, even in many states that Trump won by a wide margin, VoteCast showed.

""This is just an across-the-board, national phenomenon,"" McDonald said.

These patterns continued in the 2022 midterm elections, with Democrats accounting for the bulk of the mail vote, Republicans casting most of the Election Day vote and Republicans holding a small advantage in early in-person voting.

McDonald noted that party behavior on pre-Election Day voting was, if anything, the opposite before 2020.

""People who voted by mail tended to be more Republican than the people who voted in-person early,"" he said, but those patterns ""were suddenly turned upside down"" during the pandemic.

During the 2020 election, Trump repeatedly disparaged, politicized and undermined mail voting, going as far as to block funding to the U.S. Postal Service to thwart its ability to process mail ballots he claimed without evidence were susceptible to widespread tampering.

Trump's messaging on mail balloting has been somewhat inconsistent. At times he has said ""absentee voting"" is "" good. "" But he also has claimed that mail voting is ripe for fraud, something not borne out by decades of mail voting conducted in every state. Trump himself has cast mail ballots on multiple occasions, including in the 2020 primaries.

Trump's rhetoric seems to have taken a toll on Republican confidence in mail voting. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in 2023 found that 58% of Republicans were not very or not at all confident that mail votes would be counted accurately, compared with 32% in 2018. Among Democrats, confidence in the counting of mail ballots increased, from 28% saying they were very or extremely confident in 2018 to 52% in 2023.

""We need to wait and see how 2024 plays out before we make definitive statements about what the early voting is telling us"" about the election, McDonald said.

Absentee voting in some states began as early as mid-September, and more than half the states had begun some type of voting by Oct. 1.

Where are the voters who could decide the presidential election?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-swing-states-georgia-arizona-nevada-michigan-e69da5eb0584606ba9f02ff8fe1de9ee,2024-10-08T19:26:39Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- When you hear the term bellwether, you might think about states in the presidential election that always vote with the White House winner. The true meaning of a bellwether is an indicator of a trend. And for that, you need to be thinking about counties.

In a closely contested presidential election, as many expect 2024 to be, the results in a few bellwether counties in the key battleground states are likely to decide the outcome, just as they did in the past two general elections.

Here's a look at those that might matter the most on Election Day.

Many of those states have large, Democratic-leaning cities. These cities and their inner suburbs are an important source of Democratic votes in statewide elections. These areas consistently vote for the Democratic candidates, which means turnout in these places can have an outsized effect on the final statewide margin.

This year, look at Michigan's Wayne County (Detroit), North Carolina's Mecklenburg County (Charlotte) and Georgia's Fulton County (Atlanta).

Republican candidates have tended to do well in the more rural areas of these states, which means Democrat Kamala Harris will need to run up big margins in these places in order to offset Republican Donald Trump's advantage elsewhere.

Detroit, Charlotte and Atlanta are particularly large, about twice as populous as the next biggest municipality in each state. In 2020, voters in those three counties cast more than two-thirds of their votes for Democrat Joe Biden.

The turnout and margin in the counties around Milwaukee and Philadelphia will be significant to the results in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, respectively.

In Wisconsin, the key counties that surround Milwaukee are Washington, Ozaukee and Waukesha -- known colloquially as the ""WOW"" counties. These historically Republican-leaning communities have been slowly moving to the left: Republican presidential candidates have won them in recent elections, but by increasingly smaller margins.

This forces Republican candidates to seek to run up turnout in more rural areas of the state rather than relying on those counties to offset losses in the state's urban counties of Milwaukee and Dane, home to Madison, the state capital and the University of Wisconsin's main campus. It will be a good night for Trump if high turnout and margins in the ""WOW"" counties look more like the early 2000s, rather than 2020.

Philadelphia's collar counties of Bucks, Montgomery, Chester and Delaware are among the state's wealthiest. They, too, are historic Republican strongholds that have shifted left for decades. Democratic presidential candidates have carried three of them since the 1992 election; Chester flipped between the parties throughout the 2000s.

Arizona and Nevada are unique because in both states, one county is home to so much of the state's population. More than 60% of ballots cast in the 2020 presidential election in Arizona came from Maricopa, which includes Phoenix, while more than two-thirds of Nevada votes came from Clark, home to Las Vegas.

In states where voters are so overwhelmingly concentrated in a single county, even a narrow win can produce big shifts in the statewide numbers. Biden won 50.3% of the vote in Maricopa in 2020, beating Trump by about 45,000 votes, and that was enough to win the state by just over 10,000 votes. In Nevada, Biden lost 14 of the state's 15 counties, but his 91,000-vote margin over Trump in Clark was enough to secure his statewide victory of 34,000 votes.

Trump's margin of victory in North Carolina was just 74,481 votes in 2020, a little more than 1 percentage point and the tightest of any state he won that year over Biden. It's not yet clear, and may not be by Election Day, Nov. 5, how Hurricane Helene will affect the election in North Carolina.

The storm's impact was severe in Buncombe County and the Asheville area, one of two counties in western North Carolina carried by Biden four years ago. The other counties in the region are reliably Republican, and suffered alongside Buncombe a level of destruction described by the state's governor, Democrat Roy Cooper, as ""unlike anything our state has ever experienced.""

""We've battled through hurricanes and tropical storms and still held safe and secure elections, and we will do everything in our power to do so again,"" Karen Brinson Bell, the executive director of the state's election board, said a few days after Helene struck. ""Mountain people are strong, and the election people who serve them are resilient and tough, too.""

Across the seven main battleground states in 2024, there are 10 counties -- out of more than 500 -- that voted for Trump in 2016 then flipped to Biden in 2020. Most are small and home to relatively few voters, with Arizona's Maricopa a notable exception. So it's not likely they'll swing an entire state all by themselves.

What these counties probably will do is provide an early indication of which candidate is performing best among the swing voters likely to decide a closely contested race. It doesn't take much for a flip. For example, the difference in Wisconsin, in both 2016 and 2020. was only about 20,000 votes.

North Carolina's two Trump-Biden counties - New Hanover on the Atlantic Coast and Nash, northeast of Raleigh - are likely to be the first among the 10 to finish counting their vote on election night. Polls close next in Michigan's Kent, Saginaw and Leelanau counties and Pennsylvania's Erie and Northampton counties, followed by Wisconsin's Sauk and Door. Maricopa is the closer.

How elections forecasters became political 'prophets',AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-prophet-prediction-2024-kamala-harris-donald-trump-joe-biden-d1e61649ef95e0b7a187465410cd9303,2024-10-08T19:26:19Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before there was a FiveThirtyEight model, or a New York Times election night needle, or 13 keys revealing ""how presidential elections really work,"" there was an economist named Louis Bean.

Bean achieved a sort of political fame for a book he wrote in 1948 that suggested, contrary to conventional wisdom, that Democratic President Harry Truman was favored to win the election, not Republican Thomas Dewey, the governor of New York.

""It is here, presumably, where the experts fall out, that the tea leaves and intuition enter in,"" said a Times review of Bean's book, ""How to Predict Elections."" ""The intuitive school has already counted Governor Dewey in by a landslide.""

Truman won.

When Bean predicted that Sen. Robert A. Taft, R-Ohio, would lose reelection in 1950, The Washington Post printed the headline: ""Political Prophet Sees Taft Defeat.""

Today, there are more of these ""prophets"" than ever.

It may be no surprise that people seek certainty before elections happen, given what they see as the stakes: One recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that about 7 in 10 Americans believe that the future of democracy is at stake in this year's presidential election, and another found that about 6 in 10 Americans described themselves as being ""fearful"" about the possibility of Democrat Kamala Harris winning, Republican Donald Trump winning, or both.

Yet often the forecasters themselves are the first to push back on the characterization that they can tell you what's going to happen.

""People I think are looking for oracles, right?"" said Nate Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight and author of the Silver Bulletin, a new site analyzing elections. ""They're looking for people that seem to have some magic formula or have some almost quasi-mystical understanding of elections and trends.""

Charlie Cook, founder of the Cook Political Report, said he flinches ""at the term 'prediction' because it suggests saying, 'I think Smith will win.'"" But, Cook said, ""In close races, how can someone say that without knowing precisely what will happen between now and the last vote is cast?""

Most people, Cook said, ""don't really understand probabilities, they want it to be definitive, either Smith or Jones, no hedging, no qualifying, no conditions, don't give me nuance"" and ""they want us to say something that is unknowable.""

In a recent column, the Cook Report's publisher and editor, Amy Walter, issued a ""plea"" to stop ""attaching your hopes, dreams, and fears to one poll or a poll model on any given day.""

""Just take a breath and accept the fact that this election will be won on the margins,"" Walter said in an interview.

Even Bean, whose election predictions made headlines for decades, cautioned against reading his analysis as gospel. A year before the 1968 election, he predicted, with a caveat, that Democratic President Lyndon Johnson would defeat Republican Richard Nixon: ""If the Republicans win, you ought to forget it and say it was a good, tentative early analysis.""

Johnson ended up dropping out and his vice president, Humbert Humphrey, was the party's nominee. Nixon won.

Before the 2022 midterms, a Q-and-A with David Wasserman appeared in New York Magazine with the headline ""'A Category 2 or 3 Hurricane Headed Democrats' Way.'"" The quote wasn't wrong. It just wasn't complete.

""Today, we're somewhere between an asterisk year, where there's a minimal wave, and a classic midterm election, where Republicans do quite well,"" Wasserman said at the time. ""I think this is probably a Category 2 or 3 hurricane headed Democrats' way, just not a Category 4 or 5.""

Wasserman, senior editor and elections analyst at the Cook Report, said he was trying to convey that, despite the conventional wisdom, a massive Republican wave wasn't imminent at all. But that's not how many readers interpreted the headline. Republicans ended up making only modest gains.

""I have to be very careful on how I communicate our elections analysis because it's so prone to misinterpretation,"" Wasserman said.

Before the internet took off, analysts such as Cook and Stu Rothenberg offered their analysis in newsletters. Part of that included putting individual races in categories, on a scale from ""safe"" to ""toss-up."" Those designations come from a combination of access to polling data, reporting in battleground states, in-person assessments of candidates and other factors that have made Cook and Rothenberg some of the foremost elections experts.

The ratings, however, are only a small part of the analysis these outlets provide.

Rothenberg, the founder of the Rothenberg Political Report, approached his newsletter as a venue to tell subscribers what he had observed and analyzed in the world of elections, communicating directly with the readers who knew and trusted him.

Sometimes news outlets would mark his ratings as news events, rather than as expert analysis.

""It was like I was coming down from Mount Sinai with the truth,"" Rothenberg reflected.

The current surge of elections predictions is centered around models that use a combination of factors -- polling, demographics, historical results, to name a few -- to put a number on the probability that a race will turn out one way or the other. That can make it seem like forecasts are objective measurements, when in fact they rely on many subjective decisions, said Natalie Jackson, a longtime pollster who is now vice president at Democratic polling firm GQR.

""They're treated as a lot more concrete than they should be,"" Jackson said.

Nathan Gonzales, who runs Inside Elections, calls the process of placing races in a category to denote competitiveness ""a combination of art and science.""

Paradoxically, even though the most reputable analysts urge caution, it's those who present their predictions most confidently who tend to receive the most attention.

The digital era has made people even more uncomfortable with uncertainty.

""There's information, and a lot of it, and there's an industry constantly creating more information, and that makes us think we should have everything at our fingertips, including future election results,"" Jackson said.

""Everyone is jockeying for attention, and there are some perverse incentives as well,"" Wasserman said. ""If your model shows a strong probability for one side, that'll get the most 'likes' and 'retweets' on that side. A lot of the most nuanced and thoughtful approaches get drowned out.""

That need for certainty may also be one reason for a field of elections forecasters that is dominated by men, despite the large number of women who work in polling and political journalism.

There's not a single reason that fully explains the gender disparity, though Silver believes that ""men are given license to be more aggressive"" and that sexism likely plays a role in who gets taken seriously.

Studies also suggest women are more cautious in professional settings, Jackson noted. It's a quality that can be critical for conveying uncertainty of elections predictions but doesn't necessarily get rewarded on social media or in headlines.

""People don't like uncertainty,"" Jackson said. ""They like the person who tells them what's happening.""

That human tendency is especially problematic in the elections forecasting business. Silver actually describes his forecasts as ""models of uncertainty.""

""A definitive prediction,"" Silver said, ""is usually a sign that someone's a charlatan.""

"AP Elections Top 25: The people, places, races, dates and things to know about Election Day",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/associated-press-elections-top-25-people-places-races-dates-f323fe3dd459c54860a3ad39657e1fca,2024-10-08T19:26:14Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans will cast roughly 160 million ballots by the time Election Day comes to a close -- in several different ways, including many submitted a few weeks before polls even open.

They will choose a president, members of Congress and thousands of state lawmakers, city council members, attorneys general, secretaries of state -- and in Texas, a railroad commissioner who has nothing to do with the trains.

This year's election also comes at a moment in the nation's history when the very basics of how America votes are being challenged as never before by disinformation and distrust.

It can be tough to make sense of it all. To help better understand the way America picks its president and its leaders -- all the way down the ballot -- The Associated Press offers the following thoughts on the Top 25 people, places, races, dates and things to know about Election Day. A guidebook, of sorts, to American democracy as it nears its 250th birthday.

It's said that every presidential election makes history. Perhaps. But while some are destined to be included in the history books, others become the subject of books all of their own. Put 2024 down to get a whole shelf at the library. Will Americans choose to return Donald Trump to the White House, electing a former president to a new term for only the second time -- and picking for the first time a convicted felon to sit behind the Resolute Desk? Or will voters decide Kamala Harris ought to be the nation's first woman to take up office in the Oval Office, a candidate who didn't win a single primary yet landed at the top of her party's ticket by acclamation. No list of the Top 25 things to know about this year's general election can begin without an acknowledgment that no matter who America chooses, Trump and Harris will make history this Election Day. (Or a few days later.)

There might not be anyone as all-in on returning Trump to the White House as Elon Musk, the world's richest person. ""President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America,"" the founder of SpaceX and Tesla told a rally crowd in early October when Trump returned to the site of his first attempted assassination in Pennsylvania. Along with his unfathomable personal wealth, Musk's ownership of X, formally known as Twitter, gives him an unprecedented ability to try and convince voters of his belief that electing Trump is a ""must-win situation."" Musk is spending heavily on get-out-the-vote efforts and using his perch as X's CEO to amplify misinformation and push into millions of timelines his argument that the country will not survive should Kamala Harris win the White House. It's a foreboding message that seems to get bleaker by the day - and Musk knows it. ""As you can see, I am not just MAGA,"" he told Trump's backers from the rally stage. ""I am Dark MAGA.""

The founder of Win With Black Women, Jotaka Eaddy has for the past four years hosted Sunday evening video conferences on Zoom to chat politics. On July 21, she couldn't get into her own meeting. Earlier that day, Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris as his replacement to be the Democratic nominee, and once Zoom changed some settings, 44,000 people were online and ready to talk about it. It was a pep talk and a telethon. People prayed and sang. About an hour after the Zoom started, Star Jones shared a donation link and by early the next morning they had raised more than $1 million. The meeting spawned a domino effect as Eaddy turned a tool made essential by the coronavirus pandemic into an essential place for Harris' supporters to gather. Soon, Black men and white women and white dudes and Taylor Swift fans were logging on. ""It has allowed us to organize in a way to bring people together that otherwise would not connect,"" Eaddy said.

Now that how a ballot is cast is as much of a red/blue choice as the candidate getting the vote, figuring out who will win a close election often depends on knowing the kind of ballots left to be counted. Garrett Archer, a former analyst at the Arizona Secretary of State's office who is now a data journalist, was one of the first of Twitter's election seers to understand how nit-picky those details can be. Were the advance votes still to be counted cast in person, mailed or left at a drop box? How soon before Election Day did those mail ballots arrive? Or might those mail votes actually be ""late earlies"" dropped off at a polling place? Archer goes deep into those details in his job with ABC's Phoenix affiliate, but most of us will get his analysis of Arizona's election results online, as we wait every afternoon after Election Day for his trademark Tweet that begins: ""Maricopa incoming...""

About a week after Election Day, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows is likely to star in a livestream via laptop webcam to announce results of ranked choice voting. The instant-runoff system, used when no candidate initially wins an outright majority, might be a downballot novelty if not for the state's 2nd Congressional District. Behind by about 2,000 votes in 2018, Democrat Jared Golden emerged the winner and ousted the GOP incumbent once the ranked choice process awarded him the votes of two trailing independents. Maine also awards two of its Electoral College votes by congressional district, and while it may be unlikely, the road to 270 electoral votes could theoretically end with ranked choice results in Maine's 2nd District. In that case, should Golden's come-from-behind win of 2018 repeat itself, it would fall to Bellows to announce that ranked choice voting had put a second place finisher into the White House.

On an Aleutian island closer to the Russian border than mainland Alaska and more than 4,000 miles from the White House, the question isn't who wins on Election Day. It's who will be the very last American to vote. ""People have a little bit of fun on that day, because, I mean, realistically everybody knows the election's decided way before we're closed,"" said Layton Lockett, the city manager in Adak, Alaska. The country's last polling place to close is the only one still open from midnight ET to 1 a.m., when things wrap up on the island and former World War II military base. The honor of being the last voter was Mary Nelson's in 2012, when the community of a few hundred people did away with early voting in favor of casting ballots in person. She was a poll worker that Election Day, too, meaning her historic moment was short lived. ""When I opened the curtain to come back out, the city manager took my picture ... and they were waiting for us in Nome to call with our vote count,"" she said.

Out of more than 500 counties in the seven battleground states in this year's election, only 10 voted for Trump in 2016 before flipping to Biden in 2020. The first to complete its count this Election Day ought to be North Carolina's Nash County, which by 10 p.m. ET could provide an early indication of which candidate is performing best among the swing voters likely to decide a closely contested White House. That's especially true should there be a decisive winner in the community northeast of Raleigh, unaffected by Hurricane Helene. Two decades have passed since any presidential candidate won Nash by more than a point. Confirmation won't come for hours (or days), but more intelligence will arrive about a half hour later when North Carolina's other Trump-Biden county -- New Hanover on the state's Atlantic Coast -- should wrap up its count. The other eight counties to watch: Erie and Northhampton in Pennsylvania; Maricopa in Arizona; Kent, Saginaw and Leelanau in Michigan and Sauk and Door in Wisconsin.

There's more to Arizona than Maricopa County. Seriously! Yes, it's true that Biden eked out a win in 2020 among the more than 60% of Arizona voters who live in the sprawling home of Phoenix and its suburbs. But Biden may not have won Arizona and its 11 electoral votes without his win in Apache County, where he beat Trump by 11,851 votes out of roughly 35,000 cast. His statewide margin? Just 10,457. Apache County is far from the typical Democratic urban stronghold. Much of the rural county is part of the Navajo Nation, and it also includes lands belonging to the Apache people who gave the county its name. In all, more than 70% of people living there are Native American. America's indigenous population is often overlooked in presidential elections: the states with the largest percentages of Native people - Alaska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and South Dakota - are not often competitive. Arizona's emergence as a battleground makes the voters in Apache County -- and the roughly 5% of Arizonans who are Native American -- a potential factor in this year's election.

Trump won Wisconsin by about 20,000 votes in 2016 - and he and the country had to wait on Milwaukee County to know which way that margin would fall. The state's largest county and Democratic stronghold is one of a handful in Wisconsin that releases results of mail ballots all at once, rather than combining them with other ballots counted at precinct polling places. In 2016, confirmation there weren't enough mail votes left to count in the City of Milwaukee to flip the race from Trump to Hillary Clinton allowed AP to declare the Republican the winner of the state - and the White House. In the 2022 midterms, it was only when AP confirmed there were no ballots remaining to be counted in Milwaukee and Dane County, Wisconsin's other largest source of Democratic votes, that it was able to say incumbent Republican Ron Johnson would return to the Senate. Milwaukee might not be among the final counties in Wisconsin to report its results this year, but don't count out its chances to be the decisive county once it does in this crucial battleground state.

Election officials nationwide found no cases of fraud, vandalism or theft related to the use of drop boxes that that could have affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. And yet no place in this year's election may face more scrutiny than the drop box - a tool designed to make voting easier that's become the source of conspiracy theories that they played a role ( they didn't ) in stealing the election from Trump ( it wasn't ). Several states have enacted laws restricting their use since 2020, while in others they remain the subject of fascination. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed itself in July and dumped a ruling that limited drop boxes to only election clerks' offices. Prosecutors are currently investigating allegations that the mayor of Wausau removed the city's drop box last month without consulting with the city clerk. Election officials typically have detailed processes to ensure the security of ballots left in drop boxes, which are often monitored remotely by camera. Still, drop boxes remain a place where opponents wrongly believe their vote is neither safe nor secure.

There are 538 electoral votes to win from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but the Trump and Harris campaigns are seriously contesting only seven states this year as battlegrounds: Arizona and Nevada out West, North Carolina and Georgia in the South, Michigan and Wisconsin amid the Great Lakes and Pennsylvania as the final boss. Eight years ago, Pennsylvania was the last state called for Trump before he won election by winning in Wisconsin in the early morning hours after Election Day. Four years ago, Biden's win there four days after polls close -- by roughly 80,000 votes out of more than 6.8 million cast -- was the difference. Both presidential hopefuls can get to the 270 electoral votes need to win White House without the Keystone State, but their path to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue gets a whole lot easier if they grab Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes along the way.

Supporters of abortion rights are 7-for-7 in statewide votes since the U.S. Supreme Court "" returned to the people and their elected representatives "" the ability to decide on the legality of abortion. Come Election Day, voters in nine more states will get the chance via ballot measure to do the same. The states range from the reliably blue (Colorado, Maryland) to the resolutely red (South Dakota, Missouri, Nebraska), with a few presidential battlegrounds and/or states with key races for U.S. Senate - Arizona, Nevada and Montana - in between. And then there's Florida, a state Hillary Clinton hoped would provide her with a powerful push into the White House. Instead, the Sunshine State was in 2016 (and again in 2020) a cornerstone of Trump's Electoral College count. A Trump loss in Florida would undoubtedly sink his bid to return to the White House, but it's hardly clear that the chance to vote on social issues - even one as potent as abortion - can sway enough voters to truly affect an outcome at the top of the ticket.

Republicans can likely hold the U.S. House of Representatives even if they lose a couple of seats in New York, where a messy redistricting process two years ago helped the GOP win six districts carried by Biden. But if those losses include freshman Rep. Marc Molinaro in the state's 19th District, it will make for an uncomfortable election night for House Speaker Mike Johnson. Molinaro has styled himself as a pragmatist as he seeks reelection for the first time, avoiding the circus of former GOP Rep. George Santos in New York's 3rd District - a seat his party has already lost - and the inconveniently timed headlines of rising party star and 17th District Rep. Mike Lawler. Democrat Josh Riley, who nearly won the district in 2022, has raised more money than Molinaro ahead of their November rematch, as Democrats run candidates nationwide who came up just short in the 2022 midterms. If that's a winning strategy in New York's 19th District and elsewhere, the celebrations might be the most raucous in Brooklyn at the election night party of New York 8th District Rep. Hakeem Jefferies: the Democratic leader and House Speaker-in-waiting.

Pay enough attention to politics and you'll have heard the bit about Democrats being one election away from winning in Texas. Then Election Day arrives and Republicans have the cattle while Democrats are once again holding their hat. Is this the year that changes? Democrats say they're investing serious cash into the state with the hope that an unpopular incumbent (Sen. Ted Cruz) is at risk to a rising star (former NFL player and current Rep. Colin Allred). Sound familiar? Six years ago, Cruz was an unpopular incumbent running against a rising Democratic star from the U.S. House named Beto O'Rourke. Some say O'Rourke ran the perfect campaign...and Cruz won by a comfortable 2.6 points. It's been 30 years since a Democrat won statewide in Texas, so maybe the odds are better for Democrats in Florida? They're spending money there, too, to try and take down incumbent Sen. Rick Scott. Ask the GOP what to make of these moves and they'll tell you Democrats need that kind of dramatic upset to keep control of the Senate.

John Duarte might be in one of the closest races of the cycle - and possibly faces the longest waiting time to find out if he's returning to Congress. The California Republican won his 2022 race by 564 votes in a race that was so close that the AP needed until the first week of December to declare Duarte the winner. Now he has to do it all again: He faces a rematch in the state's 13th Congressional District against former state Assemblyman Adam Gray. California's count takes so long in large part because the state conducts its elections entirely by mail. In the 13th, there are also no major cities - no L.A., no Bakersfield, not even Fresno - that would provide enough votes at the beginning of the night to make clear who has won. If the House majority comes down to Duarte's race, the nation's attention will focus on a long count in five counties of California's agricultural Central Valley.

The first Tuesday after the first Monday in November is Election Day, established in 1875 under 2 U.S. Code § 7 for the election ""in each of the States and Territories of the United States, of Representatives and Delegates to the Congress."" In modern U.S. elections, Election Day is perhaps best thought of as the LAST day of the general election: it's the final chance for voters to cast ballots in person, for mail ballots to arrive and be counted, or, in some states, the day by which mail ballots must be postmarked.

Three weeks later comes the last day a mail ballot can arrive in Washington state and still be counted -- Nov. 25 is the latest deadline of any state that accepts votes cast by mail to arrive with an Election Day postmark. In all, 17 states and the District of Columbia allow mail ballots to arrive after Election Day, while 32 others require they be in the ballot box on Election Day. Only Louisiana requires mail ballots to arrive early in order to be counted -- the deadline there for mail ballots is the day before Election Day.

After supporters of Trump stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an insurrection that aimed to overturn his loss to then-President-elect Joe Biden, Congress updated the Electoral Count Act to, among other things, establish the date by which every state's governor must certify the results of the presidential election and submit their slate of electors. Any legal challenges should then be completed by Dec. 16, because those members of the Electoral College will vote the next day.

Wait, there's another election day? Indeed! The Constitution says it's not the people who pick a president, but rather a group of ""electors"" as selected by each state for the job. But the founders also wrote that states get to decide how to pick their members of the Electoral College, and almost all require they vote for the winner of their state's popular vote (Maine and Nebraska do it just a little differently). This ritual takes place about a week before Christmas, the deadline for the electors' cast ballots to arrive in Washington.

More ceremony in early January as the members of the 119th Congress, having taken office a few days earlier, count those Electoral College ballots under the rules of the updated Electoral Count Act. Objections are still possible, but much harder to raise, and the revised law makes plain the vice president is there only to announce the results as president of the Senate. Once the electoral votes are officially cast and counted, the final step of the election comes at the new president's inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025.

Almost all of the roughly 160 million ballots that will be cast in this year's election will be made of paper. And almost all will be counted by machine. Election officials say without such machines, counting those ballots by hand would take much longer, cost taxpayers far more and result in errors that would then take even more time and money to fix. ""Human beings are really bad at tedious things, and counting ballots is among the most tedious things we could do,"" said Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Charles Stewart. ""Computers are very good at tedious things. They can count very quickly and very accurately."" Still, the desire to have humans involved in the process lingers. Officials in Georgia remain at odds over a recent directive from the state's election board requiring poll workers to count the total number of ballots by hand.

At The Associated Press, a race is ""too early to call"" if election officials are still tabulating votes and there is no clear winner. Regardless of how tight the margin may be between the leading candidates, AP won't say a race is ""too close to call"" unless election officials have tallied all outstanding ballots -- save for provisional ballots and late-arriving mail and absentee votes -- and the winner still remains unclear. In those cases, it's likely AP won't be able to say who has won until election officials certify the results -- a process that may take up to several weeks after Election Day. By the way, elections headed to a recount aren't automatically ""too close to call."" In fact, depending on how many votes separate the trailing candidates from the leader, AP may declare a winner even if a recount is possible.

Here's the thing about recounts: They might be required by law, they might be requested by a candidate, they might be ordered by a court. But they're not very likely to do anything but drag out the inevitable. ""Recounts are shifting a very small number of votes,"" said Deb Otis of the nonpartisan organization Fair Vote. ""We're going to see recounts in 2024 that are not going to change the outcome."" They almost never do. In the 36 recounts of a statewide general election since America's most famous recount in 2000, none moved the margin by more than a few hundred votes. The average change? Just 0.03 percentage points. The biggest? A move of 0.11 points in the 2006 race for Vermont state auditor - a rare race that did flip as a 137-vote lead in the initial count for Republican Randy Brock became a 102-vote recount win by Democrat Thomas Salmon. ""The count is pretty accurate because the machines work,"" said former Arizona election official Tammy Patrick. ""We have recounts ... to make sure we got it right."" As hopeful trailing candidates will soon learn, the first count almost always is.

Looking for ""precincts reporting"" when watching as results are reported in this year's election? Chances are, you'll find an estimate of ""expected vote"" instead. The Associated Press and other news organizations have moved away from precincts reporting as a measure of election turnout for several reasons - the fact that well more than half of voters no longer cast their ballot in person at a neighborhood ""precinct"" on Election Day chief among them. Instead, AP will estimate how much of the vote election officials have counted - and how many ballots they have left to count - based on a number of data points, including details on advance ballots cast, registration statistics and turnout in recent elections. Those estimates will change as votes are counted and more information about the exact number of ballots cast becomes available. AP's estimates of ballots cast won't reach 100% until election results are certified as final and complete.

More often than not, in a nation as evenly divided as the United States, not on Election Day -- or, at the least, not on Election Day on the East Coast. Since it took 36 days for George W. Bush's win in the 2000 presidential race to play out in Florida and before the Supreme Court, only in Barack Obama's two victories has AP declared a White House winner before midnight Eastern Time. Trump didn't win until 2:29 a.m. ET in 2016 and he didn't lose in 2020 until the Saturday morning after Election Day -- that's how long it took for Biden to claim 270 electoral votes by emerging as the clear winner in Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the sheer number of U.S. Representatives from California -- a state where officials will be counting mail ballots for weeks -- could make for a long wait to know which party will control the House. The election for Speaker? That's a whole other matter.

The AP Elections Top 25 was reported by Leah Askarinam, Christina A. Cassidy, Christine Fernando, Meg Kinnard, Chris Megerian, Geoff Mulvihill, Stephen Ohlemacher, Emily Swanson, Mark Thiessen and Robert Yoon.

Will the polls be right in 2024? What polling on the presidential race can and can't tell you,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-polls-kamala-harris-donald-trump-b497bd1015d35ed563e085c8db075802,2024-10-08T19:18:52Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential race is competitive.

That's about as much as the national polls can tell us right now, even if it looks like Democrat Kamala Harris is down in one poll or Republican Donald Trump is up in another.

And that's just fine.

Even though polls are sometimes treated as projections, they aren't designed to tell you who is likely to win.

Polls are better for some things than others. Tracking shifts in voter intention is hard to do with a survey, particularly when the number of truly persuadable voters is relatively small. Voters' opinions can change before Election Day and they often do. Horse race polls can only capture people's viewpoints during a single moment in time. Even then, a margin that looks like one that could decide an election -- say, one candidate has 48% support and the other has 45% support -- might not be a real difference at all.

When reporters at The Associated Press are covering the election, horse race polling numbers don't take center stage. The reason for this is that the AP believes that focusing on preelection polling can overstate the significance or reliability of those numbers.

Election-year polls are still useful, particularly when they're trying to assess how the public is feeling about the candidates or the state of the country. They told us quite clearly, for instance, that many Americans wanted Democratic President Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 race. But they're not the same thing as an election result, and even a poll conducted just before Election Day still reflects opinion before all ballots have been cast.

Polls are useful tools, but it's important not to overstate their accuracy. After all, a polling organization can't talk to every single person in the country. They instead rely on a sample to produce a statistically valid estimate of the views of all adults. Even though polls can give a reasonable approximation of the views of the larger group, the question is how much each finding could vary.

The margin of error, which all high-quality pollsters will share along with their results, helps capture some of that uncertainty. It means that in a poll with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, a finding that 47% of voters say they'll support a particular candidate actually means that there's a very good chance that anywhere between 50% and 44% of voters are supporting that candidate. If the other candidate has 45% support, which could really be anywhere from 42% to 48%, the 2 percentage point difference isn't statistically meaningful.

That's why the AP will only say a candidate is leading if that candidate is ahead by more than twice the margin of error.

When you're looking at a subgroup, rather than a national sample, the potential error is even larger. The fewer people interviewed, the larger the margin of error. This means that state-level polls or polls that measure the views of a subgroup such as women, men, Hispanic Americans or Black Americans are subject to even more error than a national finding.

The margin of sampling error is not the only source of survey error. It is simply the only one that can be quantified using established statistical methods. But there are other factors, too. The wording and order of questions can affect how people answer. An interviewer's skill can have an effect. Even in high-quality polls, some respondents may be less likely to answer, which means their views can be underrepresented.

National polls measure how voters all over the country are thinking about the election. But that's not how we elect presidents.

The Electoral College system means that presidential elections are functionally decided by a small number of states. So in some ways, looking at polls of those states is a better way to assess the state of the race.

But state-level polls introduce their own challenges. They're not conducted as frequently as national polls and some states get polled more often than others. Also, the number of people surveyed for state polls is often smaller than for national polls, which means the margin of error is broader.

Some media outlets or organizations publish polling averages or aggregates that combine the results of multiple polls into a single estimate. There are some organizations that create polling averages or models during elections that attempt to determine which candidate is leading in overall polls.

But averaging poll results does not eliminate polling error and it can introduce additional problems. Polling averages contain their own methodological decisions, such as which polls are included or receive greater weight. Some of them also include other factors such as the state of the economy to turn those estimates into forecasts.

In election polling, survey averages can provide a general sense of the state of a race. But it's also important to not overstate the accuracy of an average or expect it to be a crystal ball into the election outcome. Sometimes the individual results of multiple different polls can provide a better sense of the potential array of outcomes than an average boiled down to a single number.

"How AP VoteCast works, and how it's different from an exit poll",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/how-ap-votecast-works-exit-poll-48c02b728cecb06c26a896b049fe1096,2024-10-08T19:18:40Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- When it comes to understanding elections, it's not just about who won and lost. To explain what really happened, it's important to understand who voted and how, what they cared about and how they felt about important issues facing the country.

At The Associated Press, AP VoteCast is a key part of answering those questions, explaining the voting coalitions that elected the president, determined congressional control and decided state-level ballot measures.

Launched in 2018, AP VoteCast is an extensive survey of both voters and nonvoters that aims to tell the story behind election results. Conducted for the AP and Fox News by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, it's a detailed snapshot of the American electorate that helps explain who voted, who didn't vote, what issues they care about, how they feel about the candidates and why they voted the way they did -- or didn't vote at all.

Although it serves a similar purpose, AP VoteCast is not an exit poll.

Traditional exit polls, including the one conducted by a consortium of news networks in the United States, rely largely on in-person interviews with voters conducted outside of select polling places after they've voted, supplemented with a phone survey to reach mail-in voters. Before AP VoteCast the AP worked with other major news organizations to conduct Election Day exit polls.

AP VoteCast was created in part to reflect significant changes over the years in how people vote, from a world where most people vote by showing up at the polls on Election Day to one where a growing number vote before Election Day.

In 1972, for example, about 95% of voters nationwide cast a ballot in-person on the day of the election. Since then, the number of those voting before Election Day has grown steadily, especially in the past few elections. In 2018, roughly 4 in 10 voters cast their ballots before the November general election. In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, the number shot up to about 7 in 10. In the 2022 midterms, about half of voters cast pre-Election Day ballots.

AP VoteCast captures the views of voters -- whether they vote in person on Election Day or weeks ahead of time -- by beginning to interview registered voters several days before Election Day. Those interviews conclude as polls close in each state. Interviews are offered in English and Spanish, as needed.

This approach allowed AP VoteCast to reliably survey more than 130,000 registered voters in all 50 states during the 2020 presidential election, and comprehensively explain how Democrat Joe Biden won the presidential election.

AP VoteCast uses a combination of methods -- mail, phone and online interviews -- to reach registered voters and capture their opinions about the candidates and the election, regardless of whether they vote in-person on or before Election Day or by mail-in ballot.

The first step in the process is to find people to participate in the survey. A random sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files is contacted through the mail and invited to take the survey online or by phone. Some voters are also contacted by phone if they do not respond to the initial invitation to take part in the survey.

Besides the randomly selected group of eligible registered voters, AP VoteCast collects data by conducting interviews with additional voters recruited through ""opt-in"" online panels where the participants are not selected randomly but instead recruited through internet advertising. This helps give AP VoteCast a broader reach and additional depth.

To make sure these additional interviews don't overrepresent or underrepresent important demographic and ideological groups, the panel's composition is carefully calibrated to match the random sample survey on key attitudes, along with matching the demographic characteristics of all registered voters.

Voters are asked a standard set of demographic questions, such as their age, sex, race and ethnicity, education level and the type of neighborhood they live in. They're asked to share their views on what they look for in a candidate, what they think about the candidates on the ballot and what they believe are the key issues facing the country, such as abortion, crime, the economy, health care and immigration.

While voters are asked for whom they're voting, the AP doesn't use this information to report an overall horse race result or to replace vote totals. But the survey results do provide valuable insight into how specific groups voted. For example, in the 2020 presidential election, AP VoteCast results showed that white men favored Republican Donald Trump, while women with college degrees favored Biden. That year, voters who thought the economy was the top issue preferred Trump, while those who thought health care was the top issue supported Biden.

In the 2024 Republican primary, AP VoteCast surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina showed that while Trump won commanding victories in the early states, he struggled to broaden his support beyond those groups that have generally supported him in the past. Harris didn't become the Democratic nominee through the primary process, so her support among the party's primary voters wasn't captured in AP VoteCast surveys.

"Voting systems have been under attack since 2020, but are tested regularly for accuracy and security",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/elections-2024-voting-machines-conspiracy-theories-1aec4eec87eaaea4158825cb3f4bda27,2024-10-08T19:17:56Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- Voting machines have been at the center of a web of conspiracy theories after the 2020 election, with false claims that they were manipulated to steal the presidency from Donald Trump.

There was no evidence of widespread fraud or rigged voting machines in the election, and multiple reviews in the battleground states where the Republican president disputed his loss to Democrat Joe Biden confirmed the results as accurate. In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems, one of the largest voting machine companies, $787 million to avoid a trial in a defamation lawsuit.

In the years since his loss, Trump and his allies have continued to sow doubts about voting equipment. State and local election officials have tried to push back by explaining the layers of protection that surround voting systems and the measures they have in place to conduct fair and accurate elections.

In November's presidential election, nearly every ballot cast will have a paper record that can be used to obtain an accurate count even if there are errors or cyberattacks.

Election officials rely on various pieces of technology. Every office does things a little bit differently.

Officials rely on a voter registration system that is a database of registered voters and have an election management system that workers use to create, issue and track ballots. They also use an election-night reporting system that reports unofficial results. Many jurisdictions use electronic pollbooks to check in voters at polling locations.

All this depends on software and computers, a reliance that carries risks that officials work to identify and address. For example, election officials often will isolate critical systems from the internet and use storage devices, such as secured USB sticks, to transfer data. They limit access to sensitive equipment to only those who need it and have logs that track and monitor the devices.

When an internet connection is needed, election officials will often use private networks to limit the risk of malicious activity and take other steps to scan their systems for potential vulnerabilities and threats.

Voters in much of the country fill out ballots by hand, and then that ballot will be scanned and counted electronically. A few places, mostly small towns in the Northeast, will count their ballots by hand.

In some areas, voters use a computer to mark their ballots electronically and then get a printout of their choices that they insert into a scanner for counting. In other cases, the ballot is cast electronically, and a paper record is printed that summarizes the votes cast. That record is then available if a hand-count is needed.

With a few exceptions, no. There are some jurisdictions in a few states that allow for ballot scanners in polling locations to transmit unofficial results, using a mobile private network, after voting has ended on Election Day and the memory cards containing the vote tallies have been removed.

Election officials who allow this say it provides for faster reporting of unofficial election results on election night. They say the paper records of the ballots cast are used to authenticate the results during postelection reviews, and that those records would be crucial to a recount if one was needed.

Computer security experts have said this is an unnecessary risk and should be prohibited.

Election officials say they have worked extensively to shore up security around their voting equipment after an effort by Russia to scan state voter registration systems for vulnerabilities in 2016.

There was no evidence then that any data was changed or deleted, but it led the federal government to declare the nation's election systems as critical infrastructure. That allows the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to provide free cybersecurity reviews and vulnerability testing to election offices nationwide.

""Today, eight years later, because of all the incredible work by election officials to strengthen the security and resiliency of our election process, election infrastructure has never been more secure, and the election stakeholder community has never been stronger,"" the agency's director, Jen Easterly, told reporters in September.

Computer security experts have called for more to be done and for election officials to limit the use of certain technology, specifically machines that mark ballots for voters. A long-running court battle in Georgia has sought to compel the state to get rid of these machines in favor of hand-marked paper ballots.

Experts have also raised particular concern about a series of security breaches that occurred after the 2020 election as Trump allies sought access to voting systems in Georgia and elsewhere as they tried to prove their unsubstantiated claims. The experts have warned that the public release of critical election software because of the breaches has raised ""serious threats"" and have called for a federal investigation.

Election officials say there are safeguards in place to ensure that voting systems are not manipulated. That begins with physical security, such as locked rooms with limited access and the use of tamper-evident seals. In addition, voting equipment is tested before the election, a process that includes running test ballots through the equipment to ensure votes are being counted correctly.

Postelection reviews are conducted to identify any mistakes or errors that may have occurred.

Around 98% of all ballots cast in this year's election will include a paper record, according to a report by the Brennan Center for Justice based on data collected by Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group that tracks voting equipment in the U.S. Officials say that's important for ensuring that any error or cyberattack will not prevent officials from producing an accurate record of the vote.

"Election conspiracy theories fueled a push to hand-count votes, but doing so is risky and slow",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hand-counts-ballots-voting-elections-93af22f5f7691e57b4a675a64c217627,2024-10-08T19:17:29Z,"CHICAGO (AP) -- Four years of Donald Trump's false claims about a stolen 2020 election have kindled growing suspicion of voting machines among conspiracy theorists. One of their solutions is to replace the tabulators that count every vote with people who will do that by hand.

Controversies over the issue have flared periodically in pockets of the country before the 2024 presidential election even though research has shown that hand-counting is more prone to error, costlier and likely to delay results.

The few counties that have attempted the massive task have found the process more time-consuming, expensive and inaccurate than expected.

In Texas' Gillespie County, a hand-count of Republican primary election ballots this year stretched into the early morning hours, taking almost 24 consecutive hours with 200 people counting ballots, the Texas Tribune and VoteBeat reported. The hand-count cost taxpayers about double the wage costs of the 2020 Republican primary and involved fixing a series of errors, the news nonprofits reported.

In rural Nye County in Nevada, where volunteers in 2022 embarked on an unprecedented full hand-count of midterm votes, mismatched tallies led to recount after recount. After the first day of counting, the county clerk, Mark Kampf, estimated a discrepancy of nearly 25% between the hand and machine count, attributing it to human counting error. The painstakingly slow process was halted by the state's Supreme Court over concerns that early vote tallies could be leaked publicly.

Shasta County, a conservative rural county in northern California, last year abandoned plans to hand-count ballots after the plan was estimated to cost $1.6 million and require more than 1,200 additional employees.

Still, some jurisdictions continue to call for hand-counting.

Most recently, Georgia's State Election Board voted to require poll workers to count the number of paper ballots, but not the votes, by hand after voting is completed. The counting would have to be done by three separate poll workers until all three counts are the same.

The new rule went against the advice of the state attorney general, the secretary of state and an association of county election officials.

Efforts to replace modern voting machines with more laborious, error-prone hand-counting are rooted in a set of conspiracy theories about voting machines that have been spread by Trump and his allies. Some Republicans, inspired by election lies claiming that widespread fraud cost Trump reelection in 2020, have pushed for hand-counting ballots and banning the electronic tabulators used to scan ballots and record votes, despite no evidence of widespread fraud or major irregularities.

""This movement could have died if it had just been a flash in the pan from the 2020 election,"" said Charles Stewart, a political science professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But conspiracy theorists such as election denier and MyPillow founder Mike Lindell have traveled the country working ""to create a grassroots social movement around this skepticism,"" Stewart said.

While these conspiracy theories are not common nationwide, they have found a stubborn hold in pockets of the country, ""primarily in the deepest red parts of the deepest red states,"" Stewart said.

The hand-counting of ballots threatens to delay results by days, weeks or even months, depending on jurisdiction and staffing. Swapping machines with hand-counts would not only be slower but also increase the chances for mistakes and fraud, research has shown.

In a New Hampshire study, poll workers who counted ballots by hand were off by 8%, compared with a 0.5% error rate for machine counting.

""Human beings are really bad at tedious things, and counting ballots is among the most tedious things we could do,"" Stewart said. ""Computers are very good at tedious things. They can count very quickly and very accurately.""

Trump and other Republicans have called for the use of paper ballots in this year's election. In fact, paper ballots or paper records of every vote already are produced in nearly every state.

The Brennan Center at New York University estimates that 98% of all votes nationwide will be cast on paper in this year's presidential election.

Paper ballots also are used in postelection, hand-count audits to identify any irregularities with ballot scanning and counting and to ensure the machine results are accurate. Election officials also conduct accuracy testing on the machines before every election.

Susannah Goodman, director of election security at Common Cause, said informing voters of the checks already in place can help reduce the fear and distrust at the center of calls for hand-counting ballots.

""If you show voters the process and all of the steps that are taken to ensure the outcome is correct - not just tell, show - they gain confidence,"" she said.

Want to follow election results like a pro? Here's what to watch in key states,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-results-states-to-watch-results-6bb161de2661c653a06f4242bc860c4e,2024-10-08T19:15:16Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Election night in the United States is a bit like a jigsaw puzzle, except that only one piece appears at a time, and you don't get to look at the picture on the box.

As thousands of counties and towns report vote totals, it can be hard to figure out when the results reported so far will reflect the outcome.

The first report of the night might show a massive lead for one candidate, but why does that lead dwindle in some races and grow in others? Why does a single vote update from a big city sometimes confirm the winner when there's still a substantial number of votes left to count? What's the difference between a ""mirage"" and a real outcome?

Past elections can provide a guide.

They show that mail-in votes in recent elections have leaned heavily toward Democrats and that in some states, counties report those ballots first. That can create a ""blue mirage"" in races that end up being only narrow victories for Democrats or even substantial victories for Republicans. They show that Republicans can lose big cities overwhelmingly and still win the election.

Even so, sometimes the usual rules and patterns get thrown out the window, either because of unexpected changes to the state's administration process or major swings in voter behavior.

Some recent examples in key states can help provide some idea of what to expect between the time that polls close in Florida early in the evening all the way through Arizona, where polls close at 10 p.m. EST.

The first clues of how election night is going usually come from Florida. Results start coming in at 7 p.m. EST even though the final polls don't close in the state until 8 p.m. EST.

Not every state makes clear when it releases vote updates whether the reports include mail-in ballots, early in-person or Election Day ballots. But when states do provide that information, or enough clues are available to figure it out on our own, it's hugely helpful in figuring out why the vote count looks like it does at that moment.

Florida law requires each county to report its early and absentee ballots first. That includes mail-in ballots, which lean heavily Democratic.

Over the past two election cycles, Democrats have tended to vote by mail more than Republicans. That means the first results reported often look stronger for Democratic candidates than the eventual outcome. Then, as the votes cast on Election Day trickle in, Republicans start seeing much more favorable results.

Take the 2022 Senate race, when Republican Sen. Marco Rubio faced a challenge from Democrat Val Demings.

Demings won an early update in Broward County, giving her a lead of nearly 30 percentage points at the beginning of the night. But she lost an update two minutes later in Miami-Dade County, a particularly concerning sign for Democrats because these early updates should be the votes that are most favorable to them. In the end, Demings lost her lead as more Election Day votes and more votes from Republican-leaning areas were counted. Rubio won reelection, 58% to 41%.

While the first votes of the night should favor Democrats in Florida, the order of events in Virginia tends to vary depending on what each county decides to do.

There are no strict rules dictating how counties should release results. But in past elections, early returns favored Republicans until the big cities and large northern Virginia suburbs reported their results, which took hours.

In Virginia and in most other states, Republican voters are more spread out geographically than Democratic voters, who are concentrated in major population hubs. So throughout the night, while the major Democratic-leaning counties were still counting votes, smaller counties, which tend to lean Republican, had already started reporting their votes.

In 2020, Republican Donald Trump led Democrat Joe Biden for five hours after polls closed on election night before heavily Democratic Fairfax County reported a nearly 400,000-vote update about 12:30 a.m. EST. Biden won Virginia that year by a margin of 10 percentage points.

Georgia allows counties to begin counting absentee ballots on Election Day. By the time polls close, some counties already have major batches of votes ready to report.

Those first reports are often disproportionately favorable to Democrats. Then, prepare to wait for a while. After the first reports, it may be hours before the rest of the state starts sending in results as they continue to count votes, meaning that blue mirage could stick around for quite a while.

In 2022, the Senate election went to a runoff, because neither candidate received 50%. Democrat Raphael Warnock did end up with a single percentage point lead by the time votes were certified in the general election.

This fall, the State Election Board approved a new rule that requires poll workers to hand count the number of ballots cast -- not the actual votes -- after voting is complete. Critics, including GOP Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, worried the rule would delay the reporting of election results.

In the 2022 Ohio Senate race, Rep. Tim Ryan started out with an early lead when Franklin County, home to the state capital of Columbus, reported its first batch of ballots of the night, which went 74% to 26% for Ryan over Republican JD Vance, now Trump's running mate. That was the high point for Ryan. In the end, he carried Franklin with slightly less of the vote -- about two-thirds -- and lost the race statewide.

So why was his lead so much bigger early in the night?

Again, it's all about mail-in ballots. Ohio releases its pre-Election Day votes first thing on election night, including mail-in votes. Like in other races since 2022, mail-in votes tended to lean toward Democrats. As Election Day votes trickled in, Republican JD Vance took the lead and eventually won by 6 points.

In the 2022 Senate race, about a half hour after polls closed in North Carolina, Democrat Cheri Beasley had a lead of nearly 200,000 votes. By midnight, Republican Ted Budd had a lead of over 150,000 votes.

North Carolina counts nearly all its ballots on election night. The first reports of the night in most North Carolina counties will be the results of mail ballots, followed by early in-person votes. Later updates will include results from ballots cast on Election Day. North Carolina has a history of counting its Election Day vote pretty quickly, so if a blue mirage does arise from those first reports, it might not last very long.

It's unclear how vote counting may be affected by emergency changes put in place in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which ravaged western parts of the state. Among other changes, the North Carolina State Board of Elections extended the time voters have to submit absentee ballots, to 7:30 p.m. on Election Day rather than by Election Day. Board members also said they're committed to ensuring early voting and Election Day happens on schedule statewide.

Pennsylvania followed the same pattern as Georgia and Ohio in 2022.

Initial vote updates, which included a big chunk of mail-in ballots, gave Democrat John Fetterman a lopsided advantage before votes from Republicans began to narrow the gap in the Senate race. The state had reported even before poll closing that more than 7 in 10 mail ballots returned before Election Day came from registered Democrats.

Republican Mehmet Oz began to catch up as more of the rural and Election Day votes were tabulated. But those votes weren't enough to overcome Fetterman's lead.

When the AP called Fetterman the winner, he led by 2 percentage points. The AP estimated there were more than 800,000 votes left to be counted, but most of them were in counties where Fetterman was winning by large margins: Philadelphia and the surrounding counties of Delaware, Bucks and Montgomery. But the way Pennsylvania counts its votes could lead to a blue mirage, a red mirage, or both -- at different times in the evening. Pennsylvania doesn't require counties to report their mail-in votes first, and they aren't allowed to start processing those votes until Election Day.

In the 2020 presidential election, Biden took a massive lead as pre-Election Day votes were counted, then Trump took a huge lead as Election Day votes were counted, and then Biden eventually regained his narrow margin as more mail votes were counted.

In Wisconsin, municipalities report their vote totals to counties, and each city can choose how to report its results. Most combine mail-in ballots with Election Day votes, but some, including Milwaukee, release them separately. That dilutes the chances of a mirage but also adds an element of unpredictability.

The city of Milwaukee reports Election Day votes before mail-in votes. That can make it difficult to know how many votes remain to be counted there until election officials give specific information about how many mail ballots remain or confirm that they have been counted already.

In Wisconsin, information about the last votes to come from Milwaukee, which typically reports into wee hours of Wednesday morning, is often necessary to determine the winner in close races.

As in Wisconsin, there's no universal pattern in Michigan for when counties report their mail ballots. That often makes geography a better indicator of the direction of a race than vote type.

The key to a close race in Michigan is to wait for Wayne, Oakland, and Washtenaw counties to release significant batches of votes before jumping to any conclusions. Wayne includes Detroit, while Oakland is made up of the city's northern suburbs. Washtenaw County is home to Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan.

Michigan doesn't permit absentee ballots to be counted until the morning of Election Day and warns on its elections website that high numbers of absentee ballots usually prolongs the counting process by hours if not days.

Arizona won't report votes until an hour after polls close, due to the state law. But that means when that first update comes in, it's pretty big. Historically, about half of the state's total votes are reported in the first update.

That update, like in many other states, has tended to lean heavily Democratic in recent elections because it includes mail ballots cast well before Election Day. That gap usually narrows as Election Day votes are counted. But after that, things take a more complicated turn in Arizona than in other states.

Ballots counted after Election Day include ""late earlies"" -- the last-arriving mail ballots that include those dropped off on Election Day. Those ballots heavily favored Trump in 2020.

But in the 2022 Senate race, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly took the lead in the first update, when Maricopa County, the state's most populous county and home to Phoenix, released 837,000 ballots in its first report. He maintained that initial lead, even though it narrowed, when Election Day votes were reported. Votes counted after election night failed to eat into his advantage.

"Yes, voter fraud happens. But it's rare and election offices have safeguards to catch it",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-voter-fraud-trump-harris-a3b4c2db17217311770259193c115b80,2024-10-08T19:14:46Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- You've heard the horror stories: Someone casting multiple ballots, people voting in the name of dead relatives, mail-in ballots being intercepted.

Voter fraud does happen occasionally. When it does, we tend to hear a lot about it. It also gets caught and prosecuted.

The nation's multilayered election processes provide many safeguards that keep voter fraud generally detectable and rare, according to current and former election administrators of both parties.

America's elections are decentralized, with thousands of independent voting jurisdictions. That makes it virtually impossible to pull off a large-scale vote-rigging operation that could tip a presidential race -- or most any other race.

""You're probably not going to have a perfect election system,"" said Republican Trey Grayson, a former Kentucky secretary of state and the advisory board chair of the Secure Elections Project. ""But if you're looking for one that you should have confidence in, you should feel good about that here in America.""

Voting more than once, tampering with ballots, lying about your residence to vote somewhere else or casting someone else's ballot are crimes that can be punished with hefty fines and prison time. Non-U.S. citizens who break election laws can be deported.

For anyone still motivated to cheat, election systems in the United States are designed with multiple layers of protection and transparency intended to stand in the way.

For in-person voting, most states either require or request voters provide some sort of ID at the polls. Others require voters to verify who they are in another way, such as stating their name and address, signing a poll book or signing an affidavit.

People who try to vote in the name of a recently deceased friend or family member can be caught when election officials update voter lists with death records and obituaries, said Gail Pellerin, a Democratic in the California Assembly who ran elections in Santa Cruz County for more than 27 years.

Those who try to impersonate someone else run the risk that someone at the polls knows that person or that the person will later try to cast their own ballot, she said.

For absentee voting, different states have different ballot verification protocols. All states require a voter's signature. Many states have further precautions, such as having bipartisan teams compare the signature with other signatures on file, requiring the signature to be notarized or requiring a witness to sign.

That means even if a ballot is erroneously sent to someone's past address and the current resident mails it in, there are checks to alert election workers to the foul play.

A growing number of states offer online or text-based ballot tracking tools as an extra layer of protection, allowing voters to see when their ballot has been sent out, returned and counted.

Federal law requires voter list maintenance, and election officials do that through a variety of methods, from checking state and federal databases to collaborating with other states to track voters who have moved.

Ballot drop boxes have security protocols, too, said Tammy Patrick, chief executive officer for programs at the National Association of Election Officials.

She explained the boxes are often designed to stop hands from stealing ballots and are surveilled by camera, bolted to the ground and constructed with fire-retardant chambers, so if someone threw in a lit match, it wouldn't destroy the ballots inside.

After the 2020 election, social media surged with claims of dead people casting ballots, double voting or destroyed piles of ballots on the side of the road.

Former President Donald Trump promoted and has continued to amplify these claims. But the vast majority of them were found to be untrue.

An Associated Press investigation that explored every potential case of voter fraud in the six battleground states disputed by Trump found there were fewer than 475 out of millions of votes cast. That was not nearly enough to tip the outcome. Democrat Joe Biden won the six states by a combined 311,257 votes.

The review also showed no collusion intended to rig the voting. Virtually every case was based on an individual acting alone to cast additional ballots. In one case, a man mistakenly thought he could vote while on parole. In another, a woman was suspected of sending in a ballot for her dead mother.

Former election officials say that even more often, allegations of voter fraud turn out to result from a clerical error or a misunderstanding.

Pellerin said she remembered when a political candidate in her county raised suspicion about many people being registered to vote at the same address. It turned out the voters were nuns who all lived in the same home.

Patrick said that when she worked in elections in Maricopa County, Arizona, mismatched signatures were sometimes explained by a broken arm or a recent stroke. In other cases, an elderly person tried to vote twice because they forgot they had already submitted a mail ballot.

""You really have to think about the intent of the voter,"" Patrick said. ""It isn't always intuitive.""

It would be wrong to suggest that voter fraud never happens.

With millions of votes cast in an election year, it's almost guaranteed there will be a few cases of someone trying to game the system. There also have been more insidious efforts, such as a vote-buying scheme in 2006 in Kentucky.

In that case, Grayson said, voters complained and an investigation ensued. Then participants admitted what they had done.

He said the example shows how important it is for election officials to stay vigilant and constantly improve security in order to help voters feel confident.

But, he said, it would be hard to make any such scheme work on a larger scale. Fraudsters would have to navigate onerous nuances in each county's election system. They also would have to keep a large number of people quiet about a crime that could be caught at any moment by officials or observers.

""This decentralized nature of the elections is itself a deterrent,"" Grayson said.

"Courts could see a wave of election lawsuits, but experts say the bar to change the outcome is high",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-supreme-court-lawsuits-trump-harris-1507df4e695ca13c5da00c22ef8e14e5,2024-10-08T19:14:20Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the Supreme Court stepped into the 2000 presidential race, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore were separated by a razor-thin margin. The court's decision to halt the recount of votes in Florida effectively delivered the election to Bush and shaped the nation's future.

The case is perhaps the most notable modern example of the judicial branch having a direct involvement after an election, but it's not the only time judges have been drawn into postelection disputes.

America's court system has no formal role in the election process, and judges generally try not to get involved because they don't want to be seen as interfering or shaping a partisan outcome, said Paul Schiff Berman, a professor at George Washington University Law School.

But election disputes have increasingly landed in court since Bush v. Gore, Berman said.

This year could be especially contentious, coming after more than 60 unsuccessful lawsuits where then-President Donald Trump falsely claimed that he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden due to massive voter fraud. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed this year, mostly concerning relatively small matters.

""We have a long history in this country of a democratic process that operates in a nonpartisan manner with regard to vote counting that does not require constant court intervention, but that norm has been shattered in the same way that many of our democratic norms have been shattered since 2016,"" Berman said.

Court cases could start election night over whether to keep polling places open if they experienced trouble affecting access during the day.

After the votes are all cast, lawsuits over the vote count could be next. That could involve claims about the counting of certain ballots, allegations against the election officials overseeing the count, disputes over the methodology or challenges to the certification of the vote totals in each state.

There could be lawsuits over recent updates to the Electoral Count Act, which governs the certification of the presidential contest. The revisions were passed by Congress in 2022 in response to Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 results by pressuring his vice president, Mike Pence, over congressional certification of the states' electors.

How much a lawsuit might affect the outcome of an election depends on how many votes are in dispute and what kind of a solution a judge might order if a problem is found. In some cases, ""It isn't clear what the remedy would be if these suits were successful,"" said Steven Schneebaum, an attorney and adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University.

If the 2024 race is very close, court rulings could affect the outcome, especially in the swing states that will be key to the election. But for a lawsuit to affect the race, the election would have to be so close that the court would have to determine how people voted or one side would have to prove a major, fundamental problem with how it was run, said Rick Hasen, an elections expert and law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.

""The standard to overturn an election is extremely high, for good reason,"" he said. ""We want elections to be decided by voters, not courts.""

Ranked choice voting could decide which party controls the US House. How does it work?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/ranked-choice-voting-maine-alaska-elections-3c671352c0a6aa3604502955e6df3097,2024-10-08T19:14:15Z,"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- An uncommon system of voting could be central to which party controls the U.S. House this fall -- or even the presidency.

In Maine and Alaska, voters in competitive congressional districts will elect a winner using ranked choice voting.

Rather than cast a single vote for their preferred candidate, voters rank their choices in order of preference on the ballot. If a candidate is the first choice of more than 50% of voters in the first round of counting, that candidate is the winner.

But if no candidate surpasses 50%, the count continues in round two. The candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and voters who chose that candidate as their top pick have their votes redistributed to their next choice. This continues with the candidate with the fewest votes getting eliminated until someone emerges with a majority of votes.

Ranked choice voting has become more popular in recent years, particularly at the municipal level.

Voters in two dozen cities and counties -- from New York and Minneapolis to Boulder, Colorado -- used ranked choice voting in 2023, according to FairVote, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for the expansion of ranked choice voting. Seven other cities voted in favor of preserving, adopting or expanding ranked choice voting.

Proponents of ranked choice voting argue the system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions, eliminates the spoiler effect and discourages negative campaigning. Opponents say it's confusing and can result in a candidate without the largest number of first-choice votes ultimately prevailing.

Because they take place over multiple rounds, elections that advance to ranked choice are often resolved a week or more after Election Day.

Maine adopted ranked voting in elections in 2016 in a statewide referendum. It is used in all statewide primaries with more than two candidates. In general elections, it is used for federal offices including the presidency but not in state races, such as for governor or the Legislature, because it runs afoul of the Maine Constitution.

It quickly came into play -- twice -- in Maine's 2nd Congressional District. Then-GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin won the first round of voting in 2018, but lost to Democratic Rep. Jared Golden when votes were reallocated after removing the third- and fourth-place finishers. The process repeated four years later when Golden beat Poliquin in a rematch.

A federal judge twice upheld the constitutionality of ranked voting in separate challenges by Poliquin in 2018 and a group of voters in 2020.

This year, only two candidates are explicitly on the ballot in the 2nd District -- Golden and Republican Austin Theriault -- but the race could nonetheless go to ranked choice voting because votes will be counted for a third candidate whose write-in candidacy has been recognized by the state.

If no first-round winner receives a majority of the vote on Election Day, then the ballots are shipped to the state capital, where the ballots are entered into a computer. The process takes about a week before the final tally is run and the winner declared.

Alaskans approved the use of ranked choice voting in a 2020 statewide initiative. It is used in all general elections, including for the presidency, but not in state primaries. Alaska's state primaries are open, so all candidates, regardless of party, run on the same ballot and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election.

Presidential primaries are different. Candidates can make the ballot by winning a recognized party's primary or successfully petitioning the state Division of Elections. This year, there will be eight presidential tickets on the ballot in Alaska; voters can rank all of them if they choose.

The first use of ranked choice voting -- and when it first came into play -- was in a 2022 special election for the state's at-large congressional district. Now-Rep. Mary Peltola, a Democrat, received the most votes in the first round of voting, while two Republican candidates finished second and third. She surpassed 50% of the vote when the third-place candidate was eliminated.

Peltola went on to win the regularly scheduled election, which also used ranked choice voting, later that year. She faces Republican Nick Begich, one of the two candidates she defeated in 2022, and two others in November.

Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski was reelected in 2022 in a race that went to ranked choice voting.

Alaska will vote next month on a ballot measure that would repeal the state's new open primary and ranked choice general election system.

The more candidates in a race, the more likely it is that candidates will split the vote and nobody will win a majority, advancing the election to ranked choice voting. The presidential ballots in Maine and Alaska will include more than just Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, so it's possible those states' races could wind up going to ranked choice voting.

Maine is one of two states that gives an electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district along with two to the statewide winner, and ranked choice voting could go into effect if no presidential candidate receives a majority in one of the districts.

In 2020, before Alaska's ranked choice voting was in place, Trump received about 53% of the state's vote. Democrat Joe Biden won Maine with about 53% of the vote that year.

Sweedler reported from Washington.

What is the Electoral College and how does the US use it to elect presidents?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/what-to-know-electoral-college-presidential-elections-1fe5436f724d87030f340f1893626f6e,2024-10-08T19:14:10Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016 because of the Electoral College. So did George W. Bush in 2000.

The Electoral College is the unique American system of electing presidents. It is different from the popular vote, and it has an outsize impact on how candidates run and win campaigns. Republicans Trump and Bush lost the popular vote during their presidential runs but won the Electoral College to claim the nation's top office.

Some Democrats charge that the system favors Republicans and they would rather the United States elect presidents by a simple majority vote. But the country's framers set up the system in the Constitution, and it would require a constitutional amendment to change.

A look at the Electoral College and how it works, as Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, compete for the White House on Election Day, Nov. 5:

The Electoral College is a 538-member body that elects a president. The framers of the Constitution set it up to give more power to the states and as a compromise to avoid having Congress decide the winner.

Each state's electors vote for the candidate who won the popular vote in that state. The runner-up gets nothing -- except in Nebraska and Maine where elector votes are awarded based on congressional district and statewide results.

To win the presidency, a candidate must secure 270 electoral votes -- a majority of the 538 possible votes.

Under the Electoral College system, more weight is given to a single vote in a small state than to the vote of someone in a large state, leading to outcomes at times that have been at odds with the popular vote.

It also affects how candidates campaign. Because the outcome is almost certain in solidly Republican states and solidly Democratic states, candidates tend to focus most of their efforts on a handful of swing states that have split their votes in recent elections.

Electors are allocated based on how many representatives a state has in the House of Representatives, plus its two senators. The District of Columbia gets three, despite the fact that the home to Congress has no vote in Congress.

It varies by state, but often the electors are picked by state parties. Members of Congress cannot serve as electors.

After state election officials certify their elections, electors meet in their individual states -- never as one body -- to certify the election. This year, that will happen on Dec. 17.

If the two candidates have a tied number of votes, the election is thrown to the House, where each state's congressional delegation gets one vote. That has happened only twice, in 1801 and 1825.

Once a state's electors have certified the vote, they send a certificate to Congress. Congress then formally counts and certifies the vote at a special session on Jan. 6. The vice president presides as the envelopes for each state are opened and verified.

Lawmakers can object to a state's results during the congressional certification, as several Republicans did after the 2020 election. On Jan. 6, 2021, the House and Senate both voted to reject GOP objections to the Arizona and Pennsylvania results.

After Trump tried to overturn his defeat to Democrat Joe Biden and his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, Congress updated the 1800s-era Electoral Count Act to make it harder to object and to more clearly lay out the vice president's ceremonial role, among other changes. Trump had pressured Vice President Mike Pence to try and object to the results -- something the vice president has no legal standing to do.

Once Congress certifies the vote, the new or returning president will be inaugurated Jan. 20 on the steps of the Capitol.

Election certification is a traditionally routine duty that has become politicized in the Trump era,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-certification-electoral-college-trump-harris-6319a520078cca1455862151f085414e,2024-10-08T19:14:07Z,"For the outcome of this year's presidential race, it will be the vote count on election night and possibly in the days after that will grab the public's attention. But those numbers are unofficial until the election is formally certified -- a once uneventful process that has become politicized since then-President Donald Trump tried to overturn his reelection loss four years ago.

Trump unsuccessfully pressured fellow Republicans on an evenly divided board that had to sign off on Michigan's vote not to certify his loss in the state. On Jan. 6, 2021, he directed his supporters to march to the Capitol and stop Congress from taking the final step to certify that Democrat Joe Biden had won the presidency.

This year, Trump's allies have set the table to try to block certification should Trump lose to Democrat Kamala Harris.

The best way to think about certification is as a three-step process.

It starts with local governments, such as counties. It then moves to states, which add up all the local totals to certify the winner and appoint presidential electors. Congress then effectively certifies the votes of those electors.

The process may seem daunting, especially on the local level. Most of the country's thousands of individual election jurisdictions -- many of which have been taken over by Trump supporters -- have to officially certify their vote tallies before a state can certify a winner. If just one of those counties refuses to certify, it could stop a state from signing off.

Legal experts say there is no actual legal risk of Trump's allies being able to reverse a loss by refusing to certify at the local level. Decades of case law hold that local officials have no choice but to certify election results. Any potential problem with the vote count can be challenged in court, but not on the boards and commissions that have the ceremonial task of certifying the ballot tallies and transmitting them to the state.

Trump supporters have tried to block election results in Arizona, Michigan and New Mexico since 2020 by refusing to certify them, only to be forced to sign off by courts or to back down under legal pressure.

The notion that a lone board could hold up a state by refusing to certify is ""this crazy fantasy that has merged the right and the left,"" said Derek Muller, a University of Notre Dame law professor.

In 2020, Trump focused intensely on getting Republican state leaders to refuse to certify his losses and send his own slate of electors to the Electoral College. That failed everywhere.

In 2024, four of the six swing states where Trump disputed his loss are led by Democratic governors. In the other two, the GOP governors don't seem likely to go along with a potential push by Trump to stop certification. Georgia's Brian Kemp defied Trump in 2020, and Nevada's Joe Lombardo was elected in 2022 with votes from Democrats.

The last step in the certification process is in Congress on Jan. 6. Once the states have certified their winners and selected their electors, and those electors cast their votes for president, the Constitution requires Congress to formally count those votes.

That's what Trump and his supporters seized on in 2020, arguing that Congress could choose to reject Electoral College votes from states where it didn't trust the vote count. Even after the assault on the Capitol, a majority of House Republicans -- 139 of them -- and eight Republican senators voted to reject Biden's electors from Pennsylvania. That wasn't enough votes to change the outcome of the election, but it's a signal that they could try again should Harris win.

A bipartisan majority in Congress not only upheld Biden's 2020 victory but then amended the law that governs how Congress certifies a presidential election to make it much harder to reject Electoral College votes. If Harris wins, we'll see if that majority still holds on Jan. 6 to confirm her victory.

Disputes over access to the vote intensify as Ohioans begin to cast ballots,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-early-voting-begins-ohio-82e12f274b0ad13e053aac809e694349,2024-10-08T18:22:56Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Several disputes over voter rights in Ohio were unresolved Tuesday as the state began accepting early ballots in this fall's election for president, a key U.S. Senate race and a redistricting measure.

Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose had not yet responded to Common Cause and the League of Women Voters, which notified him last week that voters were being systematically removed from the rolls in several counties as a result of third-party challenges. The advocacy groups alleged the actions violate provisions of the National Voting Registration Act.

LaRose's office said he had cast a tie vote keeping most of the challenged voters in one of the counties, Delaware, on the rolls. He is reviewing claims in three additional counties.

National groups allied with former President Donald Trump have been facilitating these citizen-powered efforts to systematically challenge the legitimacy of large numbers of voter registrations. LaRose praised their efforts and believes accurate voter rolls are a core tenet of any well-run election, said spokesman Dan Lusheck.

""Ohio runs some of the most transparent elections in the nation, and we are proud of that,"" Lusheck said.

Meanwhile, minority Democrats at the Ohio Statehouse carried on questioning LaRose's removal of 155,000 voter registration records in August. He has said the legally required actions targeted registration records of inactive, noncitizen, deceased or otherwise ineligible voters.

On Monday, state Rep. Elliot Forhan, a Cleveland-area Democrat, filed a formal challenge asking the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections to restore 741 voters in the county -- a Democratic stronghold potentially pivotal in U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown's tight reelection bid against Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno.

State Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney, another Democrat from the Cleveland area, sent a letter to LaRose on Tuesday reiterating her earlier request for additional records involving the office's removal processes. Her office uncovered more than 1,000 wrongfully removed voters in Cuyahoga County alone with the help of previously released records, she said, and requested a third-party audit.

""If Frank LaRose isn't going to ensure all eligible voters have the right to vote in Ohio, the least he can do is give me the public records, so I can do it for him,"" Sweeney said in a statement.

LaRose's office had no immediate comment.

Also yet to be resolved is the Ohio Democratic Party's September lawsuit challenging a LaRose directive that prevents people who are helping voters with disabilities drop off their ballots from using drop boxes.

The secretary issued his order after a federal judge struck down portions of Ohio's sweeping 2023 election law in July, allowing more classes of people to help voters with disabilities deliver their ballots. It affirmed the helpers could do so, but added requirements that they drop the ballots inside board of elections offices and sign a form vouching for their identities.

LaRose called the move a precaution against ballot harvesting. Democrats said that it is illegal.

Three of the Ohio Supreme Court's seven justices -- two Democrats and a Republican, all seeking office this fall -- have recused themselves in the case. A fourth was asked to, but refused.

The Republican National Committee and the Ohio Republican Party said Tuesday they have moved to intervene in the case.

""Secretary LaRose has taken critical steps to safeguard Ohio's elections, but once again Democrats are trying to dismantle commonsense protections that make it easy to vote and hard to cheat,"" national committee Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement. ""This is yet another poorly veiled attempt to eliminate ballot safeguards and interfere right before the election -- and we will stop them."""
Lawsuit says Virginia is illegally purging legitimate voters off the rolls,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/virginia-voter-rolls-lawsuit-purge-immigrant-488e9b52ae81f03b7cd1ea28bc384b69,2024-10-08T18:04:33Z,"FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- A coalition of immigrant-rights groups and the League of Women Voters in Virginia has filed a federal lawsuit accusing Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares of an ongoing ""purge"" of voter rolls that will disenfranchise legitimate voters.

The lawsuit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, argues that an executive order issued in August by Youngkin requiring daily updates to voter lists to remove ineligible voters violates a federal law that requires a 90-day ""quiet period"" ahead of elections on the maintenance of voter rolls.

The quiet period exists to prevent erroneous removals, the lawsuit states. Virginia's policy of using data from the Department of Motor Vehicles to determine a voter's citizenship and eligibility will surely disenfranchise legitimate voters, the lawsuit alleges, because the DMV data is often inaccurate or outdated.

""Defendants' Purge Program is far from ... a well-designed, well-intended list maintenance effort. It is an illegal, discriminatory, and error-ridden program that has directed the cancelation of voter registrations of naturalized U.S. citizens and jeopardizes the rights of countless others,"" the lawsuit states.

Immigrant citizens are at particular risk, the lawsuit states, because individuals can obtain a driver's license as lawful permanent residents, refugees or asylum applicants, and then later become naturalized citizens. But the data from the Department of Motor Vehicles will still list that individual as a noncitizen.

Andrea Gaines, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Elections, declined comment on the lawsuit, citing the ongoing litigation. The attorney general's office did not respond to an email seeking comment.

It's not clear how many voters have been removed as a result of the executive order. The lawsuit alleges that the Virginia Department of Elections has refused to provide data about its efforts. Youngkin's executive order states that Virginia removed 6,303 voters from the rolls between January 2022 and July 2023 over citizenship questions.

At the local level, the lawsuit cites anecdotal evidence of county boards removing voters since Youngkin's executive order was issued and inside the 90-day quiet period required by federal law. In Fairfax County, the state's most populous jurisdiction, minutes from the August meeting of the electoral board show that 49 voters were removed.

According to the minutes, the elections office received data about 66 voters who were deemed likely noncitizens. The data came from both the state elections office and from an ""Election Integrity Task Force"" affiliated with the Fairfax County Republican Committee. The county registrar said that the elections office sent notices to all 66, and gave them 14 days to verify their citizenship and eligibility. Of those, 17 responded and were kept on the rolls. The other 49 were removed, and had their names forwarded to the commonwealth's attorney and the Virginia attorney general's office for potential prosecution.

The lawsuit says the Fairfax removals, as well as other local actions, show that legitimate voters are being improperly removed if they don't respond within the 14-day window provided to them.

Orion Danjuma, a lawyer with The Protect Democracy Project, one of the legal groups that filed the lawsuit on the plaintiffs' behalf, said what's occurring in Virginia is part of a national effort by supporters of former President Donald Trump to sow doubts about election integrity and delegitimize the results if Trump loses in November.

""The allies of the former president are advancing a narrative that's false,"" he said. ""And they're putting the voting rights of every citizen on the line to do it.""

The lawsuit asks a judge to bar the state from removing voters under what it describes as the state's ""purge program,"" and restoration to the voter rolls of those who have been removed as a result of it.

A hearing on the request has not yet been scheduled."
Texas is a young state with older elected officials. Some young leaders are trying to change that.,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/texas-texas-state-government-general-news-9403e6a8cab1dd6d1e4088acb8a6def5,2024-10-08T16:51:52Z,"Figure out what to wear to be taken seriously; prepare a few one-liners to respond to the inevitable critiques about your age; know the issues facing your district.

These are among the tips Rep. Erin Zwiener, a Driftwood Democrat, serves up to young people seeking elected office in Texas.

Zwiener was the second youngest elected state lawmaker in Texas when she won a state House seat at 33. On the campaign trail, competitors and potential voters frequently chided Zwiener about her age, questioning whether she had the skills and experience needed for the job. Zwiener had a standard comeback: Lyndon B. Johnson, the future president, was 28 when he was elected to U.S. Congress, and Lloyd Doggett, now in his 29th year in Congress, was 27 when elected to the state Senate.

""Some of those lines really helped remind folks that my age wasn't that unusual,"" she said.

In the Texas Capitol, Zwiener was -- and, at 39, continues to be -- something of a rarity. Despite having one of the youngest populations in the country, the Texas Legislature is a gerontocracy, and it has only gotten older in recent years.

In 1981, the average age of lawmakers was 42, according to data from the Texas Legislative Library. Last year, it was 55. The average age of Texas' 30 million residents is 37, based on U.S. Census Bureau data.

As a result, Zwiener said, issues most affecting young people, including education and access to affordable childcare and housing, are neglected.

""The age gap between the Legislature and the people we represent definitely pops up in ways that create more challenges for our communities,"" Zwiener said. ""The fact that most lawmakers haven't been young adults since the '80's or earlier makes it challenging for us to help those folks.""

The demographic mismatch between Texans and the lawmakers who represent them is both a symptom and a cause of civic disengagement among younger Texans. A number of studies have shown that people are more likely to be civically engaged when they see themselves represented, whether in terms of candidates' age, race or gender.

And because voting is habit-forming, those young people tend to remain disengaged and become less likely to run for office, according to research from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement.

The cycle is reinforced through Texas' barriers to voting and the challenges of running a campaign as a young adult. Texas has some of the strictest voting laws in the country, banning online voter registration and same-day registration -- both have been found to increase voter turnout, especially among young people.

Meanwhile, running for office requires raising large sums of money, a roadblock for young candidates who don't typically have wide networks of wealthy donors. And winning a seat in the House or Senate means traveling to Austin for about 140 days every other year for the legislative session, a commitment that makes it difficult to retain a full-time job.

For young professionals building a career and a family, those logistical hurdles can make running for office seem like a pipe dream. Not to mention the paltry pay of $600 a month.

""We don't pay a living wage to our legislators, which sounds good because you don't want to pay politicians, but the end result is you have trust-fund babies making policy for 30 million people in the state,"" said state Rep. James Talarico, D-Austin, who became the youngest state lawmaker when he was elected in 2018. ""It's mostly wealthy bankers, doctors, lawyers that can afford to serve, and that's not a representative democracy.""

Working in a San Antonio public school district in the years following a slate of school budget cuts convinced Talarico that he wanted to run for office and affect education policy.

But as a 28-year-old former educator and non-profit leader who grew up in a middle class household, Talarico did not have the kind of money one needs to launch a political campaign. And he wasn't sure where he would find it.

A millennial, Talarico naturally turned to social media. He put out a call to his online network of friends, and to his surprise, raised $25,000 within a week. Over the following weeks, Talarico would walk all of District 52 by foot, holding energetic town halls along the way.

""That's how I won my swing seat in Williamson County, a seat that had voted for Donald Trump just two years before I ran,"" Talarico said. ""I went and knocked on everyone's door.""

Talarico also created ""camp campaign,"" a summer program for youth interested in learning about politics. High school and college students would hear about policy issues from guest speakers in exchange for pulling shifts for the campaign's phone bank, reaching out to potential voters. Talarico defeated Republican Cynthia Flores by less than 3,000 votes, flipping the district blue.

This year, Talarico launched the Big & Bright PAC to help young Democratic Texans running for public office. The group has raised about $150,000, Talarico said, and has helped several campaigns get off the ground.

Talarico said he knows all the obstacles he faced: ""Not having name recognition or experience campaigning or a network of donors. I'm trying to help candidates in similar situations.""

Young candidates on both sides of the aisle say that when they seek elected office, they hear a discouraging refrain: It's not your turn yet.

""There's a stigma that young people need to wait their turn in line and that they aren't ready to serve their communities,"" said Mason Morgan, executive director of Run GenZ, a national organization that empowers young conservatives who want to run for office.

Those are the words Fort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker, a Republican, said she heard when she ran in a crowded field in 2021 at 37.

In the end, Parker, who became the country's youngest mayor of a major city, said she believes she was successful in part because she was relatable to the average Fort Worth resident, having to balance work with raising a growing family.

""For some reason, we have this stereotype that elected leaders can't have the level of maturity needed (to do the job) at a younger age,"" Parker said. ""I've tried to break that stereotype to the best of my ability.""

Caroline Fairly, a 25-year-old Republican candidate for House District 87, would become the youngest Texas lawmaker if she is elected in November. She said some people have pulled her aside to tell her she's not ready for office.

But to her, being young is an asset.

""Being the youngest in the room means I'll bring a fresh perspective, especially on issues that impact younger generations,"" Fairly said. ""It's also a chance to show that leadership isn't about age -- it's about vision, values, and the drive to serve.""

As the president of the University Democrats at the University of Texas at Austin, Brian Peña spends a lot of time talking to students, encouraging them to register to vote. He's been surprised to learn that students are uninformed about the registration process. Peña said he had a government teacher who instilled in him the importance of voting and showed him how to complete registration, but many Texas high school students don't have that same experience.

Many assume they can register online or that they can wait until Election Day. Some students have no idea if they are even registered, Peña said.

""One in three students we ask if they are registered say, 'Let me ask my mom,'"" Peña said. ""We really have to walk them through this process.""

The window for Texas teenagers to register before turning 18 is shorter than in other states. Texans must be 17 years and 10 months old to register; more than half of U.S. teens live in states where pre-registration starts at age 16, which gives high schools more time to educate students. Texas also has a relatively early cutoff for registration, 30 days before Election Day.

All of these factors contribute to the low registration rate among young people in Texas, where 39.6% of 18-24 year olds were registered to vote in November 2022, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.

Once registered, the next challenge is educating students on the issues to motivate them to turn out. Young people who are registered are less likely to vote than older Texans. During the 2022 midterm elections, only 49% of registered Texas voters between 18 and 24 voted, compared to 86% of voters 65 and older.

Peña says his organization tries to connect with potential voters three times before early voting begins. During each interaction, they instruct the student on where to vote and tell them about different candidates' platforms.

To address transportation issues and possible long lines at polling places, Peña said his group is chartering buses that can transport students to and from different polling locations.

A segment of the student population is especially hard to convince to vote, said Zach Spanhak, vice president of the Texas Aggie Democrats at Texas A&M University. Those students are disillusioned with politics and feel like they aren't represented or heard by elected leaders.

""They feel like their vote doesn't matter,"" Spanhak said. ""It's a self-defeating mindset.""

Spanhak said he tries to break through to those voters but that sometimes it isn't possible.

Jeremy Muchemi, who leads a GenZ organization called Voters of Tomorrow, deals with young people who have a similar sentiment.

""A lot of people my age are feeling this resentment that neither side is listening to us,"" Muchemi said. ""We feel like we are yelling into a void.""

Muchemi said he has aspirations to run for office, but says he will wait.

""It's an insane atmosphere and I'm not ready for that right now,"" he said.

One of the first times Democratic state Sen. Morgan LaMantia, 37, crossed the Capitol rotunda and entered the House floor, a House member -- who didn't recognize the newly-elected senator from South Padre Island -- told her that staffers aren't allowed on the floor.

LaMantia, the second youngest state senator, recalled struggling to be taken seriously by fellow lawmakers, many of whom also assumed that she was a staffer rather than a senator.

""I've felt like I needed to work twice as hard so I would be seen as a peer and a colleague, as someone who could talk about the issues at their same level,"" said LaMantia.

LaMantia said she hopes to see more young people elected in Texas to challenge the stereotype that one must be older and more experienced to serve. She said she regularly visits high schools and colleges to have conversations about civic engagement in an effort to get them interested in politics from a young age.

""At first they are intimidated, but it quickly turns into a conversation among peers,"" LaMantia said. ""We get them interested and engaged in what's happening and have them see this as something they can pursue.""

LaMantia urges students who express interest in politics to apply for an internship in her office.

Research from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University has found that youth who are interested in running for office are much more likely to have been involved in political activities, whether by volunteering for a campaign or through activism. And young people who pay attention to elections tend to become more interested in running for office.

That was the case for state Rep. Cody Vasut, R-Angleton, 37, who served on the Angleton City Council as a 28-year-old before winning the Texas House District 25 seat in 2021.

Vasut's mother served on the local school board, his father was a justice of the peace and his grandfather was president of the Angleton Rotary Club. Every Wednesday evening, his family sat down for dinner and discussed the goings-on in the community.

""I had been out at the polls for my mom and dad since I was 9,"" Vasut said.

Nobody was surprised when Vasut expressed interest in running for local office, or when he sought a state seat, though he did recall being mistaken for a teenager while blockwalking in shorts and a t-shirt.

Vasut and others in his age group help challenge assumptions about who is qualified to serve in office, said Sara Suzuki, a senior researcher at the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement.

She said it's important to offer encouragement to young people considering running for office. Based on her research, young people show high levels of interest in running for office but are underrepresented on ballots because of perceived or actual financial barriers.

""Older people should not be representing the whole population,"" Suzuki said. ""Equitable representation is important, and because young people as a generation are more diverse in terms of race, gender identity and immigration status, getting them in office is a way to diversity who our elected officials are beyond age.""

Run GenZ, the group that helps young conservatives run for office, said they are pairing young conservatives who are interested in running for office with young elected officials who can offer support and encouragement.

""You don't need to wait 15 years to step up and run,"" said Morgan, the group's director. ""If you have a servant's heart, you're ready to run now.""

Courts keep weighing in on abortion. Next month's elections could mean even bigger changes,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-ruling-texas-georgia-5c5d73c45274f90d40f7a4a07f00a27a,2024-10-08T16:18:22Z,"Two court rulings Monday bolstered abortion opponents, with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that Texas could ban emergency abortions if they violate state law and Georgia's top court allowing enforcement of the abortion ban in that state.

The rulings are the latest in a legal saga that's been playing out a few rulings at a time across the U.S. for the past two years -- since the nation's top court overturned Roe v. Wade, ended the nationwide right to abortion, and opened the door to bans and restrictions, as well as the new legal fights that followed.

Meanwhile, abortion is also a top concern for voters ahead of next month's elections, including in nine states where it's on the ballot directly in the form of state constitutional amendments.

Here are five key things to know about the latest abortion developments across the country.

In the fallout of the 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, President Joe Biden's administration told hospitals that federal law required them to provide abortion services when the life of the pregnant person was at risk.

Texas sued over the policy, saying the federal government could not mandate the right to abortions that would violate the state's ban at all stages of pregnancy, with exceptions to protect the health and life of the woman.

On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court let that ruling stand. The justices did not detail their reasoning.

A weeks after a Georgia judge blocked the state's ban on abortion after the first six weeks or so of pregnancy, the state Supreme Court on Monday put it back into place -- at least for now.

The state's top court said the ban on abortion once cardiac activity can be detected, generally about six weeks into pregnancy and often before women realize they're pregnant, can be enforced while it considers the state's appeal of the September ruling.

It's not clear how many abortions were provided in the state that could not have been under the ban during the week the rules were relaxed. Some clinics said they were willing to provide abortions after six weeks, though.

The ruling meant that four states again bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy.

In another late-September development, a North Dakota ruling from earlier in the month striking down that state's abortion ban became official.

That means that 13 states are now enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, instead of 14.

But the impact of the ruling in North Dakota is limited to hospitals in the nation's second-least populous state.

The only clinic that provided abortions in the state moved from Fargo to nearby Moorhead, Minnesota, after the Dobbs ruling was made and North Dakota's ban took effect.

Court rulings are not the only place where abortion policy decisions are being made.

Voters in nine states are determining whether to add the right to abortion to their state constitutions.

In Missouri and South Dakota, the measures would undo current bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy. In Florida, it would lift a ban that kicks in after six weeks.

Nebraska has competing measures on the ballot. One would create the right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. The other would enshrine the current ban that kicks in after 12 weeks.

In Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana, it would enshrine, and in some cases expand, abortion rights. Nevada's vote would, too, but to take effect, the measure would have to pass a second time, in 2026.

Additionally, New York voters will decide on an amendment that would bar discrimination on the basis of pregnancy status, though it does not mention abortion by name.

Abortion is a major issue in elections for office, too -- including the presidential race.

Vice President Kamala Harris has been focusing on abortion rights in her presidential campaign. She says she wants to ""reinstate the protections of Roe"". She talked about it on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast this week and in a speech last month in Georgia.

Former President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has taken credit for nominating Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe. He says that the issue should be up to the states and, recently, that he would veto a nationwide abortion ban if Congress passed one. He has also said he would vote against the Florida ballot measure, though he has also criticized it as too restrictive."
"Biden visita Pensilvania y Wisconsin, estados clave en la contienda electoral",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/politics/general-news-c2c3ae97114764dcd76b65100c39386a,2024-10-08T16:06:24Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- El presidente Joe Biden hará una inusual incursión en la contienda política de 2024 desde que dio un paso atrás tras poner fin a su candidatura a la reelección.

El martes hará campaña en Pensilvania por un aliado y visitará Wisconsin para destacar un logro legislativo emblemático.

Pero mientras Biden hace un rápido recorrido por estos estados clave, dos senadores demócratas inmersos en reñidas batallas por la reelección están adoptando enfoques diferentes respecto al presidente saliente, cuyos índices de aprobación en una franja significativa del país siguen estando por los suelos.

Biden será recibido con los brazos abiertos por el senador demócrata Bob Casey cuando participe en un acto privado de recaudación de fondos para la campaña del legislador por Pensilvania en los suburbios de Filadelfia. Pero en Milwaukee, donde Biden está destacando los esfuerzos de su gobierno para sustituir las tuberías de plomo tóxicas del país, la senadora demócrata Tammy Baldwin estará ausente.

""Los demócratas en contiendas muy reñidas, en su mayoría, están calculando que el riesgo de apoyar a Biden supera con creces cualquier recompensa que sus esfuerzos puedan aportar a su campaña"", señaló Christopher Borick, director del Instituto de opinión pública del Muhlenberg College, en Pensilvania. ""No hay muchos lugares en los que pueda ser de gran ayuda a los demócratas en contiendas competitivas"".

Biden ha pasado poco tiempo haciendo campaña desde que puso fin a su proceso de reelección en julio. Eso hace que sus escalas en Pensilvania y Wisconsin -dos estados muy disputados que la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris y el expresidente Donald Trump consideran cruciales- sean aún más notables.

Las contiendas de Casey y Baldwin también se consideran imprescindibles para los demócratas, que intentan mantener su estrecho control del Senado.

Tras retirarse, Biden se comprometió a hacer campaña por Harris y los demócratas. Pero a medida que avanza la campaña, Biden se ha mantenido al margen y sigue siendo un sustituto inadecuado de Harris y de otras candidaturas demócratas.

Casey, que se enfrenta al republicano David McCormick en busca de su cuarto periodo en el Senado, mantiene una larga relación con Biden desde hace tiempo.

El senador demócrata creció en la misma calle que Biden en Scranton. Sus familias se conocen desde hace décadas, y Casey ha hecho campaña con Biden en innumerables ocasiones, incluso a principios de este año.

"Trump spoke to Putin as many as 7 times since leaving office, Bob Woodward reports in new book",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-biden-putin-war-ukraine-russia-zelenskyy-ce9c59f689d3f438264a64b2bfa0aa39,2024-10-08T16:06:12Z,"In the famed Watergate reporter's latest book, Woodward reports that Trump asked an aide to leave his office at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, so that the former president could have a private call with Putin in early 2024. The aide, whom Woodward doesn't name, said there have been multiple calls between Trump and Putin since Trump left office, perhaps as many as seven in that period, according to the book.

Woodward also reports that Trump sent Putin COVID-19 test machines for his personal use as the virus began spreading in 2020. Putin told Trump not to tell anyone because people would be mad at Trump over it, but Trump said he didn't care if anyone knew, according to the book. Trump ended up agreeing not to tell anyone.

Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, derided the reporting as ""made up stories"" and said the book is a work of fiction that could double as toilet paper.

""None of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,"" Cheung said in a statement.

He added: ""President Trump gave him absolutely no access for this trash book that either belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section of a discount bookstore or used as toilet tissue. Woodward is a total sleazebag who has lost it mentally, and he's slow, lethargic, incompetent and overall a boring person with no personality.""

A copy of the book, which is due out next week, was obtained early by The Associated Press. CNN first reported on the contents of the book Tuesday.

Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has spoken to or met with several foreign leaders since leaving office, most recently meeting in New York with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy amid rising public tensions between the two over Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion.

Trump has said he wants to have ""peace"" and that the war must end. The former president has been critical of U.S. support for Ukraine and said the country should have made concessions to Putin before Russia invaded in 2022. He also previously touted his good relationship with Putin and called the Russian leader ""pretty smart"" for invading Ukraine.""

"Encuesta: Votantes negros apoyan más a Harris, pero no están seguros de que cambiará las cosas",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/politics/encuesta-votantes-negros-apoyan-mas-a-harris-pero-no-estan-seguros-de-que-cambiara-las-cosas-b8e6e2f00c41d9e00df2a6b5503abc4b,2024-10-08T16:01:14Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Los votantes registrados negros tienen un punto de vista abrumadoramente positivo de la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris, pero no están seguros de que ella cambiará al país para bien, según una encuesta de AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

La encuesta, realizada a mediados de septiembre, halló que alrededor de un 70% de los votantes negros tienen una opinión muy o algo favorable de Harris, con escasa diferencia entre hombres y mujeres. Los votantes más jóvenes y los de edad más avanzada también tenían opiniones similares de la vicepresidenta.

Las opiniones entre los votantes negros hacia el expresidente y candidato presidencial republicano Donald Trump, en cambio, son abrumadoramente negativas, lo que subraya la dificultad que enfrenta en sus intentos por quitarle a Harris apoyo entre las personas de raza negra. Los votantes negros son un importante baluarte para los demócratas y pocos están alineados con el Partido Republicano. Según la encuesta, dos tercios de los votantes negros se identifican como demócratas, un 20% se identifica como independiente y solo un 10% se identifica como republicano.

Pero el sondeo también halló que, a pesar de la profunda discrepancia en los puntos de vista hacia los candidatos, los votantes negros tienen menos certeza en cuanto a que Harris pueda colocar al país en una mejor trayectoria o cambiar sus vidas de manera significativa. Preguntados si la frase ""Cambiaría al país para bien"" describe bien a Harris, solo la mitad dijo que la describiría muy o extremadamente bien, un 30% dijo que la describiría ""más o menos bien"" y un 20% dijo que la describe ""no muy bien"" o ""para nada bien"". Y solo alrededor de la mitad opinan que el resultado de estas elecciones tendrá ""mucho"" o ""algo"" de impacto en sus vidas, una proporción similar a la hallada en la población general.

""El Partido Demócrata no es lo suficiente fuerte para mí"", expresó Raina Johnson, una habitante de Chicago de 53 años de edad. Vaticinó que Harris ""tratará de hacer algo a favor de la gente"" pero se verá limitada ""como ocurrió con (Barack) Obama, porque el Partido Republicano le trancó el camino"".

Si bien Johnson opina que las elecciones serán muy importantes, no cree que le afectará mucho en su vida ""porque yo seguiré viviendo mi vida, seguiré adaptándome a los problemas que surjan"".

Preguntados sobre cuál candidato haría un mejor trabajo en encarar los temas que enfrentan al país -- como la economía, la atención médica y la delincuencia - la mayoría de los votantes negros coincidieron: Harris.

Al igual que en la población general, un 80% de los votantes negros dijeron que la economía es uno de los temas principales en esta campaña. Pero un 75% de los votantes negros dijeron que la atención médica es uno de los temas más importantes, comparado con poco más de la mitad de la población general. Además, los votantes negros son más propensos a opinar que las normas sobre tenencia de armas y la delincuencia son problemas importantes, que en la población general.

En todos esos temas, así como en otros como el aborto y el cambio climático, Harris supera cómodamente a Trump entre los votantes negros. Pero el tamaño de esa ventaja es mayor en algunos temas que en otros. Un 60% de los votantes negros opinan que Harris está mejor posicionada para manejar la economía, mientras que un 20% dice lo mismo de Trump, lo que le da a Harris una ventaja de alrededor de 40 puntos. En cuanto al aborto, ella tiene una ventaja de alrededor de 60 puntos.

La campaña de Trump ha estado aumentando sus intentos por ganarse el apoyo de las comunidades negras, creyendo que su mensaje en cuanto a la economía, la inmigración y los valores tradicionales puede quitarle votos a los demócratas, particularmente entre los hombres negros más jóvenes.

Rod Wettlin, un jubilado y veterano de la Fuerza Aérea en Surprise, Arizona que desea más acción en cuanto a la atención médica y la inmigración, dice que se opone fuertemente a Trump y que teme que la democracia estadounidense está en peligro.

""Lo que está pasando ahora es la culminación de algo a lo que nos hemos enfrentado desde hace años"", dijo Wettlin. ""Ojalá después de las elecciones volveremos a un discurso más civil, pero esta gente desde ya está clamando por un caos. Y eso es su derecho, yo luché para que ellos tengan ese derecho. Pero que no vengan a pisarme mis derechos"".

Hay indicios de que algunos votantes negros consideran a Harris una figura más fuerte. Las mujeres negras y los votantes negros de mayor edad especialmente son más propensos a describir a Harris como alguien que ""luchará a favor de gente como tú"", comparado con los hombres negros y los votantes negros más jóvenes.

Son relativamente pocos los votantes negros que tienen una opinión positiva de Trump, o que lo consideran un candidato poseedor de las cualidades necesarias para ser presidente. La encuesta halló que alrededor del 80% de los votantes negros tienen una opinión algo o muy desfavorable de Trump, mientras que apenas un 15% tienen una opinión algo o muy favorable. Apenas alrededor de un 10% dicen que frases como ""Cambiaría al país para bien"" o ""Lucharía por gente como tú"" describen bien a Trump, y una proporción igualmente baja de votantes negros dijeron que Trump sería un buen presidente.

""Creo que iremos por la dirección correcta si Kamala Harris gana"", opinó Roslyn Coble, una residente de Oakboro, Carolina del Norte, de 63 años de edad. ""Pero si Donald Trump gana, las cosas irán mal. Él ya dejó claro lo que va a hacer, va a ser un dictador"".

Alrededor del 70% de los votantes negros dicen que la frase ""Dirá cualquier cosa para ganar las elecciones"" describe a Trump por lo menos muy bien.

En un indicio de cómo la decisión del presidente Joe Biden de retirarse como candidato demócrata en julio podría haber afectado la contienda, solo un 55% de los hombres negros tienen una opinión favorable de Biden, comparado con 70% entre las mujeres negras.

Biden ""hizo lo mejor que pudo"", declaró Wettlin. Añadió que Biden debió haberse retirado mucho antes, y se mostró escéptico ante los logros del mandatario.

Grupos de activismo negro dicen que han detectado un aumento en energía y entusiasmo desde que Harris se convirtió en la candidata demócrata, y tanto la campaña de Harris como la de Trump siguen centrando esfuerzos en ese sector demográfico.

La campaña de Trump ha estado organizando eventos en vecindarios negros de ciudades como Filadelfia, Detroit y Milwaukee y organizó una gira en autobús con el lema ""Voces Negras A Favor De Trump"" en septiembre. Por su parte, la campaña de Harris ha realizado varios eventos orientados hacia los votantes negros, especialmente los hombres, y ha despachado a varios partidarios prominentes - como legisladores, celebridades y líderes de derechos civiles - en comunidades negras en semanas recientes.

La encuesta abarcó 1.771 votantes registrados y se realizó entre el 12 y 16 de septiembre usando una muestra AmeriSpeak, diseñada para ser representativa de toda la población estadounidense. Tiene un margen de error de +/- 3,4 puntos porcentuales."
Book Review: 'Countdown 1960' shows parallels with this year's presidential election season,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/countdown-1960-chris-wallace-book-review-203e5e4aa70216ea20905a4797e43fad,2024-10-08T15:55:44Z,"""Countdown 1960: The Behind-the-Scenes Story of the 312 Days that Changed America's Politics Forever"" is a look at a critical period in U.S. history that holds lessons for today.

CNN news anchor Chris Wallace starts the book in January 1960, when U.S. Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts declared his candidacy for the presidency during a divided time in United States politics. We are introduced to mobsters, Hollywood movie stars, labor bosses and Cuba's revolutionary leader Fidel Castro.

It was the year that U.S. presidential campaigns entered the modern era, with televised debates and slick advertising, The achingly close contest was not unlike the current lead-up to the 2024 election pitting Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris against Republican Donald Trump.

Like now, there were charges of voter fraud and a stolen election. The results were so tight that Americans stayed up well past midnight to hear the final count.

The book is the latest in Wallace's ""Countdown"" series of popular histories, following his best-selling ""Countdown 1945: The Extraordinary Story of the Atomic Bomb and the 116 Days that Changed the World,"" and ""Countdown bin Laden: The Untold Story of the 247-Day Hunt to Bring the Mastermind of 9/11 to Justice.""

This time, Wallace, the son of CBS broadcaster Mike Wallace, takes us behind the scenes to view the machinations of the 1960 Democratic National Convention that led to Kennedy's nomination over Lyndon B. Johnson, later chosen as his running mate. Kennedy went on to become the first Catholic and youngest person elected U.S. president.

Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican Richard M. Nixon, who ultimately decided not to contest the results despite reports of voting irregularities in Illinois and Texas. He said he could not think of a worse example for young nations trying to adopt free elections.

As we approach another consequential election this year, the book is a reminder of how 1960 was also a deeply perilous time for America. It also was a moment the nation survived because of patriotism and courage."
Oklahoma amends request for Bibles that initially appeared to match only version backed by Trump,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/oklahoma-bible-schools-trump-amend-99bec8ed6b67acd2d836913783c4fe7b,2024-10-08T15:32:03Z,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Oklahoma has amended its request for 55,000 Bibles to be placed in public schools that initially matched a version of the holy book endorsed by former President Donald Trump.

The request was amended Monday and no longer requires the Bibles to include U.S. historical documents such as the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution -- requirements that match the ""God Bless the USA Bible"" that Trump endorsed this year and that are several times more expensive than similar Bibles that don't include the U.S. documents.

The new request says the historical documents may be included together or separately and extends the deadline for offers to supply the items by one week, from Oct. 14 to Oct. 21.

The request is part of State Superintendent Ryan Walters' efforts to require Bibles in public school classrooms, which has been met with resistance by some of Oklahoma's largest school districts.

Walters, in a Monday video on X, said the Bible will be used ""because of its historical significance throughout this nation's history,"" blaming what he called the ""fake news media"" for lies about the program.

""The left-wing media hates Donald Trump so much, and they hate the Bible so much, they will lie and go to any means necessary to stop this initiative from happening,"" Walters said.

Walters' spokesperson, Dan Issett, said in a statement that the changes to the ""request for proposal,"" or RFP, were suggested by the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, which issues the requests and were agreed to by Walters.

""Unfortunately, there have been false reports that have been repeated by numerous, supposedly credible, news organizations that the state's RFP was catered to one specific organization,"" Issett said, noting that tailoring the request so that only one manufacturer's Bible would qualify would be illegal.

Christa Helfrey, a spokesperson for OMES, said the changes were made to the request to try to save taxpayer money.

""OMES worked with OSDE to amend the solicitation to provide the listed resources at a much better value to Oklahomans,"" Helfrey said.

The initial request included requirements that are not commonly found in Bibles but are included in the ""God Bless the USA Bible,"" which Trump urged his supporters to begin buying earlier this year at a website that sells the book for $59.99.

The Bibles must be bound in ""leather or leather-like material for durability,"" according to the initial request.

Similar Bibles that don't include the Declaration of Independence or Constitution are available online for less than $20."
The Latest: Harris continues media blitz with 3 more national interviews,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-2024-831fd5c5a53476639c664234b1dafe3b,2024-10-08T15:27:46Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris is continuing her media tour Tuesday with three more interviews for national audiences, with Election Day now just four weeks away.

The Democratic presidential nominee was scheduled to appear in New York with the women of ""The View,"" speak with radio host Howard Stern, and tape a show with late-night comedian Stephen Colbert. The trio of appearances comes after Harris granted interviews to CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" which aired Monday night, and Anderson's Cooper's podcast, which was released Sunday.

The blitz comes after Harris has largely avoided interviews since replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. Long past the midway point of her unexpected presidential campaign and with voting already underway, Harris is still introducing herself to Americans who will determine her fate in this year's presidential election.

Black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive view of Vice President Kamala Harris, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

About 7 in 10 Black voters have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, with few differences between Black men and women voters on how they view the Democratic candidate.

Black voters' opinions of former President Donald Trump, by contrast, were overwhelmingly negative, underscoring the challenges he faces as he seeks to erode Harris' support among Black men.

But the poll also found that despite this dramatic gap in views, many Black voters don't see Harris as a candidate who will set the country on a better trajectory or make a substantial difference in their own lives.

Jill Biden will return to the campaign trail this week on a tour of battleground states to help boost Vice President Kamala Harris.

Harris' campaign and the White House announced Tuesday that the first lady will depart Friday on a five-day, five-state swing with stops in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

The appearances will mark the first lady's return to campaigning. She had campaigned extensively for her husband, President Joe Biden, when he was running for reelection. But she pulled back after Biden folded his campaign and endorsed Harris to replace him on the Democratic ticket.

With four weeks to go until Election Day, Harris' campaign said the first lady will be urging people to get out and vote. The campaign noted that early voting is set to start Wednesday in Arizona and that mail ballots are going out in the five states that Jill Biden will be visiting.

President Joe Biden is campaigning through two key swing states, but two Democratic senators locked in competitive reelection battles are taking markedly different approaches to the the outgoing president.

Biden will be fully embraced by Democratic Sen. Bob Casey when he participates in a private campaign fundraiser in suburban Philadelphia for the senior Pennsylvania senator.

But in Milwaukee, where Biden is spotlighting his administration's efforts to replace the nation's toxic lead pipes, incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin will be conspicuously absent.

Biden has spent scant time on the campaign trail since ending his reelection effort in July. That makes his stops in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- two tightly contested states that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump see as crucial -- all the more notable.

But as Biden makes a quick swing through the key states, two Democratic senators locked in competitive reelection battles are taking markedly different approaches to the outgoing president, whose approval ratings in a significant swath of the country remain in the pits.

Casey's and Baldwin's races are also seen as must-wins for Democrats who are trying to maintain their razor-tight control of the Senate.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is speaking at Trump International Doral in Miami, headlining a memorial service for the attack on Oct. 7, 2023, against Israel, telling his audience the threat of Hurricane Milton wouldn't have kept him away.

""I think I'm the only person who flew into Florida today,"" Trump said at the outset of his remarks. ""I wouldn't have missed it, regardless.""

Milton, a Category 5 hurricane, could come ashore Wednesday in the Tampa Bay region.

Trump said he had never heard of a Category 5 hurricane hitting land. However, hurricanes Andrew and Michael in Florida were Category 5, the latter of which struck during his administration.

President Joe Biden has spoken with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to discuss preparations in Florida for the approaching Hurricane Milton and ongoing recovery efforts from the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene.

The White House confirmed the president's call with the governor after Vice President Kamala Harris earlier on Monday accused DeSantis of ""playing political games"" and engaging in ""political gamesmanship"" over the federal response to Helene.

Biden, according to the White House, asked DeSantis ""to call him directly if there is anything that can be done to further support the response and recovery efforts.""

Harris' office suggested earlier that DeSantis was dodging Harris, saying she reached out to the governor last week but the two never spoke.

DeSantis said that he ""didn't know that she had called"" and ""they didn't call me.""

Biden also spoke on Monday with Tampa Mayor Jane Castor and received a detailed briefing from National Weather Service Director Ken Graham on the expected impact Milton will cause.

Graham stressed during the briefing that people in the storm's path should evacuate now while there's time to do so.

Vice President Kamala Harris says she owns a Glock pistol and that she has fired it at a shooting range.

""I've had it for quite some time,"" said Harris, during an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" aired on Monday evening.

Harris last month at a campaign event with Oprah Winfrey noted that she was a gun owner. She caused a stir when she told Winfrey, ""If somebody breaks into my house, they're getting shot.""

Harris has advocated for stricter gun safety laws, while also underscoring that she and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are gun owners.

Harris laughed when asked by ""60 Minutes"" journalist Bill Whitaker if she had ever shot her weapon."
This Montana Senate candidate said his opponent ate 'lobbyist steak.' But he lobbied -- with steak,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/montana-republican-tim-sheehy-jon-tester-senate-race-democrat-wildfire-steak-c1408993f0b93cd851ec1a1daba6b096,2024-10-08T15:11:48Z,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) -- During an October debate, Montana GOP Senate candidate Tim Sheehy took a shot at his Democratic opponent, Sen. Jon Tester, for "" eating lobbyist steak '' while the Republican fought in Afghanistan.

But Sheehy himself had a taste for red meat and lobbying, according to emails obtained by The Associated Press. He combined the two in pursuit of government contracts that allowed his aerial firefighting company to rapidly expand over the past decade.

""I hope you enjoyed the steakhouse,"" Sheehy wrote to Ryan Osmundson, the state Budget Director after a November 2021 meeting in Martinsdale, Montana. Sheehy went on to describe his company's aircraft as ""ideal"" for a dedicated, state-based fleet of planes to aggressively fight fires. There's no indication the lobbying of Montana officials involved any wrongdoing by Bridger Aerospace or Sheehy.

Sheehy's bid to prevent Tester from winning a fourth term is widely seen as one of the GOP's best chances at reclaiming the Democratic-controlled Senate. The Republican's campaign has leaned heavily on his military record and business accomplishments while routinely criticizing Tester for being the top recipient of lobbyist cash in Congress.

Fighting wildfires from above

Sheehy's career as a U.S. Navy SEAL ended in 2014. By 2021, as CEO of Belgrade-based Bridger Aerospace, he was pressing Montana officials to put money into establishing a statewide aerial firefighting force that stood to benefit his company.

In subsequent months, a lobbyist working on behalf of Sheehy kept making the case for a dedicated Montana firefighting fleet, records show. And Sheehy met and communicated with top state officials, urging them to create the fleet under exclusive contracts to ensure the aircraft would be available when needed.

A director at a think tank for which Sheehy was a board member also called on Montana to direct those contracts to private firefighting companies like Bridger Aerospace.

""Admittedly, Bridger stands to benefit from the creation of a Montana Fire Force,"" Sheehy wrote in an email to Amanda Kaster, Director of the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation.

The agency's contract with Bridger Aerospace calls for the company to receive $51,621 a day for each of its six ""super scooper"" planes made available for duty, plus $17,605 per hour of flight time. The planes scoop water from lakes or other bodies of water and dump it on wildfires from above.

By the spring of 2023, Kaster spoke in favor of legislation that sharply increased state spending on fighting wildfires. In July, a Billings aircraft company announced that it was awarded the first-ever exclusive-use aerial firefighting contract from Kaster's agency.

Troubled finances and alleged mismanagement

Bridger Aerospace over the past decade secured contracts for work in at least nine states, the federal government and several Canadian provinces, according to the company.

The large contracts haven't been enough to avoid financial troubles. Sheehy's company -- held up by his campaign as ""a Montana success story"" -- has suffered persistent losses, a declining stock price and allegations of mismanagement.

Osmundson and Kaster did not respond to emails and telephone messages seeking comment.

It's also uncertain if the financial challenges faced by the company, which Sheehy founded a decade ago with his older brother, will be lasting. The only analyst tracking the company has maintained a positive rating for Bridger Aerospace even as its stock price plummeted.

The Sheehy campaign declined to make the candidate available for an interview or to directly answer questions about his lobbying.

""Tim is proud of his work to expand Montana's ability to fight wildfires, and he hears those efforts praised on the campaign trail from grateful Montanans who have had their homes and property saved from the devastation of wildfires by heroic aerial firefighters,"" the campaign said in a statement.

Federal contracts made up 69% of Bridger Aerospace's 2023 revenue, according to a company presentation. Lobbyists in Washington reported spending $450,000 since 2021 on its behalf.

Tester, Montana's incumbent Democratic senator, brought up the Republican's federal lobbying during the Sept. 30 debate in Missoula after Sheehy's remark about ""lobbyist steak.""

""Tim Sheehy set up his own lobbying firm in Washington, DC. Why? So he could try to influence elected officials, try to take them out and feed them those steaks he's talking about,"" Tester said.

Tester ranks number one among U.S. lawmakers in lobbyist contributions, taking in more than $500,000 this election cycle, according to the nonpartisan group OpenSecrets. The Democrat ranked second when he last sought re-election in 2018.

Bridger Aerospace has reported net losses of more than $150 million since the company went public in January 2023. The company has made Sheehy rich, with net worth of between $73 million and $256 million, according to his financial disclosures.

He invested $1.5 million in his Senate bid, kickstarting the campaign in its early months. His nomination was sealed when his main Republican primary rival bowed out after Sheehy was backed by national party leaders, including former President Donald Trump.

A Sheehy spokesperson blamed the company's fiscal problems on ""smears"" from Democrats and short-selling by investors looking to profit off the company's troubles.

Democrats have pounced on Sheehy's lobbying efforts and business troubles, hoping to debunk the candidate's claims of success.

Their criticism of Sheehy's private sector achievements echoes earlier attacks on two other Montana Republicans, U.S. Sen. Steve Daines and Gov. Greg Gianforte, who worked together at Bozeman software company RightNow Technologies. Democrats asserted in prior election cycles that claims by Daines and Gianforte of being job creators belied the company's role helping to outsource jobs overseas.

Differing views on ""a Montana success story""

Sheehy resigned as Bridger CEO in July, saying he wanted to concentrate on the Senate race. He remains a top shareholder in the company, which lost 70% of its value over the past year, and said he would put his stocks into a blind trust if elected.

The company hopes to have a positive cash flow for the first time this year, said spokesperson Alison Ziegler. It posted record revenue of $67 million in 2023.

Much of that goes to paying interest for debt the company took on for aircraft acquired under Sheehy, who is considered to have a strong chance of toppling Tester after Republicans dominated recent elections in the state. In March an auditor raised the specter of potential bankruptcy.

""If that's a Montana success story, I'd like to see a failure,"" said Marc Cohodes, a Wall Street investor and short-seller living in Bozeman, Montana, who's been a vocal critic of Sheehy's business record.

The company's problems leave Sheehy politically vulnerable, particularly among independent voters who are looking at his background rather than his party affiliation, said Jeremy Johnson, a political analyst at Carroll College.

The financial analyst who tracks Bridger Aerospace offered a rosier view in an August note to investors. Worsening wildfires would ""dramatically increase demand"" for its fleet of firefighting aircraft, wrote Aaron Moeller with Canaccord Genuity LLC. -- echoing the company's claims that climate change will increase demand for its services.

Sheehy's been more skeptical of climate change as a candidate, repeating Republican talking points that "" the climate is always changing "" and warning of a liberal ""climate cult "" that will hurt the energy industry through more regulations.

Moeller rated the stock favorably in mid-August as a ""buy."" The price has since dropped about 30%."
Harris hace campaña en podcasts y otros medios para llegar a los votantes,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/politics/general-news-06359cf38877693936c735a02260abc1,2024-10-08T15:07:52Z,"NUEVA YORK (AP) -- Cuando la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris apareció en el podcast de Alex Cooper, la conversación no comenzó con el análisis de posturas políticas. El objetivo, le dijo Cooper a la candidata demócrata, era ""conocerla a usted como persona"".

Y eso le pareció muy bien a Harris, que acudió al popular podcast ""Call Her Daddy"" porque ""una de las mejores formas de comunicarse con la gente es siendo auténtica"".

Mucho más allá de la mitad de su inesperada campaña presidencial, y con la votación ya en marcha, Harris sigue dándose a conocer a los votantes estadounidenses que determinarán su destino en la elección presidencial de este año.

El martes, su campaña mediática la llevara a distintos estudios en todo Manhattan, mientras la candidata demócrata trata de llegar a tantas personas como pueda en el menor tiempo posible. Es un marcado contraste con la época en la que evitaba dar entrevistas desde que reemplazó al presidente Joe Biden en la candidatura presidencial, y una forma implícita de reconocer que tiene que hacer más para superar al candidato republicano Donald Trump.

Harris conversará con las mujeres del programa ""The View"" de ABC, hablará con el conductor de radio Howard Stern y grabará un programa con el comediante nocturno Stephen Colbert. Las tres apariciones se producen después de que Harris concediera entrevistas en ""60 Minutes"" de CBS que se transmitió el lunes en la noche, y en el podcast de Cooper, emitido el domingo.

El podcast ""Call Her Daddy"" suele ser provocativo, y se habla abiertamente de sexo, pero Harris y Cooper comenzaron hablando de sus respectivas madres.

Harris señaló que el primer instinto de su madre fue nunca consolar a su hija mayor cuando se metía en problemas. En cambio, le preguntaba, ""¿Qué hiciste?"".

Aunque eso podría parecer frío, señaló la vicepresidenta, ""en realidad me estaba enseñando a pensar, dónde tuviste influencia en ese momento y qué pudiste decidir hacer o no. No dejes simplemente que las cosas te ocurran"".

Son interacciones como esas a las que el equipo de Harris da prioridad para la vicepresidenta, en las últimas cuatro semanas antes del día de la elección. Ella aún no ha dado entrevistas a diarios o revistas, pero su personal considera la posibilidad de que acuda a más podcasts donde piensan que Harris pueda llegar a votantes que no siguen los medios noticiosos tradicionales.

Anna Greenberg, una encuestadora demócrata, dijo que Harris debe motivar a las personas que se han desligado de la política porque piensan que ""todos los políticos son iguales, dicen lo mismo, no saben nada de mi vida, y no puedo identificarme con ellos en absoluto"".

""Quieren que les gustes y que puedan confiar en ti"", dijo.

Jennifer Harris, exdirectora de alto nivel de economía de la Casa Blanca, dijo que Harris tiene un camino más largo que recorrer por la forma en que se convirtió en candidata demócrata.

""No tuvimos una buena y larga elección primaria para conocer a Kamala Harris en la forma que muchos votantes están acostumbrados"", dijo. Harris debe hallar la manera de demostrar los instintos y principios que ""guiarán cientos de cuestiones políticas que surgirán durante la presidencia"".

El gobierno de Biden impone un plazo de 10 años a las ciudades para retirar tuberías de plomo,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/general-news-2f3f4cd4c78ead331ea705bc8bc6aa3d,2024-10-08T10:59:04Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Una década después de que la crisis de agua en Flint, Michigan, hiciera sonar las alarmas sobre el peligro que sigue suponiendo el plomo en el agua del grifo, el presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, marcó un plazo de 10 años para que ciudades de todo el país sustituyan sus conducciones de plomo, lo que completaba una agresiva estrategia dirigida a garantizar que el agua potable es segura para todos los estadounidenses.

Estaba previsto que Biden anunciara el martes la norma definitiva de la Agencia de Protección Ambiental de Estados Unidos (EPA, por sus siglas en inglés) en el estado disputado de Wisconsin, en el último mes de una ajustada campaña presidencial. El anuncio ponía sobre la mesa un asunto -- el agua potable segura -- que Kamala Harris ha priorizado como vicepresidenta y durante su campaña presidencial. La nueva norma sustituye a una regulación más laxa aprobada por el gobierno del expresidente Donald Trump que no incluía un requisito universal de sustituir las tuberías de plomo.

Biden y Harris creen que es ""un imperativo moral"" asegurarse de que todo el mundo tiene acceso a agua potable limpia, indicó el lunes a periodistas el administrador de la EPA, Michael Regan. ""Sabemos que más de 9 millones de tuberías de plomo antiguas siguen llevando agua a hogares en todo nuestro país. Pero la ciencia está clara desde hace décadas: no hay un nivel seguro de plomo en nuestra agua potable"".

La norma es la reforma más importante de los niveles autorizados de plomo en el agua en unas tres décadas. El plomo, un metal pesado utilizado en tuberías, pintura, munición y muchos otros productos, es una neurotoxina que puede causar una amplia gama de problemas de salud, desde trastornos de comportamiento a daño cerebral. El plomo reduce las puntuaciones de los niños en pruebas de inteligencia, merma su desarrollo e incrementa la tensión sanguínea en los adultos.

La EPA estima que el estándar más estricto impedirá que hasta 900.000 bebés tengan un peso bajo al nacer y evitará hasta 1.500 muertes prematuras al año por enfermedad cardiaca.

La nueva regulación es más estricta que la que se propuso el pasado otoño y requiere que los sistemas de agua se aseguren de que la concentración de plomo no supera un ""nivel de acción"" de 10 partes por mil millones, en comparación con las 15 partes por mil millones de la norma actual. Si se encuentran niveles más altos, los sistemas de agua deben informar a la población de formas para proteger su salud, incluido el empleo de filtros de agua, y tomar medidas para reducir la exposición al plomo al tiempo que trabajan para sustituir todas las conducciones de plomo.

Las tuberías de plomo suelen afectar sobre todo a zonas urbanas de bajos ingresos. Se encuentran con más frecuencia en zonas industriales y más antiguas del país, lo que incluye grandes ciudades como Chicago, Cleveland, Nueva York, Detroit y Milwaukee, donde Biden anunciará las normas el martes.

La nueva regla también revisa cómo se miden las cantidades de plomo, lo que podría incrementar de forma significativa el número de ciudades y sistemas de agua que se considera tienen niveles excesivos de plomo, indicó la EPA.

Para ayudar a las poblaciones a cumplir los criterios, la agencia ofrecerá una partida adicional de 2.600 millones de dólares para infraestructura de aguas a través de la ley bipartidista de infraestructura. La agencia también concederá 35 millones de dólares en concursos para programas para reducir el plomo en el agua potable.

El plazo de 10 años no empezará a contar hasta dentro de tres años, lo que da tiempo para prepararse a las compañías de suministros. Un número limitado de ciudades con una gran concentración de tuberías de plomo podría recibir un plazo más largo para cumplir la nueva norma.

Biden hará el anuncio en Milwaukee, que ocupa el quinto lugar en la lista de ciudades con mayor número de tuberías de plomo en el país, según la EPA. Las autoridades locales han dedicado dinero de la ley federal de infraestructura para acelerar los trabajos de sustitución de conducciones de plomo y cumplir el objetivo de retirarlas todas en 10 años, en comparación con el objetivo inicial de 60 años.

Las tuberías de plomo pueden corroerse y contaminar el agua potable. Retirarlas reduce de forma drástica la posibilidad de una crisis. En Flint, un cambio en la fuente de agua potable de la ciudad hace más de una década la hizo más corrosiva, lo que disparó los niveles de plomo en el agua corriente. Flint era el ejemplo más llamativo de las muchas ciudades que han tenido problemas para reducir los altos niveles de plomo, como Newark, en Nueva Jersey, Benton Harbor, en Michigan, y Washington D.C.

La norma original sobre plomo y cobre en el agua potable fue aplicada por la EPA hace más de 30 años. Las normas han reducido de forma significativa el plomo en el agua corriente, pero tenían lagunas legales que permitieron que algunas ciudades tomaran pocas medidas cuando se disparaban los niveles de plomo.

""Creo que hay un apoyo muy amplio a hacer esto. Nadie quiere beber agua del grifo contaminada con plomo ni básicamente beber agua de una cañita de plomo, que es lo que están haciendo millones de personas ahora"", dijo Erik Olson, experto en salud y alimentación en la organización sin fines de lucro Natural Resources Defense Council, refiriéndose en general a los esfuerzos de la EPA por sustituir las tuberías de plomo antes del anuncio oficial.

En la práctica, desenterrar las tuberías de plomo será un desafío enorme. La ley de infraestructura aprobada en 2021 ofrecía 15.000 millones de dólares para ayudar a las ciudades a sustituirlas, pero el coste total será muchas veces esa cifra. El requisito también se anunciaba después de que el gobierno de Biden propusiera nuevos estándares más estrictos para productos químicos duraderos conocidos como PFAS, o sustancias perfluoroalquiladas y polifluoroalquiladas. Esas normas también mejorarán la salud pública, aunque a un coste de miles de millones de dólares.

La American Water Works Association, un grupo sectorial, dijo cuando se anunció la propuesta que apoya los objetivos de la EPA, pero advirtió que el coste sería prohibitivo.

Otro obstáculo es encontrar las tuberías. Muchas ciudades no tienen registros fiables que indiquen dónde están. Está previsto realizar inventarios preliminares este mes, y muchas ciudades han dicho que no saben de qué material están hechas sus tuberías.

Biden sets a 10-year deadline for US cities to replace lead pipes and make drinking water safer,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lead-pipes-epa-flint-biden-wisconsin-4aae63134894762cbe904ee460e62708,2024-10-08T09:28:14Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A decade after the Flint, Michigan, water crisis raised alarms about the continuing dangers of lead in tap water, President Joe Biden is setting a 10-year deadline for cities across the nation to replace their lead pipes, finalizing an aggressive approach aimed at ensuring that drinking water is safe for all Americans.

Biden is expected to announce the final Environmental Protection Agency rule Tuesday in the swing state of Wisconsin during the final month of a tight presidential campaign. The announcement highlights an issue -- safe drinking water -- that Kamala Harris has prioritized as vice president and during her presidential campaign. The new rule supplants a looser standard set by former President Donald Trump's administration that did not include a universal requirement to replace lead pipes.

Biden and Harris believe it's ""a moral imperative"" to ensure that everyone has access to clean drinking water, EPA Administrator Michael Regan told reporters Monday. ""We know that over 9 million legacy lead pipes continue to deliver water to homes across our country. But the science has been clear for decades: There is no safe level of lead in our drinking water.''

The rule is the strongest overhaul of lead-in-water standards in roughly three decades. Lead, a heavy metal used in pipes, paints, ammunition and many other products, is a neurotoxin that can cause a range of disorders from behavioral problems to brain damage. Lead lowers IQ scores in children, stunts their development and increases blood pressure in adults.

The EPA estimates the stricter standard will prevent up to 900,000 infants from having low birthweight and avoid up to 1,500 premature deaths a year from heart disease.

The new regulation is stricter than one proposed last fall and requires water systems to ensure that lead concentrations do not exceed an ""action level"" of 10 parts per billion, down from 15 parts per billion under the current standard. If high lead levels are found, water systems must inform the public about ways to protect their health, including the use of water filters, and take action to reduce lead exposure while concurrently working to replace all lead pipes.

Lead pipes often impact low-income urban areas the most. They are most commonly found in older, industrial parts of the country, including major cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Detroit and Milwaukee, where Biden will announce the standards on Tuesday.

The new rule also revises the way lead amounts are measured, which could significantly expand the number of cities and water systems that are found to have excessive levels of lead, the EPA said.

To help communities comply, the agency is making available an additional $2.6 billion for drinking water infrastructure through the bipartisan infrastructure law. The agency also is awarding $35 million in competitive grants for programs to reduce lead in drinking water.

The 10-year timeframe won't start for three years, giving water utilities time to prepare. A limited number of cities with large volumes of lead pipes may be given a longer timeframe to meet the new standard.

Biden will make the announcement in Milwaukee, a city with the fifth-highest number of lead pipes in the nation, according to the EPA. Officials there are using money from the federal infrastructure law to accelerate lead-pipe replacement work and meet a goal to remove all lead pipes within 10 years, down from an initial 60-year timeframe.

Lead pipes can corrode and contaminate drinking water; removing them sharply reduces the chance of a crisis. In Flint, a change in the source of the city's drinking water source more than a decade ago made it more corrosive, spiking lead levels in tap water. Flint was the highest-profile example among numerous cities that have struggled with stubbornly high levels of lead, including Newark, New Jersey, Benton Harbor, Michigan, and Washington, D.C.

The original lead and copper rule for drinking water was enacted by the EPA more than 30 years ago. The rules have significantly reduced lead in tap water but have included loopholes that allowed cities to take little action when lead levels rose too high.

""I think there is very broad support for doing this. Nobody wants to be drinking lead-contaminated tap water or basically sipping their water out of a lead straw, which is what millions of people are doing today,"" said Erik Olson, a health and food expert at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, speaking generally about the EPA's efforts to replace lead pipes ahead of the official announcement.

Actually getting the lead pipes out of the ground will be an enormous challenge. The infrastructure law approved in 2021 provided $15 billion to help cities replace their lead pipes, but the total cost will be several times higher. The requirement also comes as the Biden administration proposes strict new drinking water standards for forever chemicals called PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. These standards will also improve public health although at a cost of billions of dollars.

The American Water Works Association, an industry group, said when the proposed rule was announced that it supports EPA's goals, but warned that costs could be prohibitive.

Another hurdle is finding the lead pipes. Many cities do not have accurate records detailing where they are. Initial pipe inventories are due this month, and many cities have said they don't know what substances their pipes are made of.

Biden makes rare dip into battleground state fray with visit to Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-pennsylvania-wisconsin-senate-races-casey-e7bb70bd880ca4927b5ba92acd0f3852,2024-10-08T09:27:17Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is making a rare jump into the 2024 political battleground fray since taking a step back after ending his reelection bid.

He'll campaign on Tuesday in Pennsylvania for a close ally and visit Wisconsin to spotlight a signature legislative achievement.

But as Biden makes a quick swing through the key states, two Democratic senators locked in competitive reelection battles are taking markedly different approaches to the outgoing president, whose approval ratings in a significant swath of the country remain in the pits.

Biden will be fully embraced by Democratic Sen. Bob Casey when he participates in an evening campaign fundraiser in Philadelphia for the senior Pennsylvania senator. But in Milwaukee, where Biden is spotlighting his administration's efforts to replace the nation's toxic lead pipes, incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin will be conspicuously absent.

""Democrats in tight races, for the most part, are calculating that the risk of embracing Biden far exceeds any reward that his efforts would bring to their campaign,"" said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania. ""There just aren't many places where he can be of much help to Democrats in competitive races.""

Biden has spent scant time on the campaign trail since ending his reelection effort in July. That makes his stops in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- two tightly contested states that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump see crucial -- all the more notable.

Casey's and Baldwin's races are also seen as must-wins for Democrats who are trying to maintain their razor-tight control of the Senate.

Biden, after dropping out, pledged to campaign hard for Harris and Democrats. But as the campaign season has played out, he's largely stayed on the sidelines as he's remained a flawed surrogate for Harris and down-ballot Democrats.

Casey, who faces a stiff challenge from Republican David McCormick as he seeks a fourth Senate term, has a long-running relationship with Biden.

Casey grew up on the same street as Biden in Scranton. Their families have known each other for decades, and he's campaigned with Biden countless times, including earlier this year. Biden -- a Delaware resident but a Pennsylvania native -- has long claimed Pennsylvania as his own.

Still, Biden faces considerable skepticism and his popularity has sagged amid pessimism about rising costs and doubts about whether at 81 he remains up to the job.

About 4 in 10 voters had a favorable view of Biden and about 6 in 10 had an unfavorable view, according to a Monmouth University poll published in late September.

Baldwin will spend Tuesday on the other side of Wisconsin from Biden, attending campaign events and getting an award, according to her campaign and Senate office.

""Senator Baldwin had a previously scheduled event at a family farm in Eau Claire to receive the American Farm Bureau Federation's 'Friend of Farm Bureau' award recognizing her leadership fighting for America's hardworking farmers, growers, and producers,"" said Eli Rosen, Baldwin's communications director, in response to a query about why she was skipping the president's visit.

Biden's favorability in Wisconsin has hovered around 40% for the past year and did not increase after he dropped out of the presidential race this summer, according to a recent Marquette University Law School poll.

Baldwin, who is seeking her third term, is facing a stiff challenge from Republican Eric Hovde, the CEO of a Wisconsin real estate development company.

She has skipped four of Biden's five appearances in the state this year, including two in her hometown of Madison, before he dropped out of the race.

However, Baldwin has appeared with Harris, including speaking to a crowd of more than 10,000 people last month in Madison.

""Baldwin may be able to skip a Biden event, but she cannot avoid the verdict of working families in Wisconsin when they head to the polls,"" said Wisconsin GOP chairman Brian Schimming.

Biden's visit to Wisconsin, which has some 340,000 lead pipes, comes as the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday issued a final rule requiring drinking water systems across the country to identify and replace lead pipes within 10 years.

Biden's 2021 infrastructure law provides $15 billion to find and replace the toxic pipes, a legacy the Biden White House says will have an impact on generations to come. Lead can lower IQ and create behavioral problems in children, and the administration believes the legislation will go a long way in removing some 9.2 million lead pipes carrying water to U.S. homes.

White House officials played down Baldwin's expected absence from the event, while noting that Wisconsin's other senator, Republican Ron Johnson, voted against the infrastructure law.

""Senator Baldwin is an amazing partner (to) this administration in leading the charge in the bipartisan infrastructure law,"" White House deputy chief of staff Natalie Quillian said of Baldwin's absence from the president's visit.

Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, whose district includes Wisconsin's deeply Democratic capital city of Madison, said Biden's policies are popular in the battleground state even if polls show he is not.

""I don't think that polling on Biden is based on what he's done in office,"" Pocan said. ""The problem with some of the polls is overly simplistic. He looks old and people don't want that in the White House, but he's not running anymore.""

Pocan, who is not in a competitive race, also defended Baldwin not appearing with Biden.

""If you're in a competitive race, you have your calendar,"" Pocan said. ""You have a strategy based on where you're trying to get votes and you don't change it when you have a surrogate come.""

Harris is still introducing herself as she sets out on media tour when people are already voting,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-stern-view-colbert-60-minutes-daddy-5a2af60ba0b1099e19cca151955c9855,2024-10-08T04:18:06Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- When Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview with podcaster Alex Cooper, the conversation didn't start by parsing policy positions. The goal, Cooper told the Democratic nominee, was ""to get to know you as a person.""

And that was just fine with Harris, who said she was on the popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast because ""one of the best ways to communicate with people is to be real.""

Long past the midway point of her unexpected presidential campaign and with voting already underway, Harris is still introducing herself to Americans who will determine her fate in this year's presidential election.

On Tuesday, her media blitz will take her to studios across Manhattan as the Democratic nominee tries to reach as many people as possible in the shortest period of time. It's a sharp shift after largely avoiding interviews since replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, and it's an implicit acknowledgment that she needs to do more to edge out Republican candidate Donald Trump.

Harris will sit for a conversation with the women of ABC's ""The View,"" speak with longtime radio host Howard Stern and tape a show with late-night comedian Stephen Colbert. The trio of appearances comes after Harris granted interviews to CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" which aired Monday night, and Cooper's podcast, which was released Sunday.

""Call Her Daddy"" is often raunchy, with frank talk about sex, but Harris and Cooper began by talking about their mothers.

Harris said her mother's first instinct was never to comfort her eldest daughter when she ran into problems. Instead, she asked, ""What did you do?""

Although that might sound cold, the vice president said, ""she was actually teaching me, think about where you had agency in that moment, and think about what you had the choice to do or not do. Don't let things just happen to you.""

It's interactions like those that Harris' team is prioritizing for the vice president in the final four weeks before Election Day. She has yet to give an interview to a newspaper or magazine, but her staff is pondering additional podcasts where they believe Harris can reach voters who aren't following traditional news sources.

Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said Harris has to energize people who have tuned out politics because they believe ""all the politicians are the same, they all say the same thing, they don't know anything about my life, I can't relate to them at all.""

""They want to like and trust you,"" she said.

Jennifer Harris, the former White House senior director of international economics, said Harris has a steeper hill to climb because of the way she became the Democratic nominee.

""We did not have a good long primary to meet Kamala Harris in the way most voters are accustomed to,"" she said. Harris has to find a way to demonstrate the instincts and principles that ""will be guiding any number of hundreds of specific policy questions that will come up in the course of the presidency.""

While Harris has unveiled some policy proposals during her two and half months at the top of the ticket -- such as increasing the child income tax credit and taking a range of actions to help lower the cost of housing -- she's given prime billing to speeches about her ""economic philosophy,"" like one she delivered in Pittsburgh two weeks ago.

There, Harris pushed back against Trump's claims that she's advancing ""communist"" ideas, embraced capitalism and positioned herself as a pragmatist who ""would take good ideas from wherever they come.""

""As president, I will be grounded in my fundamental values of fairness, dignity and opportunity,"" Harris said. ""And I promise you, I will be pragmatic in my approach.""

Senior campaign officials have largely blocked out criticism from some corners that Harris hasn't articulated more policy positions. Instead, they say that small yet pivotal numbers of still-undecided voters say they want to know more about Harris before making up their minds, and that the more those voters see Harris, the more they like her.

Republican communications strategist Kevin Madden said defining Harris in voters' eyes is the central challenge of the campaign.

""This race is actually pretty simple in the sense that the next few weeks are about who's going to fill in the blanks on who Harris is,"" he said.

Being a vice president confers a certain amount of basic name recognition. In October 2019, while Harris was one of many candidates in the Democratic presidential primary, AP-NORC polling found that about 3 in 10 Americans didn't know enough about her to have an opinion. That share dropped to around 1 in 10 Americans by early 2021, when she and Biden took office, where it stayed until earlier this summer.

Now, nearly all Americans know enough to have at least a surface opinion -- whether positive or negative -- of Harris.

But that doesn't mean perspectives on Harris are settled, or that Americans know as much as they would like about her. Harris' favorability numbers shifted slightly over the course of the summer, suggesting that opinion of her may still be somewhat malleable.

Other polls indicate that some voters are still looking for more information about Harris, while views of Trump appear to be more settled. One-quarter of likely voters said they still feel like they need to learn more about Harris, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll conducted after her debate against Trump, while about three-quarters say they pretty much already know what they need to know about her.

Trump, on the hand, was more of a known quantity. One in 10 likely voters said they feel like they need to learn more about Trump, while roughly 9 in 10 said they pretty much already know what they need to know.

On ""Call Her Daddy,"" Cooper told Harris that people are ""frustrated and just exhausted with politics in general.""

""Why should we trust you?"" she asked.

Harris answered by saying ""you can look at my career to know what I care about.""

She continued: ""I care about making sure that people are entitled to and receive the freedoms that they are due. I care about lifting people up and making sure that you are protected from harm.""

What polling shows about Black voters' views of Harris and Trump,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-black-voters-biden-78e344ddea4886dd23582f4a51eb0da6,2024-10-08T04:06:13Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive view of Vice President Kamala Harris, but they're less sure that she would change the country for the better, according to a recent poll from the  AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

The poll, which was conducted in mid-September, found about 7 in 10 Black voters have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, with few differences between Black men and women voters on how they view the Democratic candidate. Younger and older Black voters also had similar views of the vice president.

Black voters' opinions of former President Donald Trump, by contrast, were overwhelmingly negative, underscoring the challenges that the Republican candidate faces as he seeks to erode Harris' support among Black men. Black voters are an important Democratic constituency, and few are aligned with the Republican Party. According to the survey, two-thirds of Black voters identify as Democrats, about 2 in 10 identify as independents and about 1 in 10 identify as Republicans.

But the poll also found that despite this dramatic gap in views of the candidates, Black voters are less certain of whether Harris would set the country on a better trajectory, or make a substantial difference in their own lives. Only about half of Black voters say ""would change the country for the better"" describes Harris very or extremely well, while about 3 in 10 say it describes her ""somewhat well"" and about 2 in 10 say it describes her ""not very well"" or ""not well at all."" And only about half believe the outcome of this presidential election will have ""a great deal"" or ""quite a bit"" of impact on them personally, an assessment that's in line with Americans overall.

""The Democratic Party is not strong enough for me,"" said Raina Johnson, 53, a safety case manager in Chicago. Johnson predicted that Harris would ""try to do something for the people"" but she felt that Harris would be limited as it was ""with (Barack) Obama, because the Republican Party shut him down.""

While Johnson felt that the stakes of the election were extremely high, she did not think it would have a large personal impact on her.

""Because I'll still live my life. I'll just have to roll with the punches,"" she said.

When asked which candidate would do a better job handling their top issues, including the economy, health care and crime, Black voters had the same answer: Harris.

Like voters overall, about 8 in 10 Black voters said the economy is one of the most important issues to their vote. But about three-quarters of Black voters said health care was one of their most important issues, compared to slightly more than half of registered voters, and they were also more likely than the electorate as a whole to say gun policy and crime were top issues.

In all of those areas, as well as on other topics like abortion and climate change, Harris held a commanding advantage over Trump among Black voters. But the size of that edge was bigger on some issues than others. About 6 in 10 Black voters said Harris was better positioned to handle the economy, while about 2 in 10 said this about Trump, giving Harris about a 40-point advantage. On abortion policy, she had around a 60-point advantage over Trump.

The Trump campaign has stepped up with some outreach to Black communities this year. The former president's campaign believes that his message on the economy, immigration and traditional values can make notable inroads into the Democrats' traditional base of support among Black voters, especially younger Black men.

Rod Wettlin, a retired Air Force veteran in Surprise, Arizona, who wants greater action on issues like health care and immigration, said he was deeply opposed to Trump and was concerned about the implications of the election for American democracy.

""What's going on now is the culmination of a lot of stuff that's been in our face for years,"" said Wettlin. ""Hopefully after the election it is civil, but these cats out here are already calling for bedlam. And that's their right, I fought for them to have that right. But don't infringe on mine.""

There are signs that some groups of Black voters see Harris as a stronger figure, though. Black women voters and older Black voters were especially likely to describe Harris as someone who would ""fight for people like you,"" compared to Black men and younger Black voters.

Relatively few Black voters have a positive view of Trump, or see him as a candidate who has important qualities for the presidency. The poll found that about 8 in 10 Black voters have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Trump, while just 15%  have a somewhat or very favorable view. About 1 in 10 said ""would change the country for the better"" or ""would fight for people like you"" describes Trump at least very well, and a similarly low share of Black voters said that Trump would make a good president.

""I think we're headed in the right direction if Kamala Harris gets it,"" said Roslyn Coble, 63, and a resident of Oakboro, North Carolina. ""But if Donald Trump gets it, it's going to be bad. He already told us what he's going to do. He's going to be a dictator.""

About 7 in 10 Black voters say the phrase ""will say anything to win the election"" describes Trump at least very well.

In a sign of how former President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw as the Democratic candidate in July may have altered the race, only 55% of Black men voters have a favorable view of Biden, compared to 7 in 10 Black women voters.

""He did his best,"" said Wettlin. He said that Biden should have bowed out of the presidential race far sooner and was skeptical of some of his achievements.

Black voter engagement organizations say they have also seen a burst of energy from voters and advocates since Harris' entrance into the race, and both the Harris and Trump campaigns are continuing to focus on this group.

The Trump campaign has been conducting listening sessions and community events in Black neighborhoods in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee. The campaign has also coordinated a ""Black Voices for Trump"" bus tour across cities in September. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign has held a number of events geared toward Black voters, especially Black men, and has deployed a number of high-profile surrogates, including lawmakers, celebrities and civil rights leaders, to Black communities in recent weeks.

The poll of 1,771 registered voters was conducted Sept. 12-16, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points."
Taylor Swift is back to watch Travis Kelce and the Chiefs with Eras Tour soon to resume,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/chiefs-taylor-swift-travis-kelce-arrowhead-b386bd5deb5b6588f255d62068417cae,2024-10-07T23:51:17Z,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Taylor Swift was back at Arrowhead Stadium on Monday night to see her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and the Kansas City Chiefs play the New Orleans Saints after the pop superstar had missed the team's previous two games on the road.

Swift is in the final days of a break from her record-setting Eras Tour, which resumes with the first of three shows Friday night at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. The tour's North American leg continues in New Orleans and Indianapolis before heading to Toronto and Vancouver in November and December. The final show is scheduled for Dec. 8.

Swift also missed Kelce's annual Kelce Car Jam over the weekend, a charity car show that raises money for his 87 and Running foundation, which helps underserved youth in the areas around Kansas City and Cleveland. There was still plenty of star power with Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, joining Kelce's parents his brother, retired Eagles center Jason Kelce.

Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the ""Anti-Hero"" singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. Since then, the two have spent plenty of time together, often with cameras following every move.

Swift has stayed out of the spotlight the past couple of weeks, though. That after a particularly headline-grabbing week in which she endorsed Kamala Harris for president, took home seven trophies from the MTV Video Music Awards, and show up to see the Chiefs beat the visiting Cincinnati Bengals.

Swift has become close friends with the Mahomes family over the past year. That created some controversy when the 14-time Grammy winner said she supported Harris over Donald Trump in the November election; Trump has referenced the quarterback's wife after she had liked -- and then unliked -- an Instagram post by the Republican presidential nominee.

Patrick Mahomes has declined to endorse anyone in the election, instead urging people to register to vote.

""I don't want my place and my platform to be used to endorse a candidate,"" Mahomes said. ""My place is to inform people to get registered to vote. It's to inform people to do their own research and then make the best decision for them and their family."""
Harris calls Trump 'incredibly irresponsible' for spreading misinformation about Helene response,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-hurricane-helene-misinformation-552e413dfb6c1b3e37eca0d2114668ea,2024-10-07T23:47:45Z,"""There's a lot of mis- and disinformation being pushed out there by the former president about what is available, particularly to the survivors of Helene,"" Harris told reporters before boarding Air Force Two to fly to New York. ""It's extraordinarily irresponsible. It's about him. It's not about you.""

Helene has killed more than 220 people in six states, and Category 5 Hurricane Milton is on a path toward Florida's Gulf Coast.

Trump has made a series of false claims in the wake of Helene, including saying incorrectly that the federal government is intentionally withholding aid to Republican disaster victims. He also falsely claimed the Federal Emergency Management Agency had run out of money because all of it had gone to programs for immigrants in the country illegally.

Harris said ""the reality is that FEMA has so many resources that are available to folks who desperately need them now, and resources that are about helping people get back on their feet and rebuild and have places to go.""

""People are entitled to these resources, and it is critically important that people apply for the help that is there to support,"" the vice president added. ""All those resources were created for just these types of moments, in an emergency situation, knowing that folks are entitled to have the relief that they so rightly need.""

Trump also said during a visit Valdosta, Georgia, last week that President Joe Biden was ""sleeping"" and not responding to calls from Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. Biden had, in fact, spoken with Kemp and said of Trump, ""He's lying, and the governor told him he was lying.""

Harris also criticized another high-profile Republican, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, suggesting he's ""playing political games"" and engaging in ""political gamesmanship"" in Helene's wake.

Harris office says the vice president reached out to DeSantis last week in the storm's aftermath. DeSantis said Monday that he ""didn't know that she had called"" and ""they didn't call me.""

""It wasn't anything anybody in my office did in saying that it was political,"" DeSantis said.

But Harris, asked about DeSantis, said ""people are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations ... is utterly irresponsible.""

""It is selfish and it is about political gamesmanship instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first,"" Harris said without naming DeSantis.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, at her briefing with reporters Monday, noted that DeSantis was invited to tour Helene damage in Florida with Biden but didn't join him.

""If you have the president, and you have the vice president, reaching out to offer up assistance -- providing to your constituents, the people who live in your state, to make sure we are doing everything that we need to do from the federal response,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""It's up to the governor, it's up to him if he wants to respond to us or not."""
Intelligence officials say US adversaries are targeting congressional races with disinformation,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/congress-russia-trump-china-cuba-disinformation-election-a4de250124d7cb93f16718831d0715a9,2024-10-07T22:33:09Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's not just the presidential election: Foreign governments are targeting House and Senate races around the country in their effort to meddle with American democracy this election year, intelligence officials warned Monday.

Russia, China and Cuba have all launched influence operations designed to help or hurt candidates in specific congressional races. Without giving specifics about the number of affected races, an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Monday that all three countries have zeroed in on races where they believe they have a national security interest at stake.

The warning from intelligence officials comes during a particularly tight battle for the House and Senate, where control could be decided by just a handful of races. While much of the attention has focused on attempts by foreign adversaries to influence the presidential race, Monday's warning underscores the threat that online disinformation also poses in state and local contests.

Leaders in Russia, China and Cuba understand the American political system well enough to recognize that this year's close elections create good conditions for the use and spread of disinformation, said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity under rules set by the office of the director.

Foreign adversaries have also targeted some races even further down the ballot, including statewide offices and state legislative campaigns, the official said.

Moscow's goal is to erode support for congressional candidates who favor assisting Ukraine in its war with Russia. Officials wouldn't say which candidates were targeted, but it's likely that the Kremlin's effort is intended to hurt Democrats and centrist Republicans who have supported Ukraine.

China has targeted candidates from both parties based on their stance on issues of key importance to Beijing, including support for Taiwan. Officials said they have observed Chinese disinformation agencies focusing on candidates in ""tens"" of races.

Cuba's government has mounted a narrower operation aimed at boosting candidates it believes would favor better relations with the island, such as reduced economic sanctions.

Influence operations can include false or exaggerated claims and propaganda designed to mislead voters about specific candidates, issues or races. It can also include social media posts or other digital content that seeks to suppress the vote through intimidation or by giving voters false information about election procedures.

Along with cyberattacks on election systems, influence operations that stoke distrust and divisiveness are a critical threat facing the 2024 election, national security officials have said.

State and local authorities have invested heavily in securing the vote that last week, Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told The Associated Press there is no way a foreign adversary could alter the overall results.

Disinformation can be a harder threat to quantify. Foreign adversaries create networks of fake websites and social media accounts mimicking Americans, and then work to amplify divisive and incendiary claims about contentious debates like immigration, the economy or the federal government's response to disasters.

Officials in Russia, China, Iran and Cuba have all rejected accusations that their governments are trying to interfere with the U.S. election, despite indications that the use of disinformation designed to influence the outcome of this year's elections is increasing.

When foreign governments target a specific candidate, office or organization with election information they are often given what's called a defensive briefing by intelligence officials. While ODNI won't say how many defensive briefings they have delivered so far this election cycle, they say the number is three times higher than the previous cycle.

In the presidential race, intelligence officials have concluded that Russia supports Trump, who has criticized Ukraine and the NATO alliance while praising Russian President Vladimir Putin. They have assessed that China is taking a neutral stance in the race between the Republican former president and Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat.

Iran opposes Trump's reelection, intelligence officials have said, seeing him as more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran. Trump's administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran's leaders to vow revenge.

Last month federal authorities charged three Iranian men for their alleged involvement in Iran's hacking of Trump's campaign. Iran later offered the material to Trump's Democratic opponent, but no one replied.

Officials said Monday they have seen no indications that Iranian disinformation is targeting down ballot races so far in 2024."
"Trump dice que inmigrantes que cometieron asesinatos han introducido ""muchos genes malos"" en EEUU",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/politics/elecciones-en-eeuu-donald-trump-ecf46ca25565a65003b0727687d89ace,2024-10-07T21:20:39Z,"NUEVA YORK (AP) -- El candidato republicano a la presidencia de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, insinuó el lunes que los migrantes que están en Estados Unidos y han cometido asesinatos lo hicieron porque ""está en sus genes"". Añadió que hay ""muchos genes malos en nuestro país ahora mismo"".

Este es el caso más reciente en que Trump alega que los migrantes están cambiando la composición genética de Estados Unidos. El año pasado, evocó palabras utilizadas en su día por Adolf Hitler para argumentar que los migrantes que entran ilegalmente en Estados Unidos están ""envenenando la sangre de nuestro país"".

Trump hizo sus comentarios el lunes en una entrevista radiofónica con el presentador conservador Hugh Hewitt. Estaba criticando a su oponente demócrata, la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris, cuando abordó el tema de la inmigración, y citó estadísticas que el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional dice que incluyen casos del gobierno de Trump.

""¿Qué hay sobre permitir que entren personas a través de una frontera abierta, 13.000 de las cuales eran asesinos? Muchos de ellos asesinaron a mucho más de una persona"", afirmó Trump. ""Y ahora viven felices en Estados Unidos. Ya saben, ahora un asesino... creo esto: está en sus genes. Y tenemos muchos genes malos en nuestro país ahora mismo. Entonces tuvieron 425.000 personas que entraron a nuestro país que no deberían estar aquí y que son criminales"".

El equipo de campaña de Trump dijo que sus comentarios con respecto a los genes se referían a los asesinos.

""Se refería claramente a asesinos, no a migrantes. Es bastante repugnante que los medios de comunicación sean siempre tan rápidos para defender a asesinos, violadores y criminales ilegales si eso significa escribir un titular malo sobre el presidente Trump"", dijo en un comunicado Karoline Leavitt, secretaria nacional de prensa de la campaña de Trump.

El Servicio de Control de Inmigración y Aduanas de Estados Unidos (ICE, por sus siglas en inglés) dio a conocer el mes pasado al representante republicano Tony Gonzales datos sobre las personas bajo su supervisión, incluidas las que no están bajo custodia del ICE. Eso incluyó a 13.099 personas que fueron declaradas culpables de homicidio y 425.431 personas que son criminales convictos.

Pero esas cifras abarcan décadas, incluso el gobierno de Trump. Y aquellos que no están bajo custodia del ICE podrían estar detenidas por agencias policiales estatales o locales, según el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, que supervisa al ICE.

El equipo de campaña de Harris declinó hacer comentarios.

Cuando se le preguntó el lunes durante su rueda de prensa por el comentario de Trump sobre los ""genes malos"", la secretaria de prensa de la Casa Blanca, Karine Jean-Pierre, dijo que ""ese tipo de lenguaje es odioso, repugnante, inapropiado y no tiene cabida en nuestro país"".

El gobierno de Biden ha endurecido las restricciones de asilo para los migrantes, y Harris, tratando de hacer frente a una vulnerabilidad mientras hace campaña, se ha esforzado por proyectar una postura más dura en materia de inmigración.

El expresidente y candidato republicano ha hecho de la inmigración ilegal una parte central de su campaña para 2024, y ha prometido llevar a cabo la mayor operación de deportación de la historia de Estados Unidos si resulta elegido. Cuenta con un largo historial de comentarios que difaman a los migrantes, como referirse a ellos como ""animales"" y ""asesinos"", y decir que propagan enfermedades.

El mes pasado, durante su debate con Harris, Trump afirmó falsamente que los migrantes haitianos de Ohio raptaban y se comían a las mascotas.

Como presidente, cuestionó por qué Estados Unidos aceptaba migrantes de Haití y África en lugar de Noruega, y dijo a cuatro mujeres congresistas, todas ellas personas de color y tres de las cuales habían nacido en Estados Unidos, que ""se devolvieran y ayudaran a arreglar los lugares totalmente destrozados e infestados de delincuencia de los que procedían"".

FEMA administrator continues pushback against false claims as Helene death toll hits 230,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-fema-826effecab238ff0acf0556ad64b0df2,2024-10-07T21:02:26Z,"The head of the U.S. disaster response agency continued to forcefully push back Monday against false claims and conspiracy theories about her agency's response to Hurricane Helene as the death toll from the storm continued to climb.

Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell pointed to the agency's massive, collaborative effort that keeps growing, and she strongly urged residents in hard-hit areas to accept the government's offer for assistance.

""We have thousands of people on the ground, not just federal, but also our volunteers in the private sector,"" Criswell said at a news conference in Asheville, North Carolina. ""And frankly, that type of rhetoric is demoralizing to our staff that have left their families to come here and help the people of North Carolina. And we will be here as long as they're needed.""

Misinformation has spread over the past week in communities hit the hardest by Helene, including that the federal government is intentionally withholding aid to people in Republican areas. Former President Donald Trump and other Republicans have questioned FEMA's response and falsely claimed that its funding is going to migrants or foreign wars.

FEMA has dedicated part of its website to providing accurate answers to questions and addressing rumors on its response to Helene.

On Friday, the agency put out a statement debunking rumors that it will only provide $750 to disaster survivors to support their recovery. Criswell said that initial money helps residents with expenses for medicine or food. She said additional funding will be available to reimburse them for the cost of home repairs, personal items lost, post-hurricane rental units and hotel stays.

""But I can't give it to them if they don't apply,"" Criswell said. ""And if people are afraid to apply, then it is hurting them.""

When asked directly about a circulating claim that FEMA would seize people's property if they don't pay back the $750 in within one year, Criswell said that was ""absolutely false.""

The cleanup and response to the storm that killed at least 230 people continued Monday, while Milton strengthened rapidly into a Category 5 hurricane on a path toward Florida, the same area battered by Helene less than two weeks ago.

More than 130,000 customers in western North Carolina were still without electricity Monday, according to poweroutage.us.

Also in North Carolina, more than 1,600 local and state search-and-rescue team members have been joined by about 1,700 members of the state National Guard, according to Gov. Roy Cooper's office.

Meanwhile, the Pentagon said Monday that an additional 500 active-duty troops have been deployed to North Carolina. Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said troops with advanced technological assets will be arriving, bringing the total number of active-duty forces to about 1,500. The troops are bringing surveillance equipment to allow officials to get a better overview of the region.

Air Force Gen. Gregory Guillot, commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, said search-and-rescue aircraft were flying 10-hour sorties providing wellness checks, medical care and evacuations. He called the military's operations the ""most important and honorable mission for us, which is to help fellow citizens.""

Cooper said more than 50 water systems were destroyed or impaired by the storm and that the pace of restoring service varies by community. He said he couldn't give a specific timeline but said the process might take longer in Asheville and Buncombe County, where at least six dozen people died.

""It's still going to be a while,"" he said.

In South Carolina, officials estimate $250 million has been spent on debris cleanup, infrastructure damage and emergency response. More than 300 homes were destroyed and 5,200 damaged, state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said Monday.

The state's largest school district, Greeneville County, plans to reopen Wednesday after shutting down for seven days. The district said it has had to modify bus routes because of blocked roads, closed bridges, sinkholes, and traffic signal outages at major intersections.

In Tennessee, where at least 12 people died from Helene, Gov. Bill Lee on Monday visited Bristol Motor Speedway, now a hub for collecting donations for victims and centralizing other operations in the wake of the flooding. Lee met with coordinators and volunteers who were sorting through donations.

""These are Tennesseans and they're hurting,"" Lee said. ""Not only are they hurting, but they're helping.""

"Corte Suprema de EEUU reanuda con casos de armas fantasma, pena de muerte y derechos transgéneros",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/general-news-4504aea5fa1ae7f6e798ce67c24fa1cf,2024-10-07T19:57:26Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- La Corte Suprema se sentó de nuevo en el banquillo el lunes, lista para escuchar casos sobre armas fantasma, una sentencia de muerte y los derechos de las personas transgénero.

Sentado frente a las imponentes columnas de mármol de la sala, el presidente de la Corte Suprema, John Roberts, anunció el fin formal del mandato anterior del tribunal, cuando una serie de casos importantes incluyeron una resolución que otorgaba amplia inmunidad al expresidente Donald Trump.

A continuación, dio inicio al nuevo mandato. La agenda no está tan cargada, pero el tribunal de mayoría conservadora podría tener que intervenir en disputas electorales después de la votación de noviembre.

A continuación, los magistrados conocieron su primer caso, relativo a las solicitudes de ayuda por desempleo presentadas en Alabama durante la pandemia.

El inicio del mandato se produce tras un paréntesis de verano relativamente ajetreado para el tribunal. Entre las órdenes que emitieron sobre apelaciones de urgencia se incluía la negativa a restablecer el plan de préstamos estudiantiles del presidente Joe Biden y la aprobación parcial de una ley de Arizona que exigía una prueba de ciudadanía para votar.

El nuevo mandato se abre en un contexto de escasa confianza pública en la Corte Suprema y de continuo debate sobre si su código ético, recientemente adoptado, debe contar con un mecanismo de ejecución.

A continuación se exponen algunos de los casos que se presentarán:

Los jueces escucharán un caso el martes sobre regulaciones para armas fantasma, armas fabricadas privadamente que son difíciles de rastrear para la policía porque no tienen números de serie.

El número de estas armas de fuego encontradas en escenas de crímenes se ha disparado en los últimos años, pasando de menos de 4.000 en 2018 a casi 20.000 recuperadas por las fuerzas del orden en 2021, según datos del Departamento de Justicia.

Las cifras han disminuido en múltiples ciudades desde que el gobierno de Biden comenzó a exigir la verificación de antecedentes y de la edad para los kits de armas fantasma que se pueden comprar en línea.

Pero los fabricantes y los grupos de defensa de los derechos de las armas sostienen que el gobierno se extralimitó y que la norma debería anularse.

En las décadas transcurridas desde que Richard Glossip fue condenado a muerte por un plan de asesinato a sueldo en 1997, el caso se ha convertido en uno de los pocos en que los fiscales reconocen haber cometido errores.

El fiscal general republicano de Oklahoma se ha unido a Glossip para intentar anular su condena por asesinato y su pena de muerte.

A pesar de esas dudas, un tribunal de apelaciones de Oklahoma ha confirmado la condena de Glossip, y la junta de indultos y libertad condicional del estado se ha bloqueado en una votación para concederle clemencia.

El tribunal escuchará los argumentos de su caso el miércoles.

Tal vez el caso más seguido de la Corte en lo que va de año sea la lucha por los derechos de la comunidad transgénero.

El caso sobre las prohibiciones estatales de la atención a la afirmación del género se presenta en un momento en que los estados liderados por los republicanos promulgan una serie de restricciones, como la participación en deportes escolares, el uso de los baños y los espectáculos de drags.

El gobierno y los estados liderados por los demócratas han ampliado las protecciones para las personas transgénero, aunque la Corte Suprema ha prohibido por separado que el gobierno aplique una nueva normativa federal que pretende proteger a los estudiantes transgénero.

Los magistrados sopesarán una ley de Tennessee que restringe los inhibidores de pubertad y la terapia hormonal para los menores transgénero. El caso aún no tiene fecha de audiencia, pero es probable que se discuta en diciembre."
Trump says migrants who have committed murder have introduced 'a lot of bad genes in our country',AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-immigration-2024-election-2157777f240142e5aed38be192a52b25,2024-10-07T19:27:27Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Monday suggested that migrants who are in the U.S. and have committed murder did so because ""it's in their genes."" There are, he added, ""a lot of bad genes in our country right now.""

It's the latest example of Trump alleging that immigrants are changing the hereditary makeup of the U.S. Last year, he evoked language once used by Adolf Hitler to argue that immigrants entering the U.S. illegally are ""poisoning the blood of our country.""

Trump made the comments Monday in a radio interview with conservative host Hugh Hewitt. He was criticizing his Democratic opponent for the 2024 presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris, when he pivoted to immigration, citing statistics that the Department of Homeland Security says include cases from his administration.

""How about allowing people to come through an open border, 13,000 of which were murderers? Many of them murdered far more than one person,"" Trump said. ""And they're now happily living in the United States. You know, now a murderer -- I believe this: it's in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now. Then you had 425,000 people come into our country that shouldn't be here that are criminals.""

Trump's campaign said his comments regarding genes were about murderers.

""He was clearly referring to murderers, not migrants. It's pretty disgusting the media is always so quick to defend murderers, rapists, and illegal criminals if it means writing a bad headline about President Trump,"" Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's national press secretary, said in a statement.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released immigration enforcement data to Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales last month about the people under its supervision, including those not in ICE custody. That included 13,099 people who were found guilty of homicide and 425,431 people who are convicted criminals.

But those numbers span decades, including during Trump's administration. And those who are not in ICE custody may be detained by state or local law enforcement agencies, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.

The Harris campaign declined to comment.

Asked during her briefing with reporters on Monday about Trump's ""bad genes"" comment, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, ""That type of language, it's hateful, it's disgusting, it's inappropriate, it has no place in our country.""

The Biden administration has stiffened asylum restrictions for migrants, and Harris, seeking to address a vulnerability as she campaigns, has worked to project a tougher stance on immigration.

The former president and Republican nominee has made illegal immigration a central part of his 2024 campaign, vowing to stage the largest deportation operation in U.S. history if elected. He has a long history of comments maligning immigrants, including referring to them as ""animals"" and ""killers,"" and saying that they spread diseases.

Last month, during his debate with Harris, Trump falsely claimed Haitian immigrants in Ohio were abducting and eating pets.

As president, he questioned why the U.S. was accepting immigrants from Haiti and Africa rather than Norway and told four congresswomen, all people of color and three of whom were born in the U.S., to ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.""

A Michigan Senate candidate aims to achieve what no Republican has done in three decades,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/senate-michigan-rogers-slotkin-4d193fdb4043982c7d8b39354b07fb8f,2024-10-07T18:37:53Z,"ROCHESTER, Mich. (AP) -- As canvassers for U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers navigate the manicured lawns and gated communities of some of Detroit's wealthiest suburbs, they walk a fine line in their efforts to convince Republicans disillusioned with Donald Trump to back other GOP candidates next month.

Nowhere else in Michigan reflects the state's recent shift toward Democrats more than Oakland County just north of Detroit, home to the state's largest Republican base. Democrats have won decisively here in recent elections, and winning back voters in a county once dominated by traditional country club Republicans could be crucial to Rogers' chances to achieve what no Republican has done in more than three decades: win a U.S. Senate race in Michigan.

""We created a large, probably the best ground game, I would argue, in the country right now,"" Rogers said in a recent interview. ""And we are firing on all cylinders.""

With control of the Senate on the line, the race for Michigan's open seat could be pivotal. Democrats currently maintain a narrow margin in the Senate but are defending far more seats in this year's elections than Republicans.

Rogers and his Democratic opponent, Rep. Elissa Slotkin, are set to meet Tuesday for their first debate. Neither participated in debates during party primaries, making this event the first opportunity for voters to compare their dramatically different policy views.

Republicans have become increasingly confident that Rogers, who served in the U.S. House from 2001 to 2015, can flip a seat held for over two decades by Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who is retiring at the end of her fourth term. Standing in their way is Slotkin, long viewed as a rising star in the Democratic Party, with a fundraising advantage and an established track record in a competitive House district.

""Where I see Michigan as well as our races around the country is exactly as I would have predicted them last year,"" said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ""These are going to come down to very close races.""

Slotkin entered the Senate race shortly after Stabenow's retirement announcement, effectively clearing the Democratic primary field and building a campaign war chest that dwarfed her potential Republican opponents. She had raised $42 million through the end of September, according to her campaign.

With a big boost from national GOP fundraising groups, Rogers and the Republicans have been hustling to catch up. He entered the race over six months later and faced the challenge of navigating a state GOP divided by internal strife between grassroots activists fired up by Trump's brand of conservative populism and the party's old guard.

Rogers also had to contend with a crowded Republican primary field that included two other former congressmen. Trump's endorsement in March had a coalescing effect and made Rogers the clear frontrunner, prompting many of his rivals to drop out and allowing him to coast to the GOP nomination in August.

Whether Rogers can hold the fractious GOP coalition together could go a long way toward deciding the race.

By mid-July, Rogers had raised just over $5 million, the most recent figure reported by his campaign. While he has seen a recent influx of outside funding, including $22.5 million from Sen. Mitch McConnell's Senate Leadership Fund announced last week, it hasn't given him the same opportunity to define his candidacy as Slotkin. She was already airing ads in May to highlight her background.

Ultimately, the outcome of the Senate race could turn on how the presidential candidates perform in Michigan. Some Democrats, including Slotkin, have expressed concerns about Vice President Kamala Harris' standing in Michigan with less than a month to go in a state considered crucial to the presidential race.

Republicans think they see an opening in both contests.

""Michigan will be a state where our outcome in the Michigan Senate race will be probably very closely tied to President Trump's outcome in Michigan,"" Montana Sen. Steve Daines, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said during a press roundtable in Las Vegas. ""Trump's number and Mike Rogers' number will be very close.""

Rogers' team is working hard to close the gap. His campaign has 36 paid staffers statewide, leading volunteer groups that Rogers' campaign says have knocked on 50,000 doors a week.

Slotkin's campaign says her field operation is integrated into One Campaign, a coordinated effort involving Democratic candidates at all levels. That initiative includes 52 field offices and nearly 400 staff members across Michigan.

Oakland, the state's second-largest county, was once a Republican stronghold, but President Joe Biden won it by over 14 percentage points, largely due to a shift among suburban women in a state where reproductive rights have been on voters' minds since the U.S. Supreme Court turned those matters back to the states in 2022. Rogers' team is now focused on winning those voters back.

On a crisp October morning, his canvassers knocked on doors in the Oakland County suburb of Rochester, where lawn signs and other indicators of the fierce political battle unfolding there were rare. Although Rogers' campaign materials highlight Trump's endorsement, canvassers in neighborhoods like this typically mention the former president's name only if voters bring it up first.

""Mike just seems like a genuinely good guy and someone I'd want to represent Oakland,"" said Donnell Green, a longtime Rochester resident. After speaking with canvassers on Oct. 4, she added, ""I like that he works across the aisle.""

Green declined to share her views on Trump. However, in a region where noted anti-Trump Republican Sen. Mitt Romney grew up, Trump remains a polarizing figure, and many Republicans in the county continue to be turned off by his combative brand of politics.

Slotkin believes reproductive rights are still on voters' minds in Oakland County, where in 2022, a ballot proposal enshrining abortion rights passed by a 28-point margin, helping secure its statewide approval. She continues to campaign on the issue, warning that Republicans could push for a nationwide ban.

Rogers, however, calls it a nonissue after the 2022 vote and has said that he would not support a federal ban.

Slotkin currently represents a mid-Michigan district that was expected to be one of the most competitive and expensive races of the 2022 cycle. She won reelection by over five percentage points, using a strategy she has replicated in her Senate campaign. This approach, she says, involves ""going to places where maybe Democrats haven't shown up in 40 years.""

""I'm a Democrat that represents a Republican-leaning district,"" Slotkin told reporters last month in Grand Rapids. ""I wouldn't have won if I hadn't engaged all kinds of different voters.""

Slotkin could be most vulnerable in metro Detroit, where divisions within the Democratic Party over the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war are intensifying. The region has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the country, and frustration with Biden is spilling over to other Democratic candidates, including Slotkin, who is Jewish. She has remained a supporter of Israel, although she has been critical of the country's leader, Benjamin Netanyahu.

The growing discontent in metro Detroit could impact Slotkin's campaign.

""It is something that we have been spending a lot of time on and I think it's important for folks to know that our Democratic candidates, incumbents care deeply about listening to the Arab American community,"" said Peters.

Supreme Court won't hear appeal from Elon Musk's X platform over warrant in Trump case,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-donald-trump-twitter-elon-musk-635ceb3a21d0449d0fd681a11a3fc339,2024-10-07T15:13:46Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said Monday it won't hear an appeal from the social media platform X over a search warrant prosecutors obtained in the election-interference case against former President Donald Trump.

The company, known as Twitter before it was purchased by billionaire Elon Musk, says a nondisclosure order that blocked it from telling Trump about the warrant obtained by special counsel Jack Smith's team violated its First Amendment rights.

The company also argues Trump should have had a chance to exert executive privilege. If not reined in, the government could use similar tactics to invade other privileged communications, their lawyers argued.

Two nonpartisan electronic privacy groups also weighed in, encouraging the high court to take the case on First Amendment grounds.

Prosecutors, though, say the company never showed Trump had used the account for official purposes so executive privilege wouldn't be an issue. A lower court also found that telling Trump could have jeopardized the ongoing investigation.

Trump used his Twitter account in the weeks leading up to his supporters' attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to spread false statements about the election that prosecutors allege were designed to sow mistrust in the democratic process.

The indictment details how Trump used his Twitter account to encourage his followers to come to Washington on Jan. 6, pressured his Vice President Mike Pence to reject the certification and falsely suggested that the mob at the Capitol -- which beat police officers and smashed windows -- was peaceful.

That case is now inching forward after the Supreme Court's ruling in July giving Trump broad immunity from criminal prosecution as a former president.

The warrant arrived at Twitter amid rapid changes instituted by Musk, who purchased the platform in 2022 and has since laid off much of its staff, including workers dedicated to ferreting out misinformation and hate speech.

He also welcomed back a long list of users who had been previously banned, including Trump, and endorsed him in the 2024 presidential race."
Milton alcanza categoría 3 mientras Florida prepara evacuaciones masivas,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/general-news-bef6693474052c4b10ea3abf5a472e50,2024-10-07T14:18:15Z,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) -- El huracán Milton alcanzó la categoría 3 el lunes por la mañana mientras Florida se preparaba para la que podría ser su evacuación más grande en siete años ante una tormenta que podría afectar a importantes núcleos de población como Tampa y Orlando.

El huracán Milton ganaba fuerza, con vientos máximos sostenidos de 205 kilómetros por hora (125 millas por hora) en el sur del Golfo de México, y se emitieron avisos de marejada ciclónica y huracán para zonas de Florida, así como alertas en la costa mexicana, señaló el Centro Nacional de Huracanes de Estados Unidos.

La tormenta tenía su centro unos 285 kilómetros (180 millas) al oeste-noroeste de Progreso, México, y 1.210 km (750 millas) a oeste-suroeste de Tampa, señaló el centro de huracanes, y se desplazaba al este-sureste a 13 km/h (8 mph).

Aunque los modelos meteorológicos varían, la trayectoria más probable indica que Milton podría tocar tierra el miércoles en la zona de Tampa Bay y permanecería como huracán a medida que avanza a través de la parte central de Florida hacia el océano Atlántico, indican los meteorólogos. Esta ruta no pasaría por los estados del sureste del país que quedaron devastados por el paso de Helene, el cual causó daños catastróficos desde Florida hasta los montes Apalaches y dejó más de 230 muertos.

El gobierno mexicano emitió una alerta de huracán para la península de Yucatán, de Celestún a Río Lagartos, señaló el centro.

En 2017, las autoridades instaron a unos 7 millones de personas a evacuar en Florida ante la llegada del huracán Irma. El éxodo atascó autopistas, provocó esperas de horas en las gasolineras que aún tenían combustible y dejó a los desplazados frustrados y, en algunos casos, decididos a no volver a evacuar nunca.

A partir de las lecciones aprendidas con Irma y otras tormentas, Florida ha preparado suministros de combustible y estaciones de carga para vehículos eléctricos a lo largo de las rutas de evacuación, dijo Kevin Guthrie, director ejecutivo de la División de Gestión de Emergencias de Florida.

""Hemos mirado toda localidad posible que pudiese alojar a personas, en lo que describimos como manejo de emergencia, como refugio de último recurso"", añadió Guthrie.

Milton se intensificó con rapidez y probablemente mantendría la categoría 3 o más antes de embestir a mediados de semana con la costa del Golfo, ya maltrecha por otras tormentas.

El gobernador de Florida, Ron DeSantis, señaló el domingo que si bien no hay certeza sobre dónde tocará tierra el sistema, está claro que el estado recibirá un fuerte impacto de Milton.

""No creo que a estas alturas haya un escenario en el que no recibimos un golpe significativo"", dijo.

""Hay tiempo para prepararse, todo el día de hoy, todo el lunes, probablemente todo el martes, para asegurarse de contar con todo lo necesario"", dijo DeSantis. ""Si usted está en la costa oeste de Florida, en las islas barrera, asuma que se le pedirá evacuar"".

Una vez Milton alcanzó la categoría de huracán, esta es la primera vez que el Atlántico tiene tres huracanes simultáneos después de septiembre, según el experto en huracanes de la Universidad Estatal de Colorado Phil Klotzbach. Se han documentado casos de cuatro huracanes simultáneos en agosto y septiembre.

El área de St. Petersburg-Tampa Bay todavía está despejando escombros y reparando los daños causados por la tormenta Helene. Doce personas perecieron luego que las marejadas ciclónicas arrasaron con la costa, y el peor daño se registró en una estrecha franja de 32 kilómetros (20 millas) de islas de barrera que va de St. Petersburg a Clearwater.

DeSantis expandió el domingo su declaración de estado de emergencia a 51 de los 67 condados del estado y dijo que la población debía prepararse para más cortes de luz y complicaciones, asegurarse de que tiene comida y agua para una semana y estar lista para marcharse.

""Nos preparamos (...) para la evacuación más grande que hemos visto, probablemente desde 2017, el huracán Irma"", dijo Guthrie.

Las personas que viven en casas construidas después de que Florida endureciera la normativa en 2004, que no depende den electricidad constante y que no estén en zonas de evacuación probablemente deberían evitar las carreteras, señaló Guthrie.

Todas las actividades escolares han sido suspendidas de manera preventiva en el condado Pinellas de St. Petersburg de lunes a miércoles, y la ciudad de Tampa abrió al público los estacionamientos municipales para que la gente pudiera mover sus autos a alturas seguras, incluidos los vehículos eléctricos. Los vehículos debían quedar en la tercera planta o más arriba en cada recinto.

Hasta 4.000 efectivos de la Guardia Nacional ayudan a las cuadrillas del estado a retirar toneladas de escombros que dejó Helene, indicó DeSantis, quien instruyó que los equipos estatales que fueron enviados a Carolina del Norte tras el paso de Helene regresen a Florida para prepararse para la llegada de Milton.

""Todos los recursos disponibles del estado (...) están siendo usados para ayudar a despejar escombros"", indicó el gobernador. ""Trabajaremos las 24 horas, los siete días"".

Por su parte, la administradora de la Agencia de Manejo de Emergencias (FEMA), Deanne Criswell, defendió las acciones de su agencia después de que republicanos repitieron las afirmaciones falsas del expresidente Donald Trump, que crearon una ola de desinformación en las comunidades devastadas.

""Esta clase de mensajes no ayuda a la gente y es lamentable que haya gente que esté poniendo la política por encima de la ayuda a la comunidad"", dijo Criswell a George Stephanopoulos, de la emisora ABC. Las falsedades han creado temor y desconfianza entre los habitantes hacia los miles empleados y voluntarios de FEMA en todo el sudeste del país, señaló.

A pesar de ello, dijo Criswell, la agencia ya se está preparando para Milton, aunque no está claro qué ruta tomará la tormenta en la península de Florida esta semana.

""Estamos trabajando con el estado allí para saber cuáles son sus necesidades, para que podamos satisfacerlas antes de que llegue la tormenta"", indicó Criswell.

La asistencia federal por el desastre ha sobrepasado los 137 millones de dólares desde que Helene llegó hace más de una semana, una de las mayores movilizaciones de personal y recursos en la historia reciente, dijo FEMA el domingo.

Se han desplegado unos 1.500 soldados en activo, más de 6.100 elementos de la Guardia Nacional y casi 7.000 empleados de todas las agencias federales, y la agencia ha enviado más de 14,9 millones de comidas, más de 13,9 millones de litros de agua, 157 generadores y más de 505.000 lonas, y ha aprobado más de 30 millones de dólares en alojamientos y otros tipos de asistencia para más de 27.000 familias, según la FEMA, la Casa Blanca y el Departamento de Defensa.

Más de 800 personas incapaces de regresar a sus viviendas se están alojando gracias a un programa de asistencia de la FEMA, y 22 albergues siguen alojando a casi 1.000 personas mientras se sigue repartiendo comida a los sobrevivientes. La respuesta a Helene continuará durante Milton y sus secuelas, dijo FEMA, asegurando que tiene la capacidad de gestionar varios desastres a la vez.

""Mi gobierno no está escatimando recursos para apoyar a las familias a medida que empiezan sus labores de reconstrucción"", dijo el presidente, Joe Biden. ""Continuaremos trabajando mano a manos con los líderes locales y estatales, sin importar su filiación política y sin importar cuánto tiempo tome""."
Trump and Harris mark somber anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-oct-7-hamas-israel-78ba85f87ea89fa93c6537f77ca81b25,2024-10-07T14:07:35Z,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are marking the first anniversary of the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust as the presidential candidates approach the final weeks of the campaign during a widening conflict in the Middle East.

Trump will speak before Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in the Miami suburb of Doral. Harris will briefly speak to journalists and plant a pomegranate tree with her husband on the grounds of the Vice President's residence in honor of the 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, who were killed by Hamas-led militants in the Oct. 7 attack last year.

Harris' husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, will recite a prayer at an event to commemorate the anniversary with the American Jewish Committee.

Trump has blamed both Harris and President Joe Biden for the war, arguing their administration empowered Iran, and tried to take advantage of some of the divisions within the Democratic Party with progressives protesting Israel's military campaign, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians.

Some of his statements on Israel overlook his association with people who spew antisemitic rhetoric such as far-right activist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.

Trump has also repeatedly said that Jewish voters who vote for Democrats ""should have their head examined"" and recently said that if he loses the presidential election to Harris on Nov. 5 ""the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that.""

In an excerpt released from an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that will air Monday night, Harris appeared to avoid answering a question about whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered ""a real close ally,"" and said that ""The better question is: Do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.""

Trump's own relations with Netanyahu have been rocky. They soured after the Israeli prime minister became one of the first world leaders to congratulate President Joe Biden for his 2020 victory, which Trump continues to deny. A few days after the Oct. 7 attack last year, Trump publicly criticized Netanyahu and said he ""was not prepared"" for the deadly incursion from Gaza on Oct. 7. Trump said Netanyahu had let the U.S. down just before the U.S. killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in 2020.

Since then, the two have met to talk about a cease-fire deal for Gaza.

Halie Soifer, head of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said the conflict in the Middle East -- including fighting with Hezbollah and Iran -- has left Jewish voters ""with a sense of vulnerability and concern for Israel's future."" Soifer previously advised Harris on national security issues.

But she says Harris has been consistent with the message of commitment to Israel's defense for the last year, and said Harris and Biden have directed U.S. forces to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel on multiple occasions."
Supreme Court rejects Republican-led challenge to ease voter registration,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-biden-voter-registration-order-republican-444ede6ac289f2656b5b47963466ca8b,2024-10-07T13:58:53Z,"The Supreme Court on Monday turned away a challenge from Republican state lawmakers in Pennsylvania to a Biden administration executive order that is intended to boost voter registration.

The justices did not comment in rejecting an appeal from the Republicans, who claimed the order is an unconstitutional attempt to interfere in the November election. Lower courts had dismissed the lawsuit.

Nine Republican secretaries of state and 11 members of Congress had asked the court to step in. In May, the justices declined to take up and decide the case on an expedited basis.

The justices separately rejected two appeals stemming from baseless claims made by Republicans that voting machines and software of Dominion Voting Systems were responsible for Donald Trump 's defeat in the 2020 presidential election.

In one case, the court turned away an appeal from Fulton County, Pennsylvania, that questioned a Pennsylvania high court ruling involving voting machines. The other rejected appeal involved claims from people around the country that Denver-based Dominion tried to silence them."
The Latest: New analysis says both Trump and Harris' plans would increase the deficit,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-vance-walz-election-81a24ac1389f5d7a83d064f9e6d358d2,2024-10-07T13:06:56Z,"No one is likely to be happy with the projected higher deficits laid out in a new analysis of Kamala Harris' and Donald Trump's economic plans.

The analysis released Monday by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests a Harris presidency could increase the national debt over 10 years by $3.5 trillion. The same analysis says former President Trump's ideas could heap another $7.5 trillion onto the debt and possibly as much as $15.2 trillion.

Soon, the ballots will be cast, the polls will close and a campaign marked by assassination attempts, animosity and anxiety will come to an end. But for U.S. adversaries, the work to meddle with American democracy may be entering its most critical phase.

Despite all the attention on efforts to spread disinformation in the months before the Nov. 5 election, the hours and days immediately after voting ends could offer foreign adversaries like Russia, Iran and China or domestic extremist groups the best chance to mess with America's decision.

That's when Americans will go online to see the latest results or share their opinions as the votes are tabulated. And that's when a fuzzy photo or AI-generated video of supposed vote tampering could do its most damage, potentially transforming online outrage into real-world action before authorities have time to investigate the facts.

It's a threat taken seriously by intelligence analysts, elected officials and tech executives, who say that while there's already been a steady buildup of disinformation and influence operations, the worst may be yet to come.

Turning Point's representatives have made two things clear in meetings with state and local Republican leaders -- Donald Trump has blessed their conservative organization to help lead his get-out-the-vote effort, and local party officials ought to use the group's new voter mobilization app.

Both prospects terrify fellow Republicans.

Soaring to prominence after Trump's unexpected 2016 win, Turning Point earned a reputation for hosting glitzy events, cultivating hard-right influencers and raising prodigious sums of money while enriching the group's leaders. They've had far less success helping Republicans win, especially in their adopted home state of Arizona.

Now the organization has leveraged its ties to Trump to expand its influence in a way that could be potentially lucrative. Turning Point has sought to lead an effort to remake the GOP's get-out-the-vote effort based on the theory that there are thousands of Trump supporters who rarely vote but could be persuaded to in this year's election. And they are pitching their new mobile app as vital to this effort's success."

"Supreme Court taking the bench with ghost guns, a capital case and transgender rights on the docket",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-death-sentence-ghost-guns-transgender-rights-926e78c1100f3201fbd99b3d1ef2b747,2024-10-07T04:31:48Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court is taking the bench again on Monday, ready to hear cases on ghost guns, a death sentence and transgender rights.

The docket doesn't have quite as many blockbuster cases on its docket as it did last term, when its rulings included an opinion granting broad immunity to former president Donald Trump.

Still, it's possible that the conservative-majority court could yet be asked to intervene in election disputes after the ballots are cast in November.

The justices also stayed relatively busy during their summer break. The orders they issued on emergency appeals included a refusal to restore President Joe Biden's student loan plan and a partial approval of an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship to vote.

The new term also opens against the backdrop of low public trust in the Supreme Court, and continued debate about whether their newly adopted code of ethics should have an enforcement mechanism.

Here's a look at some of the cases coming up:

The justices will hear a case Tuesday on regulations for ghost guns, privately made weapons that are hard for police to track because they don't have a serial number.

The number of the firearms found at crime scenes has soared in recent years, from fewer than 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 recovered by law enforcement in 2021, according to Justice Department data.

The numbers have been declining in multiple cities since the Biden administration began requiring background checks and age verification for ghost gun kits that can be bought online.

But manufacturers and gun rights groups argue that the administration overstepped and the rule should be overturned.

In the decades since Richard Glossip was sentenced to die over a 1997 murder-for-hire scheme, the case has become a rare one where prosecutors are conceding mistakes.

Oklahoma's Republican attorney general has joined with Glossip in seeking to overturn his murder conviction and death sentence.

Despite those doubts, an Oklahoma appeals court has upheld Glossip's conviction, and the state's pardon and parole board deadlocked in a vote to grant him clemency.

The court will hear arguments in his case on Wednesday.

Perhaps the court's most closely watched case so far this year is a fight over transgender rights.

The case over state bans on gender-affirming care comes as Republican-led states enact a variety of restrictions, including school sports participation, bathroom usage and drag shows.

The administration and Democratic-led states have extended protections for transgender people, though Supreme Court has separately prohibited the administration from enforcing a new federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students.

The justices will weigh a Tennessee law that restrict puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors. The case does not yet have a hearing date, but will likely be argued in December."
Florida prepares for massive evacuations as Hurricane Milton takes aim at major metro areas,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-milton-helene-florida-557c5c512135e0a8661b298e45e17c92,2024-10-07T04:21:38Z,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) -- Florida is gearing up for what could be its biggest evacuation in seven years as Hurricane Milton strengthens over warm waters and heads toward major population centers including Tampa and Orlando.

About 7 million people were urged to evacuate Florida in 2017 as Hurricane Irma bore down on the state. The exodus jammed freeways, led to hourslong lines at gas stations that still had fuel and left evacuees frustrated and, in some cases, vowing never to evacuate again.

Hurricane Milton was centered late Sunday night about 230 miles (370 kilometers) west-northwest of Progreso, Mexico, and 765 miles (1,235 kilometers) west-southwest of Tampa with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 kmh), the National Hurricane Center reported.

While forecast models vary widely, the most likely path suggests Milton could make landfall Wednesday in the Tampa Bay area and remain a hurricane as it moves across central Florida into the Atlantic Ocean. That would largely spare other southeastern states ravaged by Hurricane Helene, which caused catastrophic damage from Florida into the Appalachian Mountains and a death toll that rose Sunday to at least 230 people.

Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the Florida Peninsula, the Florida Keys and the northwestern Bahamas should monitor the system's progress, the hurricane center said. Heavy rainfall was expected Sunday ahead of the hurricane and likely will then combine with Milton's rainfall to flood waterways and streets in Florida, where forecasters said up to a foot (30 centimeters) of rain could fall in places through Wednesday night.

Building on lessons learned during Irma and other previous storms, Florida is staging emergency fuel for gas vehicles and charging stations for electric vehicles along evacuation routes, Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said at a Sunday briefing.

""We are looking at every potential, possible location that can potentially house someone, as what we refer to in emergency management, as a refuge of last resort,"" Guthrie added.

Hurricane Milton is intensifying rapidly and will likely be a major hurricane before slamming into the storm-ravaged Gulf Coast midweek.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday that while it remains to be seen where Milton will strike, it's clear the state is going to be hit hard.

""I don't think there's any scenario where we don't have major impacts at this point,"" he said.

""You have time to prepare -- all day today, all day Monday, probably all day Tuesday to be sure your hurricane preparedness plan is in place,"" DeSantis said. ""If you're on that west coast of Florida, barrier islands, just assume you'll be asked to leave.""

With Milton achieving hurricane status, this is the first time the Atlantic has had three simultaneous hurricanes after September, according to Colorado State University hurricane scientist Phil Klotzbach. There have been four simultaneous hurricanes in August and September.

The St. Petersburg-Tampa Bay area is still cleaning up extensive damage from Helene and its powerful storm surge. Twelve people perished as Helene swamped the coast, with the worst damage along the narrow, 20-mile (32-kilometer) string of barrier islands that stretch from St. Petersburg to Clearwater.

DeSantis expanded his state of emergency declaration Sunday to 51 counties and said Floridians should prepare for more power outages and disruption, making sure they have a week's worth of food and water and are ready to hit the road.

""We are preparing ... for the largest evacuation that we have seen, most likely since 2017, Hurricane Irma,"" Guthrie said.

People who live in homes built after Florida strengthened codes in 2004, who don't depend on constant electricity and who aren't in evacuation zones should probably avoid the roads, Guthrie said.

All classes and school activities in St. Petersburg's Pinellas County preemptively closed Monday through Wednesday as Milton approached. Officials in Tampa opened all city garages free of charge to residents hoping to protect their cars from floodwaters, including electric vehicles. The vehicles must be left on the third floor or higher in each garage.

As many as 4,000 National Guard troops are helping state crews to remove debris, DeSantis said, and he directed Florida crews dispatched to North Carolina in Helene's aftermath to return in preparation for Milton.

""All available state assets ... are being marshaled to help remove debris,"" DeSantis said. ""We're going 24-7 ... it's all hands on deck.""

FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell defended her agency's response to Hurricane's destruction after Republicans' false claims, amplified by former President Donald Trump, created a frenzy of misinformation across devastated communities.

""This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people and it's really a shame we're putting politics ahead of helping people,"" Criswell told ABC's George Stephanopoulos. It has created fear and mistrust among residents against the thousands of FEMA employees and volunteers on the ground across the southeast, she said.

Despite this, Criswell said the agency is already preparing for Milton, well before it's clear exactly where the storm will move across the Florida peninsula this week.

""We're working with the state there to understand what their requirements are going to be, so we can have those in place before it makes landfall,"" she said.

Federal disaster assistance has surpassed $137 million since Helene struck more than a week ago, one of the largest mobilizations of personnel and resources in recent history, FEMA said Sunday.

Some 1,500 active-duty troops, more than 6,100 National Guardsmen and nearly 7,000 federal workers have been deployed, shipping more than 14.9 million meals, 13.9 million liters (3.6 million gallons) of water, 157 generators and 505,000 tarps, along with approving more than $30 million in housing and other types of assistance for over 27,000 households, according to FEMA, the White House and the Department of Defense.

More than 800 people unable to return home are staying in lodging provided through FEMA and 22 shelters are still housing nearly 1,000 people as mobile feeding operations continue to help survivors. The response to Helene won't let up during Milton and its aftermath, because FEMA has the capacity to address multiple disasters simultaneously, the agency said.

""My Administration is sparing no resource to support families as they begin their road to rebuilding,"" Biden said. ""We will continue working hand-in-hand with local and state leaders -- regardless of political party and no matter how long it takes."""
"Tips, overtime, Social Security: A look at Donald Trump's no-tax pledges and what they might cost",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-taxes-social-security-overtime-tariffs-989016ef41dc1533b05d1871d69c03ff,2024-10-07T04:21:13Z,"Donald Trump has pledged to end taxes on everything from tips to Social Security and overtime pay if he's elected to the White House again. But he hasn't detailed how he would fund those ideas and avoid creating a huge budget shortfall, beyond arguing he will usher in an economic boom.

He argues his ideas would improve Americans' personal financial standing and the overall U.S. economy. A debate about the tax code will be a dominant legislative issue next year given that tax cuts Trump signed in 2017 will be set to expire. If he's elected again, Trump could push Congress to enact some or all of his proposals, though that might be difficult if Democrats end up in control of either the House or the Senate.

Estimates from outside economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts ranged between nearly $6 trillion and $10 trillion over 10 years, depending on which ideas become policy and how they're implemented.

A look at Trump's various tax-related ideas:

In June, Trump announced his plan to exclude workers' tips from federal taxes, saying he got the idea from a waitress at his Las Vegas hotel.

""To those hotel workers and people who get tips, you are going to be very happy, because when I get to office we are going to not charge taxes on tips, people making tips,"" Trump said, adding: ""We're going to do that right away, first thing in office.""

Trump made the announcement in Nevada, a key battleground state with six electoral votes and home to the highest concentration of tipped workers in the country. Nevada has an average of 25.8 waiters and waitresses per 1,000 jobs. President Joe Biden won the state in 2020, but the Trump campaign hopes to put it in play this fall.

Trump has not specified whether he wants to exempt tips from just income taxes or from the payroll tax -- which funds Medicare and Social Security -- as well.

Vice President Kamala Harris has echoed Trump's call for no taxes on tips, making a pledge that would apply to hospitality and service industry workers at a Nevada rally of her own two months after her GOP opponent's announcement.

Trump has also pledged tax cuts for older Americans, posting on Truth Social in July that ""SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!""

The challenge is that taxes on Social Security benefits help to pay for the program. The loss of revenue could mean that Social Security would be unable to pay out its full benefits in 2033, two years ahead of the current estimate, according to Brendan Duke of the liberal Center for American Progress.

According to the Social Security Administration, recipients must currently pay federal income taxes if combined income -- 50% of the benefit amount plus any other earned income -- is higher than $25,000 annually if filing individually, or $32,000 if filing jointly.

While in the Senate, Harris co-sponsored a bill that would have required the wealthy to pay higher Social Security taxes and made benefits more generous for some. The White House has said her views on the program are similar to Biden's, but Harris hasn't talked in detail about Social Security during her campaign.

Trump has also said he would support legislation to eliminate taxes on overtime pay.

""That gives people more of an incentive to work,"" Trump said in September at a campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona. ""It gives the companies a lot, it's a lot easier to get the people.""

Harris has not said if she would also call for cuts to taxes of overtime pay.

Trump's plans include proposed breaks for businesses, too. He's called for lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%, but only for companies that produce in the U.S.

""We're putting America first,"" Trump said. ""This new American industrialism will create millions and millions of jobs.""

As president, Trump signed legislation in 2017 that cut the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.

Harris has said she believes that big corporations and the ultra-wealthy should pay more in taxes -- including a 28% rate for corporations -- and wants to use those revenues to help spur the construction of 3 million homes and offer tax breaks for parents.

Ahead of a September rally on Long Island, Trump pledged that he would ""get SALT back,"" suggesting he would eliminate a cap on state and local tax deductions that were part of tax cut legislation he signed into law in 2017.

The so-called SALT cap has led to bigger tax bills for many residents of New York, New Jersey, California and other high-cost, high-tax states, and is an important campaign issue in those states, particularly among those New York Republicans serving in districts Biden won.

Some Democrats have pushed to lift the $10,000 cap, a move many Republicans have said they oppose. Some, including Trump's former GOP primary foe Nikki Haley, have called for making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. Some of that notion is enshrined in Republicans' 2024 platform, although the permanence provision specifically calls out portions ""that doubled the standard deduction, expanded the Child Tax Credit, and spurred Economic Growth for all Americans.""

Harris has not said that she would try to preserve Trump-era tax cuts, which are set to run out at the end of next year. But, like Biden, she has vowed not to raise taxes for Americans who earn less than $400,000 annually.

Angling to bring back more overseas jobs and manufacturing to the U.S., Trump has said repeatedly that he wants higher tariffs on imported goods, and has said the idea wouldn't increase inflation. He has floated the idea of a universal tariff as high as 20% on all imports and even higher tariffs on Chinese products and on U.S. companies that move factory jobs overseas.

In a recent speech at the Economic Club of New York, Trump suggested that tariffs could be used to solve seemingly unrelated challenges such as the rising cost of child care in the U.S., as part of a broader promise that tariffs can raise trillions of dollars to fund his agenda without those costs being passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. That's a view with which many economists disagree since tariffs directly raise the prices of purchasing goods.

Particularly as it relates to the U.S. auto industry, it's a notion he called for again recently in Savannah, Georgia, where Trump said he'd put a 100% tariff on every car imported from Mexico. Calling for a ""new American industrialism,"" Trump suggested that the only way to avoid those charges would be for an automaker to build the cars in the U.S.

Harris has described Trump's ideas for tariffs as a ""sales tax"" on American households that could cost a typical family roughly $4,000 annually.

Turning Point wants to revolutionize how Republicans turn out voters. Some are skeptical,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-turning-point-voter-mobilization-musk-07286c2572b02aafefdda1cda093e788,2024-10-07T04:13:44Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Turning Point's representatives have made two things clear in meetings with state and local Republican leaders -- Donald Trump has blessed their conservative organization to help lead his get-out-the-vote effort, and local party officials ought to use the group's new voter mobilization app.

Both prospects terrify fellow Republicans.

Soaring to prominence after Trump's unexpected 2016 win, Turning Point earned a reputation for hosting glitzy events, cultivating hard-right influencers and raising prodigious sums of money while enriching the group's leaders. They've had far less success helping Republicans win, especially in their adopted home state of Arizona.

Now the organization has leveraged its ties to Trump to expand its influence in a way that could be potentially lucrative. Turning Point has sought to lead an effort to remake the GOP's get-out-the-vote effort based on the theory that there are thousands of Trump supporters who rarely vote but could be persuaded to in this year's election. And they are pitching their new mobile app as vital to this effort's success.

The Associated Press obtained an unvarnished look at how Turning Point is promoting its strategy by obtaining several recordings of presentations made by its representatives to state and local Republican officials. In those presentations, Turning Point operatives honed in on churchgoers and hunters, citing statistics that purport to show how few of each group cast ballots in 2020. Their argument, which is questioned by critics, is if groups like Turning Point target such groups, Republicans will likely sweep the swing states for Trump, the recordings show.

The decision by Trump to rely on untested groups such as Turning Point could have sweeping implications for November's election. Turning Point says it's operating statewide in Arizona and Wisconsin, two must win states for Trump. It's also working in two competitive House districts, one in Michigan and another in Nevada, that could also help tip the balance in the presidential race.

The difference of just a few thousand votes in battleground states could mean victory or defeat for candidates up and down the ballot. It's also a risky move that dismisses independent voters, a small but significant portion of the electorate.

""Their strategy is bad. They know how to talk MAGA, they know how to message the base,"" said Tyler Montague, a Republican strategist from Arizona and a longtime Turning Point critic, referring to the former president's Make America Great Again movement. ""But they literally don't know what to say to a swing voter. They alienate these people.""

A Turning Point spokesman rebuffed such criticism, saying the group is performing an important role for conservative candidates. ""We did this because we knew conservatives need"" a way to identify and turn out voters, said spokesman Andrew Kolvet. He added that the effort reflects lessons Turning Point has learned from defeats Republicans suffered in Arizona in 2022 and elsewhere and how Democrats have embraced similar tactics.

Turning Point was founded in suburban Chicago over a decade ago by Charlie Kirk, then a recent high school graduate, to nurture the next generation of conservatives. But as its leaders age out of the youth movement, the group's brand of far-right politics hasn't been very persuasive to Arizona's general election voters, who rejected conservative candidates for statewide office in 2022, including gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake.

Turning Point's leaders showed a degree of introspection after those losses. Not only had they failed to mobilize GOP voters, but Kirk had also amplified Trump's false claims that voting by mail was rife with fraud, putting Republicans at a strategic disadvantage by discouraging a convenient way to cast a ballot.

They reversed course for the 2024 election and launched a campaign to raise $108 million for a ""ballot chasing"" operation that would expand beyond Arizona to key presidential swing states, where they are canvasing reliably Republican areas and encouraging low-turnout voters to cast a ballot by mail. Kolvet, Turning Point's spokesman, said they have so far raised tens of millions of dollars as part of this effort.

Turning Point's get-out-the-vote work is part of a broader effort to elect Trump that includes 30,000 volunteers recruited by the former president's campaign, as well as work being done by such outside groups as Elon Musk's America PAC, which has paid at least $45 million to voter canvasing firms this year.

Musk's PAC took over as the leader of voter mobilization efforts in Wisconsin, a position that Turning Point had previously held. Turning Point will now play a secondary role in the state, while directing much of their focus to Arizona, a development previously reported by Politico.

The group's strategy isn't complicated: Its operatives believe there is a well of untapped conservative voters who have not backed Trump in recent elections. To get Trump back to the White House, they believe the best path is to activate those voters. The strategy appears to mostly ignore independents -- or less hardened Republicans -- because Turning Point's brand of hard-right politics is less likely to appeal to them.

In the recordings obtained by the AP, Turning Point's representatives fully embraced that strategy and believe it would have helped them win past elections and ensure victory in November.

""If we just have an ounce of ballot chasing, just in Arizona,"" Republicans would have won all their races, Matthew Martinez, a Turning Point official, said at a June event in Detroit, referring to the practice of convincing people to vote early while reaching out to those who haven't cast ballots

Martinez added that Republicans faced the same challenges in Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia. In all three states, Martinez said, ""Republicans are sincerely disengaged.""

Kirk wrote this month that Turning Point had assigned a full-time staffer or volunteer to chase every low-propensity voter on their target list in Arizona.

Experts in voting patterns are doubtful Turning Point's efforts to mobilize infrequent Trump-inclined voters will do much to affect the election. Turnout in the past two presidential elections has already drawn a record number of voters to the polls, the experts noted, meaning the pool of voters they are seeking to turn out is small and particularly unlikely to vote.

""You had the highest turnout in Michigan in those presidential election years than you've ever had before. It's doubtful they're going to get any more,"" said Bernie Porn, a nonpartisan pollster who's worked in the state for more than 30 years.

For over a year, Turning Point has aggressively pitched its new voter mobilization app -- a potentially lucrative venture that, if successful, critics believe could strengthen its grasp on key Republican Party machinery. In meetings with state and local Republican leaders, Turning Point operatives lean heavily into their close affiliation with Trump, who is a regular speaker at Turning Point conferences, according to the recordings obtained by theAP.

""We now are an official arm of the Trump campaign,"" Turning Point operative Luke Malace told the members of the Monroe County Republican Party in Michigan earlier this year while urging the group to become a paying ""client"" of the company that made the Turning Point app.

Martinez, at the June event, told attendees concerned about helping Republicans win that the best way to help was to use the app.

""Sir, just download the app - and everybody in here, too, download the app,"" said Martinez, a Turning Point official.

The app was designed by Superfeed, a company with direct ties to Turning Point's leaders. Tyler Bowyer, Turning Point's chief operating officer, sits on the company's board and was formerly the company's chairman, business filings show. Kirk's mother-in-law also serves on Superfeed's board.

It's unclear how much the company has made from apps it designed for Turning Point and over a dozen other GOP and conservative groups, including state parties in Arizona, Nevada and Delaware. Recent state and federal campaign finance disclosures do not show any payments to Superfeed.

In private, a Turning Point representative did not seek to disguise the connection between the app and their group.

""It's all in-house,"" Malace told the county party in Michigan.

Malace did not respond to a request for comment. Superfeed officials also did not respond to a request for comment.

Kolvet, the Turning Point spokesman, said that Malace mischaracterized the organization's relationship with the app maker. Turning Point does not receive any money earned by Superfeed, and the conservative group isn't ""financially involved"" with the app maker, Kolvet said.

""Our relationship with Superfeed is we are a client and they are a vendor,"" Kolvet said.

Some Republicans told the AP that there are major issues with Turning Point's app, which has minimal protections to secure voters' personal information.

The platform allows anyone who uses it, including an AP reporter, to quickly gain access to detailed personal information, including voters' full names, addresses, ages and cellphone numbers. That's a departure from the security protocols adopted by other such platforms. Such protocols are designed to safeguard personal information and prevent rival parties from stealing data or spying on a campaign's strategy.

But not everyone is critical of the app.

Matt Brown, chair of the Yakima County Republican Party in Washington, said he learned about the app during a talk at a Turning Point conference in December. Brown was wowed and decided to become a Superfeed client, and began using the app a few months ago. He declined to say how much the party pays Superfeed, but praised Turning Point's new focus.

""They are doing the work that no one else wants to do and the party is not doing it,"" Brown said of the group.

The app is seen by Republican strategists as the latest example of Turning Point becoming more focused on using data as a way to strengthen its Republican role in the future. And those strategists are concerned that Turning Point is not playing by established traditions of sharing data within the Republican ecosystem and is unprepared to do the kind of work needed to elect Republicans in swing states.

""We have had good ground games in the past, really good ground games. And they were run by the RNC,"" said Ron Kaufman, a longtime Republican who is so closely associated with the Republican National Committee he has been referred to as ""Mr. RNC"" in the past. ""It doesn't make sense to turn that operation over to an outside organization that doesn't have the institutional knowledge that the committee has.""

Turning Point, for example, is not sharing its voter data with Data Trust, a Republican information clearinghouse that allows GOP campaigns and groups to use data collected by groups throughout the party's ecosystem. Other Republican operatives said Turning Point is not sharing data with key statewide campaigns in the battlegrounds they are prioritizing.

Such data is the ""lifeblood"" of modern electioneering, said Montague, the Arizona Republican who has been critical of Turning Point.

He said the group's foray into providing other groups data is further evidence it is attempting ""to take over the party at the national level.""

Turning Point's spokesman denied the charge, saying the group was not seeking to take over the GOP and blaming their lack of sharing with the Data Trust on not having access when they started this work.

""It's just craziness,"" Kolvet said. ""We don't want the job."""
"New analysis suggests national debt could increase under Harris, but it would surge under Trump",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/budget-deficit-trump-harris-kamala-debt-1ee3ff65e22ccf19d19b792ee22c46da,2024-10-07T04:13:41Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- No one is likely to be happy with the projected higher deficits laid out in a new analysis of Kamala Harris' and Donald Trump's economic plans.

The analysis released Monday by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests a Harris presidency could increase the national debt over 10 years by $3.5 trillion. That's even though the vice president's campaign insists her proposed investments in the middle class and housing would be fully offset by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. Her campaign policy guide states that Harris is ""committed to fiscal responsibility -- making investments that will support our economy, while paying for them and reducing the deficit at the same time.""

The same analysis says former President Trump's ideas could heap another $7.5 trillion onto the debt and possibly as much as $15.2 trillion. That's even though he suggests growth would be so strong under his watch that no one would need to worry about deficits.

The 34-page report released by the fiscal watchdog group puts a spotlight on the issue of government borrowing that will confront the winner of November's election. Total federal debt held by the public now tops $28 billion and is expected to keep climbing as revenues can't keep up with the growing costs of Social Security, Medicare and other programs. The analysis noted that the expense of servicing that debt in dollar terms has ""eclipsed the cost of defending our nation or providing health care to elderly Americans.""

Drawing on the candidates' speeches, campaign documents and social media posts, the analysis warns bluntly: ""Debt would continue to grow faster than the economy under either candidates' plans and in most scenarios would grow faster and higher than under current law.""

Neither candidate has meaningfully stressed budget deficit reduction in their pitch to voters. But multiple analyses show a clear difference of Harris being much more fiscally responsible than Trump.

Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was the top economist in the Obama White House, estimated in an opinion article for The Wall Street Journal that Harris' plans could cut deficits by $1.5 trillion or raise them by $1.5 trillion. Meanwhile, his estimates show that Trump's plans would increase deficits by $5 trillion, though that figure does not include his plans to charge no taxes on overtime pay and scrap the limit on deductions of state and local taxes.

There are other estimates by The Budget Lab at Yale and the Penn Wharton Budget Model that also show Harris would be better at keeping the deficit in check.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis estimates that Harris' policy ideas could add $3.5 trillion to the national debt through 2035. That conclusion depends on its treatment of how much various programs could cost.

It forecasts that Harris would implement $4.6 trillion in tax reductions, including extensions of some of the expiring 2017 tax cuts that Trump signed into law and tax breaks for parents and no taxes on tipped income for hospitality workers. Roughly $4 trillion in higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy would be insufficient to cover the total cost of her agenda and the additional interest on the debt that it could generate.

Still, the analysis notes that its numbers depend on various interpretations of what Harris has said. It's possible that Harris' agenda would add nothing to baseline deficits, but the report also said it might plausibly add as much as $8.1 trillion in debt in what appears to be a worse-case scenario.

By contrast, Trump's ideas would likely add another $7.5 trillion to the debt. His $2.7 trillion in tariff revenues would be unable to cover $9.2 trillion in tax cuts and additional expenditures such as $350 billion to secure the border and deport unauthorized immigrants.

But the analysis includes other possibilities that show far higher deficits under Trump. If his tariffs raised less money and there were higher costs for his mass deportations and tax breaks, the national debt could jump by $15.2 trillion.

On the other hand, if the tariffs raised $4.3 trillion and there were no costs tied to deportations, Trump's plans could only increase the debt by $1.5 trillion over 10 years."
"For US adversaries, Election Day won't mean the end to efforts to influence Americans",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-interference-trump-harris-russia-china-efff7f7fcbc71032b1152d011c953eba,2024-10-07T04:08:35Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Soon, the ballots will be cast, the polls will close and a campaign marked by assassination attempts, animosity and anxiety will come to an end. But for U.S. adversaries, the work to meddle with American democracy may be entering its most critical phase.

Despite all the attention on efforts to spread disinformation in the months before the Nov. 5 election, the hours and days immediately after voting ends could offer foreign adversaries like Russia, Iran and China or domestic extremist groups the best chance to mess with America's decision.

That's when Americans will go online to see the latest results or share their opinions as the votes are tabulated. And that's when a fuzzy photo or AI-generated video of supposed vote tampering could do its most damage, potentially transforming online outrage into real-world action before authorities have time to investigate the facts.

It's a threat taken seriously by intelligence analysts, elected officials and tech executives, who say that while there's already been a steady buildup of disinformation and influence operations, the worst may be yet to come.

""It's not like at the end of election night, particularly assuming how close this election will be, that this will be over,"" said Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee. ""One of my greatest concerns is the level of misinformation, disinformation that may come from our adversaries after the polls close could actually be as significant as anything that happens up to the closing of the polls.""

Analysts are blunter, warning that a particularly effective piece of disinformation could be devastating to public confidence in the election if spread in the hours after the polls close, and if the group behind the campaign knows to target a particularly important swing state or voting bloc.

Possible scenarios include out-of-context footage of election workers repurposed to show supposed fraud, a deepfake video of a presidential candidate admitting to cheating or a robocall directed at non-English speakers warning them not to vote.

When a false or misleading claim circulates weeks before the election, there's time for local election officials, law enforcement or news organizations to gather the facts, correct any falsehoods and get the word out. But if someone spreads a deceptive video or photo designed to make a big chunk of the electorate distrust the results the day after the election, it can be hard or even impossible for the truth to catch up.

It happened four years ago, when a drumbeat of lies about the 2020 results spurred the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Often, those arrested on accusations of trying to interfere with the transfer of power have cited debunked election fraud narratives that circulated shortly after Election Day.

An especially close election decided in a handful of swing states could heighten that risk even further, making it more likely that a rumor about suitcases of illegal ballots in Georgia, to cite an example from 2020, could have a big impact on perceptions.

President Joe Biden's victory over Donald Trump in 2020 wasn't especially close, and no irregularities big enough to affect the result were found -- and yet false claims about vote-rigging were still widely believed by many supporters of the Republican, who's running for president again.

The relatively long run-up to Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 gives those looking to sow doubt about the results ample time to do so, whether they are propaganda agencies in Moscow or extremist groups in the U.S. like the Proud Boys.

Ryan LaSalle, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Nisos, said he won't feel relief until a new president is sworn in without any serious problems.

""The time to stay most focused is right now through the peaceful transfer of power,"" LaSalle said. ""That's when real-life activities could happen, and that's when they would have the greatest chance of having an impact on that peaceful transfer.""

Another risk, according to officials and tech companies, is that Russia or another adversary would try to hack into a local or state election system -- not necessarily to change votes, but as a way of making voters question the security of the system.

""The most perilous time I think will come 48 hours before the election,"" Microsoft President Brad Smith told lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee last month. The hearing focused on American tech companies' efforts to safeguard the election from foreign disinformation and cyberattacks.

Election disinformation first emerged as a potent threat in 2016, when Russia hacked into the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton and created networks of fake social media accounts to pump out disinformation.

The threat has only grown as social media has become a leading source of information and news for many voters. Content designed to divide Americans and make them mistrust their own institutions is no longer tied only to election seasons. Intelligence officials say Russia, China and other countries will only expand their use of online disinformation and propaganda going forward, a long-range strategy that looks beyond any one election or candidate.

Despite the challenges, election security officials are quick to reassure Americans that the U.S. election system is impervious to any attack that could alter the outcome of the vote. While influence operations may seek to spread distrust about the results, improvements to the system make it stronger than ever when it comes to efforts to change votes.

""Malicious actors, even if they tried, could not have an impact at scale such that there would be a material effect on the outcome of the election,"" Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told The Associated Press."

Andy Kim and Curtis Bashaw clash over abortion and immigration in New Jersey Senate debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-senate-debate-kim-bashaw-57659eff4ca62c7e581978f0d91561cb,2024-10-07T02:57:18Z,"NUTLEY, N.J. (AP) -- Democratic Rep. Andy Kim and Republican Curtis Bashaw clashed over abortion and immigration Sunday in their first debate for New Jersey's Senate seat, open this year after Bob Menendez's conviction on bribery charges and resignation.

Kim, a three-term representative from the 3rd District, hammered Bashaw for his support of former President Donald Trump and expressed skepticism about Bashaw's position as an abortion rights supporter. Bashaw, a hotel developer from southern New Jersey and first-time candidate, sought to cast himself as a moderate and Kim as a Washington insider.

The debate was briefly derailed at the start when Bashaw stopped speaking mid-sentence and stared ahead, nonresponsive. He was helped from the stage and left the room for roughly 10 minutes.

""I got so worked up about this affordability issue that I realized I hadn't eaten so much food today,"" Bashaw said when he returned. ""So I appreciate your indulgence.""

Among the most pointed exchanges was over abortion. Both candidates support abortion rights, but Bashaw has said he supported the U.S. Supreme Court's decision that ended Roe v. Wade. New Jersey has enshrined abortion protections in state law.

""I just fundamentally have a problem with using the term 'pro-choice' to describe yourself when you have talked about the important of the Dobbs decision being correctly decided,"" Kim said.

He also hammered Bashaw for his support of Trump, who has twice lost New Jersey's electoral votes.

""The one endorsement that he has made is for Donald Trump to be president of the United States,"" Kim said. ""And I guess we get a sense of his judgment from that.""

Bashaw, who defeated a Trump-endorsed rival in the primary, didn't defend the former president explicitly.

""Elections are binary choices, and we all have to make a decision,"" he said.

He touted his own candidacy based on his credentials as a businessperson and resisted being typecast as a traditional Republican, pointing out that he backs abortion rights and is a married gay man.

""I am pro-choice, congressman. I am for freedom in the home,"" Bashaw said. ""I don't think government should tell me who I can marry. I don't think it should tell a woman what she can do with her reproductive health choices.""

Bashaw hammered on immigration repeatedly throughout, saying it's ""a crisis in New Jersey"" and is costing the state.

In a reflection of how Democratic-leaning New Jersey has been in Senate races, which Republicans haven't won in more than five decades, Bashaw addressed his closing statements to women and moms of New Jersey.

""I am a moderate, common-sense person that will work to be a voice for New Jersey,"" he said.

Kim declared his candidacy a day after Menendez's indictment last year, saying it was time for the state to turn the page on the longtime legislator. It looked as if the Democratic primary in a must-win state for the party would be contentious when first lady Tammy Murphy entered the race, winning support from influential party leaders.

But Kim challenged the state's unique ballot-drawing system widely viewed as favoring the candidates backed by party leaders. A federal judge sided with Kim in his legal challenge, putting the system on hold for this election. Murphy dropped out of the race, saying she wanted to avoid a divisive primary, leaving a clear path to Kim's nomination.

Kim first won office to the House in 2018, defeating Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur. He got national attention after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection when he was photographed picking up trash in the building.

Bashaw won a contested primary in June, defeating a Trump-backed opponent. The hotel developer from Cape May is running for office for the first time.

Menendez was convicted this summer on federal charges of accepting bribes of gold and cash from three New Jersey businesspeople and acting as an agent for the Egyptian government. He has vowed to appeal the conviction.

He resigned in August, capping a career in politics that spanned roughly five decades. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy as interim senator. Helmy said he'll resign after the election is certified so Murphy can appoint whoever wins the election to the seat for the remainder of Menendez's term, which expires in January."
US disaster relief chief blasts false claims about Helene response as a 'truly dangerous narrative',AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-fema-hurricane-helene-conspiracy-theories-criswell-07d5b1f6968cb2af11b63357186a1a15,2024-10-06T19:37:09Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. government's top disaster relief official said Sunday that false claims and conspiracy theories about the federal response to Hurricane Helene -- spread most prominently by Donald Trump -- are ""demoralizing"" aid workers and creating fear in people who need recovery assistance.

""It's frankly ridiculous, and just plain false. This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people,"" said Deanne Criswell, who leads the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""It's really a shame that we're putting politics ahead of helping people, and that's what we're here to do. We have had the complete support of the state,"" she said, referring to North Carolina.

Republicans, led by the former president, have helped foster a frenzy of misinformation over the past week among the communities most devastated by Helene, promoting a number of false claims, including that Washington is intentionally withholding aid to people in Republican areas.

Trump accused FEMA of spending all its money to help immigrants who are in the United States illegally, while other critics assert that the government spends too much on Israel, Ukraine and other foreign countries.

""FEMA absolutely has enough money for Helene response right now,"" Keith Turi, acting director of FEMA's Office of Response and Recovery said. He noted that Congress recently replenished the agency with $20 billion, and about $8 billion of that is set aside for recovery from previous storms and mitigation projects.

There also are outlandish theories that include warnings from far-right extremist groups that officials plan to bulldoze storm-damaged communities and seize the land from residents. A falsehood pushed by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., asserts that Washington used weather control technology to steer Helene toward Republican voters in order to tilt the presidential election toward Democrat Kamala Harris.

Criswell said on ABC's ""This Week"" that such baseless claims around the response to Helene, which caused catastrophic damage from Florida into the Appalachian mountains and a death toll that rose Sunday to at least 230, have created a sense of fear and mistrust from residents against the thousands of FEMA employees and volunteers on the ground.

""We've had the local officials helping to push back on this dangerous -- truly dangerous narrative that is creating this fear of trying to reach out and help us or to register for help,"" she said.

President Joe Biden said in a statement Sunday that his administration ""will continue working hand-in-hand with local and state leaders -- regardless of political party and no matter how long it takes.""

Meantime, FEMA is preparing for Hurricane Milton, which rapidly intensified into a Category 1 storm on Sunday as it heads toward Florida.

""We're working with the state there to understand what their requirements are going to be, so we can have those in place before it makes landfall,"" she said."
Pennsylvania high court declines to decide mail-in ballot issues before election,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-mail-ballots-date-court-d48eae420e88232eac0064f6ee3902bd,2024-10-06T17:08:42Z,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has declined to step in and immediately decide issues related to mail-in ballots in the commonwealth with early voting already under way in the few weeks before the Nov. 5 election.

The commonwealth's highest court on Saturday night rejected a request by voting rights and left-leaning groups to stop counties from throwing out mail-in ballots that lack a handwritten date or have an incorrect date on the return envelope, citing earlier rulings pointing to the risk of confusing voters so close to the election.

""This Court will neither impose nor countenance substantial alterations to existing laws and procedures during the pendency of an ongoing election,"" the unsigned order said.

Chief Justice Debra Todd dissented, saying voters, election officials and courts needed clarity on the issue before Election Day.

""We ought to resolve this important constitutional question now, before ballots may be improperly rejected and voters disenfranchised,"" Todd wrote.

Justice P. Kevin Brobson, however, said in a concurring opinion that the groups waited more than a year after an earlier high court ruling to bring their challenge, and it was ""an all-too-common practice of litigants who postpone seeking judicial relief on election-related matters until the election is underway that creates uncertainty.""

Many voters have not understood the legal requirement to sign and date their mail-in ballots, leaving tens of thousands of ballots without accurate dates since Pennsylvania dramatically expanded mail-in voting in a 2019 law.

The lawsuit's plaintiffs contend that multiple courts have found that a voter-written date is meaningless in determining whether the ballot arrived on time or whether the voter is eligible, so rejecting a ballot on that basis should be considered a violation of the state constitution. The parties won their case on the same claim in a statewide court earlier this year but it was thrown out by the state Supreme Court on a technicality before justices considered the merits.

Democrats, including Gov. Josh Shapiro, have sided with the plaintiffs, who include the Black Political Empowerment Project, POWER Interfaith, Make the Road Pennsylvania, OnePA Activists United, New PA Project Education Fund Pittsburgh United, League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania and Common Cause Pennsylvania.

Republicans say requiring the date is an election safeguard and accuse Democrats of trying to change election rules at the 11th hour.

The high court also rejected a challenge by Republican political organizations to county election officials letting voters remedy disqualifying mail-in ballot mistakes, which the GOP says state law doesn't allow. The ruling noted that the petitioners came to the high court without first litigating the matter in the lower courts.

The court did agree on Saturday, however, to hear another GOP challenge to a lower court ruling requiring officials in one county to notify voters when their mail-in ballots are rejected, and allow them to vote provisionally on Election Day.

The Pennsylvania court, with five justices elected as Democrats and two as Republicans, is playing an increasingly important role in settling disputes in this election, much as it did in 2020's presidential election.

Issues involving mail-in voting are hyper-partisan: Roughly three-fourths of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania tend to be cast by Democrats. Republicans and Democrats alike attribute the partisan gap to former President Donald Trump, who has baselessly claimed mail-in voting is rife with fraud."
Walz says he'll 'own up' when he misspeaks as the Democratic ticket steps up media interviews,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/walz-harris-media-interview-presidential-campaign-83325184cd7f93ca505df590f7a27ede,2024-10-06T16:08:51Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly a week after verbal stumbles in the only vice presidential debate, Democrat Tim Walz used his debut campaign appearance on a Sunday news show to try to fend off criticism of his stand on abortion rights and ""own up"" to past misstatements.

The interview on ""Fox News Sunday"" reflected a broader media blitz by presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate as the Democrats seek to garner public attention in the final 30 days of the campaign against Republicans Donald Trump and JD Vance.

Harris has taped an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that will air Monday night. She is booked Tuesday on Howard Stern's satellite radio show, ABC's ""The View"" and ""The Late Show"" with Stephen Colbert on CBS. Her interview on the podcast ""Call Her Daddy"" is scheduled to be released later Sunday. Walz will be on Jimmy Kimmel's ABC show on Monday.

Walz's Fox appearance also touched on the turmoil in the Middle East, with anchor Shannon Bream pressing the Minnesota governor on whether Israel has a right to preemptively attack Iran's nuclear and oil facilities in response to Tehran's firing of missiles against Israel. It was a question that Walz did not fully answer during his debate this past week with Vance, an Ohio senator.

Walz said Sunday that ""specific operations will be dealt with at the time."" He said Israel has a right to defend itself and that Harris worked with Israel this past week to repel the Iranian attack. President Joe Biden said last week he would not support an Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran's nuclear program.

Walz defended a law that he signed as governor to ensure abortion protections, saying it ""puts this puts the decision with the woman and her health care providers."" He questioned the statement by Trump that he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

On the economy, Walz said Harris' proposals would make life more affordable for the middle class by helping with the construction of 3 million new homes and expanding tax credits for parents. He said tariffs floated by Trump could increase costs by an estimated $4,000 a year on a typical family.

Walz also faced questions in the interview about misstatements pertaining to his military service, drunken driving arrest, infertility treatment for his family and claims to have been in Hong Kong before the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China.

""I will own up when I misspeak,"" Walz said.

He said he believes voters are more concerned by the fact that Vance could not acknowledge during their debate that Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden and that there could restrictions on the infertility treatment of intrauterine insemination that his wife, Gwen, received.

""I think they're probably far more concerned with that than my wife and I used IUI to have our child and that Donald Trump would restrict that,"" Walz said. ""So I think folks know who I am.""

Bream noted that Trump has come out in support of fertility treatments, even as he has said that abortion questions should be decided by states."

Voters in North Carolina and Georgia have bigger problems than politics. Helene changed everything,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-georgia-trump-harris-8d583852967e3f56d062397965b7853f,2024-10-06T12:57:33Z,"VILAS, N.C. (AP) -- Brad Farrington pulls over to grab a case of water bottles being passed out in Vilas, a small rural community tucked away in the Blue Ridge Mountains. He's on his way to help a friend who lost much of what he owned when Hurricane Helene blew through last weekend.

His friend, like countless others across western North Carolina, is starting over, which explains why Farrington isn't thinking too much about politics or the White House race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris right now.

""I don't believe people's hope is in either people that are being elected,"" he said.

Farrington pauses, then gestures toward a dozen volunteers loading water and other necessities into cars and trucks.

""I believe we're finding a lot more hope within folks like this,"" he said.

In the election's final weeks, people in North Carolina and Georgia, influential swing states, are dealing with more immediate concerns: widespread storm damage. If that weren't enough, voters in Watauga County, a ticket-splitting Appalachian county that has become more Democratic in recent years, must contend with politicians laying blame while offering support as they campaign in a race that could be decided by any small shift.

Large uprooted trees litter the sides of roads, sometimes blocking driveways. Some homes in Vilas are inaccessible after bridges collapsed and roads crumbled. More populous areas like Boone, home of Appalachian State University, saw major flooding.

Residents wonder where are missing friends and relatives, is there enough food and water to last until new supplies arrive and how will they rebuild.

The focus is on survival, not politics -- and may remain that way for weeks.

Trump and Harris have visited North Carolina and Georgia five times since the storm hit. Trump was in North Carolina on Friday, and Harris was there the next day.

After Trump went to Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday, 20-year-old Fermin Herrera said the former president clinched his vote with his display of caring, not out of any frustration with how President Joe Biden and Harris, the vice president, are handling the federal disaster response. Herrera already leaned toward voting for Trump.

""I feel like everybody's kind doing what they can,"" he said. ""All the locals are appreciating the help that's coming.""

Trump, who has his own mixed record on natural disaster response, attacked Biden and Harris for what he said was a slow response to Helene's destruction. Trump accused the Democrats of ""going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas"" and said there wasn't enough Federal Emergency Management Agency money because it was spent on illegal immigrants. There is no evidence to support either claim.

""I'm not thinking about voters right now,"" Trump insisted after a meeting with Gov. Brian Kemp, R-Ga., on Friday. ""I'm thinking about lives.""

Biden pushed back hard, saying he is ""committed to being president for all of America"" and has not ordered aid to be distributed based on party lines. The White House cited statements from the Republican governors of Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee expressing satisfaction with the federal government's response.

Criticism so soon after a natural disaster is ""inappropriate,"" especially when factoring in the daunting logistical problems in western North Carolina, said Gavin Smith, a North Carolina State University professor who specializes in disaster recovery. He said the perilous terrain from compromised roads and bridges and the widespread lack of power and cellphone service make disaster response in the region particularly challenging.

Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has made several stops in western North Carolina, including Watauga County and surrounding areas, and Biden viewed the extensive damage via an aerial tour.

In Watauga County, Jessica Dixon was scraping muck and broken furniture off the ground with a shovel, then dumping it in the bucket of a humming excavator. The 29-year-old stood in a home she bought two years ago. It's now gutted after a rush of water forced Dixon, her boyfriend and their two dogs to flee to safety.

Without flood insurance, Dixon is not sure what will happen over the next month. She said she filled out a FEMA application but hasn't checked her email since. She had given the presidential election some thought before Helene, but now she's preoccupied with cleaning her home.

""It wouldn't change my views on anything,"" said Dixon, who was planning to vote for Harris.

The presidential election isn't top of mind for 47-year-old Bobby Cordell, either. He's trying to get help to neighbors in western Watauga County, which has become inaccessible in some parts.

His home near Beech Mountain is one of those places, he said, after a bridge washed away. Cordell rescued his aunt from a mudslide, then traveled to Boone and has been staying in Appalachian State's Holmes Convocation Center, which now serves as a Red Cross emergency shelter.

He's trying to send disaster relief back where he lives by contacting officials, including from FEMA. That conversation, he said, ""went very well.""

Accepting help isn't easy for people in the mountains, he said, because they're used to taking care of themselves.

Now, though, the people who are trapped ""need everything they can get.""

Over the past week of volunteering at Skateworld, where Farrington stopped for water, it's become harder for Nancy Crawford to smile. She's helped serve more than 1,000 people, she said, but the emotional toll has started to settle in for ""a lot of us that normally are tough.""

That burden added to the weight she was already feeling about the election, which she said was ""scary to begin with."" Crawford, a registered Republican, said she plans to vote for Harris. As a Latina of Mexican descent, she thinks Trump's immigration policies would have harmful effects on her community.

The storm, she said, likely won't change her vote but has made one thing evident.

""It doesn't matter what party you are, we all need help,"" she said.

Jan Wellborn had a similar thought as she made her way around the Watauga High School gym collecting supplies to bring to coworkers in need. A 69-year-old bus driver for the school district, she said the outpouring of support she's seen from the community has been a ""godsend.""

She takes solace from the county's ability to pull together. The election matters, she said, but helping people make their way through a harrowing time matters more.

""The election, it should be important,"" Wellborn said. ""But right now we need to focus on getting everybody in the county taken care of.""

"Trump ramps up his campaign in Wisconsin, where a Republican win could knock out Democrats",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-wisconsin-election-2024-harris-blue-wall-b22c2042c9e68115c3de71794dc9c985,2024-10-06T12:57:14Z,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Donald Trump's fourth scheduled stop in eight days in Wisconsin is a sign of his increased attention as Republicans fret about the former president's ability to match the Democrats' enthusiasm and turnout machine.

""In the political chatter class, they're worried,"" said Brandon Scholz, a retired Republican strategist and longtime political observer in Wisconsin who voted for Trump in 2020 but said he is not voting for Trump or Democratic nominee Kamala Harris this year. ""I think Republicans are right to be concerned.""

Trump's latest rally was planned for 2 p.m. Central time Sunday in Juneau in Dodge County, which he won in 2020 with 65% of the vote. Jack Yuds, chairman of the county Republican Party, said support for Trump is stronger in his part of the state than it was in 2016 or 2020. ""I can't keep signs in,"" Yuds said. ""They want everything he's got. If it says Trump on it, you can sell it.""

Wisconsin is perennially tight in presidential elections but has gone for the Republicans just once in the past 40 years, when Trump won the state in 2016. A win in November could make it impossible for Harris to take the White House.

Trump won in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton by fewer than 23,000 votes and lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 by just under 21,000 votes.

On Tuesday, Trump made his first-ever visit to Dane County, home to the liberal capital city of Madison, in an effort to turn out the Republican vote even in the state's Democratic strongholds. Dane is Wisconsin's second most-populous and fastest-growing county; Biden received more than 75% of the vote four years ago.

""To win statewide you've got to have a 72-county strategy,"" former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, said at that event.

Trump's campaign and outside groups supporting his candidacy have outspent Harris and her allies on advertising in Wisconsin, $35 million to $31 million, since she became a candidate on July 23, according to the media-tracking firm AdImpact.

Harris and outside groups supporting her candidacy had more advertising time reserved in Wisconsin from Oct. 1 through Nov. 5, more than $25 million compared with $20 million for Trump and his allies.

The Harris campaign has 50 offices across 43 counties with more than 250 staff in Wisconsin, said her spokesperson Timothy White. The Trump campaign said it has 40 offices in the state and dozens of staff.

Harris rallied supporters in Madison in September at an even that drew more than 10,000 people. On Thursday, she made an appeal to moderate and disgruntled conservatives by holding an event in Ripon, the birthplace of the Republican Party, along with former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of Trump's most prominent Republican antagonists.

Harris and Trump are focusing on Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the ""blue wall"" states that went for Trump in 2016 and flipped to Biden in the next election.

While Trump's campaign is bullish on its chances in Pennsylvania as well as Sunbelt states, Wisconsin is seen as more of a challenge.

""Wisconsin, tough state,"" said Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita, who worked on Republican Sen. Ron Johnson's winning reelection campaign in 2022.

""I mean, look, that's going to be a very tight -- very, very tight, all the way to the end. But where we are organizationally now, comparative to where we were organizationally four years ago, I mean, it's completely different,"" LaCivita said.

He also cited Michigan as more of a challenge. ""But again, these are states that Biden won and carried and so they're going to be brawls all the way until the end and we're not ceding any of that ground.""

The candidates are about even in Wisconsin, based on a series of polls that have shown little movement since Biden dropped out in late July. Those same polls also show high enthusiasm among both parties.

Mark Graul, who ran then-President George W. Bush's 2004 campaign in Wisconsin, said the number of campaign visits speaks to Wisconsin's decisive election role.

The key for both sides, he said, is persuading infrequent voters to turn out.

""Much more important, in my opinion, than rallies,"" Graul said.

Top US trade official sees progress in helping workers. Voters will decide if her approach continues,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/katherine-tai-trade-tariff-workers-trump-election-250fab4c5dbc1c10f0780844dcdb2b12,2024-10-06T12:00:09Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the U.S. trade representative, Katherine Tai is legally required to avoid discussing the presidential election. But her ideas about fair trade are on the ballot in November.

Voters are essentially being asked to decide whether it is best to work with the rest of the world or threaten it. Do they favor pursuing worker protections in trade talks, as Tai has done on behalf of the Biden-Harris administration? Or should the United States jack up taxes on almost everything it imports as Donald Trump has pledged to do?

After nearly four years in her job, Tai feels she is making progress on getting the U.S. and its trade partners to focus more on workers' rights. Decades of trade deals often prioritized keeping costs low by finding cheap labor that could, in some cases, be exploited.

""You can't do trade policy by yourself,"" Tai said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""I am confident that the path that we are on is the right path to be on. I think the only question is how much progress we are able to make in these next years.""

It is an approach that has drawn criticism from business leaders, economists and Republicans who say that the U.S. has not made enough progress on new trade partnerships and countering China's rise.

""There have been no trade deals, no talks to expand free trade agreements,"" Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., said in an April congressional hearing with Tai. ""Compared to China's ambitious agenda, the United States is falling behind in every region in the world.""

Trump says that broad tariffs of at least 20% on all imports -- and possibly even higher on some products from China and Mexico -- would bring back American factory jobs. Most economists say they would hurt economic growth and raise inflation, though the former president has dismissed those concerns.

""If you're a foreign country and you don't make your product here, then you will have to pay a tariff, a fairly substantial one, which will go into our treasury, will reduce taxes,"" Trump, the Republican presidential nominee this year, said at a recent rally in Erie, Pennsylvania.

Tai has degrees from Yale University and Harvard Law School, but strives for a blue-collar perspective on trade. She said that she has injected once-excluded labor union voices into the trade process.

The Biden-Harris administration has not rejected tariffs. It kept the ones on China from Trump's presidency. It has imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles, even though there is not much of a U.S. market for these vehicles that can cost, without tariffs, as little as $12,000. Tai sees that as a way to shield an emerging industry against subsidized and unfair competition.

But the administration also is looking to bolster U.S. workers in the face of competition from China through other industrial policies, such as funding for computer chip factories and tax breaks for technology in renewable energy sources.

The reality, according to some economists, is that domestic factories did not simply lose jobs to China. There were productivity gains that meant some manufacturers needed fewer employers and there was a broader shift as more workers moved away from manufacturing and into the services sector. Those factors often get less emphasis from Tai, said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

""It seems to me that she's focusing on the easy one -- the one where you can blame the 'bad guy,' China,"" Lovely said.

There is unfinished work.

The trade pillar of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework spearheaded by Tai remains incomplete. That effort by Washington and its allies in Asia is meant to counterbalance China's ascendance without needing a trade deal, but it puts more of a focus on workers' rights and environmental protections than past proposals.

""What I have discovered is that we actually all want the same thing,"" Tai said. ""Fundamentally, what we're doing is innovating the way you do trade policy, innovating the way globalization is going to play out into the future.""

Tai said she is trying to foster a trade policy with other countries that ""allows for us to build our middle class together and to stop pitting them against each other, because that's been the model we've been pursuing for the last several decades.""

William Reinsch at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said it is not surprising that Asian countries involved in the initiative would say they support their middle-class workers. But he saidt Democrats have not provided the access to U.S. markets that trade partners want in return for the focus on workers.

""The consistent message we have gotten from the Asian partners is that they are looking for tangible benefits, and the U.S. is not providing any,"" he said. ""Trying to rearrange the traditional social order, however meritorious that would be, can be an uphill battle.""

Tai sees herself as having a proof of concept that her approach to trade can thrive. It just happens to come from the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the revised North American trade deal signed during the Trump administration and cited by Trump as evidence that he knows how to negotiate with the rest of the world.

In her interview, Tai said the agreement includes a ""rapid response mechanism"" that enables the government to penalize factories that violate workers' rights. Tai said that as of late September, the U.S. government has invoked the mechanism 28 times and concluded 25 of those efforts.

Tai said that has directly benefited 30,000 Mexican workers who could elect their own union representation, allowing them to receive higher wages, back pay and other benefits.

""We are empowering workers through trade,"" she said. ""And by empowering Mexico's workers, we are ensuring that America's workers do not have to compete with workers in our neighboring country who are being exploited and who are being deprived of rights.""

Praise for the agreement appears to be a rare point of convergence on trade between Trump and the Biden-Harris administration. But their perspectives are different. Trump tells voters that his threats of massive tariffs can cause foreign governments to accept America's terms on trade and immigration.

""I ended NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made and replaced it with the USMCA, the best trade deal ever made,"" he said Monday, referring to the North America Free Trade Agreement signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.

Tai, barred by the federal Hatch Act from weighing in on the presidential campaign from her office, is cautious in her remarks. But she disputes Trump's claim.

She notes that there were actually two negotiations on trade with Canada and Mexico. The first negotiation was among the Trump administration and the other two nations. But the second was between Trump's team and congressional Democrats who needed to ratify the deal and that led to worker protections, a component Tai worked on when she was a congressional staffer.

But then, she added, just getting a written deal on trade protections and rights is never enough. The text needs to be backed up by action.

""They're just words on the page unless it's implemented,"" she said."
Elon Musk makes first appearance at Trump rally casting election in dire terms,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-donald-trump-rally-butler-election-f718967ec29431a2b9858b1121e70da1,2024-10-05T23:44:01Z,"Billionaire tech executive Elon Musk cast the upcoming presidential election in dire terms during a Saturday appearance with Donald Trump, calling the Republican presidential nominee the only candidate ""to preserve democracy in America.""

The CEO of SpaceX and Tesla who also purchased X, Musk joined Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, where the former president survived an assassination attempt in July. He warned ""this will be the last election"" if Trump doesn't win and, clad in a black-on-black cap bearing the ""Make America Great Again"" slogan of Trump's campaign, appeared to acknowledge the foreboding nature of his remarks.

""As you can see I am not just MAGA -- I am Dark MAGA,"" he said.

The appearance marked the first time Musk joined one of Trump's trademark rallies and represented the growing alliance between the two men in the final stretch of a competitive presidential election. Musk created a super PAC supporting the Republican nominee that has been spending heavily on get-out-the-vote efforts in the final months of the campaign. Trump has said he would tap Musk to lead a government efficiency commission if he regains the White House.

Trump joined Musk in August for a rare public conversation on X, an overwhelmingly friendly chat that spanned more than two hours. In it, the former president largely focused on the July assassination attempt, illegal immigration and his plans to cut government regulations.

Before a massive crowd on Saturday, Musk sought to portray Trump as a champion of free speech, arguing that Democrats want ""to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your fight to vote, effectively."" Musk went on to criticize a California effort to ban voter ID requirements.

Saturday's rally took place at the same property where a gunman's bullets grazed Trump's right ear and killed his supporter, Corey Comperatore. The shooting left multiple others injured.

Several members of Comperatore's family, as well as other attendees and first responders from the July rally, returned to the site on Saturday. Also appearing with the former president were his running mate Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance, son Eric Trump, daughter-in-law and RNC co-chair Lara Trump, along with Pennsylvania lawmakers and sheriffs.

South Korean leader says North Korea wants US attention by showing off nuclear might,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-north-nuclear-asean-3e6a6839383efed921afc12351e3ba8c,2024-10-05T23:14:09Z,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea's recent disclosure of a nuclear facility was likely an attempt to grab U.S. attention ahead of the presidential election, and the North will likely stage major provocations like a nuclear test explosion and a long-range missile test, South Korea's president says.

President Yoon Suk Yeol shared his government's assessment on the recent moves by North Korea with The Associated Press, before he leaves Sunday for a three-nation trip that includes a stop in Laos for summits with Southeast Asian and other world leaders. At Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-related meetings, Yoon says he'll emphasize that North Korea's nuclear disarmament is essential to regional peace.

""At the upcoming ASEAN-related summits, I will stress the importance of denuclearization of North Korea, which is a prerequisite for realizing a free, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,"" Yoon said in written responses to questions from the AP.

""This will serve to send a clear message that the international community will never condone North Korea's reckless actions,"" he said.

Concerns about North Korea have grown in recent weeks, with the country unveiling a secretive uranium-enrichment facility, vowing to build more nuclear weapons and continuing its provocative missile tests. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to destroy South Korea with his nuclear weapons, if provoked.

Many foreign experts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win outside concessions like sanctions relief, after a new U.S. president is elected. They say Kim likely thinks a win by Republican candidate Donald Trump, whom he engaged in high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018-19, would increase his chances to get what he wants than Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. During campaigns, Trump boasted about his personal ties with Kim, while Harris said she won't ""cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un who are rooting for Trump.""

The Sept. 13 disclosure of the nuclear site showed Kim's defiance of U.S.-led efforts to eliminate his advancing nuclear program. It was North Korea's first unveiling of a facility to produce weapons-grade uranium since the country showed one at its main Yongbyon nuclear complex to visiting American scholars led by nuclear physicist Siegfried Hecker in 2010. Hecker said the centrifuge hall shown in the recent North Korean photos was not the same one that he saw in 2010.

""North Korea seems to have recently disclosed its nuclear facility in order to draw attention from the United States and the international community in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election, and it is likely that North Korea will carry out additional provocations such as nuclear tests and ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) launches going forward,"" Yoon said.

Yoon didn't elaborate whether South Korea has detected any suspicious activities in North Korea that indicate its preparations for nuclear and ICBM tests. He said South Korea is closely monitoring North Korea's movements through the South Korea-U.S. combined intelligence and surveillance assets.

North Korea has conducted six underground nuclear tests since 2006, and numerous ICBM test-launches in recent years. Additional tests are likely meant to further hone its nuclear and missile capabilities. Many observers assess North Korea has yet to possess functioning nuclear missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland, though it likely has ones that can strike all of South Korea and Japan.

Since his inauguration in 2022, Yoon, a conservative, has made a stronger military alliance with the United States the center of his foreign policy to cope with North Korea's evolving nuclear threats. He's also taken a major step toward moving beyond historical disputes with Japan to beef up a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security partnership. Such moves have enraged North Korea, which has called Yoon ""a traitor"" and ignored his calls for dialogue.

There are some potential worries about the South Korea-U.S. alliance if Trump returns to the White House. He had previously asked South Korea to drastically increase its share for the cost of the U.S. military deployment on its soil. Some experts say Trump's possible push for a new round of negotiation with Kim could complicate Yoon's approach on North Korea's nuclear program.

But Yoon said that he's confident that the ""ironclad"" South Korea-U.S. alliance will continue to advance steadily regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election.

""There is a firm bipartisan support for the ROK-U.S. alliance in the United States,"" Yoon said. ""Numerous leading U.S. Democrats and Republicans have publicly stated their staunch support for the alliance and are continuously visiting Korea for consultations to enhance the bilateral relations.""

The ROK stands for the Republic of Korea, South Korea's formal name.

Yoon also expressed confidence that South Korea and Japan will continue to advance their bilateral ties under Japan's new Cabinet led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office last week. Yoon's office said the two countries are discussing arranging a meeting between Yoon and Ishiba on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit.

Yoon said he believes North Korea's nuclear threats against South Korea are aimed at fomenting internal divisions in South Korea and tightening its domestic control with heightened military tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

""The North Korean regime's past claim that its nuclear development was never intended to target the Republic of Korea, since we are one nation, has been debunked,"" Yoon said.

Asked about North Korea's repeated launches of trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea, Yoon said that North Korea ""will face consequences that it will find difficult to withstand"" if the safety of South Korean people is jeopardized. He didn't elaborate what specific steps his government is considering.

Before visiting Laos, Yoon is to travel to the Philippines and Singapore.

At the ASEAN-related summits, Yoon said that a key issue that South Korea plans to raise other than the North Korean nuclear program is the establishment of the ROK-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership. He said South Korea will further expand cooperation with ASEAN on a range of areas such as politics, military exchanges, cybersecurity, environments and a safety net against financial crises."
Mormon church leaders encourage civility as Trump and Harris rally religious voters,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mormon-voters-trump-harris-abortion-4b7d1b3fca00d341ba988d3390cfc3d5,2024-10-05T22:51:31Z,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- As both presidential campaigns have stepped up efforts to win over voters in western swing states who belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a top church official urged members on Saturday to ""avoid what is harsh and hateful"" in the heat of election season.

Dallin H. Oaks, the top adviser and likely successor to 100-year-old church president Russell M. Nelson, encouraged congregants at the faith's twice-annual general conference to steer clear of contention and be peacemakers in their communities one month out from the Nov. 5 election.

The devil is the father of contention, which can stir up anger and stall important policy changes, he told a room of 18,000 church members in Salt Lake City and thousands more watching on a livestream.

""As we pursue our preferred policies in public actions, let us qualify for his blessings by using the language and methods of peacemakers,"" said Oaks, the second-highest-ranking leader of the faith known widely as the Mormon church.

The faith's leaders strive to remain politically neutral. But they sometimes give general advice about how members should approach key elections. About 7 million of the faith's 17 million worldwide members live in the United States, many in the battleground states of Arizona and Nevada, and in solidly red Utah and Idaho.

Latter-day Saints have been a reliably Republican voting bloc for decades, but many have half-heartedly embraced Donald Trump since his first run for the White House.

Some church members say the former president's demeaning rhetoric toward women, immigrants and refugees conflicts with their core values of humility, honesty and compassion. Others have raised concern about his felony convictions and his attempts to undermine the 2020 presidential election.

Vice President Kamala Harris is hoping to capitalize on her opponent's inability to lock down the Latter-day Saints vote. Her campaign formalized outreach efforts last month and enlisted prominent members of the faith to convince those in battleground Arizona, a state with nearly 450,000 church members, that Trump is not in alignment with the church's teachings.

Trump has also rallied influential church members at his Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida to help him convince swing voters that he will better protect their religious liberties.

Harris is unlikely to come close to winning a majority of Latter-day Saints. But by preventing Trump from running up big margins with a key demographic, she could tip the scales in Arizona and Nevada, which is home to upward of 180,000 Latter-day Saints.

One of Harris' greatest challenges is making her abortion policy palatable to members of a faith that has long opposed the procedure, with some exceptions.

It is a sticking point for Marilou Idos, a conference attendee from Herriman, Utah, who said she is not a fan of Trump's brash style but plans to vote for him because he opposes expanding abortion access. She also values Trump's support for Israel.

""He's the lesser of two evils,"" said Idos, 70. ""The basic things we believe in, Trump endorses. Abortion, that's kind of the main one, and the freedom to worship.""

The religion is also known for its belief in eternal families, tight-knit congregations and bans on alcohol, coffee, gambling and same-sex relationships.

Sammy Price, 38, of Las Vegas, said he is leaning toward voting for Harris because he thinks the nation needs her unifying rhetoric.

""Trump, he insults people, he makes people feel bad about who they are, and that's not something I think I can stand by,"" he said.

Undecided voters Jenna Winkel, 22, and her husband, Ben Winkel, 24, said just before the conference that they hoped church leaders would avoid addressing politics.

The couple from Draper, Utah, said there is room for a variety of political views under the Latter-day Saints umbrella. While Jenna said her religion doesn't really inform her politics, Ben said his does, but he wants to do more of his own research.

""The important thing about any general conference message is that it's general and then we're asked to take them and study them and apply them to our own lives, and maybe our politics,"" Jenna said. ""People will take what they need to hear from them and apply them in their lives."""

(AP) -- Thousands of supporters returned to Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday to rally around Donald Trump at the same site where a gunman tried to assassinate him in July.

Trump's campaign predicted that tens of thousands would attend the event, billed as a ""tribute to the American spirit,"" and hundreds were lining up as the sun rose. Speakers who took the stage ahead of the GOP nominee -- who has characterized his return as a fulfillment of ""an obligation"" to Butler -- recalled the details of the July 13 shooting, praised the former president's courage and said God protected him that day, something Trump has also suggested about his surviving the attempt.

There were numerous references and tributes to Corey Comperatore, who died at the July rally as he shielded family members from gunfire. His fireman's jacket was set up on display surrounded by flowers, an artist created a patriotic rendering of the former fire chief live on stage, and Comperatore's sisters wiped tears from their eyes as their brother was honored from the stage.

A visibly heightened security presence surrounded the site, with men in camouflage uniforms stationed on roofs with large guns. The building from which shots were fired in July was completely obscured by tractor-trailers, a large grassy perimeter and a fence, featuring Trump's image from the previous rally. Other tweaks included most bleacher seats being arranged at the sides, rather behind the stage."
"Ohio court refers case brought by citizens' group against Trump, Vance to prosecutors",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/haitian-immigration-trump-vance-da370515db927ea9e6cbd9a92469da7a,2024-10-05T16:35:15Z,"SPRINGFIELD, Ohio (AP) -- An Ohio court has referred to county prosecutors a criminal case brought by a citizens' group against the Republican presidential and vice presidential candidates over their comments about Haitian immigrants but rejected the group's call to issue arrest warrants or misdemeanor summons.

Springfield officials said in a statement Saturday that the Clark County municipal court found no probable cause to issue warrants or summons on misdemeanor charges against former president Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. ""The matter was then referred to the Clark County prosecutor's office for further investigation,"" city officials said.

The Springfield News-Sun reports that the judicial panel said particular consideration should be given to ""the strong constitutional protections afforded to speech, and political speech in particular"" with the election so close and the ""contentious"" nature of the issue of immigration.

The Haitian Bridge Alliance, a nonprofit group representing the Haitian community, last month invoked a private-citizen right to file charges over the chaos and threats experienced since Trump first spread false claims about legal immigrants there during a presidential debate.

""Their persistence and relentlessness, even in the face of the governor and the mayor saying this is false, that shows intent,"" said the group's attorney, Subodh Chandra of the Cleveland-based Chandra Law Firm. ""It's knowing, willful flouting of criminal law.""

Steven Cheung of the Trump-Vance campaign said the former president was ""rightfully highlighting the failed immigration system that (Vice President) Kamala Harris has overseen, bringing thousands of illegal immigrants pouring into communities like Springfield and many others across the country.""

The 15,000 to 20,000 Haitian immigrants who have arrived in Springfield over the past several years -- in many cases after being recruited to local jobs -- have been granted ""temporary protected status"" to be in the U.S. legally.

""It is crucial to foster discussions around sensitive issues, particularly those concerning immigration, with a commitment to truth and integrity,"" Springfield officials said. The city said it was ""dedicated to promoting constructive dialogue and addressing community concerns transparently"" and added that ""the safety and well-being of all residents, including the Haitian immigrant community, continue to be our highest priority."""
"For small cities across Alabama with Haitian populations, Springfield is a cautionary tale",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/haiti-migrants-alabama-springfield-e0a110d75fc4cc8f5a903c6b2408a625,2024-10-05T16:06:28Z,"ENTERPRISE, Ala. (AP) -- The transition from the bustling Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to a small Alabama city on the southernmost tip of the Appalachian mountain range was challenging for Sarah Jacques.

But, over the course of a year, the 22-year-old got used to the quiet and settled in. Jacques got a job at a manufacturing plant that makes car seats, found a Creole-language church and came to appreciate the ease and security of life in Albertville after the political turmoil and violence that's plagued her home country.

Recently, though, as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate began promoting debunked misinformation about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, causing crime and ""eating pets,"" Jacques said there have been new, unforeseen challenges.

""When I first got here, people would wave at us, say hello to us, but now it's not the same,"" Jacques said in Creole through a translator. ""When people see you, they kind of look at you like they're very quiet with you or afraid of you.""

Amid this mounting tension, a bipartisan group of local religious leaders, law enforcement officials and residents across Alabama see the fallout in Springfield as a cautionary tale -- and have been taking steps to help integrate the state's Haitian population in the small cities where they live.

As political turmoil and violence intensify in Haiti, Haitian migrants have embraced a program established by President Joe Biden in 2023 that allows the U.S. to accept up to 30,000 people a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela for two years and offers work authorization. The Biden administration recently announced the program could allow an estimated 300,000 Haitians to remain in the U.S. at least through February 2026.

In 2023, there were 2,370 people of Haitian ancestry in Alabama, according to census data. There is no official count of the increase in the Haitian population in Alabama since the program was implemented.

The immigration debate is not new to Albertville, where migrant populations have been growing for three decades, said Robin Lathan, executive assistant to the Albertville mayor. Lathan said the city doesn't track how many Haitians have moved to the city in recent years but said ""it seems there has been an increase over the last year, in particular.""

A representative from Albertville's school system said that, in the last school year, 34% of the district's 5,800 students were learning English as a second language -- compared to only 17% in 2017.

In August, weeks before Springfield made national headlines, a Facebook post of men getting off a bus to work at a poultry plant led some residents to speculate that the plant was hiring people living in the country illegally.

Representatives for the poultry plant said in an email to The Associated Press that all its employees are legally allowed to work in the U.S.

The uproar culminated in a public meeting where some residents sought clarity about the federal program that allowed Haitians to work in Alabama legally, while others called for landlords to ""cut off the housing"" for Haitians and suggested that the migrants have a ""smell to them,"" according to audio recordings.

To Unique Dunson, a 27-year-old lifelong Albertville resident and community activist, these sentiments felt familiar.

""Every time Albertville gets a new influx of people who are not white, there seems to be a problem,"" Dunson said.

Dunson runs a store offering free supplies to the community. After tensions boiled over across the country, she put up multiple billboards across town that read, in English, Spanish and Creole, ""welcome neighbor glad you came.""

Dunston said the billboards are a way to ""push back"" against the notion that migrants are unwelcome.

When Pastor John Pierre-Charles first arrived in Albertville in 2006, he said the only other Haitians he knew in the area were his family members.

In 14 years of operation, the congregation at his Creole-language church, Eglise Porte Etroite, has gone from just seven members in 2010 to approximately 300 congregants. He is now annexing classrooms to the church building for English language classes and drivers' education classes, as well as a podcast studio to accommodate the burgeoning community.

Still, Pierre-Charles describes the last months as ""the worst period"" for the Haitian community in all his time in Albertville.

""I can see some people in Albertville who are really scared right now because they don't know what's going to happen,"" said Pierre-Charles. ""Some are scared because they think they may be sent back to Haiti. But some of them are scared because they don't know how people are going to react to them.""

After the fallout from the initial public meetings in August, Pierre-Charles sent a letter to city leadership calling for more resources for housing and food to ensure his growing community could safely acclimate, both economically and culturally.

""That's what I'm trying to do, to be a bridge,"" said Pierre-Charles.

He is not working alone.

In August, Gerilynn Hanson, 54, helped organize the initial meetings in Albertville because she said many residents had legitimate questions about how migration was affecting the city.

Now, Hanson said she is adjusting her strategy, ""focusing on the human level.""

In September, Hanson, an electrical contractor and Trump supporter, formed a nonprofit with Pierre-Charles and other Haitian community leaders to offer more stable housing and English language classes to meet the growing demand.

""We can look at (Springfield) and become them in a year,"" Hanson said, referring to the animosity that's taken hold in the Ohio city, which has been inundated with threats. ""We can sit back and do nothing and let it unfold under our eyes. Or we can try to counteract some of that and make it to where everyone is productive and can speak to each other.""

Similar debates have proliferated in public meetings across the state -- even in places where Haitian residents make up less than 0.5% of the entire population.

In Sylacauga, videos from numerous public meetings show residents questioning the impact of the alleged rise in Haitian migrants. Officials said there are only 60 Haitian migrants in the town of about 12,000 people southeast of Birmingham.

In Enterprise, not far from the Alabama-Florida border, cars packed the parking lot of Open Door Baptist Church in September for an event that promised answers about how the growing Haitian population was affecting the city.

After the event, James Wright, the chief of the Ma-Chis Lower Creek Indian Tribe, was sympathetic to the reasons Haitians were fleeing their home but said he worried migrants would affect Enterprise's local ""political culture"" and ""community values.""

Other attendees echoed fears and misinformation about Haitian migrants being ""lawless"" and ""dangerous.""

But some came to try to ease mounting anxieties about the migrant community.

Enterprise police Chief Michael Moore said he shared statistics from his department that show no measurable increase in crimes as the Haitian population has grown.

""I think there was quite a few people there that were more concerned about the fearmongering than the migrants,"" Moore told the AP.

Moore said his department had received reports of Haitian migrants living in houses that violated city code, but when he reached out to the people in question, the issues were quickly resolved. Since then, his department hasn't heard any credible complaints about crimes caused by migrants.

""I completely understand that some people don't like what I say because it doesn't fit their own personal thought process,"" said Moore. ""But those are the facts.""

"After the deluge, the lies: Misinformation and hoaxes about Helene cloud the recovery",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-trump-musk-conspiracy-theories-misinformation-fe81869765d778ac2ff3dc5f9ac18e10,2024-10-05T13:43:23Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The facts emerging from Hurricane Helene's destruction are heartrending: Businesses and homes destroyed, whole communities nearly wiped out, hundreds of lives lost, hundreds of people missing.

Yet this devastation and despair is not enough for the extremist groups, disinformation agents, hucksters and politicians who are exploiting the disaster to spread false claims and conspiracy theories about it and the government's response.

According to former President Donald Trump, the federal government is intentionally withholding aid to Republican disaster victims. Far-right extremist groups warn on social media that officials plan to bulldoze affected communities and seize the land from residents. A tale straight from science fiction asserts that Washington used weather control technology to steer Helene toward Republican voters in order to tilt the presidential election toward Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.

The claims, according to experts and local officials dealing with disaster response, say less about the reality of the widespread damage from Helene than they do about America's fractured politics and the fear and distrust shadowing an election year marked by assassination attempts and escalating global tension.

As rescue work continues and authorities try to separate fact from fiction, the conspiracy theories are not helping. Elected leaders from both parties have had to set the record straight and urge people not to give into fear and rumor.

""If everyone could maybe please put aside the hate for a bit and pitch in to help, that would be great,"" posted Glenn Jacobs, the retired professional wrestler known as Kane, who is now the Republican mayor of Knox County, Tennessee. Jacobs' post was intended to rebut rumors that workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency were seizing relief supplies from private citizens.

Many of the conspiracy theories focus on hard-hit North Carolina, a state key to winning the White House. Rumors circulated that FEMA was raiding storm donations and withholding body bags, forcing local hospitals to stack the bodies of victims. One claim suggested federal authorities would condemn the entire town of Chimney Rock and prohibit resettlement in order to commandeer a valuable lithium mine nearby.

Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla, X and SpaceX, posted that private relief flights to North Carolina were being blocked by the Federal Aviation Administration, a claim dismissed as false by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

Despite the tradition of Democrats and Republicans putting aside politics for disaster response, many conspiracy theories suggest Democrats such as President Joe Biden or North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper are intentionally withholding aid from Republicans. Trump has pushed the claim, as has North Carolina's lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson, the embattled GOP nominee for governor.

""They're being treated very badly in the Republican areas,"" Trump told Fox News, ignoring reports and photo and video evidence of recovery efforts underway throughout the region. ""They're not getting water, they're not getting anything.""

Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones endorsed Trump's fact-free allegation. Jones, the founder of InfoWars, popularized the idea that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut that killed 20 children in 2012 was faked. ""Exclusive: Victims of Hurricane Helene Confirm The Federal Government is Purposely Blocking Rescuers and Stealing Aid In an Attempt to Keep Deep Red Areas From Voting,"" Jones posted Thursday on X.

State-run media and disinformation campaigns run by China and Russia have amplified false and misleading claims about the response to the storm. Both countries have used social media and state news stories to criticize responses to past U.S. natural disasters, part of a larger effort to stoke division and distrust among Americans.

State and local officials from both parties have condemned the conspiracy theories as rumors, saying the focus should be on recovery, not political division and hearsay. Responding to the hoaxes is taking up time that should go toward assisting victims, said North Carolina state Sen. Kevin Corbin, a Republican who urged his constituents not to give into hoaxes.

""Friends can I ask a small favor?"" Corbin posted Thursday on Facebook. ""Will you all help STOP this conspiracy theory junk that is floating all over Facebook and the internet... Please don't let these crazy stories consume you.""

After Robinson, the GOP candidate for North Carolina governor, posted that state officials had not prepared for the storm, a spokesman for the governor accused Robinson of mounting ""an online disinformation campaign."" North Carolina officials say the response to Helene is the largest in state history, including thousands of members of the National Guard and other recovery workers, millions of meals, dozens of aircraft and more than 1,000 chainsaws.

Trump has tried to tie the hurricane's aftermath to immigration, a leading issue of his campaign. He falsely claimed that FEMA had run out of money because all of it had gone to programs for undocumented immigrants.

The agency's funding for disaster aid is stretched, but that is because of the many parts of the country dealing with the effects of hurricanes, wildfires and other calamities. Disaster aid is funded separately from other Department of Homeland Security programs that support immigration-related spending.

Bizarre stories proposing that the government used weather control technology to aim the hurricane at Republican voters quickly racked up millions of views on X and other platforms.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., endorsed the idea, posting Wednesday on X: ""Yes they can control the weather. It's ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can't be done.""

Far-out tales of space lasers, fake snow and weather control technology -- sometimes tinged with antisemitism -- have spread after recent natural disasters, including a snowstorm in Texas and last year's wildfire in Maui.

Experts who study conspiracy theories say big events like disasters -- or the Sept. 11 attacks or the COVID-19 pandemic -- create perfect conditions for conspiracy theories to spread because large numbers of anxious people are eager to find explanations for shocking events.

Responding to the volume of false claims about Helene, the Red Cross urged people to consult trustworthy sources of information and to think twice before reposting conspiracy theories.

""Sharing rumors online without first vetting the source and verifying facts ultimately hurts people -- people who have just lost their homes, neighborhoods, and, in some cases, loved ones,"" the organization wrote in a public plea."
The Supreme Court opens its new term with election disputes in the air but not yet on the docket,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-election-transgender-free-speech-guns-50d7d3d0a85932efe407a80aeaea75fa,2024-10-05T12:43:12Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Transgender rights, the regulation of ""ghost guns"" and the death penalty highlight the Supreme Court's election-season term that begins Monday, with the prospect of the court's intervention in voting disputes lurking in the background.

The justices are returning to the bench at a time of waning public confidence in the court and calls to limit their terms to 18 years that have wide support, including the backing of Democratic President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the party's White House nominee.

Whether by design or happenstance, the justices are hearing fewer high-profile cases than they did in recent terms that included far-reaching decisions by the 6-3 conservative majority on presidential immunity, abortion, guns, and affirmative action.

The lighter schedule would allow them to easily add election cases, if those make their way to the high court in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election between Republican Donald Trump and Harris, or its immediate aftermath.

""I think there are legal issues that arise out of the political process. And so, the Supreme Court has to be prepared to respond if that should be necessary,"" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson told CBS News last month in an interview to her promote new memoir, ""Lovely One.""

The court's involvement in election disputes might depend on the closeness of the outcome and whether the justices' intervention would tip the outcome, David Cole, the outgoing legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said at a recent Washington event.

""I don't think the court wants to get involved, but it may have to,"" Cole said.

The court turned away multiple challenges from Trump and his allies to the results of the 2020 election that he lost to Biden. It's been nearly a quarter-century since the Supreme Court effectively decided the 2000 presidential election, in which Republican George W. Bush edged Democrat Al Gore.

When the justices gather Monday morning on a date set by federal law, they will shake hands with each other as they always do. Just after 10 o'clock, they will emerge from behind freshly cleaned heavy red drapery and take their seats on the curved mahogany bench, Chief Justice John Roberts in the center chair and his eight colleagues seated in order of seniority.

There are likely to be smiles and shared private jokes. But the friendliness of that moment will not sweep away tensions that have barely been concealed.

During the summer, two justices, Elena Kagan and Jackson, voiced support for toughening the new ethics code that so far lacks a means of enforcement.

The leak to The New York Times of the contents of a memo Roberts wrote last winter that outlined his approach to the court's presidential immunity decision ""was nothing short of shocking,"" Supreme Court lawyer Lisa Blatt said last week at a Washington preview of the coming term.

Two years ago, Politico obtained the draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion case.

""Something does feel broken,"" Blatt said. Describing her experience arguing before the court, she said, some justices ""just seem visibly frustrated.""

Important cases dot the court's calendar, beginning Tuesday. The court will take up a challenge to a Biden administration attempt to regulate hard-to-trace ""ghost guns"" that had been turning up at crime scenes in increasing numbers. The Supreme Court jumped into the case after the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated the regulation.

Last term, conservatives voted 6-3 to strike down a gun regulation that had banned bump stocks, an accessory that allows some weapons to fire at a rate comparable to machine guns. Bump stocks were used in the nation's deadliest modern mass shooting in Las Vegas.

A day after the guns case, the justices will take up the latest twist in Oklahoma death row inmate Richard Glossip's long quest for freedom. His case is the rare instance in which prosecutors are conceding mistakes in the trial that led to Glossip's conviction and death sentence.

The highest-profile case on the agenda so far is a fight over transgender rights that is focused on state bans on gender-affirming care. It probably will be argued in December.

Republican-led states have enacted a variety of restrictions on health care for transgender people, school sports participation, bathroom usage and drag shows. The administration and Democratic-led states have extended protections for transgender people. The Supreme Court has separately prohibited the administration from enforcing a new federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students.

The case before the high court involves a law in Tennessee that restrict puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors. About half the states have enacted similar restrictions.

Also on tap for the late fall is an appeal from the adult entertainment industry to overturn a Texas law that requires pornographic websites to verify the age of their users.

Only about half the court's calendar for the term has been filled, and several big cases could be added. Among those is a push by Republican-led states and conservative legal outlets to further restrict federal agencies.

The immediate target is the method the Federal Communications Commission has used to fund telephone service for rural and low-income people and broadband services for schools and libraries.

The case, which the administration has appealed to the Supreme Court, could give the justices the opportunity to revive a legal doctrine known as nondelegation that has not been used to strike down legislation in nearly 90 years. Several conservative justices have expressed support for the idea of limiting the authority Congress can delegate to federal agencies."
Trump returns to site of Pennsylvania assassination attempt for huge rally with Vance and Musk,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-butler-pennsylvania-elon-musk-assassination-attempt-24a8718393eb6fdab01336ca4438a0e0,2024-10-05T04:16:55Z,"BUTLER, Pa. (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump plans to return Saturday to the site where a gunman tried to assassinate him in July, setting aside what are now near-constant worries for his physical safety in order to fulfill a promise -- ""really an obligation,"" he said recently -- to the people of Butler, Pennsylvania.

""I'll probably start off by saying, 'As I was saying ...'"" the Republican presidential nominee has joked, in a bit of black humor about a speech cut short when a bullet struck Trump's ear and he was whisked off stage -- fist aloft -- with blood dripping across his face.

Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, also will be on hand at the Butler Farm Show grounds, as will billionaire Elon Musk, as the campaign elevates the headline-generating potential of his return with just 30 days to go in their tight campaign against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

The campaign is predicting tens of thousands of people will attend what is being pitched as a ""tribute to the American spirit."" Local hotels, motels and inns are reportedly full and some eager rallygoers were already arriving Friday, according to a local Facebook page.

""President Trump looks forward to returning to Butler, Pennsylvania to honor the victims from that tragic day,"" said Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. ""The willingness of Pennsylvanians to join President Trump in his return to Butler represents the strength and resiliency of the American people.""

Trump will use the 5 p.m. Eastern time event to remember Corey Comperatore, a volunteer firefighter struck and killed at the July 13 rally, and to recognize the two other rallygoers injured, David Dutch and James Copenhaver. They and Trump were struck when 20-year-old shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, opened fire from an unsecured rooftop nearby before he was fatally shot by sharpshooters.

How Crooks managed to outmaneuver law enforcement that day and scramble on top of a building within easy shooting distance of the ex-president is among myriad questions that remain unanswered about the worst Secret Service security failure in decades. Another is his motive, which has never been determined.

Butler County District Attorney Rich Goldinger told WPXI-TV this week that ""everyone is doubling down on their efforts to make sure this is done safely and correctly.""

Mike Slupe, the county sheriff, told the station he estimates the Secret Service -- which has undergone a painful reckoning over its handling of two attempts on Trump's life -- is deploying ""quadruple the assets"" it did in July.

Butler County, on the western edge of a coveted presidential swing state, is a Trump stronghold. He won the county -- where turnout hovers around an impressive 80% -- with about 66% of the vote in both 2016 and 2020. About 57% of Butler County's 139,000 registered voters are Republicans, compared with about 29% who are Democrats and 14% something else.

Three months later, townspeople are divided over the value of his return. Heidi Priest, a Butler resident who started a Facebook group supporting Harris, said Trump's last visit fanned political tensions in the city.

""Whenever you see people supporting him and getting excited about him being here, it scares the people who don't want to see him reelected,"" she said.

But Trump needs to drive up voter turnout in conservative strongholds like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, rural-suburban community, if he wants to win Pennsylvania in November. Harris, too, has targeted her campaign efforts at Pennsylvania, rallying there repeatedly as part of her aggressive outreach in critical swing states."
Alleged plots against US campaign are only the latest examples of Iran targeting adversaries,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/iran-hacking-assassinations-plot-6cb2929fa7065ca8d8e21c6713087258,2024-10-05T04:15:22Z,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iran has emerged as a twofold concern for the United States as it nears the end of the presidential campaign.

Prosecutors allege Tehran tried to hack figures associated with the election, stealing information from former President Donald Trump's campaign. And U.S. officials have accused it of plotting to kill Trump and other ex-officials.

For Iran, assassination plots and hacking aren't new strategies.

Iran saw the value and the danger of hacking in the early 2000s, when the Stuxnet virus, believed to have been deployed by Israel and the U.S., tried to damage Iran's nuclear program. Since then, hackers attributed to state-linked operations have targeted the Trump campaign, Iranian expatriates and government officials at home.

Its history of assassinations goes back further. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran killed or abducted perceived enemies living abroad.

A look at Iran's history of targeting opponents:

For many, Iran's behavior can be traced to the emergence of the Stuxnet computer virus. Released in the 2000s, Stuxnet wormed its way into control units for uranium-enriching centrifuges at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, causing them to speed up, ultimately destroying themselves.

Iranian scientists initially believed mechanical errors caused the damage. Ultimately though, Iran removed the affected equipment and sought its own way of striking enemies online.

""Iran had an excellent teacher in the emerging art of cyberwarfare,"" wryly noted a 2020 report from the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Saudi Arabia.

That was acknowledged by the National Security Agency in a document leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2015 to The Intercept, which examined a cyberattack that destroyed hard drives at Saudi Arabia's state oil company. Iran has been suspected of carrying out that attack, called Shamoon, in 2012 and again in 2017.

""Iran, having been a victim of a similar cyberattack against its own oil industry in April 2012, has demonstrated a clear ability to learn from the capabilities and actions of others,"" the document said.

There also were domestic considerations. In 2009, the disputed reelection of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the Green Movement protests. Twitter, one source of news from the demonstrations, found its website defaced by the self-described ""Iranian Cyber Army."" There's been suspicion that the Revolutionary Guard, a major power base within Iran's theocracy, oversaw the ""Cyber Army"" and other hackers.

Meanwhile, Iran itself has been hacked repeatedly in embarrassing incidents. They include the mass shutdown of gas stations across Iran, as well as surveillance cameras at Tehran's notorious Evin Prison and even state television broadcasts.

Iranian hacking attacks, given their low cost and high reward, likely will continue as Iran faces a tense international environment surrounding Israel's conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah, Iran's enrichment of uranium to near weapons-grade levels and the prospect of Trump becoming president again.

The growth of 3G and 4G mobile internet services in Iran also made it easier for the public -- and potential hackers -- to access the internet. Iran has over 50 major universities with computer science or information technology programs. At least three of Iran's top schools are thought to be affiliated with Iran's Defense Ministry and the Guard, providing potential hackers for security forces.

Iranian hacking attempts on U.S. targets have included banks and even a small dam near New York City -- attacks American prosecutors linked to the Guard.

While Russia is seen as the biggest foreign threat to U.S. elections, officials have been concerned about Iran. Its hacking attempts in the presidential campaign have relied on phishing -- sending many misleading emails in hopes that some recipients will inadvertently provide access to sensitive information.

Amin Sabeti, a digital security expert who focuses on Iran, said the tactic works.

""It's scalable, it's cheap and you don't need a skill set because you just put, I don't know, five crazy people who are hard line in an office in Tehran, then send tens of thousands of emails. If they get 10 of them, it's enough,"" he said.

For Iran, hacks targeting the U.S. offer the prospect of causing chaos, undermining Trump's campaign and obtaining secret information.

""I've lost count of how many attempts have been made on my emails and social media since it's been going on for over a decade,"" said Holly Dagres, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who once had her email briefly hacked by Iran. ""The Iranians aren't targeting me because I have useful information swimming in my inbox or direct messages. Rather, they hope to use my name and think tank affiliation to target others and eventually make it up the chain to high-ranking U.S. government officials who would have useful information and intelligence related to Iran.""

Iran has vowed to exact revenge against Trump and others in his former administration over the 2020 drone strike that killed the prominent Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad.

In July, authorities said they learned of an Iranian threat against Trump and boosted security. Iran has not been linked to the assassination attempts against Trump in Florida and Pennsylvania. A Pakistani man who spent time in Iran was recently charged by federal prosecutors for allegedly plotting to carry out assassinations in the U.S., including potentially of Trump.

Officials take Iran's threat seriously given its history of targeting adversaries.

After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, its leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini signaled how Iran would target perceived enemies by saying, ""Islam grew with blood.""

""The great prophet of Islam, he had the Quran in one hand, and a sword in the other hand -- a sword to suppress traitors,"" Khomeini said.

Even before creating a network of allied militias in the Mideast, Iran is suspected of targeting opponents abroad, beginning with members of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's former government. The attention shifted to perceived opponents of the theocracy, both in the country with the mass executions of 1988 and abroad.

Outside of Iran, the so-called ""chain murders"" targeted activists, journalists and other critics. One prominent incident linked to Iran was a shooting at a restaurant in Germany that killed three Iranian-Kurdish figures and a translator. In 1997, a German court implicated Iran's top leaders in the shooting, sparking most European Union nations to withdraw their ambassadors.

Iran's targeted killings slowed after that, but didn't stop. U.S. prosecutors link Iran's Revolutionary Guard to a 2011 plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to Washington. Meanwhile, a suspected Israeli campaign of assassinations targeted scientists in Iran's nuclear program.

In 2015, Iran signed a nuclear deal that saw it greatly reduce its enrichment in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Two years later, Trump was elected pledging to unilaterally withdraw America from the accord. As businesses backed away from Iran, Tehran renewed a campaign of targeting opponents abroad, but this time capturing them and bringing them to Iran for trial.

Belgium arrested an Iranian diplomat, Assadollah Assadi, in 2018 and ultimately convicted him of masterminding a thwarted bomb attack against an exiled Iranian opposition group. Iran also increasingly has turned to criminal gangs for some attempts, such as what U.S. prosecutors have described as plots to kill or kidnap opposition activist Masih Alinejad.

Among those targeted after Soleimani's death was former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton. The U.S. has offered a reward of up to $20 million for information leading to the capture or conviction of a Revolutionary Guard member it said arranged to kill Bolton for $300,000.

An FBI agent quoted Guard Gen. Esmail Ghaani as saying in 2022 in a court filing, ""Wherever is necessary we take revenge against Americans by the help of people on their side and within their own homes without our presence."""
Harris is heading to North Carolina to survey Helene's aftermath one day after Trump visited,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-democrats-hurricane-helene-13475a09f3fed719a1b451105ab15ccf,2024-10-05T04:15:17Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is heading to North Carolina on Saturday as the state recovers from Hurricane Helene, arriving there one day after a visit by Republican Donald Trump, who is spreading false claims about the federal response to the disaster.

Earlier in the week, Harris was in Georgia, where she helped distribute meals, toured the damage and consoled families hard-hit by the storm. President Joe Biden, too, visited the disaster zone. During stops over two days in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia, Biden surveyed the damage and met with farmers whose crops have been destroyed.

The two have been vocal and visible about the government's willingness to help, and the administration's efforts so far include covering costs for all of the rescue and recovery efforts across the Southeast for several months as states struggle under the weight of the mass damage.

In a letter late Friday to congressional leaders, Biden wrote that while the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund ""has the resources it requires right now to meet immediate needs, the fund does face a shortfall at the end of the year."" He also called on lawmakers to act quickly to restore funding to the Small Business Administration's disaster loan program.

More than 200 people have died. It's the worst storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005, and scientists have warned such storms will only worsen in the face of climate change.

But in this overheated election year, even natural disasters have become deeply politicized as the candidates crisscross the disaster area and in some cases visit the same venues to win over voters in battleground states.

Trump has falsely claimed the Biden administration isn't doing enough to help impacted people in Republican areas and has harshly criticized the response. He has, in Helene's aftermath, espoused falsehoods about climate change, calling it ""one of the great scams of all time.""

During a stop in Fayetteville, North Carolina on Thursday, Trump renewed his complaints about the federal response and cited ""lousy treatment to North Carolina in particular."" In fact, the state's Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, said this week the state has already seen more than 50,000 people be registered for FEMA assistance, and about $6 billion has been paid out.

Biden, meanwhile, has suggested the Republican House speaker is withholding critical disaster funding.

Harris' visits, meanwhile, present an additional political test in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. She's trying to step into a role for which Biden is well known -- showing the empathy that Americans expect in times of tragedy -- in the closing stretch of her White House campaign.

Until this week, she had not visited the scene of a humanitarian crisis as vice president -- that duty was reserved for Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms and more.

Harris said this week that she wanted to ""personally take a look at the devastation, which is extraordinary."" She expressed admiration for how ""people are coming together. People are helping perfect strangers.""

She said that shows ""the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us,"" an echo of a line she frequently uses on the campaign trail.

""We are here for the long haul,"" she said.

Colorado judge who sentenced election denier Tina Peters to prison receives threats,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/tina-peters-election-clerk-sentenced-threats-d565bd42bc566d4d178491a258238765,2024-10-04T23:53:17Z,"A rural Colorado county courthouse beefed up security Friday after threats were made against staff and a judge who sentenced former county clerk Tina Peters to nearly nine years behind bars and admonished her for her role in a data breach scheme catalyzed by the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump.

Courthouse staff in Grand Junction, Colorado, received multiple threats that were being vetted by law enforcement while extra security was provided, said spokesperson Wendy Likes with the Mesa County Sheriff's Office.

She did not say how many threats were made or how they were received. She also declined to describe the extra security.

The court received compliments as well as threats for Judge Matthew Barrett's sentencing of Peters, Will Sightler, the court executive of the 21st Judicial District, said in a statement Friday. He didn't elaborate on what the compliments said.

Peters, a Republican, was sentenced Thursday for allowing access to the county's election system to a man affiliated with My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell -- a prominent promoter of false claims that voting machines were manipulated to steal the election.

The one-time hero to election deniers, who was convicted in August, was unapologetic about what happened during the sentencing hearing Thursday -- leading Judge Barrett to chastise her during a 15-minute speech that was shared widely online.

He told Peters she sought power and fame in pursuing false election fraud claims, causing immeasurable damage to election integrity in Mesa County. He said she had no respect for the checks and balances of government, for the court, law enforcement or her colleagues and that she betrayed her oath of office, making her a danger to the community.

""It's the position she held that has provided her with the pulpit from which she can preach these lies,"" Barrett said. ""Every effort to undermine the integrity of our elections and public's trust in our institutions has been made by you.""

Peters, 68, isn't the only person who has faced legal troubles for pursuing Trump's claims of a stolen election.

Three people were charged after five vote tabulators were illegally taken from three Michigan counties and brought to a hotel room, according to court documents. Investigators found the tabulators were broken into and ""tests"" were performed on the equipment.

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has been disbarred in New York and Washington for pursuing Trump's claims about the 2020 election. Other Trump lawyers have been disciplined, relinquished their licenses, indicted or have pleaded guilty in relation to efforts to overturn the election. Hundreds of people have been convicted for their roles in storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress was certifying the Electoral College vote.

Before Peters was sentenced, she told Judge Barrett she still believed there had been fraud, even though no evidence exists.

""Just because you don't acknowledge and you're blind to the truth, it doesn't mean that the truth is not there,"" she said. She also alleged Mesa County's voting machines had been replaced to eliminate evidence of fraud.

Cases like Peters' raised concerns that that rogue election workers, including those sympathetic to lies about the 2020 presidential election, might use their access to election equipment and the knowledge gained through the breaches to launch an attack from within. That could be intended to gain an advantage for their desired candidate or party, or to introduce system problems that would sow further distrust in the election results.

Gillian Feiner, senior counsel with States United Democracy Center -- a nonpartisan organization that promotes free and fair elections -- said Friday she hopes Peters' sentence serves as a ""meaningful deterrent to others who are still engaged in this type of misconduct.""

""And there are others. She was not in this alone,"" Feiner said. ""There was a network of bad actors supporting her. And not all of them have been brought to justice. And they were paying attention to this.""

Judge Barrett rejected Peters' request for a probationary sentence, saying her crimes are serious enough to require prison time.

Barrett did tell Peters that she likely won't serve her entire term -- which is just over 8 years in prison followed by six months in the county jail -- because she could be granted time off based on her behavior in prison. Her sentence will be followed by three years on parole."

The Biden administration isn't extending a two-year program for migrants from 4 nations,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-immigration-election-4cb4c80e3a71ab79ef47406136653b1a,2024-10-04T22:38:10Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration will not extend a two-year program that allows migrants from certain nations into the U.S. if they came by plane with sponsorship.

The program began in 2022 with Venezuelans and was an effort to provide an alternative legal pathway for migrants who were increasingly coming to the U.S.-Mexico border while the administration simultaneously cracked down on illegal crossings. It later expanded to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans -- the nationalities of the migrants who most frequently tried to cross the border. The program allowed them to live and work in the U.S. for two years while they sought other legal status.

The decision comes just a month before the 2024 presidential election, as Democrat Kamala Harris has worked to project a tougher stance on immigration. Republican Donald Trump has derided the administration's immigration policies and has increasingly insulted and spread lies about migrants in the U.S., particularly Haitians, in recent weeks.

Homeland Security officials said Friday that those at the two-year mark must apply for another type of legal status, depart the country or face deportation. There are multiple different pathways for many of the nationalities, including what's called ""temporary protected status"" for Venezuelans and Haitians, which allows them to stay in the U.S. because of extreme violence, unrest or devastating natural disasters in their home countries.

""This two-year period was intended to enable individuals to seek humanitarian relief or other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible, and to work and contribute to the United States,"" a spokesperson for Homeland Security said.

New migrants to the border may still apply for the program, and it does not affect those from Afghanistan or Ukraine."

With Helene hitting during the homestretch of an election year, the agency has been criticized by some residents and politicians, like Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who have questioned its response and are spreading false information that its funding is going to migrants or foreign wars.

The Biden administration has defended FEMA's work and says it has the money it needs to help communities right now.

President Joe Biden does say the agency will need more cash in the future. Climate change is making storms like hurricanes more severe.

There are a lot of misperceptions about FEMA's role in disaster recovery, what it does -- and does not -- pay for and what residents in hurricane-hit areas can expect.

Here's a closer look:

FEMA has an operating budget and a disaster relief fund. The fund gets replenished every year by Congress and is used to pay for recovery from hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other disasters. FEMA also pays for rebuilding from past disasters and for projects designed to protect communities against future calamity.

""This is kind of like the emergency account for the country,"" said Samantha L. Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy.

Congress recently replenished the fund with $20 billion -- the same amount FEMA got last year. About $8 billion of that is set aside for recovery from previous storms and mitigation projects.

The federal government doesn't help with every disaster -- it generally has to be above the ability of a community or state to handle. In that case, the governor or tribal authority asks the president for an emergency declaration.

Once declared, FEMA assistance varies widely. Public assistance -- which is a lot of what it pays for -- is geared toward reimbursing governments for debris removal or rebuilding roads, public buildings and more.

FEMA also has individual assistance, designed to help residents. This can include one-time payments for emergency needs up to a trailer for someone who lost their house.

When there is warning -- like with hurricanes -- FEMA coordinates with state and local governments about what they need and can pre-position supplies like tarps or water in areas likely to be most affected. FEMA also has search-and-rescue teams.

But experts stress that the federal agency isn't in charge of the entire process.

""Everybody thinks that FEMA just comes in right after the disaster and starts managing the entire disaster. And that's just not the case,"" said Brock Long, who was FEMA administrator from 2017 to 2019.

Trump accused FEMA of spending all its money to help immigrants in the country illegally, while other critics assert that the government spends too much on foreign funding for Israel or Ukraine.

""FEMA absolutely has enough money for Helene response right now,"" said Keith Turi, acting director of FEMA's Office of Response and Recovery, noting the $20 billion from Congress.

FEMA called Trump's accusations ""completely false.""

The agency administers the Shelter and Services Program, which gives money to reimburse cities, towns or organizations for immigration-related expenses. But that comes from a separate pot of money funded by Congress for Customs and Border Protection. FEMA gives out the money, but it doesn't come from the disaster relief fund.

Congress also separately funds foreign military aid.

There are long-term funding concerns for FEMA, however.

Turi said the agency was already working to make what's called a ""supplemental"" funding request to Congress before Helene hit. In the storm's wake, it's clear they'll need even more money, he said.

Both Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who oversees FEMA, and Biden have sounded the alarm about more money needed in the future.

Speaking from a Georgia pecan farm devastated by Helene, Biden said the supplemental funding could not wait: ""People need help now.""

FEMA seeking extra money is not uncommon. Long said he had to go back to Congress three times during his tenure for more cash.

A 2022 Congressional Budget Office report said that most of the money that goes to the disaster relief fund actually comes in these supplemental requests. Extra money that's needed varies depending on the disaster, but the report noted that ""a small number of those disasters account for a disproportionate share of total spending.""

The disaster assistance fund sometimes runs low in late summer before Congress passes a new budget. When that happens, FEMA shifts to what's called ""immediate needs funding."" That means the agency stops paying out for previous disasters and conserves its money for life-saving missions during any new ones.

When the disaster relief fund is replenished -- like what just happened last week -- then money will flow again to longer-term projects.

""Honestly, there's a lot of work that needs to be done to streamline it and rethink, 'How can a disaster relief fund ... be set up in a manner where the FEMA administrator is not constantly having to ask for supplemental funding?"" Long said.

No. It's important to know not just what FEMA does, but what it doesn't do, especially for individuals.

One claim floating around after Helene is that disaster survivors only get $750 from FEMA. That figure refers to help that the agency can give someone in an affected area for what they might need immediately, like clothing or food, Turi said.

From there, the agency can provide other things like money for a storage unit, medical bills or rental assistance depending on the situation.

For homeowners, the first line of defense is always insurance. Those who don't have insurance or not enough can turn to FEMA, but the maximum amount someone can get to rebuild is $42,500. That's a far cry from what is needed to fix severe damage or rebuild completely.

""This is one of the kind of major problems FEMA has in terms of how the public understands their role and responsibility,"" said Montano, the professor. ""FEMA does not make anybody whole after a disaster happens. They are not going to give you enough money to completely recover your life."""
Oklahoma's request for Bible supplier for schools match version endorsed by Trump,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/oklahoma-bible-schools-trump-endorsed-f8001269aadca5b41712c6ec80e34f69,2024-10-04T22:35:49Z,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Oklahoma's top education official is seeking to purchase 55,000 Bibles for public schools and specifying that each copy contain the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution, which are not commonly found in Bibles but are included in one endorsed by former President Donald Trump.

The request is part of Republican State Superintendent Ryan Walters' ongoing efforts to require Bibles in every classroom, which has been met with resistance by some of Oklahoma's largest school districts.

Walters is seeking to spend $3 million in state funds for Bibles that fit a certain criteria, including that the pages are supplemented with U.S. historical materials. The Bibles must also be ""bound in leather or leather-like material for durability,"" according to state bidding documents posted this week.

The nonprofit news outlet Oklahoma Watch first reported Thursday that the requirements match the ""God Bless the USA Bible"" that Trump urged his supporters to begin buying earlier this year at a website that sells the book for $59.99.

Asked Friday if the state's bid was tailored for the Bible backed by Trump, a spokesman for Walters said the proposal was open to any vendor.

""There are hundreds of Bible publishers and we expect a robust competition for this proposal,"" said Dan Isett, a spokesman for the Oklahoma State Department of Education.

Former Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson, a Democrat, said the bid ""does not pass the smell test"" and said a court could void it if the process was found to limit competition.

""All fingers point to the Trump Bible that does contain all these requirements,"" Edmondson said.

Walters in June ordered public schools to incorporate the Bible into lessons for grades 5 through 12. The bidding documents also specify that the Bibles include both the Old Testament and New Testament, the Pledge of Allegiance and the Bill of Rights.

""We can see there are very few Bibles on the market that would meet these criteria, and all of them have been endorsed by former President Donald Trump,"" said Colleen McCarty, executive director of Oklahoma Appleseed Center for Law and Justice.

The name of the Bible backed by Trump is inspired by country singer Lee Greenwood's patriotic ballad. Trump takes the stage to the song at each of his rallies and has appeared with Greenwood at events.

The Bible's website states the product ""is not political and has nothing to do with any political campaign."" It says the site ""uses Donald J. Trump's name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Ventures LLC.""

Trump reported earning $300,000 off sales of the Bible, according to financial disclosures released in August. His campaign did not immediately return an email seeking comment Friday evening.

Walters, himself a former public school teacher who was elected to his post in 2022, ran on a platform of fighting ""woke ideology,"" banning books from school libraries and getting rid of ""radical leftists"" who he claims are indoctrinating children in classrooms."
"Biden talks election, economy and Middle East in surprise news briefing",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-conference-hamas-israel-kamala-harris-lebanon-hezbollah-jd-vance-0093866898d9f9067ff0676672cba9d8,2024-10-04T20:48:51Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 1,080 days as president, Joe Biden on Friday decided to pop in and take questions in the White House briefing room for the first time, striding in with a grin after a strong monthly jobs report and the temporary settlement of a strike by ports workers.

The president has been less available than his recent predecessors to questions from White House press corps, making his surprise appearance welcome to the gathered reporters who waited as his press secretary's daily briefing was moved up 15 minutes, then delayed for nearly one hour.

The president stepped through the press room's blue door in a dark gray suit and red tie and proceeded to make news in response to questions about comments on the 2024 presidential election, the latest jobs numbers and the escalating conflict in the Middle East.

The 81-year old stepped aside from the Democratic nomination this summer, backing Vice President Kamala Harris instead. He acknowledged doubts about whether the November election would be peaceful, given comments by former President Donald Trump that the results could be rigged.

""I'm confident it will be free and fair. I don't know whether it will be peaceful,"" Biden said. ""The things that Trump has said, and the the things that he said last time when he didn't like the outcome of the election, were very dangerous.""

Biden has tried to rebut a political movement that has at times openly trafficked in conspiracy theories, with the latest revolving around the government reporting Friday that employers added 254,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%.

""Another fake jobs report out from Biden-Harris government today,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., posted on social media. ""But all the fake numbers in the world aren't going to fool people dealing with the Biden-Harris.""

The jobs reports are legitimate and have capped a solid run for the U.S. economy. Growth has stayed solid even as the inflation rate has dropped from a four-decade high in 2022 to an annual rate of 2.5%.

Consumer confidence has been weak relative to overall economic growth, a sign that many people still don't feel the strength seen in the latest jobs and inflation numbers. But Biden stressed that he was operating on valid data despite unfounded claims of falsification by supporters of Trump's Make America Great Again movement.

""If you notice, anything the MAGA Republicans don't like they call 'fake,'"" Biden said. ""The job numbers are what the job numbers are. They're real. They're sincere.""

The president also highlighted the deal reached Thursday to suspend a strike by 45,000 dockworkers on East and Gulf coast ports until Jan. 15, creating time to try to hash out a new contract.

Still, challenges remain for Biden as his final months as president involve the risk of a wider war in the Middle East.

Since Hamas attacked Israel nearly a year ago, Israel has retaliated by bombarding the Gaza region in ways that have raised human rights concerns, as well as killing Hezbollah leaders and launching airstrikes in Lebanon. On Tuesday, Iran fired at least 180 missiles into Israel and there are concerns about additional retaliation that could cause the conflict to deepen.

When asked, Biden clarified his comments from a day earlier about Israel possibly striking Iranian oil facilities, which caused the price of the commodity to jump on the prospect of supplies being squeezed.

""Look, the Israelis have not concluded what they're going to do in terms of a strike,"" Biden said Friday. ""That's under discussion. I think if I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.""

The president emphasized that he and Harris are ""singing from the same song sheet"" on foreign and domestic policy, calling her a ""major player in everything we've done.""

As Biden began to leave the room, he was asked if he would reconsider his decision to exit the race. Biden cocked his head and smiled."
Retired New Jersey State Police trooper who stormed Capitol is sentenced to probation,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-state-police-trooper-capitol-riot-ec7637f65e0910fe5bb890cfaf98bf5e,2024-10-04T20:08:30Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A retired New Jersey State Police trooper who stormed the U.S. Capitol with a mob of Donald Trump supporters was sentenced to probation instead of prison on Friday, as the federal courts reached a milestone in the punishment of Capitol rioters.

Videos captured Michael Daniele, 61, yelling and flashing a middle finger near police officers guarding the Capitol before he entered the building on Jan. 6, 2021.

Daniele expressed his regret for his role in the attack before U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sentenced him to two years of probation, including 30 days of home confinement with electronic monitoring, and ordered him to pay a $2,500 fine. Prosecutors had recommended an 11-month prison sentence for Daniele.

""My family has been through hell,"" Daniele said before learning his sentence. ""I would never do anything like this again.""

The number of sentencings for Capitol riot cases topped the 1,000 mark on Friday, according to an Associated Press review of court records that began more than three years ago.

More than 1,500 people have been charged with Jan. 6-related federal crimes. At least 647 of them have been convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment ranging from a few days to 22 years. Over 200 have been sentenced to some form of home confinement.

In June, Mehta convicted Daniele of misdemeanor charges after a trial without a jury. But the judge acquitted him of two felony counts of interfering with police during a civil disorder.

Daniele served as a New Jersey State Police trooper for 26 years.

""I cannot be possible that you thought it was OK to be inside the United States Capitol on January 6th,"" the judge said.

Daniele wasn't accused of physically assaulting any police officers or causing any damage at the Capitol that day.

""You're not criminally responsible for that, but you do bear some moral obligation for it,"" the judge said.

A prosecutor said Daniele ""should have known better"" given his law-enforcement training and experience.

""By being there, he lent his strength to a violent mob,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Carolyn Jackson said.

Daniele traveled from Holmdel, N.J., to Washington, D.C., to attend then-President Trump's ""Stop the Steal"" rally near the White House on Jan. 6, when Congress convened a joint session to certify President Joe Biden's 2020 electoral victory.

Before Trump finished speaking, Daniele marched to the Capitol and joined hundreds of other rioters at the Peace Circle, where the mob breached barricades and forced police to retreat. Daniele entered the Capitol through the Senate Wing doors and walked through the Crypt. He spent roughly six minutes inside the building.

When the FBI interviewed him, Daniele referred to the Jan. 6 attack as a ""set up"" and suggested that other rioters ""looked like cops,"" according to prosecutors.

""He also blamed the violence of January 6 on the police -- despite serving decades with law enforcement himself -- accusing the police officers facing an unprecedented attack by a crowd of thousands of not following proper riot control practices,"" prosecutors wrote.

Defense attorney Stuart Kaplan said incarcerating Daniele would be a waste of taxpayer dollars.

""He made poor choices and a bad decision,"" the lawyer said. ""I think he's got more credits than debits."""
Donald Trump and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp use hurricane recovery to make first appearance together,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-brian-kemp-hurricane-helene-biden-75ed7f49ffd1a9b07ba82e18abecaa47,2024-10-04T19:46:26Z,"EVANS, Ga. (AP) -- After making up privately, former President Donald Trump and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp are using the aftermath of Hurricane Helene to put their détente on public display with a month to go before Election Day.

Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, and Kemp, a popular second-term governor, are slated to appear together Friday afternoon outside Augusta, Georgia, to tout recovery efforts after Helene made landfall in Florida and wrought widespread damage as it moved inland through Georgia and other states.

The appearance will take place at a public pavilion in the town of Evans, with Trump and Kemp surrounded by water, paper products and other relief supplies. It marks the latest turn in the two Republicans' contentious relationship tracing back to Trump's insistence that his 2020 election defeat was fraudulent and his repeated broadsides at Kemp for not helping him overturn Democrat Joe Biden's narrow victory in Georgia.

It also comes days after Kemp publicly disputed Trump's false assertions that Biden and his White House were not helping Georgia and other GOP-run states affected by the storm. Kemp told reporters plainly that Biden had called him personally and offered whatever assistance Georgia might need.

""The president just called me ... and I missed him and called him right back and he just said 'Hey, what do you need?' And I told him, you know, we've got what we need, we'll work through the federal process,"" Kemp said of Biden. ""He offered if there are other things we need just to call him directly, which I appreciate that.""

In Valdosta on Monday, Trump ignored reporters' questions about Kemp confirming that Biden and his administration were indeed directing federal response and working with officials in the affected states, which are led by governors from both major parties.

It was not clear Friday whether Trump and Kemp might take questions from reporters gathered in Evans -- a situation that almost certainly would put the governor in a position to again dispute Trump's false accounts with the former president standing beside him.

As recently as August, Trump used social media posts and an Atlanta rally to accuse the governor of ""fighting Unity and the Republican Party"" and criticizing Georgia's first lady for saying she planned to write in her husband's name on her presidential ballot. Kemp had been saying for months that he would support ""the Republican ticket,"" but without naming Trump specifically.

That spectacle raised concerns among Republicans in Georgia and nationally that GOP dissension would lead to a repeat of 2020, when Biden won the state by fewer than 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Trump's running mate JD Vance helped negotiate a detente, with Kemp finally stating in a cable news interview that he supported Trump's comeback bid and Trump, in turn, praising the governor on social media. Not long after, Vance and Kemp spoke at a Faith & Freedom Coalition gala in Georgia and met privately backstage. During his speech at the dinner, Kemp did explicitly call for returning Trump to the White House. But he still spent most of his argument criticizing Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris rather than extolling Trump."
4 voters charged with intentionally voting twice in Michigan primary election,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/michigan-election-fraud-charges-d274ed39e3f298f3e75a44dfb38be4c4,2024-10-04T17:27:06Z,"DETROIT (AP) -- Four people intentionally voted twice in Michigan's summer primary election, the state attorney general said Friday as she announced felony charges against the suburban Detroit residents as well as public employees accused of enabling it to happen.

""It's shocking and simply unheard of,"" Attorney General Dana Nessel said.

The charges in St. Clair Shores come a month before the general election in a high-stakes state coveted by presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and where voter turnout is expected to be high.

""What occurred here cannot be allowed to be repeated in November,"" Nessel said. ""As to election workers, it is imperative that all election staff, volunteers and assistant clerks abide by the laws of this state.""

She said four people who had already cast absentee ballots for the Aug. 6 primary showed up to vote in St. Clair Shores on the day of the election. It's possible to cancel an absentee ballot, Nessel said, but not when a ballot has already been received before Election Day.

An electronic poll book showed that the four had already voted. But after poll workers consulted with local election staff, they were still allowed to vote again, Nessel said.

The extra votes did not affect race results, she said.

Four voters were charged with voting twice. Three people described as assistant clerks in St. Clair Shores were charged with falsifying election records.

Nessel said the motives of the seven were unknown. There's no evidence that they were working together.

The state stepped in after Pete Lucido, the Republican local prosecutor in Macomb County, said there was ""no malicious or criminal intent"" and declined to file charges.

Nessel, a Democrat, suggested Lucido didn't have expertise.

""There are so many different procedures that are involved here,"" she said. ""I think if you're not highly familiar with this, the way that our staff has become, it's easy to make mistakes."""
The US and South Korea reach new deal on costs for the American troop presence,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/us-south-korea-military-presence-costs-49519732c6a7d68038bc3516f2e4f69a,2024-10-04T16:56:27Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and South Korea have tentatively agreed to a new deal covering the costs of maintaining the American military presence there, the U.S. State Department and South Korean foreign ministry announced Friday.

The agreement, which must still be approved by the South Korean government and ratified by its parliament before taking effect, would see Seoul's contribution rise by 8.3% during the first year of the five-year deal, to $1.125 billion. Additional increases, capped at 5% per year, would then be applied.

There are about 28,500 U.S. forces in South Korea to help deter potential aggression from North Korea and fewer than a handful of major bases.

""The agreement will be a significant accomplishment for both sides, and will strengthen our alliance and our shared defense,"" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.

He did not detail the costs to South Korea, which were outlined in a simultaneously released statement from the South Korean foreign ministry.

The current agreement was not due to expire until next year, but the Biden administration had been pushing to complete the ""Special Measures Agreement"" with South Korea before November's U.S. presidential election, in part to allay South Korean concerns that a possible victory by former President Donald Trump might complicate future negotiations.

During Trump's term, he repeatedly accused South Korea and other U.S. allies of freeloading and suggested he would demand billions of dollars more to extend mutual defense agreements. That led to fears that decadeslong alliances could be jeopardized, and the previous agreement was not extended until President Joe Biden took office.

The new agreement, if approved by the South Koreans, would run until 2030, beyond the four-year term of the next U.S. president."
Advocates urge Ohio to restore voter registrations removed in apparent violation of federal law,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-ohio-voter-registration-challenges-03c8c82f0742c963afa680882fedbc37,2024-10-04T16:34:45Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Voter advocacy organizations have put Ohio's Republican elections chief on notice that voters are being systematically removed from the rolls in several counties in apparent violation of federal law.

A letter sent Thursday to Secretary of State Frank LaRose, just days ahead of Ohio's Monday registration deadline, said the manner in which batches of voters suspected of having moved out of state are being systematically removed -- based on challenges by third-party groups with no direct knowledge of a voter's situation -- is illegal.

The Ohio chapters of Common Cause and the League of Women Voters, represented by the ACLU and the Brennan Center for Justice in Washington, D.C., urged LaRose to correct the violations within 20 days or they may sue. LaRose's office is reviewing the request.

The voter advocates cite public records, including minutes of county election board meetings, voter challenge materials and other communications, showing mass removals in Delaware, Muskingum, probably Logan and possibly Cuyahoga counties. The latter is home to Cleveland, a Democratic stronghold.

The National Voter Registration Act prohibits the systematic removal of names from voter rolls 90 days before a federal election. It also requires election officials to notify voters when their registrations are in danger of lapsing, and provides a four-year window for remedying the situation.

In their letter, the advocates cited recently issued U.S. Justice Department guidance making clear that a person can only be removed from the rolls for a change of residency under two circumstances: if the voter submits a written address change, or if a flagged registration has met all federal notice and waiting period requirements.

Dan Lusheck, a spokesperson for LaRose's office, said an Ohio law in place for nearly 20 years expressly permits voter challenges to be made until 30 days before an election. However, that law applies only to challenges involving individual voters, not systematic removals.

LaRose's office said the secretary cast a tie vote Wednesday against sustaining most of the Delaware County registration challenges. Lusheck said the office would review the groups' claims involving the other three counties.

Conservative groups across the country have been systematically challenging the legitimacy of large numbers of voter registrations this year. Democrats have alleged in court filings that it's a coordinated effort to cause the American electorate to question the results of the 2024 presidential election, as former President Donald Trump repeatedly claims, without evidence that his opponents are trying to cheat.

In Michigan, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, ordered a suburban Detroit election clerk to reinstate the registrations of about 1,000 people removed after a third-party effort. And in Alabama last week, the Justice Department sued the state and its top election official, alleging that Alabama illegally purged voters too close to the November election.

The voter advocates provided several examples of what is happening around Ohio.

In Delaware County's fast-growing suburbs north of Columbus, the elections board in August granted at least 84 third-party challenges -- and potentially hundreds more -- based on voters' purported changes of residence. The advocates said there was no evidence that the affected voters had been communicated with directly, as required.

About a dozen similar removals were carried out in Muskingum County, in eastern Ohio, at two challenge hearings in July, the advocates wrote, where challenges had been brought by third-party groups, such as Check My Vote and The People's Audit. The advocates told LaRose that there is no evidence that the county first complied with the federally required notice and waiting period procedures. Similar removals appear to have taken place in Logan County, in southern Ohio, in June, they found.

In the letter announcing his tie-breaking Delaware County vote, LaRose said a total of about 300 registrations were challenged because voters had moved out of state. He noted that those shown to have registered or voted in North Carolina -- 60 or so people -- were removed in a bipartisan vote. But LaRose said he ""unfortunately"" had to oppose sustaining challenges to the remaining 240 due to a lack of ""clear and convincing"" proof that they had subsequently registered and/or voted in Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Tennessee or Texas.

""Let me state clearly that I commend the citizens who are passionate enough about the integrity of our elections to crowdsource the veracity of our voter rolls,"" LaRose wrote. ""Their civic engagement must be applauded, and I share their commitment to honest and accurate elections."""
"AP PHOTOS: This couple's divided on politics, but glued together by love",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/love-politics-americans-election-democrat-republican-cd9161b351efb8f1ff493c7691e7acbc,2024-10-04T16:07:21Z,"It was on Interstate 74, driving past the endless cornfields of rural Illinois, when Lesley Dzik realized she'd been raising her voice at her husband, Matt. She stopped, and suggested they drop the topic. He agreed, and quiet settled into the cabin of the pickup truck.

""I love you,"" they told each other, and the hands that had been gesturing to articulate their opposing views collapsed into each other on the center console.

The Dziks have navigated issues common to so many marriages, from parenting to money.

But politics? That's complicated.

Lesley, 56, is a Republican. Matt, 68, is a Democrat. She is anti-abortion. Matt believes women should have the choice. She refused to be vaccinated during the pandemic. He got the shots.

When they started dating, all it took was the sight of Democratic lawn signs outside his house ahead of the 2020 election to make her question if their relationship could work.

But they both wanted it to work. Lesley read books by other politically divided couples for inspiration and eventually came across Braver Angels, a nonprofit started by a therapist after former President Donald Trump's 2016 election to help people bridge the political divide. They found a community there that is both red and blue.

""It gave me enough hope,"" said Lesley. ""I felt safe, I'm not alone.""

They seem, in so many ways, the ideal couple. Matt, who is retired, routinely brings flowers home for her. She helps him with handy-man jobs he does for people who can't afford professionals. He drives her to the library at the University of Illinois where she works. They volunteer together at a local theater so they can see shows for free.

Lesley is deeply Christian. Matt, an Army veteran, was raised Catholic, but now sees himself as more spiritual than religious.

""I get worried with Matt because I believe the Bible is truth and Matt is iffy about that,"" she said. ""I wonder what I got myself into.""

But they attend church regularly and when they pray, they hold each other.

Acts of kindness bring them together, whether helping a man who uses a wheelchair get to church or caring for a nonverbal boy so his single mother can work. But their political differences seem to worsen before presidential elections.

At times, things get so heated, they don't speak for days.

A suggestion from their therapist that has helped them navigate their insecurities hangs on the refrigerator door. ""Can I give you a hug?"" it reads. ""If no, then say, 'I love you. You don't suck. I'll come back in ten minutes.'""

At Braver Angel workshops they've learned some techniques to keep political talk civil. Speak to understand, one rule says, don't speak to win.

Their need for one another is too great to avoid the discomforts of their many disagreements.

""We share the same heart,"" said Lesley.

""I love looking in her eyes and seeing her smile,"" said Matt. ""Why would I want to lose that?

They've found things they can agree on, like putting up a flagpole in their front yard and flying the American flag.

""It's much more inspiring than any yard sign will ever be for me,"" she said. ""It's more enduring.""

Musk wrote on his social platform X on Thursday in a retweet of Trump's own promotion of the rally. The SpaceX and Tesla CEO will be among special guests in attendance, Trump's campaign confirmed Friday.

The event will mark the first time that the billionaire businessman appears publicly at a campaign event for the former president since endorsing him. The July endorsement came directly after the attempted assassination, with Musk writing on X, ""I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.""

Musk has supercharged his support for Trump in recent months and has become personally more invested in politics -- even agreeing to lead a government efficiency commission if Trump wins reelection.

He also created a super PAC supporting the Republican nominee that has been spending heavily on get-out-the-vote efforts in the final months of the campaign.

Saturday's rally will take place at the same property where a gunman's bullets grazed Trump's right ear and killed his supporter, Corey Comperatore. The shooting left multiple others injured.

Several members of Comperatore's family, as well as other attendees and first responders from the July rally, will join Trump on Saturday at the farm show property, according to the campaign."

Meanwhile, Trump is heading to Georgia to appear with Gov. Brian Kemp, the latest sign that he's patched up his rocky relationship with the top Republican in a key battleground state.

Former President Barack Obama is planning to hit key swing states to boost Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign for the White House, starting on Thursday in Pittsburgh.

The Harris campaign says Obama will travel around the country over the final 27 days ahead of the election. It noted that the former president and Harris have a friendship that goes back 20 years, from when they first met while he was running for Senate.

Harris was also an early supporter of Obama's 2008 presidential bid and knocked on doors for him in Iowa ahead of its caucus that led off voting in the Democratic primary.

In his speech at the Democratic convention in August, Obama said Harris ""wasn't born into privilege. She had to work for what she's got.""

""And she actually cares about what other people are going through,"" the former president added then."
Chief operating officer of Truth Social's parent company resigns,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-northwall-truth-social-ca5aa7eb862ab25096de7591d4540c18,2024-10-04T12:40:54Z,"The chief operating officer of Truth Social's parent company has resigned and the company must hand over almost 800,000 shares to one of its investors as part of a court ruling, according to a regulatory filing.

COO Andrew Northwall resigned from Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. late last month, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing, adding that the company plans to ""transition his duties internally."" No further details were provided about the resignation. He joined the company in December 2021 according to his LinkedIn page.

The SEC filing also disclosed that a Delaware court ruled last month that 785,825 shares of Trump Media must be released to ARC Global Investments II. Both parties have been feuding over how many shares ARC was owed after Trump Media combined with Digital World Acquisition Corp. The court said that ARC and Trump Media have the option to file an appeal within 30 days after its final order.

Trump Media runs the social media platform Truth Social, which Trump created after he was banned from Twitter and Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Based in Sarasota, Florida, the company has been losing money and struggling to raise revenue. It lost nearly $58.2 million last year while generating only $4.1 million in revenue, according to regulatory filings.

Shares of Trump Media have been considered a meme stock by some market experts, which is a nickname given to stocks that get caught up in buzz online and shoot way beyond what traditional analysis says they're worth. The stock has fluctuated for several months, with trading largely driven by individual investors who are typically considered less sophisticated than day traders.

Late last month Trump Media's stock fell to its lowest level ever on the first trading day that its biggest shareholder, former President Donald Trump, was free to sell his stake in the company behind the Truth Social platform.

Trump Media, whose shares are commonly called TMTG, started trading publicly in March. When the company made its debut on the Nasdaq in March, the shares hit a high of $79.38.

Shares of Trump Media & Technology rose slightly to $16.20 before the market open on Friday."
"For migrant women who land in Colorado looking for jobs, a common answer emerges: No",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/immigration-us-work-permit-tps-aurora-colorado-30dc5eeac61cfa7cb36872f348637844,2024-10-04T04:16:38Z,"AURORA, Colo. (AP) -- East Colfax Avenue was the best place to find a job. That's what everyone told Sofia Roca.

Never mind the open drug use, the sex workers or the groups of other migrant women marching the sidewalks soliciting work at the very same Mexican restaurants and bakeries.

On East Colfax in Aurora, Colorado, bosses and customers would speak Spanish and might be willing to hire someone like Roca -- a 49-year-old immigrant from Colombia -- without legal authorization to work. That was the rationale for going back to Colfax each morning, fruitless as it was.

""Do you know how to cook Mexican food?"" asked one woman, looking up from the limes she was quartering, when Roca inquired about a kitchen position advertised on the door. Roca's accent was a giveaway: not Mexican.

As record numbers of South Americans attempt to cross the U.S. southern border seeking better economic opportunities, many are landing in communities that are unprepared for them -- and sometimes outright hostile.

And many migrants have also been unprepared for the realities of their new home.

Women are leaving Colombia, and to a greater extent Venezuela, to escape starvation and violence, to provide for their children and to seek medical care. They represent some of the more than 42,000 migrants who have arrived in the Denver area over two years. Many didn't know anyone in Denver. But it was the closest city to which Texas was offering free bus rides, both to relieve pressure on its towns and to make a political point to liberal-leaning cities about immigration's impact on the border.

From Denver, untold numbers made their way to the neighboring suburb of Aurora, lured by cheaper rent and abundant Spanish speakers. But finding a job and an affordable place to stay has been anything but easy, and women face their own particular challenges.

Last year, nearly 900,000 women and girls tried to cross the U.S. southern border, more than a fivefold increase over the last decade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows. Like many of them, Roca came to the United States to help her children. Her adult daughter back in Colombia suffers from lupus and can't afford ""the good medicines.""

The economy in Colombia never recovered from pandemic shutdowns, and Roca heard from acquaintances that in the United States she could earn $1,000 a week. ""That's a lot of money in Colombia,"" she said. Back home, ""one U.S. dollar can buy breakfast for your entire family.""

Roca set out for the United States with an uncle. He was detained in Mexico, but Roca made it across the border in Juárez and told U.S. agents she was seeking asylum. She heard from a shelter worker in El Paso that Denver was offering free housing for migrants and Texas would pay to get her there.

As of September, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has bused at least 119,000 migrants from the border to cities run by Democratic mayors, including Denver, New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C., according to a press release from the governor's office.

Roca arrived in November and stayed for two weeks in a hotel-turned-shelter paid for by the city of Denver. When she went looking for work in front of Home Depot and along East Colfax, she observed an icy reception from locals. ""They said horrible things about Venezuelans,"" she said.

She didn't know the benefits many recent migrants have received -- specifically, a path to a temporary work visa and with it better-paying jobs -- were causing resentment among Aurora's large Mexican community. Many have loved ones in the country illegally or have themselves lived for years in the United States without legal permission to work.

As chaos and economic collapse drove more migrants to the border, President Joe Biden's administration created and expanded legal pathways to enter the U.S., with the possibility of applying for work permits. However, in June, Biden temporarily suspended asylum for new immigrants who cross illegally, ending a main pathway to legal work.

Roca never was eligible for a work permit, but Mexican residents in Aurora still associate her with the many migrants who are.

Resentment for newcomers was building in another corner of Aurora, too -- City Hall. Aurora officials in February had warned other communities against housing migrants there, vowing not to spend city money to help them. This summer, Aurora's mayor repeated a landlord's claim that a notorious Venezuelan gang had taken over an apartment building, saying he would investigate how so many Venezuelans ended up living in Aurora. Even though police say gangs hadn't taken over the building, former President Donald Trump took up the claim, mentioning it at his campaign rallies. The mayor last month walked back some of his comments.

Roca never made a deliberate decision to settle in Aurora. To her, it wasn't clear where Denver ended and Aurora began, or that Denver was more eager to help migrants coming to the area.

So when her time is almost up at the Denver shelter, she does the only thing she knows to do: She heads to East Colfax in Aurora.

She walks up and down the sidewalks, dodging people who'd taken over the bus shelters to shoot up drugs or smoke fentanyl and who sell apparently shoplifted toiletries on the sidewalks. She approaches migrants holding cardboard signs and begging for money outside Walmart, asking if they know of work or a place to stay.

A man standing by his truck parked outside a Goodwill thrift store catches her attention. He is singing along to rap music in Spanish. He seems happy, she thinks. He seems like a good guy.

He says he can help her and her cousin, who arrived a few weeks earlier. But not in Colorado. She can come back to Kentucky with him and his family. To hold her over in the short term, the man -- El Cubano, she calls him -- gives her $10 and invites her for ice cream.

After more than a week of staying with the family in Kentucky and cooking and eating meals together, Roca learns El Cubano's wife works in el negocio, or ""the business."" There is not much work in Kentucky, so she earns her money through sex work, she tells Roca, while her kids play a few feet away.

A few days later, while they are cooking dinner together at the couple's trailer, a Mexican man in his 30s pulls up outside in a pickup truck.

He'd seen a picture of Roca and liked her -- and would pay $1,000 for two nights with Roca, the wife says. Roca would keep $600, the couple would get $400. Roca would have to pay him $6 for each ride to and from his house.

Roca stops chopping the onion and looks at her cousin. Don't go with that man, the cousin says. You don't know him.

Roca considers all of the jobs she's done in her life. Caring for Alzheimer's patients as a home health aide. Answering phones at a call center. Selling beauty products on the street in Mexico.

In her month in the United States, she has quickly come to understand she'll have to make sacrifices in this country. That the reports she'd heard back in Colombia about earning $1,000 a week were likely hyperbole. That she'll have to push her body to its limits doing manual labor. She'll have to accept below-standard wages until she gets work permission, if it ever comes. She'll have to stay in someone's living room with other new arrivals and give up her privacy.

But subjecting herself to the whims of a stranger in such an intimate and vulnerable way?

""No,"" she tells the woman. ""I'm not going anywhere with anyone.""

The man is told to leave. The insults start immediately.

How are you going to earn money, girl? asks the woman. You're not going to just live here for free. The food here is good, isn't it? But it's not free.

Roca doesn't know what to expect -- maybe violence. She and her cousin have no money or transportation. They're essentially trapped. But a few days later, Roca leaves as El Cubano yells insults from his trailer. A Venezuelan woman she met outside Home Depot finds someone to help them leave Kentucky.

Where did they want to go? Somewhere she knew people, she remembers thinking. Somewhere with other migrants.

Back to Aurora and East Colfax Avenue.

Back in Aurora, Roca reached out to a Venezuelan woman she'd met briefly begging for money outside the Walmart on Colfax. Soon she took a place in the woman's living room, sharing a queen-sized blow-up mattress with the woman's teenage son.

Roca found a job on the weekends helping a man set up and break down his stall at an outdoor flea market. She hefted large sacks of used clothing over her shoulders, put out the clothing on display, talked to customers. All for $10 an hour. ""It's an abusive wage,"" she said, ""but it's a job.""

She tried standing outside Home Depot, but found many people propositioned her for sex or wouldn't pay her after she completed legitimate jobs. She gave up standing outside a day laborer's center in Aurora when she didn't feel safe trying to jockey for work against dozens of men, who would push her out of the way and jump onto moving trucks rounding up workers.

On most days walking along Colfax Avenue, Roca says, men would solicit her for sex, holding up their fingers to signal how many hundreds of dollars they were willing to pay.

As she looked for work in March, she came across what looked like an old motel, a place she hadn't tried before. ""Is this a hotel or a motel? I don't know,"" she said as she opened the heavy metal door. ""Let's check.""

In the small vestibule, a 1970s-era cigarette vending machine stood in the corner. A grandfatherly man waited behind a plexiglass sliding window. There were no vacancies, but he urged her to try the bar in the back. ""They're always looking for girls,"" he said.

Roca walked to the rear of the building and recognized the name of the bar. ""I know about this place,"" she said.

At a few Mexican cantinas around Aurora and Denver, women are paid to talk and drink with men. ""Ficheras,"" as the women are known in Spanish, sell beers at a significant markup to men and pocket the profits. It can be a fast way to earn money, but also a route to sex trafficking or the drug trade. Visit these establishments, and you can see some ""ficheras"" wearing government-issued ankle bracelets with their sky-high heels. The bracelets were given to them by federal immigration officials to monitor their movements while they await immigration hearings.

""I don't think I have to do that yet,"" Roca said. ""But this street -- it only offers prostitution.""

Since returning to Aurora, Roca had discovered she has few options for establishing legal residence or working legally in the U.S. She told U.S. Border Patrol officials she plans to plead for asylum at her deportation hearing next year, but she doubts they will grant it. Ironically, what happened to her in Kentucky could help her win a visa. The U.S. government issues special visas to victims of sex trafficking here, but Roca has never wanted to report the Cuban couple, fearing they might come after her.

She had gotten in touch through Facebook with a high school friend from Colombia living for the last year in the northeastern United States. ""She's told me she can get me a job at a hotel and I can stay with her,"" she said. ""What would you do if you were me?"" she asked a reporter. ""Would you go?""

The idea of learning to move around a new American city exhausted Roca. But without more work, there wasn't much keeping her in Aurora. Her roommates were headed to eviction court the next week. She didn't know where she would go if they lost the apartment.

Two days later, with about $80 in her pocket, Roca boarded a Greyhound bus paid for by the city of Denver. She landed in a new town -- one that hasn't received busloads of migrants from Texas -- and reunited with her high school friend. (The Associated Press is not identifying her new location, since Roca is afraid the Cuban couple might seek her out after she spoke about them in the media.)

Roca's friend followed through on her promises, allowing her to live with her and connecting her to a job cleaning hotel rooms. Roca has already changed jobs and has found one she likes better. She walks through the city with ease -- and anonymously.

""It's a huge difference from my life in Denver,"" she says. ""There's less chaos, and no one has disrespected me. It's been a great refuge.""

She's not sure how long she'll stay. But Sofia Roca will never live in Aurora, Colorado, again.

Harris and Trump battle for labor support as dockworkers suspend strike,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-labor-michigan-georgia-dockworkers-98eee32bc975ed5bc284d3e0785e5d7b,2024-10-04T04:16:32Z,"DETROIT (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris will visit the union stronghold of Flint on Friday as she battles with Donald Trump for working-class voters who could tip the scales in this year's election.

Her appearance in the battleground state of Michigan comes the day after U.S. dockworkers suspended their strike in hopes of reaching a new contract, sparing the country a damaging episode of labor unrest that could have rattled the economy. A tentative agreement was reached to raise salaries, although other issues still need to be resolved.

Harris issued a statement saying the development ""indicates progress toward a strong contract and represents the power of collective bargaining."" She added that ""dockworkers deserve a fair share for their hard work getting essential goods out to communities across America.""

Unions have long been a bedrock of support for Democrats, but Harris has failed to secure some key endorsements. The International Association of Fire Fighters announced this week that it wouldn't back a candidate this year, following a similar announcement from the Teamsters. Both unions endorsed Joe Biden four years ago.

It's not a total cold shoulder for Harris. Some Teamsters locals are supporting her, and she won quick endorsements from national teachers unions, the building trades, the AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers after replacing Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.

But the divide within the labor community is a reminder of shifting loyalties in American politics. Democrats have increased their support among white-collar professionals while Republicans try to make inroads among voters who didn't attend college.

During a rally in Michigan on Thursday, Trump claimed that Republicans are now ""the party of the American worker,"" glossing over his anti-union record as president. In a reference to labor unrest at the country's ports, he insisted that ""under my leadership Americans won't have to go on strike for a better wage or a better life.""

Trump is heading to Georgia on Friday to appear with Gov. Brian Kemp, the latest sign that he's patched up his rocky relationship with the top Republican in a key battleground state. Later in the day, he's holding a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

Union voters have traditionally leaned toward Democrats, with 56% supporting Biden in 2020. But Trump has pushed hard to win over blue-collar workers traditionally represented by some of the biggest unions. He won 62% of white voters without college degrees -- though only 24% of non-white voters without college degrees -- in 2020.

It's frustrating for Democrats, who point to the White House's firm support for unions. Biden even joined a UAW picket line last year.

Lisa Anderson, 59, drove more than an hour from Green Bay in her green ""AFSCME for Harris-Walz"" shirt to hear the vice president speak Thursday in Wisconsin.

She's been an elementary school administrative assistant for 17 years, and she's confident that Harris' union support runs deep.

""I'm not worried about it,"" Anderson said. ""If you're voting for Trump, how can you believe in unions?"" AFSCME is the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

Labor relations could have been a dominant issue in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign if the dockworkers strike continued, leading to snarled ports and shortages on store shelves.

Biden expressed satisfaction that a deal was being worked out.

""We've been working hard on it,"" he said at the White House. ""With the grace of God, and the goodwill of neighbors, it's gonna hold."""
Filing in Trump case details remarkable schism with Pence over rejecting 2020 election loss,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jan-6-trump-pence-jd-vance-prosecution-f78cf222187b271e0ba0bb684110455e,2024-10-04T04:16:21Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Days before rioters roamed the halls of the U.S. Capitol threatening to ""hang Mike Pence,"" Donald Trump told his vice president that people are going to ""hate your guts"" and ""think you're stupid"" if he failed to stop the 2020 election certification.

The New Year's Day warning wasn't the first time Trump pressured Pence to overturn the election results. Nor was it the last. In what came to be known as ""Operation Pence Card,"" Trump spent weeks publicly and privately pushing his vice president to help him stay in power after losing.

""You're too honest,"" Trump berated his vice president in that Jan. 1 morning call.

After they hung up, the president tweeted a reminder for his followers to come to Washington for the ""BIG Protest Rally"" just days away -- what would become the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol.

The exchanges between the president and his vice president, detailed in special counsel Jack Smith's court filing this week, show the extraordinary lengths Trump went to overturn the 2020 election, even as he lays the groundwork to challenge this year's contest, if he loses.

Pence is no longer standing beside Trump, and has refused to endorse the Republican nominee's bid to return to the White House. Trump and his new vice presidential running-mate, JD Vance, still refuse to accept the 2020 election results that delivered the presidency to Joe Biden.

At a pivotal moment during this week's debate between Vance and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, Vance declined to say whether he accepted the results of the last election. In a stark retort, Walz said, ""That's why Mike Pence isn't on this stage.""

Much of the special counsel's filing recounts the tumultuous months after the November election, when Trump -- surrounded by allies including Steve Bannon, his former campaign manager turned podcast host, who is now in jail after a contempt of Congress conviction -- directed his team to fight to keep him in office. The former president, indicted on criminal charges in the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election, called the new filing ""election interference"" and has sought to have the case dismissed.

The day after the election, Trump told Pence to ""study up"" on the claims of voter fraud in the states they had previously won, when they first ran for office together in 2016.

""It was just look at all of it, let me know what you think,"" Pence recalled of their Nov. 4 phone call. ""But he told me the campaign was going to fight, was going to go to court and make challenges.""

That weekend, as Biden was projected the winner, Pence tried to ""encourage"" Trump ""as a friend"" to consider all that he had accomplished.

""You took a dying party and gave it a new lease on life,"" Pence told Trump on Nov. 7.

As the days went on, the campaign team was giving Trump what Pence described as a ""sober and somewhat pessimistic report"" on the state of the election challenges they were waging.

""Pence gradually and gently tried to convince the defendant to accept the lawful results of the election, even if it meant they lost,"" the court filing said.

""Don't concede but recognize the process is over,"" Pence said he told his defeated running mate on Nov. 12.

Four days later at a private lunch, Pence encouraged the president to accept the results and run again in four years. ""I don't know, 2024 is so far off,"" Trump responded, according to the filing.

By early December there was a shift. Trump was starting to think about Congress' role in the election process.

""For the first time, he mentioned to Pence the possibility of challenging the election results in the House of Representatives,"" the filing said, citing a Dec. 5 phone call.

It was the beginning of an intensifying public and private campaign, orchestrated by Trump, that in the coming weeks would bear down on Pence, and ultimately raise concern for his own safety. Some of the details are described in Pence's own book, ""So Help Me God.""

Trump and his team of outside lawyers, headed by Rudy Giuliani, ""developed a new plan"" after their legal challenges all failed. It was focused on seven states Trump had lost, guided by a proposal from law professor John Eastman to create alternate slates of electors who would claim the defeated president, in fact, had won.

And they turned their attention to Pence.

They falsely claimed that Pence, in his ministerial role as president of the Senate, could decide on Jan. 6 which slates of electors to select, or send them both back to the states for reconsideration, the prosecutors said.

""They lied to Pence, telling him there was substantial campaign fraud and concealing their orchestration of the plan,"" the prosecutor wrote. ""And they lied to the public, falsely claiming that Pence had the authority during the certification proceeding to reject electoral votes.""

Members of Trump's campaign staff called the plan ""crazy"" and referred derogatorily to those organizing it as characters from the ""Star Wars bar.""

Trump told Pence of his plans for a Jan. 6 rally and expressed the thought it would be a ""big day,"" the filing said.

As they had lunch together a couple days later, on Dec. 21, Pence again encouraged Trump not to look at the election as a loss but ""just an intermission.""

Pence told the president that if they still came up short, ""after we have exhausted every legal process in the courts and Congress,"" then Trump should ""take a bow.""

But Trump would not relent. On Dec. 23, Trump retweeted ""Operation Pence Card,"" and began to ""directly and repeatedly pressure Pence,"" prosecutors said, and continued ""summoning"" his supporters to amass in Washington.

On Christmas Day, when Pence called the president to wish him Merry Christmas, Trump told him he had the discretion over certification while presiding in Congress.

""You know I don't think I have the authority to change the outcome,"" Pence said.

As Jan. 6 approached, the days were becoming more desperate for Trump. The president tore into his vice president during the New Year's morning phone call. The next day he asked the Georgia secretary of state to ""find 11,780 votes"" that could prove he won the election in that state. He later told Pence a senator would be seeking a 10-day delay in certification during the proceedings. ""You can make the decision,"" Trump told Pence.

Pence took five pages of contemporaneous notes during a meeting at the White House when Trump directed his team to outline the plan for Pence and said, ""When there's fraud the rules change.""

Pence told them, ""I'm not seeing this argument working.""

""The conspirators were undeterred,"" the prosecutor wrote, and Trump continued to publicly pressure Pence.

""I hope Mike Pence comes through for us,"" Trump said at a rally in Georgia.

Meeting privately in the Oval Office on Jan. 5, the defeated president told his vice president once more, ""I think you have the power to decertify.""

When Pence was unmoved, Trump threatened to criticize him publicly: ""I'm going to have to say you did a great disservice.""

This concerned Pence, the prosecutor wrote, and the vice president's Secret Service detail was alerted.

Trump called Pence later that evening, with his lawyers, to again raise the issue of sending the electors back to the states. Trump called Pence again late that night: ""You gotta be tough tomorrow.""

The next morning, Jan. 6, before Trump took the rally stage, he made one more call to Pence.

When Pence again refused the request, the prosecutor wrote, Trump was incensed.

Trump reinserted remarks targeting Pence into his speech. And Trump sent a crowd of angry supporters to the Capitol.

Departures in House create crucial Republican targets in the fight for majority control,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/house-elections-michigan-virginia-california-41af911c357f2c719adbd2008bfa5cdf,2024-10-04T04:16:19Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a tumultuous and unproductive session of Congress, nearly 50 House members decided either to not seek reelection or to run for a higher office this year, leaving Democratic vacancies in several tight races that could tilt control of the House to either party.

Both Republicans and Democrats have had their fair share of turnover -- with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, the most prominent -- but Democrats are also losing prodigious fundraisers who have successfully held off GOP challengers in recent years. With fierce competition raging over just a couple dozen seats, that's left Democrats relying on fresh faces to hold their ground, while Republicans sense openings in four races in Virginia, Michigan and California.

The GOP is sending resources and trying to neutralize the issue of abortion access in those districts, hoping to go on offense to hold onto a slim majority. The party is running with candidates who have previously come up short in bids to unseat Democrats, but are now optimistic they can build on campaign experience and fare better when they don't face an incumbent.

Democrats, riding on a windfall of campaign donations and voters motivated by reproductive rights, are tapping candidates with track records in office. Most of them are state lawmakers who already have legislative accomplishments, relationships with voters and experience campaigning.

Regardless, it will be a tough task to make up the fundraising hauls and political skills of the prominent Democrats in the three states.

Democratic Reps. Katie Porter of California, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and Elissa Slotkin and Dan Kildee, both of Michigan, raked in a combined fundraising total of over $50 million in the last election cycle. Slotkin, Spanberger and Porter all entered Congress in 2018 as part of a wave of female lawmakers who flipped seats and delivered House control to Democrats.

They all have set their sights on higher offices: Slotkin is running for Michigan's Senate seat, Spanberger is running for Virginia governor next year, while Porter fell short in a bid for Senate earlier this year.

Meanwhile, Kildee decided not to run for a sixth term after a bout with cancer last year.

Here's how the races to replace them are playing out:

Central Michigan has been represented by either Kildee or his uncle, former Rep. Dale Kildee, for almost five decades. And Kildee said it's important to him that he hands his seat off to a Democrat.

""It's a lot easier to leave knowing we have a chance to hold the seat,"" he said.

But Paul Junge, a Republican who lost to Kildee in 2022, said Kildee's retirement also made his decision to run again much easier.

""Incumbency is powerful for a reason. People know the name. They feel like they know that representative,"" said Junge, who is a former prosecutor and TV anchor. ""This time I don't face that. And in fact, for me, as a second-time candidate in this district, I was reaching out to people who already knew me.""

Junge also chalks up 2022 as a difficult year for Republicans in Michigan because voters were coming out to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution as well as reelect a popular Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer. He has self-financed his campaign, pushing him towards a cash advantage this year.

So Junge has crisscrossed the district in his Ford F-150, working to win over the union members and blue-collar workers who once made Michigan a blue wall of support for Democrats, but who have slipped towards Republicans in recent years.

Still, Democrats are pointing out that Junge has spent most of his life outside the Michigan district, calling him a ""carpetbagger."" Democrat Kristen McDonald Rivet, a state senator, is talking up her working-class roots and experience raising six children in the community.

Rivet described herself as a ""moderate"" and pointed to her time in the legislature championing tax credits for families with children.

""I believe that when we're looking at policy, we have to prioritize middle-class families, working-class families,"" she said.

Rivet is also pushing Junge on abortion, pointing in TV ads to his opposition to abortion rights. Junge has responded that he would not support a federal abortion ban.

In another central Michigan race, Democrats are also tapping a state lawmaker to try to hold what is now Slotkin's seat.

""In terms of abortion, I think it will always be an incredibly important issue because it's a matter of personal freedom. That's not going to change,"" said Curtis Hertel Jr., who served four terms as a state senator before working in Whitmer's administration.

He's facing a former statehouse colleague. Tom Barrett, who previously served in the state senate, is running for the seat again after losing to Slotkin by 5 points in 2022. Barrett was heavily outspent that year, but so far has been able to keep a closer pace to Hertel's fundraising this year.

Barrett argued that a host of problems -- illegal immigration, a cost of living crisis, crime in Lansing, the district's largest city, as well as global threats -- have only grown in the last two years.

""I feel like there's unfinished business there,"" he said.

Barrett hasn't backed away from his record of supporting abortion restrictions in the statehouse, saying he is ""pro-life,"" but he also described abortion access as a settled issue in Michigan.

The closely watched House races to replace Spanberger is playing out in northern Virginia between two Army veterans and lawyers: Democrat Eugene Vindman and Republican Derrick Anderson.

Vindman, promising to work to restore abortion rights that were in place under Roe v. Wade, has proven to be a prodigious fundraiser and is on track to surpass Spanberger's 2022 totals, giving him the advantage of early advertising. He and his twin brother, Alexander Vindman, played major roles in former President Donald Trump's first impeachment.

Anderson, whose campaign did not grant an interview, is emphasizing his background in the Army special forces and trying to present a gentler profile on abortion rights and economic issues. However, Anderson, who is engaged to be married, raised eyebrows for posing with a friend's wife and three daughters in a campaign photo shoot that could be mistaken for a family photo.

On the West Coast, Republicans are trying to go on the offensive against Dave Min, the Democratic state senator whom Porter recruited to fill her seat. The GOP's super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, launched an ad this week criticizing his support for criminal justice changes in California's State Assembly.

Republican Scott Baugh, a former chair of the Orange County GOP, ticked off a list of local violent crimes, saying Democrats were to blame for an ""overall concern that we are less safe than we were four years ago.""

He was heavily outspent by Porter in 2022, but said this year the ""spending won't be quite as lopsided.""

Min pointed out that he has the endorsement of the Los Angeles police union and has a history in the State Assembly of advocating for immigrants, who make up a large portion of the district.

He also has a fundraising advantage, but said he is still campaigning with the mentality that the election ""could be decided by a few hundred votes and potentially could decide control of Congress."""

""I thought this was a wise guy coming up,"" he explained, joking that he was getting his elbow ready to fight back.

""You know I got a little bit of a yip problem here, right?"" he added to laughs, using a term familiar to golf aficionados to describe a phenomenon once blamed on performance anxiety where players suddenly lose the ability to make easy shots. ""I was all ready to start duking it out.""

It was a fleeting moment passed off as a joke. But as he returns to Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday for a rally at the site where a gunman opened fire in July, grazing his ear with a bullet, the scare underscores the lasting fallout for the candidate and his campaign even as much of the national attention has shifted to other crises.

Beyond the two attempts on his life in as many months, the former president and GOP nominee faces ongoing death threats from Iran, which has also been blamed for hacking top campaign officials and allies, exacerbating anxieties already heightened by a stepped-up security apparatus and new restrictions on how he can campaign.

Trump's allies insist he was not fundamentally changed by the gunman who fired from an unsecured roof at the rally in July or the would-be assailant in September who shoved a rifle barrel through the fence at his West Palm Beach golf course.

The picture of Trump standing, with blood streaked across his face, as he raised his fist and shouted ""Fight!"" has become the indelible image of the campaign.

""When you almost lose your life, it stays with you. It stays with him,"" said Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, a close Trump ally. ""But that doesn't change his resolve. His resolve is just as strong as it ever has been.""

Trump staffers are on edge. There have been death threats directed at his aides, and his team isn't as able to quickly organize the mass rallies that have always been the signature of his campaigns.

Armed security officers now stand guard at the campaign's Florida headquarters, and staff have been told to remain vigilant and alert.

Events have been canceled and moved around because the U.S. Secret Service lacked the resources to safely secure them. Even with the use of glass barricades to protect Trump onstage, there are concerns about holding additional rallies outdoors due to fears about drones.

Trump has accused President Joe Biden's administration of intentionally denying security resources to help Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, by preventing him from addressing large crowds.

""They couldn't give me any help. And I'm so angry about it because what they're doing is interfering in the election,"" he said in a recent Fox News interview.

U.S. Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that Trump ""is receiving heightened levels of U.S. Secret Service protection"" and that ""our top priority is mitigating risks to ensure his continued safety at all times."" Biden expressed concern for Trump after both assassination attempts, saying in September, ""Thank God the president is OK.""

Trump also now travels with a larger security footprint, with new traffic restrictions outside his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, and a line of dump trucks and big guns on display outside Trump Tower in New York when he's staying there.

As reporters filed into his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for a press conference this summer, guests -- including a little girl wearing a red, white and blue bathing suit -- were forced to exit their cars and go through airport-style metal detectors as their vehicles were searched for bombs.

Trump's campaign last week was briefed on continued threats from Iran in presumed retaliation for his administration's killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran's leaders to vow revenge. In August, a Pakistani man alleged to have links to Iran was charged in a plot to carry out political assassinations on U.S. soil. Law enforcement did not name the targets of the alleged plot, but legal filings suggest Trump was a potential target.

Iranian hackers have also been charged with stealing information from Trump's campaign and trying to pass it along to news organizations. In May, prosecutors say, the men charged began trying to penetrate the Trump campaign, successfully breaking into the email accounts of campaign officials and other Trump allies. They then sought to ""weaponize"" the stolen campaign material by sending unsolicited emails to people associated with Biden's campaign. None of the recipients who worked for Biden responded.

The cyberattacks have forced some staff to change their email addresses and others to be wary of communicating online.

Trump already faced unprecedented legal jeopardy for a presidential candidate, with four criminal indictments -- one resulting in a felony conviction with sentencing delayed until after the election, one case dismissed, and two pending -- along with civil lawsuits that carry hundreds of millions of dollars in potential penalties.

""I think that from our perspective, just from the campaign standpoint, operationally, if there's one group of people that can handle something like this thrown in their lap, it's the team that Donald Trump assembled to run this campaign, just based on everything we've had to deal with, whether it's lawsuits to keep him off the ballot, to indictments, to assassination attempts,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said.

As for Trump, he speaks more often publicly of divine intervention, musing that God saved him in order to save the country. He also often says that assailants only go after consequential presidents.

""Obviously, when you come within a half an inch of a very different outcome, that's going to impact you,"" said New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, another ally who said she spoke to Trump the morning after the Butler shooting.

""Of course, those moments really make you consider a higher power, why you are so committed to helping save this country,"" she said. ""I think it has further empowered and energized President Trump.""

Trump was recently asked by NewsNation if he's concerned about his safety ahead of his return to Butler. ""Well, I'm always worried,"" he responded.

""I'm going back to Butler because I feel I have an obligation to go back to Butler. We never finished what we were supposed to do,"" he said. ""And I said that, when I was shot, I said, we're coming back. We're going to come back. And I'm fulfilling a promise; I'm fulfilling really an obligation.""

His most loyal supporters at his rallies, including the one on Long Island where he joked about the ""yips,"" haven't been dissuaded from seeing him in person.

""I know some people are scared to come, but I'm not,"" said Eileen Deighan, 63, a nurse from nearby Yonkers, New York, who said she was inspired by Trump's decision to keep on campaigning given the threats.

""The fact that he didn't give up, he's willing to fight for our country, how could you not support that?' she asked. ""That will that he has -- doesn't give up. It's very contagious.""

Trump told his supporters at a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday that he would continue fighting ""no matter what obstacles and dangers are thrown on our path."" But he had another point to make.

""I tell you what, I had a good life before I did this,"" he said. ""Nobody was shooting at me. I had a hell of a life.""

Trump and the federal election case against him: Key passages from prosecutors' latest court filing,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-election-interference-2020-pence-capitol-riot-c6b616ad45a33f4614cd73e9b77ea0cd,2024-10-03T19:13:07Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump ""laid the groundwork for his crimes"" well before Election Day in 2020. He said ""the details don't matter"" when told his election fraud claims would fail in court. And his response to learning that then-Vice President Mike Pence was taken to a secure location as rioters stormed the Capitol?

""So what?""

That's according to a 165-page court filing from special counsel Jack Smith's team that paints a portrait of a president so desperate to cling to power that he ""resorted to crimes"" after losing the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden.

The filing unsealed Wednesday provides a glimpse into the evidence and testimony prosecutors plan to present if the case accusing Trump of an illegal scheme to overturn the 2020 election ever reaches trial.

The Republican presidential nominee has maintained that he did nothing illegal and has characterized the case as an attempt to hurt his bid to reclaim the White House in November. Trump's lawyers who have pushed to dismiss the case will now get a chance to respond in court to prosecutors' claims.

Here are some of the key passages from the filing:

Prosecutors allege Trump started laying the foundation for his illegal scheme well before election day, refusing to say in the months leading up to it whether he would accept the results and suggesting he could only lose if there was fraud.

Three days before the election, a Trump political adviser told a group of supporters that the then-president was ""going to declare himself the winner"" no matter the outcome,"" according to prosecutors.

""That doesn't mean he's the winner, he's just going to say he's the winner,"" the adviser said.

Trump ""did exactly that"" immediately following the election, prosecutors said. Then, in the days following the election, Trump's allies ""sought to create chaos"" at polling places where votes were still being counted, Smith's team alleges.

When a campaign employee was told about a batch of votes in Detroit that appeared to be heavily in favor of President Joe Biden, the employee told a colleague to ""find a reason"" that wasn't right and ""give me options to file litigation.""

When the colleague suggested there would be unrest, the campaign employee responded: ""Make them riot"" and ""Do it!!!"" according to the filing.

Prosecutors are trying to show that Trump knew his election fraud claims were bogus because many in his circle told him that there was no fraud and that he actually lost the election. Prosecutors say Trump disregarded those assurances just like he disregarded ""dozens of court decisions that unanimously rejected his and his allies' legal claims.""

In one key moment detailed in the filing, prosecutors say a lawyer who represented Trump during his first impeachment trial told Trump that his election fraud claims wouldn't survive in court. Trump responded: ""The details don't matter,"" according to prosecutors.

Prosecutors say they will introduce evidence that shows Trump and his allies ""made up figures from whole cloth"" about election fraud, detailing how they repeatedly changed their baseless claims on the numbers of noncitizens voting in Arizona.

One of the most illuminating sections of the filing details the relentless pressure campaign that Trump and his allies enlisted against Pence, beginning well before Election Day and running up to the final minutes of the Jan. 6, 2021, certification of President Joe Biden's win.

Even as most of the details of the former president's futile attempts to get his running mate to reject Biden's electoral votes have been well documented, Smith's latest brief gives an even more granular look at the breakdown between the two men as prosecutors say one sought desperately to cling on to power and the other fought to maintain his unwavering fidelity to the Constitution.

When news organizations, including The Associated Press, called the election for Biden on Nov. 7, Pence saw it as an opportunity to ""encourage"" Trump ""as a friend,"" reminding him that he ""took a dying political party and gave it a new lease on life,"" prosecutors wrote. A few days later, when Trump and his allies were still strategizing ways to overcome the defeat, Pence again reiterated that the next presidential election in 2024 was ""not so far off.""

When Pence refused on Dec. 28 to support the various legal cases being pursued by Trump and his close allies in Congress, the filing states that Trump told his vice president that ""hundreds of thousands"" of people ""are gonna hate your guts"" and ""people are gonna think you're stupid."" He added, ""You're too honest.""

This went on for days, until the two men met in person one last time before Jan. 6. The meeting in the Oval Office on the eve of the certification is seen by prosecutors as one of Trump's last efforts to encourage Pence privately to keep him in power, telling him once again that he had ""the power to decertify,"" the results. ""When Pence was unmoved, the defendant threatened to criticize him publicly,"" the filing states. ""I'm gonna have to say you did a great disservice,"" Trump said. Pence relayed this comment to a member of his team who saw it as a direct threat ""to the point that he alerted Pence's Secret Service detail.

As Trump's supporters began attacking the Capitol on Jan. 6 to stop the counting of the electoral votes, an aide rushed in to tell Trump that Pence had been taken to a secure location. The aide was hoping Trump would ""take action to secure Trump's safety,"" prosecutors wrote. Instead, Trump's only response was: ""So what?"" prosecutors allege.

Prosecutors say they will present ""forensic evidence"" from Trump's cellphone and testimony from witnesses to show how Trump spent the afternoon of Jan. 6 on Twitter and watching TV coverage of the riot while his aides pressed him to make a public statement to quell the violence.

""Instead, the defendant refused repeatedly until his advisors gave up and left him alone in the dining room,"" prosecutors wrote.

Alone in the dining room, Trump then sent a Tweet attacking Pence for not having the ""courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify.""

A rioter with a bullhorn read Trump's Tweet about Pence to the crowd that was trying to enter the Capitol, prosecutors said. It was only after advisers again urged Trump to do something about the riot that he sent a Tweet encouraging his supporters to support law enforcement and ""stay peaceful,"" prosecutors wrote."
"Trump's campaign says he raised $160 million in September, ended month with $283 million banked",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-september-fundraising-election-cdb8e12c67c2881d50c159401010e4fa,2024-10-03T18:59:11Z,"PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump raised $160 million for his campaign in September and entered October with $283 million in the bank for the campaign's final sprint, his aides announced.

The September fundraising figure, which Trump's campaign released on Wednesday, is up from the $130 million he reported raising in August. It covers money raised by Trump's campaign and affiliated committees.

Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic rival, has not yet released her fundraising numbers for the full month, but numbers previously released suggest she'll exceeded Trump's haul.

Harris aides have said she raised $55 million during a fundraising swing through California last weekend alone, which included stops in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The prior weekend, she raised $27 million at a packed New York City fundraiser, which was at the time her largest fundraising haul since she took over at the top of the ticket from President Joe Biden, according to a Harris campaign aide.

Trump has proven to be a prolific fundraiser, but the newness of Harris' bid has prompted a boost in cash from Democratic donors.

Though Harris has far more money than Trump, the former president is getting a boost from pricey advertising by deep-pocketed outside groups that support him

""These supporters have allowed us to bank the funds we need as we move into the campaign's final weeks,"" Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign senior adviser, said in a statement. ""Our momentum continues to grow from supporters and donors across the country as we enter the homestretch toward victory."""
What's next after prosecutors reveal new evidence in Trump's 2020 election interference case,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-capitol-riot-jack-smith-jan-6-e687b91aa27df9f985580c122c5ef34c,2024-10-03T18:59:03Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Special counsel Jack Smith has provided a road map for how prosecutors hope to prove their case charging former President Donald Trump with an illegal scheme to overturn his 2020 election loss -- if it ever gets to trial.

In court papers unsealed Wednesday, Smith's team details new evidence of Trump's ""increasingly desperate"" efforts to cling to power even as those close to him sought to convince him that he had lost the presidency.

It comes just over a month before the presidential election that could determine the future of the case.

The Republican presidential nominee, who has railed against the case as politically motivated, slammed the filing in a NewsNation interview, calling it ""pure election interference"" and ""weaponization of the government.""

Here's a look at what the filing means and what's next:

The purpose of the filing is to convince U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington that allegations against Trump can move forward to trial even after the Supreme Court in July ruled that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.

While the Supreme Court said former presidents have at least presumptive immunity for actions taken in their official role as president, the justices said they are not shielded from prosecution for things they do in their private capacity.

Smith's team is trying to make the case that Trump's prosecution is not off limits because he was acting as a private candidate for office -- not a commander in chief -- when he schemed to overturn the will of voters. Prosecutors say Trump ""must stand trial for his private crimes as would any other citizen.""

""Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one,"" prosecutors wrote.

""Working with a team of private co-conspirators, the defendant acted as a candidate when he pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt, through fraud and deceit, the government function by which votes are collected and counted -- a function in which the defendant, as President, had no official role.""

The case was supposed to go to trial in March in Washington's federal court but was put on hold last December so Trump could appeal his sweeping claims of presidential immunity. Trump had asked the Supreme Court to dismiss the case entirely, saying it the ""Presidency itself cannot retain its vital independence, if the President faces criminal prosecution for official acts once he leaves office.""

While the Supreme Court didn't dismiss the case, it effectively stripped from the indictment allegations involving Trump's dealings with the Justice Department. And it sent the case back to Chutkan to determine which of the remaining allegations in the indictment involve official actions for which Trump may be immune from prosecution and which allegations, if any, can move forward to trial.

In August, Smith's team filed a new indictment that kept the same criminal charges but narrowed the allegations in an attempt to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling.

Trump's lawyers had objected to the filing, accusing prosecutors of wanting to publicize their ""politically motivated manifesto"" to hurt Trump's campaign in the final weeks before the election.

The defense will now get a chance to respond to the arguments from Smith's team. Trump's response is due later this month, but his lawyers on Tuesday evening asked for a five-week extension to file by Nov. 21.

Trump's lawyers have argued that the allegations in the indictment -- including conversations with his vice president and pressing state officials on the administration of elections -- cut to the core of Trump's responsibilities as commander in chief. Trump attorney John Lauro told the judge during a hearing last month that the Supreme Court's opinion required the outright dismissal of the case -- a position the judge made clear she did not accept.

Even if the judge agrees with prosecutors, the case isn't heading to trial anytime soon. Her rulings are expected to be appealed -- likely all the way to the Supreme Court.

And if Trump defeats Biden, he could appoint an attorney general who would seek the dismissal of this case and the other federal prosecutions he faces. Or Trump could potentially order a pardon for himself.

The filing gives Democrats new material to use as they campaign against Trump and offers voters a reminder of the allegations just a month out from Election Day, even as voting has already begun in some states.

Trump, too, has seized on the report, casting it as yet another effort by his rivals to try to hobble his campaign -- complaints that have proven a powerful motivator for his base and a boon for his fundraising.

It's unclear, though, what impact it will have on voters, given the wealth of detail about the 2020 campaign that has already been released as well as Trump's multiple indictments. In polling, concerns about protecting democracy have typically lagged behind concerns about issues like the economy and inflation.

That includes a recent CNN poll that found 4 in 10 likely voters said the economy was their most important issue when deciding how to vote, versus about 2 in 10 who said it was protecting democracy.

The issue of protecting democracy appears to be more important for Democrats and voters already backing Harris. Roughly 4 in 10 voters who support Harris say it is their top issue. For Republicans and Trump supporters, about 6 in 10 name the economy as their top voting issue, followed by immigration. Just 5% of Trump supporters said protecting democracy was their top issue.

Wisconsin Department of Justice investigating mayor's removal of ballot drop box,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-wausau-mayor-absentee-drop-box-ballot-90d8de15577a457eeea1d2814ae4f093,2024-10-03T18:56:34Z,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- The Wisconsin Department of Justice confirmed Thursday that its criminal investigators are looking into the removal of Wausau's only absentee ballot drop box by the mayor last month.

The Marathon County district attorney had asked for assistance from DOJ about the incident in the small city about 200 miles northwest of Milwaukee. The department's Division of Criminal Investigation will take the lead, said the agency's spokesperson Gillian Drummond.

Mayor Doug Diny removed the city's drop box on Sept. 22 without consulting with the clerk, who has the authority under a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling to make one available. They are not mandatory in the state.

Diny, who ran as a conservative and opponent of drop boxes in the nonpartisan mayor's race, has said he wanted the city council to discuss whether to use a drop box. The council is scheduled to discuss the issue at a meeting Tuesday.

The mayor turned the box back over to the clerk, who had it installed and bolted to the ground on Monday.

The box was locked and no ballots were in it when the mayor took it. City workers planned to bolt it to the ground but did not have a chance to do it before the mayor, wearing a hard hat and posing for pictures he later distributed, wheeled it away.

The mayor insists he did nothing wrong. Drop box supporters are calling for a federal investigation, saying Diny broke federal law by interfering with the right to vote.

More than 60 towns, villages and cities in nine counties have opted out of using the boxes for the presidential election in November, according to a tally by the group All Voting is Local. Drop boxes are being embraced in heavily Democratic cities, including Milwaukee and Madison.

Wausau, with about 40,000 people, was among the cities that did not use an absentee drop box in the August state primary. Wausau is located in Marathon County, which Republican former President Donald Trump won by 18 points in both 2016 and 2020."
"Melania Trump says she supports abortion rights, putting her at odds with the GOP",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/melania-trump-harris-abortion-election-2024-vance-walz-a9a44cf9d3113eb55e8c4346c7e1fe59,2024-10-03T18:10:42Z,"CHICAGO (AP) -- Melania Trump revealed her support for abortion rights Thursday ahead of the release of her upcoming memoir, exposing a stark contrast with her husband, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, on the crucial election issue.

In a video posted to her X account Thursday morning, the former first lady defended women's ""individual freedoms"" to do what they want with their body -- a position at odds with much of the Republican Party and her own husband, who has struggled to find a consistent message on abortion while wedged between anti-abortion supporters within his base and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights.

""Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard,"" she said in the video. ""Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom. What does 'my body, my choice' really mean?""

The video appears to confirm excerpts of her self-titled memoir reported by The Guardian on Wednesday.

Melania Trump has rarely publicly expressed her personal political views and has been largely absent from the campaign trail. But in her memoir, set to be released publicly next Tuesday, she argues that the decision to end a pregnancy should be left to a woman and her doctor, ""free from any intervention of pressure from the government,"" according to the published excerpts.

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?"" she wrote, according to The Guardian. ""A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.""

Melania Trump writes that she has ""carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

These views contrast sharply with the GOP's anti-abortion platform and with Donald Trump, who has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade and boasted about returning the abortion question to the states. Democrats have blamed the former president for the severe deterioration of reproductive rights as abortion bans were implemented in large swaths of the country following the overturning of the landmark case, which had granted a constitutional right to abortion.

Vice President Kamala Harris ' campaign noted Trump's role in ending Roe v. Wade in a statement reacting to Melania Trump's defense of abortion rights.

""Sadly for the women across America, Mrs. Trump's husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump Abortion Ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives,"" Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. ""Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear: If he wins in November, he will ban abortion nationwide, punish women, and restrict women's access to reproductive health care.""

Donald Trump on Tuesday said he would veto a federal abortion ban, the first time he has explicitly said so after previously refusing to answer questions on the subject. Abortion rights advocates are skeptical, however, saying Trump cannot be trusted not to restrict reproductive rights.

Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment Thursday about Melania Trump's book or video.

Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said the memoir is another example of ""the Trumps playing voters like a fiddle.""

""As president, (Trump) made it his mission to get Roe v. Wade overturned,"" she said in a statement. ""Melania stood by him, never once publicly disavowing his actions until weeks before an election where our bodies are again on the ballot and they are losing voters to this issue. Read between the lines.""

Democratic strategist Brittany Crampsie called the memoir's release a ""clear attempt to appeal to more moderate voters and to moderate JD Vance's very clearly extreme views on the issue."" But she is skeptical that the move would work in favor of Trump, saying his shifting views ""have already confused voters and sowed distrust.""

Melania Trump also defends abortions later in pregnancy, asserting that ""most abortions conducted during the later stages of pregnancy were the result of severe fetal abnormalities that probably would have led to the death or stillbirth of the child. Perhaps even the death of the mother.""

""These cases were extremely rare and typically occurred after several consultations between the woman and her doctor,"" she writes.

These views appear diametrically opposed to her husband, who has often parroted misinformation about abortions later in pregnancy, falsely claiming that Democrats support abortion ""after birth,"" though infanticide is outlawed in every state.

Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law who focuses on reproductive rights law and history, said it is unclear if the memoir's release so close to the election was an attempt to help Donald Trump. But she did note that Melania Trump's split from Trump on the issue is not uncommon historically.

There is ""a pretty deep history of first ladies being more supportive of abortion rights than their husbands,"" including Betty Ford, a vocal abortion rights supporter and the wife of former President Gerald Ford, Ziegler said.

Donald Trump promoted his wife's book at a September rally in New York, calling on supporters to ""go out and get her book."" It is unclear if the former president has read the book.

""Go out and buy it,"" he told the crowd. ""It's great. And if she says bad things about me, I'll call you all up, and I'll say, 'Don't buy it.'""

The Latest: Harris campaigns in Wisconsin and Trump in Michigan in battle for 'blue wall' states,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-cheney-wisconsin-trump-michigan-14918e156095e691246bd84d5346562b,2024-10-03T15:07:12Z,"Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is opening a two-day stay in Wisconsin and Michigan, and Republican candidate Donald Trump will be in Michigan on Thursday as the two candidates grapple for wins in the ""blue wall"" battleground states, which also include Pennsylvania.

Liz Cheney, one of Trump's fiercest Republican antagonists, will join Harris at a campaign event in Wisconsin on Thursday aimed at reaching out to moderate voters and rattling the former president.

Cheney was the top Republican on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, earning Trump's disdain and effectively exiling herself from her own party.

Cheney lost her Wyoming seat to a Trump-endorsed candidate two years ago and she endorsed Harris last month. The two women will appear together in a historic white schoolhouse in Ripon, where a series of meetings held in 1854 to oppose slavery's expansion led to the birth of the Republican Party.

Harris' visit to Wisconsin comes one day after a federal judge unsealed a 165-page court filing outlining prosecutors' case against Trump for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election defeat. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and obstruction.

Harris on Friday will hold a campaign rally in Flint, Michigan, continuing her tour of states that have been critical to Democratic victories. Trump won Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan in 2016, and Joe Biden won them in 2020.

Trump on Thursday will hold a rally in Saginaw County, a bellwether in the center of the state.

The Republican candidate has ramped up his focus on Michigan, holding two rallies there less than a week ago. In 2020, Biden's win in Saginaw County by a slim 303 votes contributed to his victory in the state.

President Joe Biden said Thursday that he wasn't concerned the 2024 presidential race between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump was close

""It always gets this close,"" he said to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House on his way to visit storm-ravaged Georgia and Florida. ""She's gonna do fine,"" he said of his vice president.

Biden was also asked how Harris' running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz did in the vice presidential debate.

""The other guy lost the debate,"" Biden said. ""He misrepresented everything.""

The devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene has brought climate change to the forefront of the presidential campaign after the issue lingered on the margins for months.

Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Georgia Wednesday to see hard-hit areas, two days after her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, was in the state and criticized the federal response to the storm, which has killed at least 180 people. Thousands of people in the Carolinas still lack running water, cellphone service and electricity.

President Joe Biden toured some of the hardest-hit areas by helicopter on Wednesday. Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms and other natural disasters, traveled to the Carolinas to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation. He is expected to visit Georgia and Florida later this week."

Headliners denounced Democrat Kamala Harris -- Trump's campaign rival -- as influenced by demons and the spirit of the wicked biblical queen Jezebel.

Attendees stood and recited in unison a ""Watchman Decree,"" invoking a government that honors God and has ""righteous"" laws and ""biblical"" judicial rulings. They pledged to ""take back and permanently control"" positions of leadership in sectors such as government, business and culture.

""We break every curse against Donald Trump -- we break every satanic incantation against his presidency,"" declared the host preacher, Hank Kunneman, at the annual Opening the Heavens conference, held in mid-September at the Mid-America Center arena in Council Bluffs.

The conference is one of several of its type around the country this election year, featuring exuberant worship and speeches by influential preachers. It represents a highly politicized wing of charismatic Christianity, a larger movement that emphasizes spiritual gifts such as healings, prophecy and speaking in tongues.

As a sign of this movement's influence, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance appeared recently at a similar conference, called the Courage Tour, in Pennsylvania.

Goals for the conference included getting out the vote for Trump and his allies, and mobilizing believers to pray and take part in what's proclaimed to be a literal spiritual war surrounding the election.

""Get your butt out there and vote. Get your voice and raise it!"" declared Kunneman, who pastors Lord of Hosts Church in nearby Omaha, Nebraska, with his wife, Brenda. ""Let every devil fall. ... We push back any attempt to steal the executive office.""

The conference emerges from a movement that emphasizes authoritative direction from leaders considered to be modern-day apostles and prophets. It also incorporated Christian nationalism, a fusion of American and Christian identity.

Critics view the movement with alarm, seeing it as anti-democratic and supporting a candidate with authoritarian ambitions and incendiary rhetoric. Many of its leaders rallied behind Trump's claims that the 2020 election was stolen despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

""The attitude coming into 2024 is, 'The demons are probably going to try to steal this election again, and so we need to do spiritual warfare in advance to prevent that,'"" said Matthew Taylor, author of the new book on the movement, ""The Violent Take It By Force: The Christian Movement That Is Threatening Our Democracy.""

""It's very hard to have a pluralistic democracy,"" Taylor said, when many distrust the electoral system.

Several leaders in this movement were present at rallies in Washington protesting Biden's presidential victory before and on Jan. 6, 2021, said Taylor.

Leaders weren't among the Capitol rioters, but some issued decrees and prayers that the certification of Biden's win be blocked and Trump returned for a second term.

Such ideology ""is one of those golden threads"" in the social media feeds of many participants of the Jan. 6 rallies, said Taylor, Protestant scholar at the Baltimore-based Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies.

Headliners at the Council Bluffs conference repeatedly spoke of being in a true spiritual war, merging decrees of political victory and Christian revival.

The ""favor of the Lord"" is on Trump, said one preacher, Dutch Sheets. ""America is going to be saved, and I believe this election is a part of it.""

His brother and fellow preacher, Tim Sheets, recounted seeing a vision of a warrior angel firing an arrow that landed in front of the White House, claiming the territory for God.

""We must move into battle for the Lord,"" he said. ""The drums of spiritual war are beating.""

Preachers repeatedly denounced abortion -- one described it as an outpouring of blood craved by demons -- and the ""mutilation"" of children, as they depicted gender-affirming treatment for transgender youths.

The arena appeared a little more than half full, with thousands of attendees from multiple states. Many wore T-shirts with slogans like, ""Defender of Territory"" and ""We the People Trust Jesus,"" while several bundled up with American flag-themed fleece blankets amid chilly air conditioning.

Participants at the Council Bluffs conference, mostly but not exclusively white, aligned with the larger evangelical Christian support of Trump.

About 8 in 10 white evangelicals supported Trump in 2020, according to AP VoteCast. Pew Research Center's validated voter survey found similar support levels in 2016.

This year, about 7 in 10 white evangelical Protestants view the Republican nominee favorably, an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey found.

Behind that supermajority is a diverse evangelicalism. The charismatic exuberance and focus on the supernatural contrast in tone with the relatively restrained approach of groups such as Southern Baptists, though they have allied in their political conservatism and opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.

And the charismatic movement has its own diversity. This heavily politicized branch teaches that in the present day, God has re-established the ancient biblical roles of apostle -- an authoritative leader -- and prophet, someone issuing divine proclamations.

The movement isn't a denomination. Churches and ministries largely operate independently, even as its leaders speak at each others' conferences, endorse each others' books and appear on each others' broadcasts.

As one example of the overlap: The Opening the Heavens conference in Council Bluffs featured one segment called FlashPoint Live -- an in-person version of a television show that mixes charismatic Christianity and conservative politics. It's one of several such FlashPoint Live conferences this year, hosted by pastor Gene Bailey -- whose recent interview with Trump demonstrated the close ties between the movement and the former president.

The ReAwaken America tour, started by Trump's former national security advisor Michael Flynn, has similarly blended the political with revival-like rallies and featured members of Trump's family.

While a range of evangelicals served as Trump's faith-based advisors during his administration, charismatic leaders were especially prominent.

The apostles-and-prophets movement overlaps with two related, popular ideas: dominionism, which says Christians are to be in charge of society, and the ""Seven Mountain Mandate,"" which specifies seven areas where Christians are to lead -- politics, religion, media, business, family, education and the arts and entertainment.

Bailey led in the reciting of the Watchman Decree at Council Bluffs, which included a pledge to ""permanently control positions of influence and leadership in each of the seven mountains.""

Bailey and Kunneman declined interview requests through a media representative.

Taylor said that according to this strand of charismatic theology, Holy Spirit-filled Christians have the power not just to ask God for results but to speak them into being.

""It's not just spouting off or praying prayers,"" he said. ""They believe that they are changing reality with these Watchman Decrees.""

He added: ""It looks wild when you encounter it, but it is very popular, and it's very dangerous.""

Separate from the Council Bluffs conference organizers, but with an overlapping cast of speakers, is the Courage Tour. It's led by Lance Wallnau, who popularized the Seven Mountain concept and was an early booster of Trump's 2016 candidacy.

The tour has been held in crucial battleground states, mixing worship, prayers for miraculous healings and overt politics -- including a call for Christians to become election workers or poll watchers to ""fight the fraud"" in swing states.

Taylor said this appears to lay groundwork for a campaign to delegitimize the 2024 election results if Harris wins.

While movement leaders speak of spiritual warfare -- that is, angel vs. demon rather than human vs. human -- Taylor said such rhetoric can stoke some people into taking matters into their own hands.

He said it's no surprise that some rioters at the Capitol in 2021 were loudly praying and displaying Christian symbols.

""I really do worry that we could see a lot more political violence,"" he said.

Elections have less impact on your 401(k) than you might think,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-stocks-volatility-bonds-economy-retirement-59201a39bffd596b253021a6526a4b60,2024-10-03T10:04:57Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Much like those annoying political TV ads, the warnings come back every four years: All the uncertainty around the U.S. presidential election could have big consequences for your 401(k)!

Such warnings can raise anxiety, but remember: If your 401(k) is like many retirement savers', with most invested in funds that track the S&P 500 or other broad indexes, all the noise may not make much of a difference.

Stocks do tend to get shakier in the months leading up to Election Day. Even the bond market sees an average 15% rise in volatility from mid-September of an election year through Election Day, according to a review by Monica Guerra, a strategist at Morgan Stanley. That may partly be because financial markets hate uncertainty. In the runup to the election, uncertainty is high about what kinds of policies will win out.

But after the results come in, regardless of which party wins the White House, the uncertainty dissipates, and markets get back to work. The volatility tends to steady itself, Guerra's review shows.

More than which party controls the White House, what's mattered for stocks over the long term is where the U.S. economy is in its cycle as it moved from recession to expansion and back again through the decades.

""Over the long term, market performance is more closely correlated with the business cycle than political party control,"" Guerra wrote in a recent report.

Where the economy currently is in its cycle is up for debate. It's been growing since the 2020 recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some pessimistic investors think the expansion is near its end, with all the cumulative slowing effects of the Federal Reserve's hikes to interest rates in prior years still to be felt. Other, more optimistic investors believe the expansion may still have legs now that the Fed is cutting rates to juice the economy.

Politics may have some sway underneath the surface of stock indexes and influence which industries and sectors are doing the best. Tech and financial stocks have historically done better than the rest of the market one year after a Democratic president took office. For a Republican, meanwhile, raw-material producers were among the relative winners, according to Morgan Stanley.

Plus, control of Congress may be just as important as who wins the White House. A gridlocked Washington with split control will likely see less sweeping changes in fiscal or tax policy, no matter who the president is.

Of course, the candidates in this election do differ from history in some major ways. Former President Donald Trump is a strong proponent of tariffs, which raise the cost of imports from other countries, for example.

In a scenario where the United States applied sustained and universal tariffs, economists and strategists at UBS Global Wealth Management say U.S. stocks could fall by around 10% because the tariffs would ultimately act like a sales tax on U.S. households.

But they also see a relatively low chance of such a scenario happening, at roughly 10%."
Republican Liz Cheney to join Kamala Harris at Wisconsin campaign stop,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-cheney-wisconsin-trump-89396853e5521c3870a3c88e04cbfd99,2024-10-03T09:09:24Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former congresswoman Liz Cheney, one of Donald Trump's fiercest Republican antagonists, will join Democrat Kamala Harris at a campaign event in Wisconsin on Thursday aimed at reaching out to moderate voters and rattling the GOP nominee.

Cheney was the top Republican on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection, earning Trump's disdain and effectively exiling herself from her own party.

Cheney lost her House seat to a Trump-endorsed candidate two years ago and she endorsed Harris, the Democratic nominee, last month. The two women will appear together in a historic white schoolhouse in Ripon, where a series of meetings held in 1854 to oppose slavery's expansion led to the birth of the Republican Party.

Harris is opening a two-day stay in Wisconsin and Michigan, and Trump himself will be in Michigan on Thursday as the two candidates grapple for wins in the so-called ""blue wall"" battleground states, which also include Pennsylvania.

Harris' visit to Wisconsin comes one day after a federal judge unsealed a 165-page court filing outlining prosecutors' case against Trump for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election defeat. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and obstruction.

It's uncommon, to say the least, for a candidate to give a nod to the origins of the opposing party in the closing weeks of a presidential campaign. Not only that, the Cheney name was once anathema to Democrats who deplored Dick Cheney, Liz's father, for his role as vice president under George W. Bush.

But now both Cheneys are backing Harris, part of a cadre of current and former Republican officials who have broken with the vast majority of their party, which remains in Trump's corner. Harris wants to portray her candidacy as a patriotic choice for independent and conservative voters who were disturbed by Trump's unwillingness to cede power. Trump continues to deny his defeat with false claims of voter fraud.

Harris on Friday will hold a campaign rally in Flint, Michigan, continuing her tour of so-called ""blue wall"" states that have been critical to Democratic victories in presidential races. Trump won Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan in 2016, and Joe Biden won them in 2020.

Trump on Thursday will hold a rally in Saginaw County, a bellwether in the center of the state.

The Republican candidate has ramped up his focus on Michigan, holding two rallies there less than a week ago. In 2020, Biden's win in Saginaw County by a slim 303 votes contributed to his victory in the state.

Former Colorado county clerk Tina Peters to be sentenced for voting data scheme,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/tina-peters-colorado-clerk-election-vote-fraud-b456ce4f80dc97f4b967eb6297311a51,2024-10-03T05:22:51Z,"A former Colorado county clerk and one-time hero to election conspiracists is set to be sentenced Thursday for leading a data-breach scheme inspired by the rampant false claims that voting fraud altered the result of the 2020 presidential race.

A jury found Tina Peters guilty of most charges against her in August for orchestrating the security breach of her elections computer system.

Peters was the first election official to be charged with a security breach amid unfounded conspiracies that widespread fraud denied President Donald Trump a second term.

Peters was convicted for allowing a county security card to be misused to give a man affiliated with My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell access to the Mesa County election system and for deceiving other officials about that person's identity.

Lindell is a prominent promoter of false claims that voting machines were manipulated to steal the election from Trump.

During her trial, prosecutors said Peters was seeking fame and became fixated on voting problems after becoming involved with those who had questioned the accuracy of the presidential election results.

The breach Peters was charged of leading heightened concerns that rogue election workers sympathetic to partisan lies could use their access and knowledge to attack voting processes from within.

Peters was convicted of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state.

She was found not guilty of identity theft, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation and one count of criminal impersonation.

Peters has been unapologetic about what happened.

In a post on the social media platform X after her conviction, Peters accused Colorado-based Dominion Voting Systems, which made her county's election system, as well as lawyers for state election officials of stealing votes.

""I will continue to fight until the Truth is revealed that was not allowed to be brought during this trial. This is a sad day for our nation and the world. But we WILL win in the end,"" she said.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has called her conviction a warning that tampering with voting processes will bring consequences."
How Trump credits an immigration chart for saving his life  --  and what the chart is missing,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/immigration-trump-chart-butler-border-67866bd05a894a6bea0d670de2adc4f7,2024-10-03T04:23:46Z,"Ever since the assassination attempt at his rally in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump has professed a unique fondness for a bar chart he credits for saving his life.

Trump was addressing the crowd in Butler about illegal immigration and reviewing a chart that detailed U.S.-Mexico border crossings during his administration and President Joe Biden's term. He had his head turned to the right to review the graphic on a projection screen when the gunfire began. One bullet nicked his right ear, coming millimeters from maiming or killing him.

He has said having his head turned ""probably saved my life,"" adding at times that he loves the chart ""more than I even love the police"" and saying he will ""sleep with that chart for the rest of my life."" He has made it a recurring campaign prop and is likely to show it again when he returns to Butler on Saturday.

The chart helps the Republican presidential nominee connect an iconic moment from his 2024 campaign to his signature issue since he entered politics. It also is representative of how the Trump campaign has addressed immigration, making a strident argument for tougher border measures while erasing or misstating key parts of his record.

Here are more details about the chart and how Trump has used it along the campaign trail.

U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., said he was aboard Trump's plane in April to hitch a ride from an Easter family holiday in Florida to campaign events in the Midwest. While on the flight, Johnson showed Trump the chart, which depicts a dramatic increase in encounters with migrants at the southern border using statistics that are tallied by the U.S. Border Patrol.

Trump asked Johnson to send it to his communications team, which changed the title, description and edited some of the annotations, to begin rolling it out that same day at an event with law enforcement officers in Grand Rapids, Michigan. At that event, Trump referred to people in the U.S. illegally who are suspected of committing crimes as ""animals.""

""It's obvious what the Biden administration has done in that chart. It shows what Trump had to deal with and how he successfully dealt with it,"" Johnson said in an interview. ""And then it shows just the explosion of illegal immigration under President Biden and Vice President (Kamala) Harris.""

Border crossings hit record highs during the Biden administration but have fallen since Biden instituted a curb on asylum claims by executive order earlier this year.

The Harris campaign blames Trump for pressuring Republicans in Congress not to support a bipartisan border security package that Democrats say would have helped fix a broken immigration system.

The Border Patrol has tallied about 7.1 million arrests of people crossing illegally from Mexico from the start of the Biden administration through July, but many of those arrests were repeat crossers. Trump regularly hammers Biden and Harris for allowing record-high numbers, often claiming without evidence that the figure is upwards of 30 million.

The chart notes policies Trump instituted such as ""Remain in Mexico,"" a program that makes asylum seekers wait south of the border that Biden halted when he took office. The policies are intended to show Trump drove down border crossings during his term.

The description of the chart says ""Biden world record illegal immigrants, many from prisons and mental institutions,"" a claim Trump usually makes in rallies even though there is no evidence countries are sending their criminals or mentally ill across the border.

The graphic incorrectly identifies the month Trump left office, marking it as if it had happened during the spring of 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic prompted travel restrictions and vastly lowered the number of arrivals. Prior to the pandemic, the Trump administration struggled to manage large influxes of migrants, too.

U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia, a California Democrat, showed the chart recently at a hearing in Congress to point out this error.

""It's important to note and to point out how incorrect it actually is,"" he said, as he pointed out that border encounters had started to trend upwards in the months that followed and while Trump was still in office.

The chart also leaves out what perhaps was Trump's most controversial immigration policy. Between 2017 and 2018, border agents separated children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border in a policy that was condemned globally as inhumane and one that Trump himself halted under pressure from his own party.

Trump rarely talks about family separation. Last weekend, Trump claimed not to understand what Harris meant when she said he was responsible for taking children from their parents.

The former president has pledged to conduct the largest mass deportation operation, prioritizing migrants with criminal records. Trump has said he could rely on like-minded governors to provide National Guard support to carry out deportations.

The chart was displayed on numerous screens on stage during his Republican National Convention speech less than a week after the Butler rally.

""The last time I put up that chart, I never really got to look at it,"" he said. ""But without that chart, I would not be here today.""

Trump also took the chart on his recent border visit to Arizona, displaying it on a piece of paper as he spoke from a podium below a desert hill. He has been using it increasingly more since the assassination attempt, often retelling the story of how it saved his life.

Johnson says he is happy to have played ""a small little role.""

""Either the hand of God or just plain serendipity is why he avoided being assassinated, quite honestly,"" he said. ""That's just the historical fact now.""

He wouldn't say if Trump has mentioned anything about the chart to him since the assassination attempt. ""Those are private conversations,"" he said."
"Haunted by 2016, some Michigan Democrats worry that Harris remains ill-defined in swing state",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/michigan-democrats-harris-election-voters-46306c264cd27fa553eda0c2df55ced7,2024-10-03T04:23:26Z,"EASTPOINTE, Mich. (AP) -- Bill Clinton stood with Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell outside a suburban Detroit grocery store two days before the 2016 election when it was clear to both that Hillary Clinton would lose the state. ""They didn't listen to you,"" Dingell recalled the former president saying.

Democrats in the state have seemed ascendant since, controlling the governorship, both Senate seats and the state legislature. But some party leaders here are worried that trend is not enough to put distance between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Harris' campaign is banking on the fact that they have spent considerably more money than Trump on ads and have a stronger voter outreach program.

Michigan is a state that Harris almost certainly must win to capture the White House, and Democrats' concerns are rooted in the fear that polls don't register all Trump supporters both here and in other battleground states as the campaign enters a critical final phase.

""Anyone who's from Michigan knows that, if you believe the polling, like, I got a bridge I'm going to sell you somewhere,"" said Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin, the Democratic Senate nominee.

Dingell and others have said Harris is still relatively new to many voters and that she needs to make her plans clearer to voters. The congresswoman also said Harris needed to counter efforts by Republicans to paint her as out of touch with Michigan workers.

The state of play today? ""No one is winning this state right now,"" Dingell said.

Patrick Schuh, a veteran Michigan Democratic campaign strategist now deputy national states director for the Democratic voter outreach group America Votes, said voters they have canvassed ""are still wanting to hear more about what Harris stands for as a candidate.""

In some ways, it is simply the worrying point in a campaign, and some Michigan Republicans have concerns that mirror Harris supporters, pointing to Harris' spending edge and lack of a get-out-the-vote effort directly from the Trump campaign.

Trump and allied groups have focused in this automotive manufacturing stronghold on the false claim that Harris ""wants to end all gas-powered cars,"" as one ad that began airing this week states.

As vice president, Harris was the tie-breaking vote for the Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which includes $7,500 tax credits for new electric vehicle purchases.

In an ad airing in Detroit this week, Harris emphasized her biography as a former California attorney general and district attorney ""fighting on behalf of others.""

A complication for Harris has been opposition to the Biden administration's support for Israel in the war in the Middle East within metro Detroit, especially Dearborn, an area that is home to the nation's largest Arab American community. After months of ongoing discussions with Harris' team, communication with some Arab American leaders has stalled, according to Arab American News Publisher Osama Siblani, a prominent leader in the community. Phil Gordon, Harris' national security adviser, met virtually with some Arab and Muslim leaders on Wednesday to discuss the escalating war in the Middle East.

The death of a Dearborn resident, who Dingell and other community leaders this week said was killed in south Lebanon, has only ignited anger in the traditionally Democratic area. Kamel Ahmad Jawad's death was confirmed Wednesday by a spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council.

Harris may overcome divisions within the Democratic coalition by boosting voter turnout in Wayne County, home to Detroit, where low turnout in 2016 contributed to Clinton's loss. Black community leaders noted that excitement surged when Harris entered the race in the summer, and that some momentum continues in the majority-Black city of Eastpointe, just north of Detroit.

Canvassers knocking on doors there for Harris last week encountered several who were firmly committed to voting for her, though some undecided voters wanted to learn more.

""I just go off of what I see in the commercials, and Kamala just seems like she's more for the middle class,"" said Taneisha Stinson, a single mother for whom affordable child care is a top issue.

It's understandable for some Democrats to be nervous, given Michigan's recent narrow presidential election margins, said Amy Chapman, a Democratic strategist in Michigan. Trump won in 2016 by fewer than 11,000 votes. In 2020, Biden carried it by a little more than 154,000 votes, but only by 2.8 percentage points.

""If people are worried, they should be,"" said Chapman, who was Barack Obama's state campaign director in 2008. ""But, not in an 'oh no' way, rather in a we-have-to-work-hard way.""

Harris has not ignored pleas to compete aggressively in Michigan, as Hillary Clinton did in 2016 when she became the first Democrat to lose Michigan in 28 years.

Since entering the race on July 23, Harris' campaign and outside groups that support her candidacy have spent more than $79 million in advertising in Michigan, compared to Trump and groups supporting him which have spent more than $62 million, according to the media-tracking firm AdImpact. From Oct. 1 through Election Day, Harris and pro-Harris groups have reserved more than $40 million in Michigan ad spending, compared to $25 million for Trump's campaign and allied groups, according to the firm.

Harris' campaign also has 52 staffed campaign offices in Michigan, including three in Detroit, two in the Grand Rapids area, the state's second-largest metro area and two in vote-rich Oakland County, Detroit's more affluent northwest suburbs. Trump's campaign said they had dozens of offices across the state and in similar places.

""Democrats' financial resources absolutely dwarf anything that the Republicans have,"" said former Republican Michigan Gov. John Engler. ""But Trump is making stops in locations that have never had presidential visits before, and those are impactful with margins this close.""

Due, in part, to an abbreviated campaign, Harris has visited Michigan three times, with a fourth stop planned for Friday in Flint. In contrast, Trump has made 11 visits to the state, with a 12th planned Thursday in Saginaw. His stops have spread across various regions, while Harris' efforts have largely focused on the Detroit area.

Public polling, along with insights from campaign operatives in both major parties, indicates that neither candidate holds a clear advantage. On a call with donors this week, Slotkin said her campaign's polling showed Harris ""underwater"" in the state, a synonym for trailing. Her comments to donors were first reported by Axios.

Slotkin dismissed the term as ""just an expression that this is an exceptionally close race,"" when asked to clarify her remark.

Still, the scenario isn't what Democratic activist Lori Goldman expected after the party's enthusiasm spiked with Harris' July entry into the race.

""What did we see? Money coming in like crazy. Everybody was excited. There was such a bump,"" said Goldman, who founded Fems for Dems, a leading Michigan Democratic voter outreach group based in Oakland County. ""And now, you know, it's neck and neck.""

""It is PTSD,"" Goldman said.

Goldman was referring to what Dingell remembers as the outcome of her unheeded warnings in 2016. The Democratic nominee campaigned in Michigan only four times from June through the election. Instead, she focused more on Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, all of which she also lost.

Polls that showed Clinton ahead in Michigan, said Michigan Democratic strategist Adrian Hemond, as others did at the time, did not accurately reflect Trump's support in the state.

""Smart Democrats have a healthy sense of paranoia,"" Hemond said. ""If polling is as far off as it was in 2016, we're cooked."""
"Casey, McCormick to meet for first debate in Pennsylvania's battleground Senate race",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-senate-debate-casey-mccormick-89f4120ac553b31d778523dc699d5771,2024-10-03T04:22:51Z,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Republican challenger David McCormick will meet Thursday night for their first debate in an expensive race for a swing-state seat that could help determine control of the Senate in November's election.

Casey, perhaps Pennsylvania's best-known politician, is seeking a fourth term and is facing what he calls his toughest reelection challenge yet.

Casey, 64, is a staunch ally of labor unions, a former state auditor general and treasurer and Pennsylvania's longest-serving Democrat in the Senate. He has campaigned on preserving the middle class, abortion rights, labor rights and voting rights, and calls McCormick and former President Donald Trump a threat to all those.

McCormick, 59, is making his second run for the Senate after losing narrowly to Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022's Republican primary. He is a former hedge fund CEO who served at the highest levels of former President George W. Bush's administration and sat on Trump's Defense Advisory Board.

He has accused Casey of rubber-stamping Biden administration policies on immigration, the economy, energy and national security that he blames for inflation, domestic turmoil and war. He also has attacked Casey as out of touch after being in elected office for almost three decades.

Casey, in turn, has attacked McCormick as a carpetbagger from Connecticut's ritzy "" Gold Coast "" who got rich at the expense of others while an executive at a hedge fund there.

Casey has been a key player for Democrats trying to reframe the election-year narrative about the economy by attacking ""greedflation"" -- a blunt term for corporations jacking up prices and ripping off shoppers to maximize profits -- as fast-rising prices opened a big soft spot in 2024 for Democrats.

McCormick, meanwhile, has made a bid for Jewish voters by traveling to the Israel-Gaza border, speaking to Jewish audiences across the state and arguing that Casey and the Biden administration have not fought antisemitism or backed Israel strongly enough in the Israel-Hamas war.

Democrats currently hold a Senate majority by the narrowest of margins but face a difficult 2024 Senate map. A Casey loss could guarantee Republican control of the Senate.

More than $150 million has been spent on the race so far, according to Federal Election Commission records, and the total is on track to exceed $300 million, based on campaign ad tracking by AdImpact, which includes spots reserved between now and Election Day.

The 60-minute debate will air on TV starting at 8 p.m. across Pennsylvania and stream live online. The debate is being hosted by WHTM-TV in Harrisburg.

The candidates have agreed to another debate, to be held at a Philadelphia TV station Oct. 15.

Both Casey and McCormick were uncontested for their party's nominations in the primary election.

Also on the Nov. 5 Senate ballot are John Thomas of the Libertarian Party, Leila Hazou of the Green Party and Marty Selker of the Constitution Party. They were not invited to the debate."
Hurricane Helene brings climate change to forefront of the presidential campaign,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/helene-climate-walz-vance-debate-harris-trump-e1023e209548db8ec587115505c9797f,2024-10-03T04:05:58Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene has brought climate change to the forefront of the presidential campaign after the issue lingered on the margins for months.

Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Georgia Wednesday to see hard-hit areas, two days after her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, was in the state and criticized the federal response to the storm, which has killed at least 178 people. Thousands of people in the Carolinas still lack running water, cellphone service and electricity.

President Joe Biden toured some of the hardest-hit areas by helicopter on Wednesday. Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms and other natural disasters, traveled to the Carolinas to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation. He is expected to visit Georgia and Florida later this week.

""Storms are getting stronger and stronger,"" Biden said after surveying damage near Asheville, North Carolina. At least 70 people died in the state.

""Nobody can deny the impact of the climate crisis any more,'' Biden said at a briefing in Raleigh, the state capital. ""They must be brain dead if they do.""

Harris, meanwhile, hugged and huddled with a family in hurricane-ravaged Augusta, Georgia.

""There is real pain and trauma that resulted because of this hurricane'' and its aftermath, Harris said outside a storm-damaged house with downed trees in the yard.

""We are here for the long haul,'' she added.

The focus on the storm -- and its link to climate change -- was notable after climate change was only lightly mentioned in two presidential debates this year. The candidates instead focused on abortion rights, the economy, immigration and other issues.

The hurricane featured prominently in Tuesday's vice presidential debate as Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz were asked about the storm and the larger issue of climate change.

Both men called the hurricane a tragedy and agreed on the need for a strong federal response. But it was Walz, the governor of Minnesota, who put the storm in the context of a warming climate.

""There's no doubt this thing roared onto the scene faster and stronger than anything we've seen,"" he said.

Bob Henson, a meteorologist and writer with Yale Climate Connections, said it was no surprise that Helene is pushing both the federal disaster response and human-caused climate change into the campaign conversation.

""Weather disasters are often overlooked as a factor in big elections,'' he said. ""Helene is a sprawling catastrophe, affecting millions of Americans. And it dovetails with several well-established links between hurricanes and climate change, including rapid intensification and intensified downpours.""

More than 40 trillion gallons of rain drenched the Southeast in the last week, an amount that if concentrated in North Carolina would cover the state in 3 1/2 feet of water. ""That's an astronomical amount of precipitation,"" said Ed Clark, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

During Tuesday's debate, Walz credited Vance for past statements acknowledging that climate change is a problem. But he noted that Trump has called climate change ""a hoax"" and joked that rising seas ""would make more beachfront property to be able to invest in.''

Trump said in a speech Tuesday that ""the planet has actually gotten little bit cooler recently,"" adding: ""Climate change covers everything.""

In fact, summer 2024 sweltered to Earth's hottest on record, making it likely this year will end up as the warmest humanity has measured, according to the European climate service Copernicus. Global records were shattered just last year as human-caused climate change, with a temporary boost from an El Niño, keeps dialing up temperatures and extreme weather, scientists said.

Vance, an Ohio senator, said he and Trump support clean air, clean water and ""want the environment to be cleaner and safer."" However, during Trump's four years in office, he took a series of actions to roll back more than 100 environmental regulations.

Vance sidestepped a question about whether he agrees with Trump's statement that climate change is a hoax. ""What the president has said is that if the Democrats -- in particular Kamala Harris and her leadership -- really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America. And that's not what they're doing,"" he said.

""This idea that carbon (dioxide) emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So we're not arguing about weird science. If you believe that, what would you want to do?"" Vance asked.

The answer, he said, is to ""produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.''

Vance claimed that policies by Biden and Harris actually help China, because many solar panels, lithium-ion batteries and other materials used in renewable energy and electric vehicles are made in China and imported to the United States.

Walz rebutted that claim, noting that the Inflation Reduction Act, the Democrats' signature climate law approved in 2022, includes the largest-ever investment in domestic clean energy production. The law, for which Harris cast the deciding vote, has created 200,000 jobs across the country, including in Ohio and Minnesota, Walz said. Vance was not in the Senate when the law was approved.

""We are producing more natural gas and more oil (in the United States) than we ever have,"" Walz said. ""We're also producing more clean energy.""

The comment echoed a remark by Harris in last month's presidential debate. The Biden-Harris administration has overseen ""the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil,"" Harris said then.

While Biden rarely mentions it, domestic fossil fuel production under his administration is at an all-time high. Crude oil production averaged 12.9 million barrels a day last year, eclipsing a previous record set in 2019 under Trump, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Democrats want to continue investments in renewable energy such as wind and solar power -- and not just because supporters of the Green New Deal want that, Walz said.

""My farmers know climate change is real. They've seen 500-year droughts, 500-year floods back to back. But what they're doing is adapting,'' he said.

""The solution for us is to continue to move forward, (accept) that climate change is real"" and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, Walz said, adding that the administration is doing exactly that.

""We are seeing us becoming an energy superpower for the future, not just the current'' time, he said.

Kaine and Cao face off in only debate of campaign for US Senate seat from Virginia,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/virginia-senate-debate-kaine-cao-7371d70b8969bef41c070be7259502a7,2024-10-03T02:18:51Z,"The hourlong showdown at Norfolk State University mostly traced the contours of the nation's political fault lines. But it also included matters that resonate in Virginia and the coastal city of Norfolk, which is home to the country's largest Navy base.

Cao, a 25-year Navy veteran, criticized COVID vaccine mandates for service members and the chaotic troop withdrawal from Afghanistan when asked about the military's collective failure to recently meet recruiting goals. He also criticized diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.

""When you're using a drag queen to recruit for the Navy, that's not the people we want,"" Cao said. ""What we need is alpha males and alpha females who are going to rip out their own guts, eat them and ask for seconds. Those are the young men and women that are going to win wars.""

Kaine, who is on the Senate Armed Services Committee, responded by saying that railing at DEI ""is a red herring"" and the real challenge is informing more Americans about the benefits of the military when only about 1% of the population serves in the armed forces.

""We need to do a better job of talking about the G.I. Bill and other benefits as well as the tremendous leadership training that you get in the military,"" Kaine said.

Another subject was former President Donald Trump's proposal to place more tariffs on imported goods.

""What we need to do is not tax our industry here,"" Cao said. ""What we need to do is tax other countries bringing in goods.""

Kaine criticized Trump's proposal.

""The Trump tariffs would be a massive tax that would cause prices on all of these items that are imported to go up,"" Kaine said. ""On that, I differ strongly from my opponent.""

Asked whether he would support mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, Cao did not answer directly but said: ""If you came here illegally, you've basically screwed up the whole system.""

Cao, whose family fled Vietnam in the 1970s, said they waited seven years for their naturalization papers.

""You can't jump the line,"" Cao said. ""I mean, you go to Costco and jump the line, what do you think is going to happen? You can't come here and expect the American dream if you're not willing to obey the American laws and embrace the American culture.""

Kaine said he has never supported amnesty for immigrants who are in the country illegally but mass deportation would ""devastate the economy.""

Kaine also criticized Republicans and Trump for failing to pass stronger border security laws.

""We recently negotiated a very tough border deal that would have put a lot of resources on the border to stop illegal immigration,"" Kaine said. ""President Trump asked for Republicans to oppose it, even though it was supported by the border control union.""

With Kaine's seat considered solidly Democratic, the race has not seen the kind of dead-heat polling as the national presidential contest or the high stakes drama of other Senate races such as those in Montana and Ohio, where Democratic incumbents face tough re-election bids.

Trump has endorsed Cao. And political scientists say his path to victory is narrow given Virginia's moderate electorate, aversion to Trump in 2020 and Kaine's salience with voters.

Kaine won his last race in 2018 by 16 percentage points, although he said he was preparing for a tough race this year. The most recent Republican from Virginia to hold a U.S. Senate seat was the late John Warner, a centrist with an independent streak who last won in 2002.

Republicans can still win statewide offices in Virginia, however: Glenn Youngkin was elected governor by two points in 2021, along with a Republican lieutenant governor and attorney general."
Virginia House candidates debate abortion and affordability as congressional election nears,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/derrick-anderson-eugene-vindman-congress-election-virginia-9eb610dfc95d6e18cad17a5d19518416,2024-10-03T01:11:02Z,"FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Nearly a month before election day, Republican Derrick Anderson and Democrat Yevgeny ""Eugene"" Vindman attempted to portray themselves as the candidate best fit for Congress on Wednesday in what is shaping up to be Virginia's most competitive race.

Anderson, a former Army Green beret native of the state's 7th District, touted his local roots and military service, stressing his desire to represent his community and continue his public service endeavors.

Vindman, an Army veteran who rose to national prominence after contributing to President Donald Trump's first impeachment alongside his brother, argued that he would be a fierce defender against Republican extremism in Congress.

In a roughly hourlong debate hosted by the University of Mary Washington, the candidates blasted each other's actions on the campaign trail. Anderson accused Vindman of lying about his military rank and combat experience. Vindman was promoted to colonel, but he retired before being eligible to retain the rank.

""He's lied about being a colonel -- he's not a colonel,"" Anderson said, later adding: ""My opponent said that he used weapons of war in combat when knows very well he did not.""

Vindman, in turn, flamed Anderson for ""trying to fool the voters in the district about his fake family,"" referencing a photo reported by the New York Times of Anderson standing to a woman and her three daughters. Anderson's campaign said Wednesday that he never claimed the women in the photo were his family, and that Anderson has often posted photos with his actual family.

""If you're going to portray yourself as a family man so people like you, how can you be trusted on more serious topics?"" Vindman said.

The rebukes are some of the latest jabs Vindman and Anderson have made in their battle to win the House seat, which became open after Democratic incumbent Rep. Abigail Spanberger filed to run for Virginia governor and declined to seek reelection.

Home to some of the fastest-growing counties in Virginia, the congressional district ranges from outer-ring D.C. suburbs to the rural piedmont of central Virginia. Experts say the election could be critical in determining which party will clinch a House majority. According to the Virginia Public Access Project, Anderson had raised $1.4 million,and Vindman nearly $7.5 million throughout their campaigns.

Over the course of the debate, Anderson focused on the economy, criticizing President Joe Biden's economic policies and the lack of affordability in Virginia.

""Are you better off than you were four years ago today?"" Anderson said. ""I would say the answer is 'No.' ""

Vindman emphasized his pledge to protect abortion rights and fend off Republican extremism, making reference to Project 2025, a detailed blueprint for governing in the next Republican administration.

He referenced his daughter, who he argued had fewer rights than the generations of women before her.

Supporters of candidates clapped, cheered, booed and heckled at the candidates throughout the debate. At one point, the moderator told the crowd: ""Your job is to be an audience member, not a candidate.""

Before the event, supporters gathered on the university campus, waving signs and donning candidate T-shirts."
Man who was mad about Chinese spy balloon is convicted of threatening former Speaker McCarthy,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/kevin-mccarthy-threatened-spy-balloon-6867ca228308bbf38b6aeaa81ee3b321,2024-10-02T23:52:52Z,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) -- A Montana man was convicted Wednesday of threatening to assault former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy after becoming upset that the government had not shot down a Chinese spy balloon that floated over his home city.

Richard Rogers, 45, of Billings, delivered the threat to a McCarthy staffer during a series of more than 100 calls to the speaker's office in just 75 minutes on Feb. 3, 2023, prosecutors said. That was one day after the Pentagon acknowledged it was tracking the spy balloon, which was later shot down off the Atlantic Coast.

The 12-person federal jury also found Rogers guilty on two counts of making harassing telephone calls: the ones to McCarthy's office plus 150 calls he made to an FBI tip line in 2021 and 2022.

Rogers routinely made vulgar and obscene comments in those calls.

Sentencing was set for January 31. He faces up to six years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the conviction for threatening to harm a member of Congress, and the other two counts each carry a maximum penalty of two years and a $250,000 fine.

Threats against public officials in the U.S. have risen sharply in recent years, including against members of Congress and their spouses, election workers and local elected officials. Rogers' case was among more than 8,000 threats to lawmakers investigated by the U.S. Capitol Police in 2023, and officials expect another surge with the 2024 election.

During a three day trial, Rogers testified that his outraged calls to the FBI and McCarthy's office were a form of ""civil disobedience.""

He and his attorneys argued that using obscenities with FBI operators and Congressional staff was protected as free speech under the First Amendment, which establishes the right ""to petition the government for a redress of grievances.""

But prosecutors said Rogers crossed the line with a threat on McCarthy's life and by hurling abusive and sexual verbal tirades against the lawmaker's staffers and FBI operators.

In the dozens of calls that were played for jurors, Rogers was heard asking for investigations of various alleged conspiracies involving the FBI and the administration of President Joe Biden. He was polite at times, but would quickly become angry and shout obscenities until the calls were disconnected.

""You can't talk to people that way. It's common sense,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Godfrey said. ""He's calling not out of political protest; he's calling because he gets enjoyment out of it.""

The prosecutor told the jury there was no exception in federal law that says government employees can be subjected to harassment.

""'Petitioning the government' -- baloney,"" Godfrey said. ""Kevin McCarthy was the Speaker of the House. It's not his job to shoot down spy balloons.""

Rogers, a former telephone customer service representative, testified that he took to care to ""edit"" his comments on the phone to avoid any threats because he didn't want to go to prison.

He added that he never tried hide his actions and frequently offered his name and phone number when calling the FBI.

""They were disrespectful to me, so I was disrespectful to them,"" Rogers said.

Defense attorney Ed Werner said Rogers ""just wanted to be heard.""

Rogers wore shirts depicting Captain America and other superheroes throughout the trial, including one Wednesday with the letters ""MAGA"" on the front, a reference to Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. A supporter of the former president, he said he was in Washington during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.

Godfrey said the case was not about politics but rather illegal harassment.

Earlier this year, a 30-year-old Billings man was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in federal prison after leaving voicemail messages threatening to kill Montana Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester and his family. Another Montana man, from Kalispell, was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison last year, also for making threats against Tester."
"FACT FOCUS: Claims that more than 300,000 migrant children are missing lack context",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-misinformation-migrant-children-missing-7ab0cea2fd2238346197429e952baa8b,2024-10-02T22:53:06Z,"Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have recently claimed that hundreds of thousands of migrant children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border unaccompanied are missing, then criticized the border policies of the Biden administration and Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, repeated the claim during Tuesday night's debate.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" he said as he met Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in what is likely the last debate of the 2024 presidential campaign.

But immigration experts say the claims regarding missing migrant children lack significant context.

Here's a closer look at the facts.

CLAIM: The Biden administration has lost more than 300,000 unaccompanied migrant children.

THE FACTS: This claim misrepresents information in an August report published by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General, which faulted Immigration and Customs Enforcement for failing to consistently ""monitor the location and status of unaccompanied migrant children"" once they are released from federal government custody.

The report noted that more than 291,000 unaccompanied migrant children had not, as of May 2024, received a notice to appear in court. Additionally, more than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children got a notice to appear but then failed to show up for immigration court hearings. Those figures came from ICE and covered a period from October 2018 to September 2023. During that period there were a total of 448,820 unaccompanied children released by ICE to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement.

But experts say it is a stretch to refer to roughly 300,000 children as ""lost"" or ""missing.""

""This is not a 'missing kids' problem; it's a 'missing paperwork' problem,"" Jonathan Beier, associate director of research and evaluation for the Acacia Center for Justice's Unaccompanied Children Program, wrote in an email.

Plus, President Joe Biden only entered the White House partway through this period. It includes approximately 15 months when Trump was president and does not specify how many children arrived in the U.S. under each president.

Experts say there are many reasons why the children might not have appeared for hearings or received a notice to appear in the first place. For example, they only get a notice to appear when removal proceedings against them have begun, and if ICE hasn't started that removal process, they wouldn't have gotten a notice in the first place.

A lack of communication between government agencies could mean a notice is sent to the wrong address if it has been updated with one agency and not another. A child's guardian may be unable to take them to court, perhaps because they live on the other side of the state.

The report does not provide any explanations.

""All of these factors can explain some of the deficiencies and a conclusion that the children are missing could be very, very premature,"" said Raul Pinto, deputy legal director for transparency at the American Immigration Council.

Carmen Hills, an ICE spokesperson, said the agency agreed with the inspector general's recommendations to improve information sharing within ICE and externally with HHS, but disagreed with the suggestion that the children are missing.

""We are concerned that the report's findings are misleading and may be misconstrued because they fail to acknowledge key facts,"" she said.

Hills said ICE does not generally issue court notices to unaccompanied children ""until after they have been placed with sponsors who have been vetted by HHS"" so that they can get settled and seek legal help.

Representatives for HHS and Vance did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.

An unaccompanied migrant child is defined by the U.S. government as someone who is under 18, lacks lawful immigration status and has no parent or guardian in the country to take custody of them. When they're apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security, they're transferred to the HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement.

They are then placed ""in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interests of the child,"" according to the resettlement office. That can mean shelters, foster care or residential treatment centers, among other options. If possible, children are released to sponsors, often family members, who can care for them.

Removal proceedings may be initiated by ICE and the Department of Justice. Some children are able to stay in the U.S. legally if they qualify for asylum, special visas for victims of abuse, trafficking and other crimes, or other types of immigration relief. In those cases, removal proceedings may never start."
JD Vance again refuses to say Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jd-vance-2020-election-trump-biden-e9c1f285777a63eec251ed089a47c9e6,2024-10-02T22:06:02Z,"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance on Wednesday again refused to say who he believed won the 2020 presidential election, which has been the persistent focus of false claims by his running mate, Donald Trump.

Vance, speaking in Michigan a day after debating Democrat vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, was asked about an exchange during Tuesday night's face off when he refused to acknowledge that Joe Biden won the presidential race four years ago.

""Well look, here's the simple reason: The media's obsessed with talking about the election of four years ago,"" Vance said. ""I'm focused on the election of 33 days from now because I want to throw Kamala Harris out of office and get back to common-sense economic policies.""

Vance then went on to speak about the need for secure elections and said he believes the 2024 election will be ""the safest and most secure election.""

Trump's denial of his 2020 election loss had been the fuel for much of his campaign and embracing it has been a key test of those hoping to have his support. His efforts to overturn his loss led to federal criminal charges, which he has pleaded not guilty, and a split with his past running mate, former Vice President Mike Pence.

Trump pressured Pence to overturn Biden's election win as he presided over the Jan. 6, 2021, ceremonial certification of the results. Pence refused, and when rioters stormed the Capitol, some chanted that they wanted to ""hang Mike Pence.""

On the debate stage Tuesday night, Walz brought up the pressure campaign against Pence, noting the reason that Vance was on stage instead of Walz."
Anti-abortion leaders undeterred as Trump for the first time says he'd veto a federal abortion ban,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-vance-walz-debate-2024-election-abortion-64c739e99ffa1ad51b973e420e1fe92d,2024-10-02T20:55:36Z,"CHICAGO (AP) -- Anti-abortion leaders said Wednesday that they're undeterred after Donald Trump said he would veto a federal abortion ban, the first time he has explicitly said so after previously refusing to answer questions on the subject.

During Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, the Republican presidential nominee posted on his social media platform Truth Social that ""everyone knows I would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances, and would, in fact, veto it.""

He then said that abortion rights should be left up to the states -- his most common response to questions about the issue since Roe v. Wade was overturned by a conservative majority that included three of Trump's own appointees to the Supreme Court. In the two years since the ruling, abortion rights have emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP, which has struggled to find a consistent message on the path forward, while driving turnout for Democrats.

With the election less than five weeks away, Trump has been trying to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights. The former president is trying to make up ground with women -- a group that views Democratic nominee Kamala Harris more favorably nationally -- in the handful of battleground states that will likely determine the winner.

""Trump's statement last night is just one more example of Republicans trying desperately to rebrand themselves on the issue of abortion,"" said Ryan Stitzlein, vice president of political and government relations at the national abortion rights organization Reproductive Freedom for All. ""But at the end of the day, the only thing that has actually changed is their rhetoric on the issue. It's their reaction to seeing the political consequences for this deeply unpopular policy position.""

Major anti-abortion groups, while voicing disagreement with Trump, said they weren't discouraged by his latest comments on a national abortion ban.

Kristan Hawkins, president of the national anti-abortion Students for Life of America, said, ""There are differing approaches in the pro-life movement on how best to achieve our goal.""

""Donald Trump has his own strategy to get the federal government out of the business of abortion,"" she said. ""We might disagree with him about the long-term goals of our movement, but in the short term, we can work with that direction.""

Hawkins added that there are other avenues Trump could use to restrict abortion nationally, including through defunding Planned Parenthood and appointing anti-abortion officials to lead major federal departments.

Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said she wasn't surprised by Trump's remarks.

""But quite frankly, unless something really unusual happens in this election, neither side is going to have the votes in Congress to pass a national law,"" she said. ""So that wasn't really at the top of our list anyway.""

Angela Vasquez-Giroux, vice president of communications for Planned Parenthood Votes, meanwhile, said she doesn't believe Trump's vow to veto a national abortion ban, calling him ""a legendary flip-flopper who says whatever he thinks helps him most in that moment."" She said that even without a national abortion ban, Trump would be able to restrict abortion across the country by appointing anti-abortion judges and federal officials or reviving the Comstock Act, a 19th-century ""anti-vice"" law that abortion rights advocates say could imperil access to medication abortion.

Trump had not previously said whether he would veto a national ban. In fact, he repeatedly declined to say if he would veto such a ban during September's presidential debate with Harris, although it is extremely unlikely that either political party would be able to win enough votes in Congress to pass national abortion legislation.

In August, Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, said the former president would veto a national ban. But Trump demurred on the subject during the September debate, saying, ""I didn't discuss it with JD.""

The question has since lingered amid Trump's shifting stances on the crucial issue.

Trump senior adviser Jason Miller on Tuesday rejected the idea that Trump had changed his position on the matter.

""President Trump made clear, which he's said all along, it should be back in the states,"" he told reporters after the debate. ""Nothing changed. He's always said it should be back in the states.""

Vance falsely claimed during Tuesday's debate that he never supported a national ban himself, though he said in 2022 that he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally"" and supported Sen. Lindsey Graham's proposal to impose a national ban on abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy. In 2023, he voiced support for a ""minimum national standard"" for abortion, including at 15 weeks of pregnancy.

Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as ""minimum national standards"" in order to distort their own stances on the issue amid the political unpopularity of the GOP's position on abortion.

""It doesn't matter what they call it,"" Vasquez-Giroux said. ""What matters is how it's going to impact everyone that we know and love and care about. If you call it a limit or a ban, it's the same thing, and everyday people will suffer.""

Around 6 in 10 Americans think their state should generally allow a person to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason, according to a July poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Voters in seven states, including conservative-leaning Kentucky, Montana and Ohio, have either protected abortion rights or defeated attempts to restrict them in statewide votes over the past two years.

Harris' campaign, meanwhile, has maintained that Trump would sign a national abortion ban if reelected and blamed him for the abortion restrictions in swaths of the country since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which once granted a constitutional right to abortion.

Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade and boasted about returning the abortion question to the states. But voters don't have a direct say through citizen initiatives in about half of states, and in states that will have abortion on the ballot this year, anti-abortion groups and their Republican allies are using a wide array of strategies to counter proposed ballot initiatives.

Pete Rose still not going into Hall of Fame. His MLB ban was permanent not 'lifetime',AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/rose-hall-of-fame-d3da8832097f2717590096d68600fee4,2024-10-02T20:21:56Z,"Pete Rose still isn't going into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

While the career hits leader's banishment from baseball 35 years ago was often referred to as a lifetime ban, and his death this week led some to believe that would end, Rose agreed to permanent ineligibility from Major League Baseball following a probe of his betting on the game.

Anyone on the permanently ineligible list can't be considered for election to the Hall under a rule adopted by the Hall's board of directors in 1991. Rose's status didn't change when he died Monday at age 83 of natural causes in Las Vegas.

That certainly won't stop the debate about whether the 17-time All-Star with 4,256 hits deserves inclusion, or to now be posthumously inducted.

""The GREAT Pete Rose just died. He was one of the most magnificent baseball players ever to play the game. He paid the price! Major League Baseball should have allowed him into the Hall of Fame many years ago,"" former President and Republican candidate Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social, repeating a similar plea he made four years earlier. ""Do it now, before his funeral!""

The Hall of Fame's board adopted the rule 1 1/2 years after Rose agreed to the ban, and the same year that he would have become eligible to be on the ballot for the first time.

""It was obviously aimed at Pete Rose, and from that day forward and to today, my position, the position of millions of others is, yeah, we get it, he broke the cardinal rule. He should be banned from baseball under that rule for life,"" longtime broadcaster Bob Costas said Tuesday on ESPN's ""Get Up!"" morning show. ""But somebody got those 4,256 base hits and those three batting championships. Put him in the Hall of Fame, put it at the bottom of his plaque 'banned from baseball 1989, for life'. It's part of the record, but he should be in as a player.""

Baseball's longstanding Rule 21 about misconduct, which is prominently displayed in every MLB clubhouse, states any player, umpire, or club or league official or employee who bets ""upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform, shall be declared permanently ineligible.""

An investigation for MLB by lawyer John M. Dowd found Rose placed numerous bets on the Cincinnati Reds to win from 1985-87 while playing for and managing the team. Rose applied for reinstatement in 1997 and met with Commissioner Bud Selig in November 2002, but Selig never ruled on Rose's request.

Current MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred in 2015 denied Rose's application for reinstatement, concluding Rose continued to gamble and would be a risk to the sport's integrity if allowed back in the game.

""Pete Rose violated what is sort of rule one in baseball, and the consequences of that are clear in the rule, and we've continued to abide by our own rules,"" Manfred told the Baseball Writers' Association of America in 2023. ""It's just the rules are different for players. It's part of the responsibility that comes with the privilege of being a major league player.""

Manfred plans to retire when his current term ends in January 2029, so it is possible the next commissioner could reconsider Rose's ban.

At the time the ban agreement was announced, then-Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti said: ""The burden is entirely on Mr. Rose to reconfigure his life in a way he deems appropriate.""

Rose repeatedly denied betting on baseball until making an admission in his 2004 autobiography, ""Pete Rose: My Prison Without Bars.""

""The ultimate tragedy is the one that he experienced, because he had all sorts of blessings and advantages and talents, and to end up living a life for the past 35 years that was so frustrating and abysmal must have been a terrible sentence for him,"" former Commissioner Fay Vincent told The Associated Press this week.

""At the end, how can you not feel very sorry for a guy who suffered from sort of a human failing, which is an excessive belief in his infallibility, and he kept testing that. .... Kept being punished, and he never got a lesson,"" he said. ""The lesson was stop doing what you're doing.""

Rose directly appealed to the Hall in 2016 to restore his eligibility, arguing the lifetime ban he agreed to was never intended to keep him from Cooperstown.

Even though the 1963 NL Rookie of the Year, 1973 MVP and 1975 World Series MVP isn't in the Hall of Fame, Rose's accomplishments are found all over Cooperstown. The museum has the bats from his 3,000th and 4,000th hits, and the helmet he wore when he topped Ty Cobb's mark of 4,191 hits on Sept. 11, 1985.

Coach praises Tim Walz's son for helping protect other kids after shooting,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/gus-walz-shooting-debate-vance-election-000be5d166708536a39b9e764868fbb4,2024-10-02T18:59:18Z,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- When the issue of gun violence came up at the vice presidential debate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz had a personal story to tell: His teenage son, Gus, had been at a sports center last year when a shooting took place.

Gus Walz was at volleyball practice at the Jimmy Lee Recreation Center in St. Paul the afternoon of Jan. 18, 2023, when a 16-year-old was shot and seriously wounded outside.

It wasn't the first time Tim Walz had spoken about his son's brush with gun violence, and the shooting itself was widely publicized locally. But the Democrat's remarks Tuesday night at his debate with Republican JD Vance, as the public is still getting to know both vice presidential candidates, offered the biggest stage yet to personalize an issue that has deeply affected many American families.

On Wednesday, the youth's volleyball coach, David Albornoz, praised Gus in an interview with The Associated Press for how he helped get other kids to safety and keep them calm amid the chaotic scene.

""I was impressed by Gus and the kids in general, and how they handled it,"" Albornoz said. ""Gus stayed with the kids as he was supposed to do.""

The shooting came up as Walz and Vance were debating gun violence.

""Well, I think all the parents watching tonight, this is your biggest nightmare,"" Walz said. ""Look, I've got a 17-year-old and he witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball. Those things don't leave you.""

Gus didn't actually see the shooting itself, but he did witness the aftermath, said Albornoz, who is also aquatics facilities supervisor for St. Paul Parks. Among other things, he said, Gus saw Albornoz with blood on his hands from performing first aid on the victim.

Walz briefly brought up the shooting at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Sept. 12, when he accused Vance and his running mate, former President Donald Trump, of minimizing gun violence at schools.

""My own son was in a location where someone was shot in the head. Too many of us have this,"" the governor told the crowd.

Walz also mentioned it in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio in March, when he said Gus was still dealing with his feelings a year later.

""He was there with little kids, littler kids. He was kind of supervising. He shuffled them under the bleachers,"" Walz told MPR.

Albornoz broadly backed up the governor's version, although his memory was that Gus took the kids back to the pool area, where they waited behind locked doors until they got the all clear.

Gus got national attention during his father's speech at the Democratic National Convention in August, when he was caught on camera standing up, tears streaming down his face. In a viral moment, Gus pointed to his father and exclaimed, ""That's my dad!""

After Gus got some derision for that, Albornoz posted a tribute on Facebook, saying they met when the teen sought him out to lead a volleyball team. He called Gus a ""kid thrown into the fray and turmoil of our current divided and divisive political landscape, deserving of love and respect as he navigates his senior year."" He recalled how they and other kids would often go out for tacos after games.

""I also know him from when a kid got shot in the parking lot and he helped keeping everyone safe and calm, looking after the kids in the gym with us as I rushed out,"" he wrote in August.

On Wednesday, Albornoz said Gus is just a regular teen who has suddenly been thrust into the national spotlight.

""He's a normal kid in extraordinary circumstances,"" the coach said.

In February, a judge sentenced Exavir Binford Jr., a rec center employee, to more than 10 years for shooting JuVaughn Turner. Binford pleaded guilty to first-degree assault in exchange for prosecutors dropping an attempted murder charge. Prosecutors say Binford shot Turner in the head during an altercation involving them and other teens. Turner's family is now suing the city, saying he suffered permanent brain damage. They allege the city knew he had a history of violent conduct and threats to minors. The city has moved to dismiss the lawsuit, saying Binford was not acting within his official duties and had no police powers when he shot Turner.

On Tuesday night, after Walz brought up the shooting, Vance expressed his empathy.

""Tim, first of all, I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that. Christ, have mercy. It is awful,"" Vance said."
The president could invoke a 1947 law to try to suspend the dockworkers' strike. Here's how,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/port-strike-longshoremen-dockworkers-union-law-27c7eaa7b199fba1903a637eb6c7db0c,2024-10-02T16:33:22Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some manufacturers and retailers are urging President Joe Biden to invoke a 1947 law as a way to suspend a strike by 45,000 dockworkers that has shut down 36 U.S. ports from Maine to Texas.

At issue is Section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, better known as the Taft-Hartley Act. The law authorizes a president to seek a court order for an 80-day cooling-off period for companies and unions to try to resolve their differences.

Biden has said, though, that he won't intervene in the strike.

The law was introduced by two Republicans -- Sen. Robert Taft of Ohio and Rep. Fred Hartley Jr. of New Jersey -- in the aftermath of World War II. It followed a series of strikes in 1945 and 1946 by workers who demanded better pay and working conditions after the privations of wartime.

President Harry Truman opposed Taft-Hartley, but his veto was overridden by Congress.

In addition to authorizing a president to intervene in strikes, the law banned ""closed shops,"" which require employers to hire only union workers. The ban allowed workers to refuse to join a union.

Taft-Hartley also barred ""secondary boycotts,'' thereby making it illegal for unions to pressure neutral companies to stop doing business with an employer that was targeted in a strike.

It also required union leaders to sign affidavits declaring that they did not support the Communist Party.

The president can appoint a board of inquiry to review and write a report on the labor dispute -- and then direct the attorney general to ask a federal court to suspend a strike by workers or a lockout by management.

If the court issues an injunction, an 80-day cooling-off period would begin. During this period, management and unions must ""make every effort to adjust and settle their differences.''

Still, the law cannot actually force union members to accept a contract offer.

According to the Congressional Research Service, about half the time that presidents have invoked Section 206 of Taft-Hartley, the parties worked out their differences. But nine times, according to the research service, the workers went ahead with a strike.

President George W. Bush invoked Taft-Hartley in 2002 after 29 West Coast ports locked out members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union in a standoff. (The two sides ended up reaching a contract.)

Despite lobbying by the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Retail Federation, the president has maintained that he has no plans to try to suspend the dockworkers' strike against ports on the East and Gulf coasts.

William Brucher, a labor relations expert at Rutgers University, notes that Taft-Hartley injunctions are ""widely despised, if not universally despised, by labor unions in the United States.""

And Vice President Kamala Harris is relying on support from organized labor in her presidential campaign against Donald Trump.

If the longshoremen's strike drags on long enough and causes shortages that antagonize American consumers, pressure could grow on Biden to change course and intervene. But experts like Brucher suggest that most voters have already made up their minds and that the election outcome is ""really more about turnout"" now.

Which means, Brucher said, that ""Democrats really can't afford to alienate organized labor.""

Pennsylvania Republican in key swing-state Senate race backs using military to fight fentanyl,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-senate-mccormick-casey-fentanyl-military-trump-mexico-cartel-5bb7129c955756010eecc81cfcf1c8fd,2024-10-02T13:04:37Z,"STEELTON, Pa. (AP) -- The Republican challenger trying to flip the U.S. Senate seat in swing-state Pennsylvania said he'll press for U.S. military action in Mexico to target fentanyl trafficking networks, a controversial and complicated idea that seemed to originate with former President Donald Trump.

David McCormick, who is challenging third-term Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, is making the idea part of his plan for fighting the fentanyl scourge, which is playing a big role in the campaign and has been central to dueling TV ads in the race.

The idea of using the military garnered attention in last year's GOP primaries before Trump emerged as his party's presidential nominee for the third consecutive time.

But now, McCormick -- a decorated Army combat veteran and ex- hedge fund CEO who served on Trump's Defense Advisory Board -- is testing the message of unilateral U.S. military action in Mexico in a state that could be decisive in determining which party wins the White House and a Senate majority in November's election.

McCormick envisions using the U.S. military's drones and special operations teams in Mexico to destroy fentanyl trafficking cartels, though he stresses that the military should be used ""selectively and thoughtfully.""

""I'm not saying we're going to send the 82nd Airborne Division to do a jump into Mexico,"" McCormick said. ""What I'm saying is the combination of special operations and drones, I think, could eradicate the manufacturing facilities, kill the distribution networks and do a real dent in what is a terrorist activity.""

Military action is justified, McCormick says, by what he calls ""the biggest killer in our country."" The U.S. shouldn't wait for a blessing from a Mexican government that has failed to address its problem with fentanyl production and trafficking, he said.

""So the time for negotiating with the Mexican government to get their DEA on this is gone,"" McCormick told one audience in September. ""We've got to get tough on it. And that's what I would do.""

The idea received high-profile attention when Trump's former defense secretary, Mark Esper, said in 2022 that Trump had asked him about firing missiles into Mexico, a precedent-setting notion that Esper and other defense officials quickly rejected.

The idea gained cachet among some Republican lawmakers last year and Trump embraced it, saying ""it's now time for America to wage war on the cartels.""

Trump's then-competitors on the Republican presidential primary campaign trail also embraced the idea, but that talk has quieted. Legislation to provide military authorization hasn't received a committee vote in the Republican-controlled House and, while McCormick's proposal lacks specifics and echoes an idea Trump broached, it goes further than what most -- if not all -- other Senate candidates are saying across the U.S.

Critics of using the U.S. military in Mexico say such operations would do little to hurt the cartels or stem the flow of fentanyl, while raising delicate questions about sovereignty.

They could, for example, destroy the relationship with the U.S.' largest trade partner, whose just-departed President Andres Manuel López Obradorrepeatedlydenied Mexico is producing the synthetic opioid despite considerable evidence to the contrary.

Casey has neither criticized nor backed the idea of using the U.S. military in Mexico. Instead. he has pointed to his support for measures in Congress to strengthen screening at border checkpoints.

The vast majority of fentanyl seized is brought into the United States by American citizens at the southern border, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

McCormick and other Republicans compare fentanyl deaths to combat losses in the Vietnam War: Roughly 110,000 drug overdose deaths each of the last two years in which fentanyl was the primary culprit two-thirds of the time, compared to 58,000 reported U.S. casualties in the war.

""What we're in is unprecedented,"" he said. ""The numbers are beyond imagination in terms of what we're experiencing right now.""

McCormick says the closest model for what he has in mind is the U.S. military's cocaine interdiction work with the cooperation of the Colombian government against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. McCormick called that effort ""incredibly successful.""

But Justin Logan, director of defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, said the Colombian operation failed to stop the flow of cocaine.

It's true that Colombia became more stable, its governance improved and cartel activity receded, Logan said. But the price of cocaine in the U.S. dropped significantly, which he called an indication that cocaine had become more widely available.

""And I think that is the first reason to be skeptical of the claim that using the U.S. military against the cartels in Mexico is going to have an effect in the United States on the amount and abundance of fentanyl in the United States,"" Logan said.

Analysts say it seems unlikely that Mexico would agree to U.S. military operations on its territory.

Vanda Felbab-Brown, director of the Brookings Institution's Initiative on Nonstate Armed Actors, said a sustained military and law enforcement effort by Mexico over months or years would be necessary to shut down labs and round up a trafficking network's management.

But unilateral U.S. military strikes will have little long-term effect, because the labs and cartel commanders that get taken out are easily replaced, she said.

""And meanwhile you would incur very large costs,"" she said. ""You could imagine the complete rupture in the relationship that has many consequences.""

Mexico, for example, could end its cooperation of stemming the flow of migrants to its border with the United States, she said.

In Congress, bipartisan agreement has revolved around hiring more Customs and Border Patrol personnel at the southern border and expanding the capacity to screen vehicles coming from Mexico.

In April, President Joe Biden signed bipartisan legislation to expand the use of sanctions to disrupt trafficking networks and money laundering.

Democrats, meanwhile, have accused Trump and Republicans of hypocrisy after they sank a sweeping immigration reform bill this year that carried hundreds of millions of dollars to hire more customs agents and bolster investigations into fentanyl trafficking.

Trump said the attached immigration measures weren't tough enough.

If he wins in November, congressional authorization may not matter. Trump has said he intends to act with or without congressional approval.

The Biden administration, meanwhile, has suggested it already has the legal authority to strike cartels in Mexico, if it wanted to.

Presidents will always assert that they have the inherent authority to use the armed forces to protect the national security of the United States, said Geoffrey S. Corn, director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at Texas Tech's School of Law.

Congress in 1973 passed a law requiring their approval for taking such action, but presidents have assumed the authority to strike at non-state enemies in other countries that they deem to be either unwilling or unable to rein them in, Corn said.

It's a gray area of international law that has been tested by presidents of both parties.

""It's the same rationale that Obama used when he ordered a raid into Pakistan to kill Osama Bin Laden,"" Corn said. ""As far as we know, we didn't have consent from the Pakistanis to do that.""

The question, then, may be whether the flow of fentanyl into the United States warrants military action, Corn said.

""It's a hard question,"" Corn said. ""It is killing millions of people, but it's not like they're flying drones across the border and dropping this stuff."""

Meanwhile, those new trials -- along with a dockworkers strike that threatens the U.S. economy -- are looming over the final weeks of the presidential campaign and could help shape the public mood as voters decide between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.

Over the past four years, President Joe Biden has jetted off to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires and tropical storms. It's not a role Kamala Harris has played as vice president.

But on Wednesday, they'll both fan out across the Southeast to grapple with the damage from Hurricane Helene, seeking to demonstrate commitment and competence in helping devastated communities after Donald Trump's false claims about their administration's response. Biden is heading to North and South Carolina, while Harris is going to Georgia.

Harris' stop will also serve as a political test in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. She's trying to step into the role for which Biden is best known -- showing the empathy Americans expect in times of tragedy -- in the closing stretch of her campaign for president.

Former President Donald Trump is going back to Butler, Pennsylvania, where the world saw him pump his fist and beseech followers to ""fight,"" even as blood streaked his face from a would-be assassin's bullet.

In announcing his return, the current Republican nominee said he planned to ""celebrate a unifying vision for America's future in an event like the world has never seen before.""

The question is: Is Butler ready?

While many are predicting a large crowd to hear Trump speak back at the very Farm Show property where a bullet grazed his right ear on July 13, there's also apprehension in town, along with a sense that Butler is still healing."
Fact-check fight: CBS News cuts candidates' mics after JD Vance objects to a moderator's correction,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/debate-cbs-vance-walz-fact-check-639ceab0831b4c304fb132bcf254e48a,2024-10-02T04:41:25Z,"CBS News briefly cut off the microphones of vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz during an exchange in their debate Tuesday when the Republican objected to an attempt by moderator Margaret Brennan to correct something he said about immigration.

It was one of the evening's more contentious moments and reminded viewers again of the difficulty that the news outlets organizing debates this political season are facing in trying to point out in real time statements that are misleading or untrue.

After Vance had talked about illegal immigrants overwhelming some American cities like Springfield, Ohio, Brennan interjected that the Haitians that had moved to that city were there legally.

""Since you're fact-checking me, it's important to say what is actually going on,"" Vance said.

After briefly letting Vance speak, Brennan interrupted him and said it was time to move on to other issues. They spoke over each other, until CBS News muted the microphones of both Vance and Walz, who were appearing at a studio in New York City.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Brennan said.

Prior to the debate, CBS News had said it would be up to the two candidates -- not moderators Brennan and Norah O'Donnell -- to fact-check each other and the journalists would encourage them to do so. Vance said that it appeared CBS News was breaking the rules it had set down.

Fact-checking was an issue during last month's debate between presidential contenders Donald Trump and Kamala Harris after moderators corrected Trump at least four times, angering the former president and his supporters. When Trump debated President Joe Biden last spring, CNN moderators did not attempt any on-air corrections.

In an echo of what followed the ABC debate, Trump posted on his Truth Social site during Tuesday's debate that ""both young ladies have been extremely biased Anchors!""

At one other point Tuesday, wrapping up a discussion about climate change, O'Donnell said it was the overwhelming consensus of scientists that the planet was warming. Earlier, she had asked Vance whether or not he agreed with his running mate's comment that climate change was a hoax.

There were points at which the moderators sought to encourage the candidates to police each other. During a discussion about whether illegal migration was driving up housing costs, Brennan said to Walz, ""I do want to let you respond to the allegation that the vice president is letting in migrants.""

Yet it was a discussion about abortion that most illustrated the difficulties of that approach, and how there is no easy way during a live debate to make sure viewers are getting accurate information. Vance cited a provision in a Minnesota law, where Walz is governor.

""As I read Minnesota law, it says that a doctor that presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide life-saving care,"" Vance said.

Vance called that ""fundamentally barbaric,"" while Walz said his opponent's interpretation of the law was untrue.

What did the law actually say? That was unclear, and viewers were left to decide which candidate they wanted to believe. The CBS moderators cut to a commercial, unable or unwilling to clarify the question.

Throughout the debate, CBS News ran on its screen a message that viewers could log onto its ""CBS News Confirmed"" website to read about claims in the debate that were untrue or misleading. At some points, the network even showed a code that enabled viewers to instantly call up the information on their mobile phones. Yet those entreaties were not shown on the screens of other networks that simulcast the debate, which was produced by CBS.

The debate may have represented the last chance for viewers to see representatives of the two presidential campaigns duke it out onscreen. Harris has called for a second debate between her and Trump, but the Republican candidate has not accepted the challenge.

"Harris, Trump's approach to Mideast crisis, hurricane to test public mood in final weeks of campaign",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-mideast-dockworkers-hurricane-biden-a17bb5abe3c9bcfbea58a6ed17eb0ba6,2024-10-02T04:29:21Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A trio of new trials -- a devastating hurricane, expanding conflict in the Mideast and a dockworkers strike that threatens the U.S. economy -- are looming over the final weeks of the presidential campaign and could help shape the public mood as voters decide between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.

How events shake out -- and how the candidates respond -- could be decisive as they claw for votes in battleground states.

The sitting president, Joe Biden, is still the steward of a U.S. economy and foreign policy at this tumultuous moment and may well bear ultimate responsibility for how they play out. But how Harris and Trump approach the three disparate issues could have rippling impact on how Americans perceive their two choices this November.

""Unfortunately, there are going to be events like this, and this is where you see the leadership of a president show up,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Tuesday. ""I think this should send a message to Americans: It matters. It matters who sits behind the Resolute Desk.""

Harris, with Biden's help, is trying to display steady calm as a flurry of difficult problems arise all at once.

She and Biden on Tuesday toggled between directing Hurricane Helene recovery and rescue response work and huddling with aides in the White House Situation Room to watch as the U.S. helped Israel defend against a massive attack by Iran in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed leaders of Lebanese Hezbollah.

All the while, they were keeping close contact with economic advisers as dockworkers took to the picket line Tuesday, a walkout stretching from ports in Maine to Texas that threatens to snarl supply chains and cause shortages and higher prices if it stretches on for more than a few weeks.

Trump, for his part, lashed out at Harris as in over her head, while claiming that this sort of crush of problems never would have happened under his watch.

""We have been talking about World War III, and I don't want to make predictions,"" Trump said at a campaign event in Wisconsin. ""The whole world is laughing at us. That's why Israel was under attack just a little while ago. Because they don't respect our country anymore.""

Yet voters cast Trump aside four years ago in large part because of how they viewed his handling of the swirling economic, social and public health challenges that emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Biden, in comments to reporters before meeting with aides Tuesday to discuss the ongoing hurricane response, seemed to acknowledge the growing frustration with the federal response to the massive storm.

""I've been in frequent contact with the governors and other leaders in the impacted areas, and we have to jumpstart this recovery process,"" Biden said. He will travel to the Carolinas on Wednesday to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation. He is also expected to visit hurricane-impacted areas in Georgia and Florida later this week. ""People are scared to death. People wonder whether they're going to make it.""

Harris, meanwhile, is headed to Georgia on Wednesday and North Carolina in the coming days to do the same.

Tuesday's vice presidential debate offered a sampling of how the two campaigns were reacting to new developments to bolster their own messages and sharpen their attacks on their rivals. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised ""steady leadership"" under Harris while Ohio Sen. JD Vance pledged a return to ""peace through strength"" if Trump is returned to the White House.

Biden has stayed off the campaign trail since announcing in July that he was ending his reelection effort amid sliding public approval ratings.

His conspicuous absence underscores that Democrats see him as more of a liability than an asset in making the case for Harris, said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania.

But how well Biden deals with the three latest emergency situations could have a big impact in how undecided voters perceive Harris in these final days.

""President Biden can't help Kamala Harris on the stump,"" Borick said. ""But in a campaign where you are turning over every rock in a few states to get that undecided voter, how he manages these crises over the next several weeks could have an impact.""

The Harris campaign understands the risks it faces with multiple crises converging all at once, especially given their varied and unpredictable nature. A prolonged strike, a bungled disaster response or a further expansion of Middle East conflict could raise doubts about Biden's leadership, and by extension that of his second-in-command.

At the same time, Harris campaign aides believe the perilous moment presents an opportunity to demonstrate to voters the stakes of who's in the job and the seriousness with which they approach it, according to campaign officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking.

The former president, in a speech in Waunakee, Wisconsin, and in social media postings Tuesday, offered a mixture of prayer and concern for those impacted by Helene, jabs at Harris for the dockworkers strike, and an aside about the casting of Stanley Kubrick's film ""Full Metal Jacket.""

""The situation should have never come to this and, had I been president, it would not have,"" Trump said in a statement about the strike.

Harris aides made a point of having the vice president deliver brief remarks on the Iranian attack Tuesday in between taping interviews for her campaign, aiming to portray her as ready to take command.

Late-term tumult has been fixture in American presidential politics, sometimes in the form of scandal and other times with an incumbent hoping to demonstrate that he or his preferred successor would be a steady head at an uncertain time.

George W. Bush pushed a rescue package through Congress to stabilize a reeling financial system by creating the Troubled Asset Relief Program amid fears that the economy was on the verge of collapse. The broader economic conditions didn't help Republican John McCain in the race he lost to Barack Obama.

Jimmy Carter's reelection campaign in 1980 was paralyzed by the Iran hostage crisis. Fifty-two hostages were released on January 20, 1981, soon after his successor, Ronald Reagan, was inaugurated.

Lyndon Johnson announced a halting of bombings in North Vietnam days before the 1968 election, a step he hoped would bring the conflict toward a peace settlement. But the South Vietnamese indicated they would not negotiate and Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey, lost narrowly to Republican Richard Nixon.

""The efforts by incumbents to help themselves or their party's nominee with 'October surprises' go back quite a ways,"" said Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian. ""In this current climate, I'm not sure how many voters can be persuaded by a candidate this late in the game trying to show competency.""

Harris' stop will also serve as a political test in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. She's trying to step into the role for which Biden is best known -- showing the empathy that Americans expect in times of tragedy -- in the closing stretch of her campaign for president.

She last visited scenes of natural disasters as a U.S. senator from California, including when she went to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in 2017 and when she walked through charred wreckage in Paradise, California, after the Camp Fire in 2018.

Trump, the Republican nominee, traveled to Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday with a Christian charity organization that brought trucks of fuel, food, water and other supplies.

After arriving, Trump accused Biden of ""sleeping"" and not responding to calls from Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. However, Kemp had spoken with Biden the previous day, and the governor said the state was getting everything it needed.

Biden was infuriated by Trump's claim on Monday, snapping that Trump was ""lying, and the governor told him he was lying.""

On Tuesday, the president said he has directed administration officials to ""send every available resource"" to communities harmed by Helene. The death toll approached 160 people, and power and cellular service remains unavailable in some places.

""We have to jumpstart this recovery process,"" he said. ""People are scared to death. This is urgent.""

Trump claimed without evidence that Democratic leaders were withholding help from Republican areas, an accusation that better describes his own approach to disaster relief. He recently threatened that he would withhold wildfire assistance from California because of disagreements with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.

When Trump was president, Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Maria, which killed 3,000 people. His administration waited until the fall of 2020, just weeks before the presidential election, to release $13 billion in assistance for Puerto Rico's recovery. A federal government watchdog also found that Trump administration officials hampered an investigation into delays in the aid delivery.

And during a visit there, he was criticized for tossing paper towel rolls to survivors at a relief center. The gesture seemed to go over well in the room but was widely panned as insensitive to those who were suffering. He also questioned whether the death toll was accurate, claiming it rose ""like magic.""

Harris visited Puerto Rico after Maria as part of a bipartisan delegation.

""When disaster hits anywhere in America, our government has a basic responsibility to commit the resources necessary to save lives, accurately assess damage, and rebuild communities,"" she wrote on Twitter in 2018. ""We now know that after Hurricane Maria, our government failed Puerto Rico at every level.""

Last month, on the seventh anniversary of Maria, Harris recalled speaking with Puerto Ricans who had lost businesses and homes.

""They didn't need paper towels thrown at them -- they needed real help and partnership,"" she said."

VANCE: ""Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration. What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies.""

THE FACTS: The Biden administration agreed last year to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian assets as part of a deal to free five U.S. citizens being held by Iran. But administration officials say not a dollar of that has yet been given to Iran. It was part of a deal negotiated by the Obama administration, before Biden and Harris took office, that could have allowed Iran to access frozen assets in exchange for accepting limits on its nuclear program.

In 2016, Iran said it had received access to more than $100 billion worth of frozen overseas assets following the implementation of a landmark nuclear deal with world powers. The money had been held in banks in China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey since international sanctions were tightened in 2012 over Tehran's nuclear program. Then-Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew told Congress that only about $50 billion of the frozen assets would actually be accessible by Iran.

WALZ: ""They were charging $800 before this law went into effect.""

THE FACTS: Walz overstated how much Americans were paying for insulin before a new law capped prices at $35 per month for millions of older Americans on Medicare. A December 2022 study found that people who were on Medicare or enrolled in private insurance paid $452 yearly on average before the new law took effect.

VANCE: ""You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.""

THE FACTS: Most economists blame a long-term decline in the housing supply for the steady increase in home prices. The number of new homes under construction plunged from an annual pace of 1.4 million in April 2006 to barely above 400,000 in August 2011, and didn't recover to 2006 levels until 2021.

Vance said at least one prominent economic analysis from the Federal Reserve supports his claims that immigrants are pushing up housing costs, but he didn't provide details. He was likely citing a May 2024 blog post by Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Kashkari says immigration's long-run effect on inflation is ""unclear,"" but immigrants need a place to live and their arrival has overlapped with higher prices.

There might be upward pressure on home prices in some markets because of immigrants arriving, but most economists say the issue is a lack of supply of homes on the market. Homebuilders say they need the immigrants to build the homes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a September news conference that high mortgage rates mean people aren't listing their homes for sale and there has not been enough supply.

WALZ: ""Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies.""

THE FACTS: That's not true. The conservative initiative calls for the collection of ""accurate and reliable statistical data about abortion, abortion survivors, and abortion-related maternal deaths,"" but not a record of every pregnancy that occurs.

More specifically, Project 2025 proposes that the Department of Health and Human Services require all states to report detailed information about abortions that are performed within their borders, including the total number of abortions, the age and state of residence of the mother, the gestational age of the fetus, the reason for the abortion and the method used to perform the abortion. It suggests that this data be separated into categories such as spontaneous miscarriages, intentional abortions, stillbirths and other medical treatments that result in the death of the fetus, like chemotherapy.

VANCE: ""We've got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country.""

THE FACTS: That figure is highly inflated. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports more than 10 million arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico from January 2021 through September 2024.

That's arrests, not people. Under pandemic-era asylum restrictions, many people crossed more than once until they succeeded because there were no legal consequences for getting turned back to Mexico. So the number of people is lower than the number of arrests.

According to the Department of Homeland Security's latest available estimate, there were approximately 11 million people living illegally in the U.S. as of January 2022, 79% of whom entered prior to January 2010.

VANCE: ""It says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late-term abortion.""

THE FACTS: This claim misrepresents a bill Walz signed into law in 2023, updating language about the care of newborns.

The new language uses the phrase ""an infant who is born alive"" instead of ""a born alive infant as a result of an abortion."" It states that medical personnel are required to ""care for the infant who is born alive"" rather than ""preserve the life and health of the born alive infant.""

Both the current version of the law and the 2015 version that was amended state that ""an infant who is born alive shall be fully recognized as a human person, and accorded immediate protection under the law.""

Infanticide is criminalized in every state, including Minnesota, and the bill does not change that.

VANCE: ""Remember he said that on January the 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully.""

THE FACTS: It's true that Trump told the crowd gathered near the White House, ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.""

But Vance ignored the incendiary language Trump used throughout his speech, during which he urged the crowd to march to the Capitol, where Congress was meeting to certify President Joe Biden's victory. Trump told the crowd: ""If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore."" That's after his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, declared: ""Let's have trial by combat.""

US 'Welcome Corps' helps resettle LGBTQ+ refugees fleeing crackdowns against gay people,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lgbtq-refugees-welcome-corps-rainbow-railroad-1c4a419125f50aa769c8416cd47312e2,2024-10-02T04:13:37Z,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Cabrel Ngounou's life in Cameroon quickly unraveled after neighbors caught the teenager with his boyfriend.

A crowd surrounded his boyfriend's house and beat him. Ngounou's family learned of the relationship and kicked him out. So Ngounou fled -- alone and with little money -- on a dangerous, four-year journey through at least five countries. He was sexually assaulted in a Libyan prison, harassed in Tunisia and tried unsuccessfully to take a boat to Europe.

""The worst thing was that they caught us. So it was not easy for my family,"" Ngounou said. ""My sisters told me I need to get out of the house because my place is not there. So that's what really pushed me to leave my country.""

Ngounou's troubles drew attention after he joined a protest outside the U.N. refugee agency's Tunisia office. Eventually, he arrived in the United States, landing in San Francisco in March.

Ngounou joined a growing number of LGBTQ+ people accepted into the Welcome Corps, which launched last year and pairs groups of Americans with newly arrived refugees. So far, the resettlement program has connected 3,500 sponsors with 1,800 refugees, and many more want to help: 100,000 people have applied to become sponsors.

President Joe Biden has sought to rebuild the refugee programs Donald Trump largely dismantled as president, working to streamline the process of screening and placing people in America. New refugee resettlement sites have opened across the country, and on Tuesday, the Biden Administration announced that it resettled 100,000 refugees in fiscal year 2024, the largest number in more than three decades.

In contrast, Trump has pledged to bar refugees from Gaza, reinstate his Muslim ban and impose ""ideological screening"" for all immigrants if he regains the presidency. He and running mate JD Vance are laying groundwork for their goal of deporting millions of illegal immigrants by amplifying false claims, such as the accusation that Haitians given temporary protected status to remain in the U.S. legally are eating pets in Ohio.

Under Biden, meanwhile, two human rights officials in the State Department were tasked last year with identifying refugees who face persecution either due to their sexual orientation or human rights advocacy.

""LGBTQ refugees are forced to flee their homes due to persecution and violence, not unlike other people,"" said Jeremy Haldeman, deputy executive director of the Community Sponsorship Hub, which implements the Welcome Corps on behalf of the State Department. But they are particularly vulnerable because they're coming from places ""where their identities are criminalized and they are at risk of imprisonment or even death.""

More than 60 countries have passed anti-LGBTQ laws and thousands of people have fled the Middle East and Africa seeking asylum in Europe. In April, Uganda's constitutional court on Wednesday upheld an anti-gay law that allows the death penalty for ""aggravated homosexuality.""

""There are just a lot of people who are really at risk and are not safe in their country, and they're usually not safe in the neighboring or regional countries either,"" Kathryn Hampton, senior adviser for U.S. Strategy at Rainbow Railroad, which helps LGBTQI+ people facing persecution.

The demand far outstrips capacity: Of more than 15,000 requests for help in 2023, the nonprofit helped resettle 23 refugees through the Welcome Corps program in cities as large as Houston and towns as small as Arlington, Vermont. It has a goal of resettling 50 this year.

""So, we have a lot of urgency as an organization to find and create new pathways that LGBTQI+ people can access to find safety,"" Hampton said.

Another refugee in the program, Julieth Luna Garcia, is a transgender woman from El Salvador who settled in Chicago.

Speaking through a translator, the 31-year-old Garcia said she suffered abuse from her family because of her trans identity and couldn't legally access gender-affirming care until she arrived in the United States.

""I lived with constant fear, even more so at night. I didn't like to go out. I was really scared that somebody would find me alone and do something,"" Garcia said. Since arriving in February, Garcia has found a place to live and a job as a home health aide and hopes to study to become a lawyer. ""Here, I'm not scared to say who I am. I'm not scared to tell anyone,"" she said.

Maybe the biggest change was starting hormone treatments, she said: ""To see yourself in the mirror and see these changes, I can't really explain it, but it's really big. It's an emotional and exciting thing and something I thought I would never experience.""

Welcome Corps sponsors are expected to help refugees adjust for at least three months after they arrive. Garcia said the five volunteers helped her ""adapt to a new life with a little less difficulty,"" by accessing benefits, getting a work permit and enrolling in English classes.

Ngounou recalled how his sponsors, a team of seven that included a lesbian couple, Anne Raeff and Lori Ostlund, hosted him and connected him with LGBTQ resources and a work training program. They also served as his tour guides to gay life, taking him to the historically gay Castro district, where Ngounou got his first glimpse of the huge rainbow Pride flag and stopped to read every plaque honoring famous gay people.

""Cabrel was just very, very moved by that. Just kind of started crying. We all did,"" Raeff recalled.

""I know that feeling like when we were young, when you'd go into a gay bar and you'd feel like this sense of kind of freedom, like this community,"" she said. ""That was the only place where you could go and actually be open. And that ... this is this community of people and we all have this in common.""

Now the 19-year-old Ngounou works in a coffee shop and takes college courses, with the goal of becoming a social worker. He hopes the boyfriend he met in Tunisia can visit him in San Francisco -- and he still finds it hard to believe that they can share their love openly.

""Here I'm really me ... I feel free,"" he said with a laugh. ""I feel free to have my boyfriend and walk with him in the street. I feel free, you know, to enjoy myself with him wherever we want to enjoy ourselves. But in Tunisia or anywhere else, in Cameroon, you have to hide such things."""
Pennsylvania town grapples with Trump assassination attempt ahead of his return,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-butler-assassination-attempt-54f385fbdac215b89c6df047fa399039,2024-10-02T04:13:36Z,"BUTLER, Pa. (AP) -- Donald Trump is going back to Butler, where the world last saw him pump his fist and beseech followers to ""fight,"" even as blood streaked his face from a would-be assassin's bullet.

In announcing his return, the former president and current Republican nominee said he planned to ""celebrate a unifying vision for America's future in an event like the world has never seen before.""

The question is: Is Butler ready?

While many are predicting a large crowd to hear Trump speak back at the very Farm Show property where a bullet grazed his right ear on July 13, there is also apprehension in town, along with a sense that Butler is still healing.

""I've consulted with, at least, like 500 people since this has happened,"" said registered nurse Shanea Clancy, who runs a mental health consulting service in Butler County and has seen people more anxious since the shooting. Some show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder.

""The big theme, if you will, is just, 'How did something like that happen in our backyard?'"" Clancy said. ""People don't expect trauma to show up at their door on any given day.""

The assassination attempt has resonated deeply in the mountainous community north of Pittsburgh. Trump enjoys wide support there, having easily doubled Hillary Clinton's vote total on his way to winning the White House in 2016. He nearly did so again against Joe Biden in 2020. But Butler County was better for Democrats two years ago, when the party's gubernatorial nominee, Josh Shapiro, took about 43% of the vote there.

To claim the pivotal swing state of Pennsylvania in November, Trump needs to drive up voter turnout in conservative strongholds like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, rural-suburban community with a record of voting for Republicans.

On Saturday, the former president will speak where thousands of people, including children, witnessed him and the others get shot. Former Buffalo Township Fire Company Chief Corey Comperatore was killed, while David Dutch and James Copenhaver were both hospitalized with injuries. U.S. Secret Service killed the gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.

Stunned in the aftermath, some rally goers held impromptu prayer groups as they walked back to their cars. It seems just about everyone in Butler County was either at the rally or knows someone who was.

Last weekend, retired food service worker Sally Sarvey was picking up Trump signs and a T-shirt from a Republican Party tent at a street festival in nearby Slippery Rock. She said she will ""make it a point"" to witness Trump's return this Saturday, but she's mindful of what happened in July.

""Hopefully they'll have more security that acts faster,"" Sarvey said.

There are visible signs of the tension left behind. ""Fight"" graffiti -- echoing Trump's words in the immediate aftermath of the shooting -- began showing up around Butler County in the ensuing two weeks. In some places, the word ""fight"" on roadways was countered by another spray painted message: ""love.""

The assassination attempt has been the ""No. 1 topic"" of conversation since July 13, said Jim Hulings, chairman of the Butler County Republican Committee. He has so many lingering questions about the shooting and consequent investigations that he keeps a running list.

""There's a lot of activity going on right now, people wanting answers,"" Hulings said. ""I am not in a minority there at all. There's a lot of people asking questions.""

Police and emergency officials have faced questions from investigators looking into the shootings from the state police, FBI and Congress. The county government has fielded some 300 open records requests, five times what it normally gets in a year. Many are bracing for litigation that could extend for years.

""I'm not going to lie -- it's a burden on all of us,"" said Butler Emergency Services Director Steve Bicehouse. ""It wears on you. And it's been a trying time the last several months.""

County Commissioner Kevin Boozel, the only Democrat holding countywide elected office in Butler, said what happened two months ago has some concerned about Saturday's rally. The previous security failure is the major issue, but authorities at the July event also contended with extreme heat and humidity that kept emergency responders busy treating people in distress even before the shooting. Several people required hospital treatment.

Boozel has fielded ""plenty of emails saying, 'Don't let him back here,'"" he said of Trump. ""Because emotionally, we're not ready for that.""

Retired librarian Kathy Kline, who lives in Butler, said she supports Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race and feels there has been insufficient consideration for those who oppose Trump returning. Kline belongs to a Facebook group, ""Butler PA Women for Kamala Harris,"" that's grown to some 1,500 members in recent months.

""I personally am never opposed to any political figure coming into our community and sharing their policies,"" Kline said. ""That's the American way. But you know, you need to come in with some respect and integrity and leave all of that chaos and ugliness out of it.""

Barry Cummings' coffee shop near the Farm Show property where the shooting occurred was closed briefly after the shooting. In the immediate aftermath, he said, he was determined to reach out to people who don't share his political views.

""I tended to try to listen more than speak,"" said Cummings, a registered Democrat. He wanted to hear ""the feelings on the other side, you know, and I think that brought us a little closer together.""

Kim Geyer, a Republican Butler County commissioner, plans to attend the rally Saturday, just as she did in July when she sat behind Trump.

""I kind of have mixed feelings about it, but I'm resolved to moving forward,"" Geyer said. ""I think that the people that may be affected more negatively are going to just stay home. And the people that want to feel the inspiration and the energy from the Trump movement are going to attend to support President Trump and let him finish what he began.""

Some Trump supporters have been looking for ways to memorialize the attempted assassination. One artist is working on a 9-foot-high sculpture of Trump in Butler, although it's unclear where it might be installed. Another artist, Butler metal worker and Trump supporter Bill Secunda, spent two weeks reworking an existing life-sized Trump sculpture to better reflect his response after being shot, with his right arm raised and fist clenched.

Secunda and a friend quietly installed it in a tent at the Butler Farm Show in August, where it became popular for selfies. He's already had a $50,000 offer for the sculpture.

""I don't even think I saw a sour look, which was kind of surprising because, you know, I've lost customers over doing a piece like that,"" Secunda said.

Meanwhile, the Butler Historical Society has put on hold until spring, at least, its plans to collect local residents' stories about the shooting. The organization is looking into how it would keep the stories sealed for 75 years, as had been the plan.

Geyer said she expects Butlerites will find more ways to pay tribute to the victims.

""It was a tragic day and nobody wishes it happened or occurred in their county,"" Geyer said. ""I believe that the people who live and work here are resilient people. We're going to move forward."""
Some of the most notable quotes from the JD Vance-Tim Walz vice presidential debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/vance-walz-debate-cbs-quotes-94e552d1a7100225a0003db618351601,2024-10-02T04:09:09Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first and only vice presidential debate between Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz featured an often orderly, policy-focused and even civil dialogue between the two men seeking to serve as the next president's second in command.

One of the sharpest comments came from a debate moderator. Here are some of the most notable quotes from the debate:

-- CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan, who intervened after a tense back and forth between the candidates over immigration. Vance protested a clarification by a moderator about the legal status of Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. ""Since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said before both he and Walz's exchanges were muted.

-- Walz, agreeing with Vance that some regulations limit the construction of new housing units. Both candidates throughout the debate expressed agreement on some points before driving home their own messages.

-- Vance, after Walz noted his son had witnessed gun violence. ""I appreciate that,"" Walz replied.

-- Walz, when discussing discrepancies in his travel history to Hong Kong in 1989 that have been reported by multiple news organizations.

-- Vance, arguing Harris could have acted as vice president to make housing more affordable. ""If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, she ought to do them now,"" Vance also said during the debate.

-- Walz, when discussing Vance's unfounded claims about immigrant communities in Springfield, Ohio. Walz said Vance ""will create stories to bring attention to this that vilified a large number of people who were here legally in the community of Springfield. The Republican governor said, it's not true. Don't do it.""

-- Walz, discussing the high rate of gun violence in the United States compared to other rich nations. Walz cautioned against using mental illness as a ""scapegoat"" for the country's high levels of gun violence rather than ""find solutions on this that protect the Second Amendment, protect our children, that settlement.""

- Walz, noting that he is a longtime gunowner and the need to address firearm deaths by suicide and violent crime.

-- Vance, responding to how Republicans should navigate potentially unpopular and dangerous realities that face women surrounding pregnancy. Vance, who opposes abortion, said Republicans ""have got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they, frankly, just don't trust us.""

-- Walz, criticizing Trump's record on abortion. Walz said Trump ""bragged"" about appointing three Supreme Court justices who would go on to join a majority ruling that overturned the abortion protections in Roe v. Wade. ""52 years of personal autonomy and then he tells us 'Oh, send it to the states,'"" Walz said of Trump.

-- Walz, discussing the riot at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Walz said Trump's rhetoric and refusal to concede defeat in the 2020 presidential election led to the riot at the U.S. Capitol and deep ensuing divisions across politics. ""All of us say there's no place for this,"" Walz said.

-- Vance, when asked whether Trump won the 2020 presidential election and if he would support efforts to contest the election which Trump carried out that have since been deemed illegal or unconstitutional. ""First of all, I think that we're focused on the future,"" Vance said. ""But what President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020, and my own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square."""
"Today in History: October 2, Marshall joins Supreme Court",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/today-in-history/october-2,2024-10-02T04:08:54Z,"On Oct. 2, 1967, Thurgood Marshall joined the U.S. Supreme Court at its first African American justice; he would serve on the bench for 24 years until his retirement in 1991.

Vance and Walz focus their attacks on the top of the ticket  --  not each other: VP debate takeaways,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/debate-takeaways-vance-walz-harris-trump-5b6f219b555416ff579764048ac238a1,2024-10-02T02:25:01Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice Presidential hopefuls Tim Walz and JD Vance squared off Tuesday night in what may be the last debate of the 2024 presidential campaign. It was the first encounter between Minnesota's Democratic governor and Ohio's Republican senator, following last month's debate between the tops of their tickets, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.

No more debates are on the political calendar before Election Day. Tuesday's confrontation came as the global stakes of the contest rose again as Iran fired missiles at Israel. The vice presidential hopefuls sparred over the violence in the Middle East, climate change and immigration. Here are some takeaways from Tuesday's debate.

Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel on Tuesday elicited a contrast between the Democratic and Republican tickets on foreign policy: Walz promised ""steady leadership"" under Harris while Vance pledged a return to ""peace through strength"" if Trump is returned to the White House.

The differing visions of what American leadership should look like overshadowed the sharp policy differences between the two tickets.

The Iranian threat to the region and U.S. interests around the world opened the debate, with Walz pivoting the topic to criticism of Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, then referenced the ""nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes"" and responding to global crises by tweet.

Vance, for his part, promised a return to ""effective deterrence"" under Trump against Iran, brushing back on Walz's criticism of Trump by attacking Harris and her role in the Biden administration.

""Who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years and the answer is your running mate, not mine,"" he said. He pointedly noted that the Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, happened ""during the administration of Kamala Harris.""

Vance and Walz trained the bulk of their attacks not on their on-stage rival, but on the running mates who weren't in the room.

Both vice presidential nominees sought to convey a genial mien as they lobbed criticism at Harris and Trump, respectively.

It was a reflection of the fact that most voters don't cast a ballot based on the vice president, and on a vice presidential nominee's historic role in serving as the attack dog for their running mates.

Walz pointedly attacked Trump for failing to meet his pledge of building a physical barrier across the entire U.S.-Mexico border at the country's southern neighbor's expense.

""Less than 2% of that wall got built and Mexico didn't pay a dime,"" Walz said.

Underscoring the focus on the top of the ticket, during a back-and-forth about immigration, Vance said to his opponent: ""I think that you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does.""

In the wake of the devastation of Hurricane Helene, Vance took a question about climate change and gave an answer about jobs and manufacturing, taking a detour around Trump's past claims that global warming is a ""hoax.""

Vance contended that the best way to fight climate change was to move more manufacturing to the United States, because the country has the world's cleanest energy economy. It was a distinctly domestic spin on a global crisis, especially after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the international Paris climate accords during his administration.

Walz also kept the climate change focus domestic, touting the Biden administration's renewable energy investments as well as record levels of oil and natural gas production. ""You can see us becoming an energy superpower in the future,"" Walz said.

It was a decidedly optimistic take on a pervasive and grim global problem.

The two running mates agreed that the number of migrants in the U.S. illegally is a problem. But each laid the blame on the opposing presidential nominee.

Vance echoed Trump by repeatedly calling Harris the ""border czar"" and suggested that she, as vice president, single-handedly rolled back the immigration restrictions Trump had imposed as president. The result, in Vance's telling, is an unchecked flow of fentanyl, strain on state and local resources and increased housing prices around the country.

Harris was never asked to be the ""border czar"" and she was never specifically given the responsibility for security on the border. She was tasked by Biden in March 2021 with tackling the ""root causes"" of migration from the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and pushing leaders there and in Mexico to enforce immigration laws. Harris was not empowered to set U.S. immigration policy -- only the president can sign executive orders and Harris was not empowered as Biden's proxy in negotiations with Congress on immigration law.

Walz advanced Democrats' arguments that Trump single-handedly killed a bipartisan Senate deal to tighten border security and boost the processing system for immigrants and asylum seekers. Republicans backed off the deal, Walz noted, only after Trump said it wasn't good enough."
Speaker Johnson lays out agenda for Republicans as they fight to hold House majority,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/house-republican-agenda-speaker-johnson-fb0d90c029b5ba595d3ef58b887794b5,2024-10-01T23:34:48Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speaker Mike Johnson laid out on Tuesday a policy agenda should Republicans take the majority next year that extends the tax cuts approved when Donald Trump was president, reduces the size of the federal workforce and gives parents more choice on where they can send their children to school.

Johnson emphasized five main policy points during a speech at the New York Stock Exchange. He talked of extending and building on the Trump tax cuts, confronting China, boosting oil and gas production, expanding school choice and cutting the size and scope of the federal government.

""The survival of the American dream depends upon our victory,"" Johnson said.

The speaker and House Republicans are fighting this election season to hold their narrow House majority, with just a handful of seats to spare. Republicans are hopeful that a Trump victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in the election will help propel them to majorities in the House and Senate, which would give them unified control of Washington for the first time since 2018 and the ability to enact a sweeping legislative agenda.

Against the campaign backdrop, Johnson provided a bleak view of the economy under President Joe Biden, though the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, inflation is on the decline and the unemployment rate is still low by historical standards. He spoke to an audience of Wall Street investors, traders and others who have witnessed stock markets reach record highs in recent days.

But Johnson said that as he has traveled the country, he's meeting business owners on the verge of collapse because of high inflation, high taxes and over-regulation. And he said he's met moms and dads who have resorted to donating plasma and setting up crowdfunding pages so that they didn't lose their homes.

""Our incredible people are hanging on right now in spite of so many unprecedented challenges, but many can't afford to do it much longer,"" Johnson said.

The first policy priority he outlined was enhanced tax breaks, citing specifically immediate expensing for research and development costs. He also cited the need for a ""strong"" child tax credit, though he did not provide specific numbers. He said the Republican tax policies would ""respect the dignity of work, and it doesn't pay people more for staying out of the workforce.""

Trump has laid out a series of tax cuts on the campaign trail, such as extending the expiring provisions of his 2017 overhaul, and not taxing tips and Social Security. Outside experts say the tax cuts proposed by Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris would cause the debt to rise even faster the pace under current law.

Doing more to confront China and rolling back environmental regulations are a common denominator for Republicans that Johnson embraced in his speech. On education, he said millions of Americans have the opportunity to send their children to a school that best fits their need, and ""Republicans want to expand that choice so that every American has that opportunity.""

Johnson also emphasized cutting the debt by cutting the size of the federal government, saying ""we're going to reduce the size of the federal workforce and root out a long list of non-essential jobs through the federal bureaucracy.""

Trump won't participate in interview for '60 Minutes' election special,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-cbs-60-minutes-harris-interview-759c54bf1b8225644dd7e69ae0ceb4a7,2024-10-01T22:57:11Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS News said Tuesday that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has declined to participate in an interview with ""60 Minutes"" for its election special, which will go forward next Monday with Democratic opponent Kamala Harris alone.

Television's top-rated news program regularly invites the two presidential contenders for separate interviews that air back-to-back on a show near the election. This year, it is scheduled for Monday instead of its usual Sunday time slot.

Asked for comment, the former president's campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said, ""Fake news,"" adding that there were discussions but nothing was ever locked in.

""60 Minutes"" said Trump's campaign had initially agreed to an interview before telling CBS that the former president would not appear. The network said its invitation to sit for an interview still stands, and correspondent Scott Pelley will explain Trump's absence to viewers.

Vice President Harris will appear in a pretaped interviewed with Bill Whitaker.

There are currently no other scheduled opportunities for voters to compare the two candidates together. Harris and Trump previously debated on Sept. 10. Although Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN for a second debate later this month, Trump has not accepted..

The interview special is scheduled to air Monday instead of the usual ""60 Minutes"" time slot because CBS is showing the American Music Awards on Sunday.

Trump's interview with ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl prior to the 2020 election proved contentious, with the former president ending the session early and his campaign posting an unedited transcript of the session."
Key swing state faces 'daunting' level of uncertainty after storm ravages multiple counties,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-voting-ballots-46a7fbecb44464409d796dd687d3cb9d,2024-10-01T19:37:24Z,"ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina election officials say they will do everything in their power to ensure that voters in the crucial presidential swing state will be able to cast their ballots despite the devastation of Hurricane Helene and the destruction of basic infrastructure only about a month before the November election.

Karen Brinson Bell, the executive director of the state's election board, said Tuesday that 12 county election offices in the hard-hit western part of the state remain closed after the storm unleashed ""unprecedented"" damage. Absentee ballots, some of which already have been mailed to voters who requested them, also face obstacles, from U.S. Postal Service delays to road and residential damage that could render them undeliverable. The viability of early and Election Day voting sites remains unknown, she said.

She described the storm as causing a ""daunting"" level of uncertainty, with early in-person voting scheduled to start in just over two weeks on Oct. 17. Still, she said the state is prepared to help voters navigate the emergency.

""We've battled through hurricanes and tropical storms and still held safe and secure elections, and we will do everything in our power to do so again,"" Brinson Bell told reporters during a media call. ""Mountain people are strong, and the election people who serve them are resilient and tough, too.""

Helene, which battered large swaths of the Southeast late last week with torrential rain and strong winds and massive storm surges along the Gulf Coast, caused devastation ""beyond belief"" in the popular mountain city of Asheville and other parts of western North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper said during a media briefing Tuesday.

""This disaster is unlike anything our state has ever experienced,"" he said.

The level of destruction could have far-reaching implications beyond the immediate damage to the flooded communities, especially if it has any impact on voting. North Carolina is among seven swing states being hotly contested by Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Trump barely defeated Democrat Joe Biden in the state four years ago, winning by about 74,500 votes out of 5.5 million cast.

Asheville is the most populous city in the 25-county region under a disaster declaration and is a Democratic stronghold. The counties surrounding it are largely Republican, so the eventual impact on any statewide race, including a nationally watched contest for governor, is unknown.

On Tuesday, emergency workers were still engaged in rescue efforts across the broad swath of the Southeastern U.S. that bore the brunt of the storm. Election officials in Florida, Tennessee and the presidential battleground of Georgia were assessing the damage and the potential impacts to mail balloting, early voting and Election Day operations.

Georgia election workers have returned to work even as some offices face power outages, limited internet and infrastructure damage. Absentee ballots are scheduled to go out on Oct. 7 as planned, said Robert Sinners, communications director for Georgia's secretary of state.

In North Carolina, officials said they are considering moving or combining voting locations if some are unusable or inaccessible.

More urgently, state officials are offering guidance and some special accommodations for absentee voters, who may not receive their ballots because of evacuations, suspended Postal Service operations or residential mailboxes swept away in the storm.

Paul Cox, general counsel for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said displaced voters can contact their county election office to request that their absentee ballot be spoiled and sent to a different location. They also can use the state's BallotTrax service to track their ballot's location.

Those voters also have the option of waiting to cast a ballot in person, either during the early voting period of Oct. 17 to Nov. 2 or on Election Day, Nov. 5, Cox said. State law requires all voters to show voter ID, but those who are from a county under a disaster declaration and have lost their ID can fill out an exception form so they can cast a ballot.

Officials are still weighing whether to take further steps to accommodate voters, such as extending the absentee ballot deadline or allowing more people to cast ballots through an online portal already used by military, overseas and visually impaired voters, Brinson Bell said.

The Postal Service said in a statement Monday that it is ""still assessing damage and impacts"" and is communicating with local election boards in the affected areas to ""ensure the ongoing transport and delivery of Election Mail as soon as it is safe to do so.""

Kelly Godfrey, who has lived in Asheville for over three years, is one of the few voters who returned their absentee ballot before the storm hit. In Buncombe County, which includes Asheville, nearly 9,990 voters had requested absentee ballots as of Tuesday -- 85% of them Democrats or voters who are not affiliated with any party, according to Associated Press election research. Only about 170 had been returned.

Godfrey said she hopes rules and procedures will be adjusted to make it easier for voters who were displaced by the storm. She worries that any changes could lead to misinformation and false claims of voter fraud after the election.

""It's going to be spun a lot of different ways,"" she said.

For now, though, voting feels ""so far out in the distance,"" Godfrey said. ""Right now, people are thinking food and water.""

Brinson Bell said officials were not aware of any physical damage to election offices or the voting equipment or ballots stored inside them, but they are in close communication with tabulation machine vendors should any machines need to be repaired or replaced.

Some of the county boards whose offices remain closed or are dealing with outages have been given special emergency kits from the state, which were initially intended for use in case of a ransomware attack, she said. The kits are equipped with laptops, cellphones, Wi-Fi hotspots and other essentials to allow election operations to continue even without power, phone or internet service.

"Wisconsin Democrats, Republicans pick new presidential electors following 2020 fake electors debacle",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-gop-democratic-presidential-electors-51e1dec76376e46ccb57b42bc0843704,2024-10-01T18:32:23Z,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Democrats and Republicans in Wisconsin picked new presidential electors on Tuesday, almost four years after Republicans from the state posed as fake electors for former President Donald Trump.

The Democratic and Republican legislative caucuses and legislative candidates met in the state Capitol to select 10 people from each party who will represent voters in the presidential election. The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which party's electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets after the election in December to certify the outcome.

Ten Wisconsin Republicans posed as fake electors for Trump in 2020, filing paperwork falsely saying he had won the battleground state. Democrats filed a lawsuit against them in 2022. The Republicans ultimately agreed to a settlement last year that called for them to admit they were trying to overturn President Joe Biden's victory, acknowledge Biden won the state and agree to never serve as presidential electors in 2024 or any other election involving Trump.

The 2024 Republican electors include Fond Du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney, state GOP chair Brian Schimming and former Gov. Tommy Thompson.

Democratic electors include Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley and Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez."
No one expects a judge's rollback of Georgia's abortion ban to be the last word,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-georgia-ban-overturned-appeal-ec732417c9c3b714ccee3b0c9e77bc7d,2024-10-01T18:23:21Z,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- When a Georgia judge overturned the state's abortion ban this week, abortion rights advocates praised the ruling and opponents denounced it -- all knowing the state's top court could put it on hold in coming days or weeks.

Any changes to abortion policy in Southern states could have an impact that resonates beyond their borders. Most states in the region have bans in place, forcing women who are seeking abortion procedures to travel to obtain them.

So as long as the ban is lifted, it could change abortion-related travel patterns. And the ruling puts another spotlight on a contested state in this year's presidential election, in which Democrats have sought to make abortion a major issue.

Here's a look at where things stand.

Georgia's abortion law violates women's rights to liberty and privacy guaranteed by the state constitution, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled Monday.

Since 2022, the law effectively prohibited abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy, which is before women often know they're pregnant. That's the point when cardiac activity in an embryo's cells can be detected by ultrasound. The law banned abortions once a ""detectable human heartbeat"" was present -- with some exceptions.

McBurney ruled that the law infringed on the liberty ""of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices."" He also wrote that Georgia gives women a constitutional right to privacy that includes making personal health decisions.

The judge wrote that his ruling reverts Georgia's abortion law to its prior status, which allowed abortions until viability, which is generally considered to be about 22 to 24 weeks' gestational age.

It was the judge's second ruling striking down the same law. In 2022, McBurney declared the law invalid because it was enacted by state lawmakers in 2019, when Roe v. Wade still protected abortion rights nationally.

The Georgia Supreme Court overturned that earlier ruling and sent the case back to McBurney to consider the merits of other legal arguments raised by abortion providers challenging the law. That paved the way for the Monday ruling.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, blasted the ruling, saying: ""Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives has been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge.""

Republican state Attorney General Chris Carr planned an immediate appeal to the state Supreme Court, a spokesperson said.

Advocates on both sides of the abortion debate in Georgia noted the state's high court could keep McBurney's order from taking effect while the state's appeal is pending.

It took the Georgia Supreme Court just over a week to overrule McBurney and reinstate the law after it was struck down the first time, in November 2022.

Georgia clinic officials told The Associated Press that they would accept patients whose pregnancies are past six weeks' gestation -- and also that they know the ban could be reimposed quickly.

That could make a big difference in the state. There were about 4,400 abortions monthly in Georgia before the ban took effect, and there have been about 2,400 monthly since then, according to estimates from the Society of Family Planning.

Allowing more abortions could mean that more women who want them can obtain them. It could also ease the flow of patients to clinics in other states, particularly North Carolina, the closest place where abortion is legal further into pregnancy. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that nearly 6,000 Georgia residents traveled to North Carolina for abortions last year.

Most Southern states have abortion bans that are either similar to the one overturned in Georgia or that are in effect at all stages of pregnancy.

So when a state lifts a ban, it could become a destination for people from nearby states seeking abortion. It's not clear whether that will happen in Georgia, given the possibility the state Supreme Court could reinstate the ban.

Even before this week, Georgia, a hotly contested state in the presidential election, has been a flashpoint in the political debate over abortion.

Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris traveled there last month to highlight reporting that two women in the state died after they didn't get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills to end their pregnancies. The vice president used the occasion to blast her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, for appointing justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who cleared the way for states to impose bans.

After Monday's ruling, it leaves 13 states with bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and three that bar them after the first six weeks or so of pregnancy."

The Democratic nominee plans to visit Georgia on Wednesday and survey the devastation in North Carolina in the coming days, according to aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the travel plans. Harris' team has been working to coordinate her plans to avoid impacting local disaster response efforts.

Harris had been scheduled to join her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on a bus tour across Pennsylvania on Wednesday, the day after he faced off with Ohio Sen. JD Vance in Tuesday night's vice presidential debate. Walz will instead be joined by Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman.

After Georgia, Harris plans to continue with scheduled campaign visits to Wisconsin and Michigan later this week, with the North Carolina trip coming sometime after that.

President Joe Biden will visit North Carolina on Wednesday, checking out the worst damage in the Asheville area by helicopter to avoid tying up local resources.

Republican nominee Donald Trump visited Georgia on Monday, where he spread falsehoods about the federal response to the storm despite claiming not to be politicizing the disaster."

Vance and Tim Walz could be the last debate of the 2024 campaign between the Republican and Democratic tickets.

Both Vance, a GOP senator from Ohio, and Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, have embraced the traditional role of attack dog for the person at the top of the ticket. That could be on full display during the vice presidential debate in New York hosted by CBS News.

Although conventional wisdom says the matchup between the candidates with second billing on the ticket seldom have much impact, polls are so tight that it could sway voters on the margins. It also could be the last head-to-head matchup between the tickets because Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, haven't agreed to a second meeting.

A new AP-NORC poll found that Walz is better liked than Vance, potentially giving the Republican an added challenge.

Although Vance has said he didn't ""have to prepare that much"" for the debate because he had ""well-developed views on public policy,"" he had been doing debate prep sessions with his wife, Usha Vance, senior aides, and Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who has played Walz, according to a person familiar with his preparations who requested anonymity to discuss strategy.

Walz's debate prep included sessions hunkered down in a Minneapolis hotel, with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg standing in for Vance, according to a person familiar with the process who requested anonymity to discuss the campaign's internal dynamics.

Trump was scheduled to speak about the economy Tuesday in the critical swing state of Wisconsin.

The former president was visiting a manufacturing facility in Waunakee, a suburb of Wisconsin's capital city of Madison in the Democratic stronghold of Dane County. Later he planned to hold an event at a museum in the state's largest city of Milwaukee, with hopes of reaching that city's conservative suburbs, where his support has softened.

Dane County, the location of Trump's first stop, is Wisconsin's fastest-growing county and an economic engine for the state, fueled by jobs in the health care and tech industries. It is also home to the University of Wisconsin.

""President Trump's appearance will be a big shot in the arm for demoralized conservatives here,"" the Dane County Republican Party Chairman Brandon Maly posted on X, the social media platform, when the visit was announced. He has said Trump must get at least 23% of the vote in Dane County to have a chance of winning statewide.

Democratic presidential candidates have long come to Dane County to hold massive rallies to fire up the base. Harris campaigned there on Sept. 20, holding a rally in Madison that attracted more than 10,000 people.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Harris cut short a campaign visit to Las Vegas to return to Washington for briefings while Trump headed to Georgia to see the storm's impact.

Hurricane Helene's death toll is more than 130 people and rising, with some of the worst damage caused by inland flooding in North Carolina.

In addition to being humanitarian crises, natural disasters can create political tests for elected officials, particularly in the closing weeks of a presidential campaign.

Presidents typically avoid racing toward disaster zones so they don't interfere with recovery efforts. The White House said Harris would visit impacted areas ""as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations.""

President Joe Biden planned to survey the devastation on Wednesday.

A GoFundMe campaign launched by former president Donald Trump to help the victims of Hurricane Helene has raised more than $1 million.

The website calls the effort ""an official response for MAGA supporters to offer their financial assistance to their fellow Americans impacted by Hurricane Helene"" and promises that all donations will be directed to those who have been impacted by the devastation.

Trump earlier Monday paid a visit to Valdosta, Georgia, and said he had brought with him supplies, including fuel, that will be distributed by the Christian relief group Samaritan's Purse.

Former President Trump criticized the Biden administration's response to the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Helene, even as his supporters have called for cuts to federal agencies that warn of weather disasters and deliver relief to hard-hit communities.

As president, Trump delayed disaster aid for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico and diverted money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to finance an effort to return undocumented migrants to Mexico. And Project 2025, backed by Trump supporters, would restructure FEMA to limit aid to states and says that the National Weather Service, which provides crucial data on hurricanes and other storms, ""should be broken up and downsized.""

President Biden criticized Trump for ""lying"" about federal contacts with Georgia officials during the response to Hurricane Helene. Trump falsely claimed during a Monday tour of the damage that Biden hadn't been in touch with the state's Republican governor. ""He's lying, and the governor told him he was lying.""

""I don't know why he does this,"" Biden continued. ""I don't care about what he says about me, but I care what he what he communicates to people that are in need. He implies that we're not doing everything possible. We are. We are.""

State election officials in North Carolina are gathering information about options available to voters in the counties hardest hit by Hurricane Helene and plan a press conference for Tuesday.

Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said during an emergency board meeting on Monday that she will be providing more information, including details on how voters could declare ""natural disaster"" as their reason for not being able to provide a photo ID.

The board met Monday to approve a resolution granting counties flexibility for holding weekly meetings required under state law to review absentee ballots. These meetings are required to begin every Tuesday between now and Election Day, officials said. The resolution passed unanimously."
NATO's long-time chief hands over to a former Dutch premier,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/nato-stoltenberg-rutte-ukraine-3cdef166024f303e1ccb964d31c294a7,2024-10-01T05:28:44Z,"BRUSSELS (AP) -- One of NATO's longest serving top officials, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, steps down on Tuesday and will hand over the reins to former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, as the military alliance confronts some of the biggest challenges in its history.

Stoltenberg, NATO's 13th secretary-general, took over in 2014, the year that ""little green men"" from Russia infiltrated Ukraine. Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula, sparking a defense spending buildup at the world's biggest security alliance that gathered pace over his term.

His tenure was surpassed only by Dutch diplomat Joseph Luns, who spent 12 years in charge of NATO.

A series of events to mark the handover will be held at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. NATO secretaries-general run the HQ, drive the alliance's working agenda, and speak on behalf of the 32-nation organization with one unifying voice. Continuity is usually the key word when they take up office.

Rutte becomes NATO's top civilian official as Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches the 1,000-day mark. Political uncertainty within the organization is also high, as election fever roils the United States, its unofficial ""chairman of the board"" and most powerful member.

Russian forces are making advances in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's army has a shaky hold on part of the Kursk region in Russia, which has provided a temporary morale boost, but as casualties mount it remains outmanned and outgunned.

Rutte will have to find new ways to encourage support for Ukraine among the allies, whose ranks have swelled to 32 countries since the invasion as Finland and Sweden joined to seek protection from Russia under NATO's security umbrella.

Across the Atlantic, surveys suggest the U.S. election in November will be a close race. It could see a return to the White House of Donald Trump, whose bluster during his last term of office about low defense spending among European allies and Canada undermined trust of NATO member countries.

It became an existential challenge, as smaller members feared that the U.S. under Trump would renege on NATO's security pledge that all countries must to come to the rescue of any ally in trouble, the foundation stone the alliance is built on.

Trump has been critical of U.S. aid to Ukraine, and he suggested last week that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy should have made concessions to Russian leader Vladimir Putin before he launched his invasion in 2022."
Trial on new Georgia election certification rules set to begin,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-state-election-board-rules-certification-trial-f35c4f568dcefdb16ebd54cd74643ff1,2024-10-01T05:20:53Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- A trial is set to get underway Tuesday on a lawsuit filed by Democrats challenging two new rules passed by the Georgia State Election Board that have to do with county certification of election results.

Supporters of the rules say they are necessary to ensure the accuracy of the vote totals before county election officials sign off on them. But critics say they worry that supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump could use the rules to delay or deny certification if the former president loses the state to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, causing confusion and casting doubt on the results.

The lawsuit is to be decided in a bench trial, which means there's a judge but no jury, before Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney.

One of the rules provides a definition of certification that includes requiring county officials to conduct a ""reasonable inquiry"" before certifying results, but it does not specify what that means. The other includes language allowing county election officials ""to examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections.""

The lawsuit was filed by the state and national Democratic parties, as well as county election board members, Democratic voters and two Democratic state lawmakers running for reelection. It asks the judge to confirm that election superintendents, which are multi-person election boards in most counties, have no discretion to withhold or delay certification. It also asks him to declare the two new rules invalid if he believes they allow such discretion.

The lawsuit was filed against the State Election Board, which is dominated by three Republican partisans whom Trump praised by name at a recent rally in Atlanta. The state and national Republican parties have joined the lawsuit on the side of the election board.

While the Democrats concede that the two certification rules may not be counter to Georgia law, they argue the rules were drafted on the assumption that certification by county officials is discretionary. They worry that some officials allied with Trump could use the new rules to try to refuse to certify the election results by the deadline set in law.

Lawyers for the state argue that the Democrats are asking the judge to reinforce what is already in state law -- that county certification must happen by 5 p.m. the Monday after the election, or the next day if that Monday is a holiday.

The Republicans who have a 3-2 majority on the State Election Board have used their power to pass numerous election rules in recent months, mostly over the objections of the Democratic appointee to the board and the nonpartisan chair. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, an association of county election officials and the state attorney general's office have all cautioned against adopting new rules so close to the general election, saying it could cause confusion and put unnecessary burden on election workers.

The new rules have drawn multiple lawsuits.

State and local Democrats, and some county election officials, on Monday filed a lawsuit challenging a rule that requires three poll workers to each count the paper ballots -- not votes -- by hand at polling places once voting ends on election day.

A separate lawsuit filed by a group led by a former Republican lawmaker initially challenged the two certification rules and was amended last week to also challenge the ballot-counting rule and some others that the board passed."

Walz and Vance will meet in their first and possibly only vice presidential debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/vance-walz-vice-presidential-debate-election-66ff2e5e45a8dda55b0a2242fc238fdc,2024-10-01T04:21:37Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tim Walz and JD Vance will meet for their first and possibly only vice presidential debate Tuesday, in what could be the last debate for both campaigns to argue their case before the election.

The debate in New York hosted by CBS News will give Vance, a Republican freshman senator from Ohio, and Walz, a two-term Democratic governor of Minnesota, the chance to introduce themselves, make the case for their running mates, and go on the attack against the opposing ticket.

Tuesday's matchup could have an outsized impact. Polls have shown Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump locked in a close contest, giving added weight to anything that can sway voters on the margins, including the impression left by the vice presidential candidates. It also might be the last debate of the campaign, with the Harris and Trump teams failing to agree on another meeting.

The role of a presidential running mate is typically to serve as an attack dog for the person at the top of the ticket, arguing against the opposing presidential candidate and their proxy on stage. Both Vance and Walz have embraced that role.

Vance's occasionally confrontational news interviews and appearances on the campaign trail have underscored why Trump picked him for the Republican ticket despite his past biting criticisms of the former president, including once suggesting Trump would be ""America's Hitler.""

Walz, meanwhile, catapulted onto Harris' campaign by branding Trump and Republicans as "" just weird,"" creating an attack line for Democrats seeking to argue Republicans are disconnected from the American people.

A new AP-NORC poll found that Walz is better liked than Vance, potentially giving the Republican an added challenge.

After a Harris-Trump debate in which Republicans complained about the ABC News moderators fact-checking Trump, Tuesday's debate will not feature any corrections from the hosts. CBS News said the onus for pointing out misstatements will be on the candidates, with moderators ""facilitating those opportunities.""

Ahead of the debate, allies of both men were lowering expectations that their candidate will have a decisive performance.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., called Vance ""an accomplished debater"" and contrasted that with Walz, saying he was ""not a lawyer-debater type."" Klobuchar said Walz spent time growing up thinking about football, not debating.

Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, portrayed Walz much differently than Klobuchar.

""Tim Walz is very good in debates, really good. He's been a politician for nearly 20 years. He'll be very well prepared for tomorrow night,"" Miller told reporters Monday. He predicted the Democratic governor of Minnesota will be much more ""buttoned up"" than he is on the campaign trail and ready to defend his record, but added, ""That's not to say that JD Vance won't be prepared tomorrow, or that somehow he isn't up to the challenge.""

Vance, speaking to reporters last week, said he didn't ""have to prepare that much"" for the debate because he had ""well-developed views on public policy.""

But Vance has been doing debate prep sessions where he's been joined by his wife, Usha Vance, Miller, senior Vance aides, and Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who has played Walz, according to a person familiar with his preparations who requested anonymity to discuss strategy. Moderating their mock debates was Monica Crowley, who served in the Trump administration, hosts a podcast and contributed to Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for remaking government that Trump claims he knows "" nothing about.""

""JD Vance is prepared to wipe the floor with Tim Walz and expose him for the radical liberal he is,"" Emmer told reporters on Monday.

Walz's debate prep has included sessions hunkered down in a Minneapolis hotel, with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg standing in for Vance, according to a person familiar with the process who requested anonymity to discuss the campaign's internal dynamics. Others helping in the preparations include Rob Friedlander and Zayn Siddique, who helped Harris prepare for her debate with Trump, along with other aides to Walz and the campaign.

Klobuchar said Walz will show the American people ""a real person"" who brings ""buoyancy"" and positivity to the debate stage that will contrast with Vance, but ""he is not going to be shy about pointing out the problems.""

""Just because he's an optimistic, positive person doesn't mean he's a pushover,"" she said.

The Biden administration pledged more than $8 billion in continued support to Ukraine, guaranteeing military aid until a new U.S. administration takes power.

But Zelenskyy found himself briefly mired in domestic politics before meeting with Trump in New York.

And the Ukrainian's leader's longer-term strategic aim -- convincing his allies to adopt a victory plan that he is promoting -- remains elusive and out of his control, analysts and officials said. So does the aim of using far-reaching Western weapons against Russia, the most immediate element of Zelenskyy's plan.

Zelenskyy's visit to an ammunition plant in the swing state of Pennsylvania upset Republicans and House Speaker Mike Johnson fired off an open letter saying the visit was part of a partisan campaign to support Democrats. He demanded that Zelenskyy fire his ambassador to the U.S., which hasn't happened.

There was talk of a meeting with Republican candidate Donald Trump being called off but the two men met in New York on Friday. Zelenskyy also irritated some Republications when he told The New Yorker that Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican nominee for vice president, ""is too radical.""

Still, Zelenskyy presented his vision for victory to both Trump, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden, and walked away with more assistance, which will guarantee that Ukraine will be able to count on American aid until the new administration comes to power.

""The outcome of these two meetings was that Ukraine publicly showed it is engaging equally with both candidates. Ukraine has no favorites and is ready for open, normal relations with any future administration,"" said Oleksandr Kraiev, an analyst from the Foreign Policy Council Ukrainian Prism.

But the Biden administration's red line remains long-range Western weapons to strike deep inside Russia, even though Ukraine has long been lobbying for the U.S. to drop that limit.

The U.S. fears escalation but Zelenskyy thinks providing Ukraine with such capabilities would be a step toward ending the war, presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said.

""The lifting of these informal restrictions will undoubtedly serve as a key indicator that decisive steps toward ending the war have been taken,"" Podolyak said. ""Of course, this won't lead to an immediate end to everything. But we want to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and we want to understand how and when this war will be resolved.""

Ukraine's leadership is waiting for the next meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at Ramstein Air Base in Germany -- defense leaders from the 50-plus partner nations who regularly gather to coordinate weapons aid for the war. There, Ukraine will see how the group has digested a victory plan that Zelenskyy has been presenting.

Zelenskyy hasn't publicly presented that plan, but U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield of the U.S. said on Sept. 17 that she had seen parts of it and that ""it lays out a strategy and plan that can work.""

Podolyak said that Ukraine ""succeeded in delivering the message"" with respect to the resources required to sustain its defenses in the current, and potentially decisive, stage of the war.""

No public pledges of support were made for Ukraine's vision during the meetings, but Podolyak says Kyiv anticipated that a response to the victory plan would likely come during the Ramstein meeting on Oct. 12.

""We just need to wait a little, as our partner countries are now holding internal discussions,"" he said. ""We will see the results soon enough.""

Ukrainian lawmakers have been trying to win over Trump-allied officials for months, two of them said. One lawmaker said that attempts to solicit Republicans sympathetic to Ukraine's cause haven't yielded breakthroughs. He spoke on condition of anonymity in order to speak freely about sensitive matters.

Zelenskyy said that everything necessary for Ukraine to win the war with Russia is ""on the partner's table"" - an indication Kyiv has no option but to wait for their decision.

He made this statement while addressing the nation at the end of his trip to the U.S.

""The victory plan has been presented to America, and we have explained every point,"" he said.

But analysts and lawmakers said Ukraine sees both presidential candidates as potentially problematic.

Many are concerned by Trump's claims that the war could be resolved quickly, fearing that could mean negotiating on Russia's terms, potentially involving territorial concessions and giving up on security guarantees from Western allies.

Meanwhile, others said they believe Harris would continue Biden's foreign policy, which many Ukrainians and outside observers say is driven primarily by fear of wider war rather than than a well thought-out strategy for beating Russia.

Allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles would be one crucial signal that the US is committed to bolstering Kyiv's hand in the long and difficult war.

""Biden is too cautious to give this permission before the elections,"" another lawmaker on the foreign policy committee said, speaking on condition of anonymity to openly discuss sensitive matters. ""But once the elections are over he might give this permission,"" he said, echoing a hope that many Ukrainian officials have."
"Claudia Sheinbaum to be sworn in as 1st female president of Mexico, a country with pressing problems",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-7d3599b39a7298df46e7eda34d80afee,2024-10-01T04:18:42Z,"MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Claudia Sheinbaum will take the oath of office Tuesday as Mexico's first female president in more than 200 years of independence, promising to protect an expanded social safety net and fight for the poor like her predecessor, but facing pressing problems.

The 62-year-old scientist-turned-politician will receive a country with a number of immediate challenges, foremost among them stubbornly high levels of violence, a sluggish economy and hurricane-battered Acapulco.

Sheinbaum romped to victory in June with nearly 60% of the vote, propelled largely by the sustained popularity of her political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

He took office six years ago declaring ""For the good of all, first the poor,"" and promising historical change from the neoliberal economic policies of his predecessors. Sheinbaum promised continuity from his popular social policies to controversial constitutional reforms to the judiciary and National Guard rammed through during his final days in office.

Despite her pledge of continuity, she is a very different personality.

""López Obrador was a tremendously charismatic president and many times that charisma allowed him to cover up some political errors that Claudia Sheinbaum will not have that possibility of doing,"" said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political analyst at Mexico's Center for Economic Research and Teaching. ""So, where López Obrador was charismatic, Claudia Sheinbaum will have to be effective.""

He is not leaving her an easy situation.

Her first trip as president will be to the flood-stricken Pacific coast resort of Acapulco.

Hurricane John, which struck as a Category 3 hurricane last week and then reemerged into the ocean and struck again as a tropical storm, caused four days of incredibly heavy rain that killed at least 17 people along the coast around Acapulco. Acapulco was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, and had not recovered from that blow when John hit.

Sheinbaum must also deal with raging violence in the cartel-dominated northern city of Culiacan, where factional fighting within the Sinaloa cartel broke out after drug lords Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after they flew there in a small plane on July 25.

López Obrador has long sought to avoid confronting Mexico's drug cartels and has openly appealed to the gangs to keep the peace among themselves, but the limitations of that strategy have become glaringly apparent in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, where gun battles have raged on the city's streets. Local authorities and even the army -- which López Obrador has relied on for everything -- have essentially admitted that the fighting will only end when the cartel bosses decide to end it.

But that's only the latest hotspot.

Drug-related violence is surging from Tijuana in the north to Chiapas in the south, displacing thousands.

While Sheinbaum inherits a huge budget deficit, unfinished construction projects and a burgeoning bill for her party's cash hand-out programs -- all of which could send financial markets tumbling -- perhaps her biggest looming concern is the possibility of a victory for Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.

Trump has already vowed to slap 100% tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico. Though that would likely violate the current U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, there are other things Trump could do to make life difficult for Sheinbaum, including his pledge of massive deportations.

Things with its northern neighbor were already tense after López Obrador said he was putting relations with the U.S. embassy ""on pause"" after public criticism of the proposed judicial overhaul.

First lady Jill Biden struck an optimistic tone for relations with the incoming Sheinbaum administration saying at a reception Monday that, ""Under Dr. Sheinbaum's presidency I know we will continue to build a more prosperous, safe and democratic region -- and take the steps in our U.S.-Mexico partnership.""

There are areas where Sheinbaum could try to take Mexico in a new direction. For example, she has a Ph.D. in energy engineering and has spoken of the need to address climate change. López Obrador built a massive new oil refinery and poured money into the state-owned oil company. But his budget commitments do not leave her much room to maneuver.

Jennifer Piscopo, professor of gender and politics at the Royal Holloway University of London who has studied Latin America for decades, said Mexico electing its first female leader is important because it will show girls they can do it too, but it can also create unrealistic expectations.

""Woman firsts are powerful symbols, but they do not gain magic power,"" she said. ""Especially when the governance challenges are so large, expecting magic solutions overnight can also generate outsized disappointment."""
Trump heads to Wisconsin's critical Democratic stronghold ahead of vice presidential debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-biden-wisconsin-debate-walz-vance-60307f1fa8530c60a7f7cde721260efc,2024-10-01T04:17:51Z,"Trump is scheduled to appear at a manufacturing facility in Waunakee, a suburb of Wisconsin's capital city of Madison in the Democratic stronghold of Dane County. Trump has never campaigned in Dane County before and didn't visit as president.

Later on Tuesday, Trump is expected to hold an event at a museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin's largest city and home to the largest number of Democratic voters and second-largest number of Republicans. His appearance there will also give him reach into the city's conservative suburbs, a part of Wisconsin where his support has softened but where he must do well to win.

Trump is expected to focus his comments on the economy. On Saturday, he held a rally in western Wisconsin where he blamed Harris for crimes committed by people in the country illegally.

Both stops come ahead of Tuesday's debate between Trump's running mate JD Vance, a senator from Ohio, and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota.

Dane County, the location of Trump's first stop, is Wisconsin's fastest-growing county and an economic engine for the state, fueled by jobs in the healthcare and tech industries. It is also home to the University of Wisconsin.

Dane County's population grew by about 30,000 people between 2016 and 2020. It has gone up by another 13,000 since then, based on the most recent U.S. Census Bureau estimate.

That presents a challenge for Republicans, especially given that nearly 90% of registered voters in the county cast a ballot in 2020. President Joe Biden won 75% of the vote that year in Dane County, beating Trump by 181,000 votes in the county while carrying the state by fewer than 21,000. Hillary Clinton beat Trump in Dane County in 2016 by 47 points, and Trump won the state by less than a point.

Still, Dane County is home to the third-largest number of Republican voters of any county statewide.

""President Trump's appearance will be a big shot in the arm for demoralized conservatives here,"" the Dane County Republican Party Chairman Brandon Maly posted on X, the social media platform, when the visit was announced. He has said Trump must get at least 23% of the vote in Dane County to have a chance of winning statewide.

Democratic presidential candidates have long come to Dane County to hold massive rallies to fire up the base. Harris campaigned there on Sept. 20, holding a rally in Madison that attracted more than 10,000 people.

Waunakee, which bills itself as the ""only Waunakee in the world,"" is slightly more Republican than the county as a whole. In 2020, Trump got 36% of the vote there compared to less than 23% countywide.

Trump is expected to speak at Dane Manufacturing, a metal fabricator that has a long history of hosting Republican candidates and officeholders. In Milwaukee, Trump will speak at Discovery World, a science and technology museum along the shores of Lake Michigan."
Melania Trump admits she's worried about her husband's safety as November election looms: 'Toxic atmosphere',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/melania-trump-admits-shes-worried-about-her-husbands-safety-november-election-looms-toxic-atmosphere,2024-10-08T23:12:17Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former first lady Melania Trump admitted she's worried about her husband former President Trump's safety in the final weeks leading up to the November election and blamed Democrats for creating a ""toxic atmosphere.""

""I think, you know, when they call him, he's a threat to democracy, let's ask ourselves who is really a threat to democracy. They are ongoing with lawfare against the former president, as well as, you know, trying to get him off of the voting ballots and trying to silence him,"" she said Tuesday on ""The Five.""

""So, yes, of course, I was always afraid [of] what can happen and that they continue with that kind of language [that] is just - it's a toxic, toxic atmosphere.""

Former President Trump has faced two assassination attempts on his life. The first was in Butler, Pa., in July when would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks fired shots that grazed his ear. The second came in September when suspected would-be assassin Ryan Routh was spotted at the 2024 GOP presidential nominee's golf course in West Palm Beach, Fla., allegedly poking a rifle out of the tree line near where Trump was playing golf.

Besides reflecting on the danger surrounding her husband, Melania Trump also opened up about her priorities and goals should she return to the White House next year and vowed to continue her ""Be Best"" and ""Fostering the Future"" initiatives for children and women.

MELANIA TRUMP: EDUCATION IS THE KEY TO INNOVATION AND INDIVIDUAL EXCEPTIONALISM

She launched the ""Fostering the Future"" initiative after leaving the White House in 2021, which seeks to secure educational opportunities and scholarships for children in the foster care community, according to a description on her website.

""I have many students now in, so I will continue with that, and we need to give back to those children and support them so once they have education, they could have a great job, and after that, they could give back to communities,"" Trump told ""The Five.""

Co-host Judge Jeanine Pirro asked the former first lady what message she'd send to women who are on the fence about voting for her husband in November.

""Well, we could see in the four years that he was there, [the] country was in great shape. [The] country was safe. [The] country was prosperous. And he would bring that back,"" she said

MELANIA TRUMP SAYS SHE'S BEEN VICTIM OF 'MISREPRESENTATION' IN THE MEDIA AS SHE PROMOTES MEMOIR

Fellow co-host Greg Gutfeld asked whether there's anything the former first lady would share about her husband that most people don't know.

""Well, I have some stories, and Jesse [Watters], you read it in the book. So they're kind of, you know, cute, nice stories. And he's very warm. He's fun. He has a great personality and all he wants... He's very passionate about this country,"" Melania responded, referring to the release of her memoir, which came out Tuesday.

'Abandon Harris' group endorses Jill Stein over 'pro-genocide candidate' Kamala,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/abandon-harris-group-endorses-jill-stein-over-pro-genocide-candidate-kamala,2024-10-08T23:08:07Z,"Former Navy SEAL Cameron Hamilton discusses Israel's position as war develops in the Middle East.

A group that has labeled Vice President Harris a ""pro-genocide candidate"" has endorsed third-party presidential candidate Jill Stein in the 2024 contest.

The Abandon Harris campaign says America, as well as presidential candidates Harris and former President Trump, is supporting an ""Israeli project of Palestinian annihilation"" and urges Muslim Americans and those who oppose genocide to cast their ballot for the Green Party this year.

""In October 2023, under the darkening shadow of the U.S.-backed Israeli project of Palestinian annihilation, the Abandon Harris campaign - formerly Abandon Biden - was born. Our movement remains dedicated to ensuring that the American people, especially the Muslim-American community, recognize the responsibility we share in standing up against oppression and using all our power to stop genocide - wherever it may arise,"" the group declared in a press release.

ABANDON BIDEN CAMPAIGN RELAUNCHES, TARGETS HARRIS IN KEY SWING STATES

""We are confronting two destructive forces: one currently overseeing a genocide and another equally committed to continuing it. Both are determined to see it through. We call on Muslim-Americans and all those who stand firmly against genocide to vote for the Green Party in 2024,"" the press release states.

Stein has expressed her gratitude to the group and its support of her candidacy.

The Abandon Harris campaign says on its website that its ""current goal is to hold Harris accountable for her continued support of genocide.""

""It's painfully obvious that Kamala Harris can only sound articulate and firm when parroting US support for Israel,"" the group wrote in an August post on X. ""She fumbles through everything else, but when it comes to endorsing the killing of Palestinians, she suddenly finds a pristine level of eloquence,"" the post added.

Israel launched a war effort last year in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks perpetrated by Hamas terrorists who committed atrocities that included rapes, kidnappings, and murders.

""What Hamas did that day was pure evil - it was brutal and sickening,"" Harris said in a statement marking the one-year anniversary of the attack on Monday. ""I will do everything in my power to ensure that the threat Hamas poses is eliminated, that it is never again able to govern Gaza, that it fails in its mission to annihilate Israel, and that the people of Gaza are free from the grip of Hamas,"" she declared in the statement.

""Hamas's terrorist attack on October 7 launched a war in Gaza. I am heartbroken over the scale of death and destruction in Gaza over the past year - tens of thousands of lives lost, children fleeing for safety over and over again, mothers and fathers struggling to obtain food, water, and medicine. It is far past time for a hostage and ceasefire deal to end the suffering of innocent people. And I will always fight for the Palestinian people to be able to realize their right to dignity, freedom, security, and self-determination,"" Harris said in the statement."
Howard Stern tells Harris sun will 'go out' if she loses: 'We're in for the darkest skies on the planet',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/howard-stern-tells-harris-sun-go-out-she-loses-were-darkest-skies-planet,2024-10-08T22:11:42Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Sirius XM radio host Howard Stern suggested Tuesday there would be a climate catastrophe if Vice President Kamala Harris did not win the 2024 election.

During an hour-long live interview with the Democratic presidential candidate, Stern repeatedly ripped into Harris' opponent, former President Trump, and expressed disbelief that anyone would vote for him. At one point, he claimed the sun would ""go out"" if Trump was re-elected.

""With all this pressure on you right now, and you've got to win, you just have to,"" he told Harris. ""I really believe we're in for the darkest skies on the planet, like the sun's literally going to go out. God bless you for doing this,"" he said about her presidential bid.

At one point, Stern said he didn't even like comedians portraying Harris on ""Saturday Night Live"" because there was ""too much at stake"" in the election.

KAMALA HARRIS TELLS 'THE VIEW' SHE CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING SHE WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY FROM BIDEN

""I hate it. I don't want you being made fun of,"" Stern told Harris of actress Maya Rudolph portraying her on ""Saturday Night Live.""

""There's too much at stake. I believe the entire future of this country right now, land of the brave, home of the free, it's literally on the line,"" he said.

Harris said she thought the portrayal was funny but confessed she ""literally loses sleep"" about ""what is at stake in this election.""

""I end the day, pretty much every day these days, asking, 'What can I do more?' The stakes are so high,"" she told Stern.

At another point, Stern defended the idea of people going to therapy, and asked Harris if she could ""unload"" from the pressures she's under at a therapist's office.

""This is my form of therapy right now, Howard,"" Harris joked, before explaining she had support from her friends and husband when she needed someone to talk to.

FOUR CELEBRITIES WHO HAVE REJECTED CONSERVATIVE FANS: 'I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR YOU'

Stern's interview with Harris also covered the vice president's career as a prosecutor, her relationship with her husband Doug Emhoff, her pledge to bring Republicans into her cabinet if elected, and a discussion on whether voters were ready to elect a female presidential candidate.

The softball interview follows Stern telling his audience last month that he hates Trump supporters.

""I don't agree with Trump politically, I don't think he should be anywhere near the White House. I don't hate the guy. I hate the people who vote for him. I think they're stupid. I do. I'll be honest with you, I have no respect for you,"" he said on his show in September.

Harris' appearance on Stern's show came after she sat down for a friendly interview on ABC's ""The View."" Her friendly media blitz will continue Tuesday night on ""The Late Show,"" where she will be interviewed by Democratic Party supporter and comedian Stephen Colbert.

On CBS' ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, Harris repeatedly dodged questions about her economic policy proposals and if the Biden administration's immigration policies were ""a mistake.""

While Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have ramped up their media appearances in recent weeks, the Democratic ticket still lags behind the Republican ticket in the number of formal interviews they have sat for.

Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, have sat down for at least 69 interviews since the Harris-Walz ticket was formed, compared to at least 31 non-scripted interviews for the Democratic presidential ticket thus far."

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Biden undermines Harris claim that Ron DeSantis is politicizing hurricane response: 'Doing a great job',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-undermines-harris-claim-ron-desantis-politicizing-hurricane-response-doing-great-job,2024-10-08T21:36:12Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

President Joe Biden praised GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for being ""cooperative"" and doing a ""great job"" in his response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, despite Vice President Kamala Harris slamming DeSantis for ""playing political games"" instead of doing his job in response to the storms.

NBC News reported Monday that DeSantis was denying phone calls from Harris' team. ""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games with this moment, in these crisis situations, these are the height of emergency situations, it's just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris told reporters Monday.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, President Joe Biden's opinion about the GOP Florida governor's response to Hurricane Helene and his preparation for Milton, diverged substantially from that of his vice president's.

""The governor of Florida has been cooperative. He said he's gotten all that he needs. I talked to him again yesterday, and I said - no - you're doing a great job, it's all being done well and we thank you for it,"" Biden said at a press conference from the White House Tuesday. ""There was a rough start in some places, but every governor, every governor - from Florida to North Carolina - has been fully cooperative and supportive.""

RON DESANTIS: 51 COUNTIES ARE UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY

After a DeSantis staffer told NBC on Monday that the Florida governor had chosen not to take the vice president's call, DeSantis later clarified that he was never even aware Harris was trying to contact him.

DeSantis also shot back at Harris' claims that he was playing politics with the storm, accusing her of being the actual culprit of engaging in political gamesmanship.

""I've worked on these hurricanes under both President Trump and President Biden. Neither of them ever tried to politicize it. She has never called on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president until apparently now,"" DeSantis told ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday morning following reports of the vice president's criticism. ""Why, all of the sudden, is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown any interest in the past? We know it's because of politics, we know it's because of her campaign.""

""Harris is not even in the chain of command. She has no role in this,"" DeSantis added. ""The idea that I should be, like, worrying about her when I'm focused on the task at hand is just quite frankly absurd.""

BIDEN CANCELS OVERSEAS TRIP AS MILTON BEARS DOWN ON FLORIDA; DESANTIS TELLS VP 'IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU KAMALA'

Biden, who has had multiple phone calls with DeSantis since Hurricane Helene began barreling down on the Southeast, told him and Tampa Mayor Jane Castor to ""call him directly"" if any further support is needed. DeSantis, meanwhile, noted Tuesday morning that ""every"" one of his federal requests for more support have been answered.

DeSantis pointed out as well that, at the state level, he has been reallocating resources as necessary to help Florida's smaller communities that have fewer resources.

Islamic group calls out Jets for firing Robert Saleh after wearing Lebanon pin amid Israel war,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/islamic-group-calls-out-jets-firing-robert-saleh-after-wearing-lebanon-pin-amid-israel-war,2024-10-08T21:12:39Z,"Emmanuel Acho reacts to the New York Jets firing HC Robert Saleh after a 20-36 record and 2-3 start this season.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) released a statement on Tuesday addressing the firing of former New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh.

CAIR called on the Jets and owner Woody Johnson to explain reports that Saleh was escorted out of the building by security following his firing, and also brought up the fact that Saleh was fired just days after wearing a pin with the Lebanese flag amid ongoing attacks on the nation by Israel.

Saleh is of Lebanese descent and was the first Muslim head coach in NFL history.

""We commend Coach Robert Saleh for making history as the first American Muslim head coach in NFL history. Although no one should jump to conclusions about why the Jets fired Coach Saleh, the report that Jets security physically escorted Saleh out of the building does raise concerns about the possible motive for such unusual hostility -- especially given that Saleh wore a Lebanese flag pin at a game just days ago and that owner Woody Johnson is a former Trump administration official who has been accused of making racially charged remarks. We encourage the Jets to thoroughly explain its unusually hostile reported treatment of Coach Saleh,"" the statement read.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Jets for comment multiple times but has not received a response at the time of publication.

Both of Saleh's parents were born in Lebanon and immigrated to the United States ahead of his birth in 1979. Saleh previously wore the Lebanese flag on his arm during a game against the Giants, just weeks after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

Saleh wore that patch during the week that NFL executive vice president of club business Peter O'Reilly released a statement encouraging players to represent their heritage via decals to the back of their helmets with their flags, while coaches added a patch to their team gear.

Saleh's decision to wear the patch in London on Sunday came amid Israel's ongoing strikes on Lebanon and Gaza as it seeks to combat Hamas and Hezbollah.

CAIR's point that Johnson ""has been accused of making racially charged remarks,"" references an investigation in 2020 that never confirmed whether Johnson made those remarks. Johnson was accused of making racist and sexist comments to staff while serving as an ambassador to the United Kingdom under the Trump administration. Johnson was investigated in July 2020 by the State Department watchdog after the allegations.

Johnson denied the allegations in a post on the official X (then known as Twitter) account for the U.S. ambassador to the U.K. that same month.

""I have followed the ethical rules and requirements of my office at all times. These false claims of insensitive remarks about race and gender are totally inconsistent with my longstanding record and values,"" Johnson wrote.

The investigation's findings have never been made public.

At the time, Johnson was not involved with the Jets, as he was tending to his diplomatic duties for Trump. Still, the Jets released a statement regarding the allegations against Johnson and noted his denial of them.

""Since the Johnson family became owners of the New York Jets, the organization has consistently and actively supported, engaged and encouraged the development of many different social justice, diversity, women's, and inclusion initiatives,"" the team said in a statement. ""One of our fundamental principles is treating employees, players, coaches and fans with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, color, religion, or gender. These principles have been established by the Johnson family, which Woody implemented in our organization over the past 20 years.""

Saleh was hired by the Jets in January 2021 while Johnson was in the final month of his duties as ambassador to the U.K. Therefore, the owner did not make the final decision to hire Saleh. It was Johnson's brother, Christopher Johnson, who made the decision to hire Saleh.

When Trump left office and Woody Johnson returned to his duties as Jets owner, he kept Saleh employed for three straight seasons, none of which resulted in trips to the playoffs or winning records. Saleh went 20-36 with New York and never won more than seven games a year while at the helm.

Then, when Saleh was fired on Tuesday, the coach was reportedly escorted out of the team facility by security, according to multiple reports. The most recent head coach to be fired by the Jets, Adam Gase, was fired after the conclusion of his second season and was reportedly not removed by security.

The Jets were off to a 2-3 start this year after losing to the Minnesota Vikings 23-17 in London on Sunday, as New York is among the most penalized teams in the league this year. The Jets have struggled this year despite veteran star quarterback Aaron Rodgers starting all five games this season."
"If 2024 polling errors mirror those in 2020 election, Trump 'wins in a blowout,' CNN data guru says",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/2024-polling-errors-mirror-those-2020-election-trump-wins-blowout-cnn-data-guru-says,2024-10-08T20:50:50Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said Tuesday that if the 2024 presidential election polls are as off as they were in 2020, former President Trump ""wins in a blowout.""

Enten broke down current swing state polling numbers between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump, noting that they show a race ""too close to call."" However, he pointed out that polls have been off significantly in recent elections, and if that's the case this time, Trump could win by a landslide.

""But let's say we have a polling miss like we had in 2020,"" Enten told CNN anchor John Berman.

""What happens then? Well, then Donald Trump wins the election in a blowout with 312 electoral votes because he carries all these Great Lake battleground states plus Nevada, plus the other states he was leading in -- Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia,"" he said.

CNN DATA GURU SAYS HARRIS STRUGGLING WITH 'UNDERPERFORMANCE' FROM YOUNG VOTERS AMID TAYLOR SWIFT ENDORSEMENT

The reporter began by displaying the close race numbers between Trump and Harris in the seven battleground states. As his aggregate polls showed, Harris is up by one point in Nevada and Pennsylvania, and up by two in Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump, on the other hand, is up by one in North Carolina and Georgia, and two points up in Arizona.

Enten reminded viewers that these point differences are within the polling margin of error according to FiveThirtyEight, so currently, it's impossible to know who is winning.

He mentioned that on average since 1972 - provided that presidential candidates are polling within ten points of one another ­- swing state polls have an error rate of 3.4 points, so there is room for the actual race to swing in Harris' or Trump's favor when they're within one or two points of each other.

He further noted that in 5% of cases, swing state polling can be off by 9.4 points, making things even less certain for people looking at the polls right now.

""So, the bottom line is, the state polling averages tell us- what it tells us is it's just a race that is too close to call. Maybe one candidate has an advantage over the other one. But the bottom line is, it is way too close to call and it will remain so,"" he said.

Still, Enten offered multiple hypothetical situations, the first one being what the election results would look like if the current swing state polling is 100% accurate. ""If the polls are exactly right, Kamala Harris gets 276 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 262 because she carries those Great Lake battleground states despite losing North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona.""

He then followed up by showing what would happen if polling errors matched those found in the 2020 election. According to Vanderbilt University, polls overstated President Biden's lead over Trump by 3.9 percentage in the two weeks prior to election day, calling it the ""largest polling error since 1980 when support for Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter was overestimated by 6 percentage points.""

Enten argued if today's polls had the similar errors of the last cycle, Trump could walk away with 312 electoral college votes to Harris' 226.

Conversely, Enten discussed what would happen if polling errors predicting a red wave in the 2022 midterm elections appeared on Nov. 5, 2024.

""What happens if we have a polling miss like 2022?"" he asked. ""Well, in that particular case, now, the winner has flipped again. And Kamala Harris wins in a blowout with 319 electoral votes because she retakes those Great Lake battleground states, carries North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona."""
"Reporter's Notebook: With no government shutdown, it feels like Christmas in September",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/reporters-notebook-no-government-shutdown-feels-like-christmas-september,2024-10-08T20:39:29Z,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the latest news emerging from Hurricane Helene as FEMA struggles with funding.

Triangles of orange and yellow candy corn are now spread around the house. Reese's Cups have now morphed into chocolate and peanut butter pumpkins from their original, fluted wafer form. The dog regularly freaks out when you take it for a walk and some mechanical ghoul begins cackling in an evil laugh when you 'round a corner in your neighborhood.

The calendar flipped seamlessly from September to October. It's especially seamlessly in Congress. And while September is ""government shutdown season"" on Capitol Hill, Congress escaped unscathed this year. Bipartisan lawmakers approved a stopgap spending measure which keeps the lights on through Dec. 20. That's why those who toil on Capitol Hill - or for the federal government - can enjoy the ""Halloween"" season this October. They don't have to focus on ""Continuing Resolutions"" to keep the government afloat. They can instead embrace apparitions rather than appropriations.

September's salvation also rescued Thanksgiving next month. It's customary for Congress to approve a stopgap spending bill or two each fall. Depending on the congressional schedule - and if it's an election year - one might run the government through mid-October, or later. Another may punt until just before Thanksgiving or just afterward.

But this year's emergency spending plan is special. It funds the government for autumn. All of October. All of November. It expires just before Christmas. So does everyone on Capitol Hill get to celebrate Christmas? Don't bank on on it.

You got Halloween and Thanksgiving. Two out of three ain't bad.

""Why have we picked December 20th?,"" asked Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., during a meeting of the House Rules Committee prepping the temporary spending package. ""Because it's the same reason we always have (with) December 20th. Everybody up here is human. There are no AIs or robots in Congress. And when you get to December 20th, you're five days from Christmas. You're four days from Christmas Eve. And you desperately want to be there with your family. This is when the leadership here has the maximum influence.""

FORMER NIH OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF MAKING EMAILS 'DISAPPEAR' PLEADS FIFTH TO COVID SUBCOMMITTEE

Massie argues that bipartisan congressional leaders choose such a date so they can maximize their leverage over members. The proximity to the holiday helps leaders wrangle the votes to pass another spending plan - anything - to avoid a holiday government shutdown.

Massie said he's been in meetings where a Speaker of the House basically threatens Republicans that they'd better vote 'yes' on a spending measure.

""(He) walks in and says 'If you vote for this you can go home and unwrap presents with your kids. And if you don't vote for this, you're going to spend Christmas here with Nancy Pelosi.' And then the chants start. 'Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote!' Literally, people get enthusiastic to vote for something that they haven't read,"" said Massie.

The soupcon of jet fumes will permeate the Capitol in mid-December as lawmakers try to fund the government and avoid a shutdown over Christmas. The question is how long a spending plan might run? Deep into calendar year 2025? Maybe until February? Perhaps late March as some conservatives advocated? Or, will lawmakers actually reach an agreement on the 12 annual spending bills or even knock a few out, one by one?

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is ruling out an ""omnibus."" He's also spoken out about doing ""minibuses."" That's where they glom several spending measures together. It's not an ""omnibus."" It's smaller, hence the ""Volkswagen"" comparison.

What would Herbie the Love Bug say?

However, the length of another interim spending plan likely hinges on which party controls the House and Senate next year - as well as who won the White House. The wishes of the President-elect will prompt lawmakers to bend the spending bill in his or her direction.

But in September, the goal was to avert a shutdown - and hash out the hard stuff later.

""We're out of time. We cannot afford a shutdown,"" said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., last month. ""This path ensures Americans aren't needlessly punished with a costly shutdown and allows, importantly, the next president, to have a say in the appropriations process.""

Even though the Democratically-controlled Senate advanced zero spending bills on the floor this year, the Republican-operated House did a little better, approving five appropriations measures. But Cole partly blamed his own GOP colleagues for the legislative stumbles.

""We're the majority. The majority ought to be governing,"" said Cole.

He added that it was ""disappointing"" that the House GOP majority had to again rely on Democrats to avert a shutdown.

That's why Cole and others hope the House is able to knock out a few if not the remainder of outstanding spending bills after the election. Otherwise, a harrowing holiday season awaits.

Like Massie, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Tex., warned against ""a crazy, massive, omnibus train, which is the inevitability of doing something right before Christmas.""

So how is Johnson going to manage this? Especially with the distinct possibility of Congress having to boost FEMA with an ""immediate needs"" bill nearly as soon as lawmakers return in mid-November? Then there's the question of a shutdown in December. And that's to say nothing of approving some plan to address Hurriances Helene and Milton along with other natural disasters.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: ALL ABOUT THE POLITICS OF DISASTER RELIEF

By the way, if it's clear Democrats lost the Senate, failed to capture the House and lost the presidency, there's a good chance they'll balk at assisting Republicans with any spending bills. That could well launch the potential second-term of former President Donald Trump under a government shutdown.

There are headaches galore for Mike Johnson as he attempts to fund the government, address multiple crises, satisfy irate conservatives who are already grumbling about his leadership and possibly cling to power. Calling the wrong play could jeopardize Johnson's status in the Speaker election on January 3 if Republicans maintain the majority.

But, what is the right play call for Johnson? No one knows. Johnson tried to appease the right with a spending plan which included a provision to require proof of citizenship to vote last month. However, Republicans couldn't even pass their own bill. In other words, kowtowing to the margins doesn't automatically guarantee success in the House Republican Conference.

But regardless, there was little drama passing the interim spending bill to avoid a government shutdown in late September.

That opened the door for the denizens of Capitol Hill to enjoy the end of the rest of the month. Embrace Halloween in October. Even Thanksgiving.

Face it. Christmas came early this year. In September. There was no government shutdown.

Which is why actual Christmas could be a nightmare this year."
Overseas meth sent to US election building shuts down office for hours,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/overseas-meth-sent-us-election-building-shuts-down-office-hours,2024-10-08T19:43:22Z,"'Vote for Trump' sign glows in Upstate New York after a restraining order issued by the mayor is lifted.

A package of crystal meth from Europe shut down a board of elections office in New York for hours this week.

The Dutchess County Board of Elections office shut down for three hours on Monday, when officials discovered a suspicious package from Europe, sparking a Hazmat team to respond to the office and investigate.

""It came in through UPS from Greece. Prior to Greece, the inner envelope had been around a few other countries as well including France and then UPS'ed to the Dutchess County Board of Elections,"" Republican Elections Commissioner Erik Haight told the MidHudson News. ""The FBI is involved and I know they will be working with the Dutchess County Sheriff's Office and State Police to determine who sent this to us and why.""

A bipartisan team of BOE employees flagged the suspicious package to commissioners, with the team then donning Personal Protective Equipment to further investigate the package before calling law enforcement. The Dutchess County HAZMAT team ultimately responded to the scene, according to a press release from the county's board of elections.

""Dutchess County HAZMAT personnel, under the observation of the bi-partisan Elections Commissioners, examined the suspicious package. The substance was carefully removed from the envelope and tested with advanced chemical and gaseous identification equipment. HAZMAT personnel determined that the material was methamphetamine or more commonly known as 'crystal meth,'"" the press release explained.

Staffers who came into contact with the package have not ""reported any symptoms,"" the press released stated.

The county commissioners celebrated that even though the office shut down for three hours, it did not disrupt ""a single voter's right to vote or harm any of our hardworking staff members.""

Kamala Harris' tough words on Iran confounds critics,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-iran-biggest-us-adversary-china,2024-10-08T19:40:49Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris told the women of ABC's 'The View' that she would put a greater emphasis on small businesses and crimes against women and children.

Vice President Kamala Harris had harsh words for Iran in an interview Monday evening as she said the regime is America's biggest foe.

In a sit-down with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" the Democratic presidential nominee was asked to name the U.S.'s greatest foreign adversary. ""I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. Iran has American blood on their hands.""

""This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles. What we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power. That is one of my highest priorities.""

Harris declined to say whether she would take military action if given proof that Iran is building a nuclear weapon.

""I'm not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment,"" she told Bill Whitaker.

The suggestion that Iran was the greatest U.S. adversary raised some eyebrows -- as China is thought by many to be foe No. 1.

""Iran is our biggest adversary, not China?,"" Mary Kissel, former adviser to ex-Sec. of State Mike Pompeo, wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

""Harris is completely clueless for claiming that Iran is America's greatest adversary rather than China,"" former Trump adviser Steve Cortes said.

""Really? It's not Russia? It's not China? A middle power is America's greatest adversary?"" Iranian nuclear researcher Sina Azodi questioned.

Harris also defended U.S. aid to Israel -- at a time when many liberals are calling on her to halt that aid or put conditions on it amid the rising death tolls across Gaza and Lebanon.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel,"" she said.

Harris highlighted threats from ""Hamas, Hezbollah... Iran,"" asserting it is ""without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks.""

Still, she held out hope that Israel and its enemies could get to a ceasefire deal.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done, which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire."" She added, ""We're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.""

""China is the far greater threat just about, I think, everyone's estimation,"" said Rob Greenway, a former Trump aide and senior director of the National Security Council. ""If you really do view Iran as a threat, then the behavior they've made makes absolutely no sense.""

Former President Donald Trump has blamed President Joe Biden and Harris for loosening sanctions on Iran, which he said made the U.S. adversary ""very rich in a very short period,"" and prompted the turmoil that began with the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023.

During a rally last week, Trump tore into the September 2023 prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Iran that facilitated a detainee swap in Qatar and resulted in the release of $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets from oil sales.

""If they have somebody who was kidnapped, it's always $6 billion. Whoever heard of that?"" Trump said. ""Somebody else gets like $4,000.""

Iran said it had reached a ""good understanding"" to access the money from a Qatari bank account on Monday.

The Biden administration, meanwhile, has long claimed it has not rolled back sanctions on Iran. But ""it's not enforcing any sanctions,"" according to Greenway. Iran is now bringing in nearly $36 billion per year from oil sales.

Last week, Iran rained down 200 missiles toward Tel Aviv, many of them intercepted by both Israeli Defense Forces and U.S. capabilities. Though Iran's proxies have long attacked both Israeli and U.S. postures, it was the regime's first direct attack on Israel since April.

Harris was sharply critical of Trump for pulling out of the Iran deal in 2018. President Joe Biden campaigned on returning to the deal, but failed to do so in office.

""[Iran] made a tremendous amount of money. They have had doors opened by the U.S. administration,"" Greenway said.

HARRIS' 'WORD SALAD' ON ISRAEL ALLIANCE

The Trump administration's policies ""brought them to the brink of financial collapse.""

After Biden rolled back sanctions on Iran, the regime went from 500 centrifuges needed to make a nuclear bomb to 7,000. It went from 5% enriched uranium to 60% (90% is needed for a nuclear weapon.) It went from exporting 400,000 barrels of oil per day in 2019 under the Trump administration's harsh sanctions to 1.7 million barrels per day today.

Reports also suggest renewed activity in two nuclear weaponization sites in Iran - Sanjarian and Golab Dareh.

Last week, Biden warned Israel to make sure its response to the Iranian missile attacks was ""proportional,"" and urged them not to go after Iranian nuclear facilities.

While speaking at a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, he said when Biden was asked about Israel attacking Iran, the president answered, ""'As long as they don't hit the nuclear stuff.' That's the thing you wanna hit, right? I said, 'I think he's got that one wrong. Isn't that what you're supposed to hit?'""

He added nuclear proliferation is the ""biggest risk we have.""

Trump said when Biden was asked about Israel and Iran: ""His answer should have been: 'Hit the nuclear first. Worry about the rest later.'"""

Increased support from Republicans appears to be one factor fueling Vice President Kamala Harris with four weeks to go until Election Day in her White House showdown with former President Trump, according to a new national poll.

The vice president and Democratic presidential nominee stands at 49% support among likely voters nationwide, with the former president and GOP nominee at 46%, in a New York Times/Siena College survey released on Tuesday.

According to the poll, Harris stands at 47% and Trump at 44% in a multi-candidate field. Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver each grabbed 1%, with roughly 7% supporting another candidate or undecided.

Harris' edge - which is within the survey's sampling error - is up from the New York Times/Siena poll from last month, when the two major party nominees were deadlocked at 47%.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

The top-line number in the new poll is in the range of most other national surveys, which indicate the vice president with a slight edge over Trump.

The poll indicates Harris' support among Republican voters stands at 9%, up four points from last month.

As she turns up the volume on her efforts to court Republicans disgruntled with Trump, Harris last week teamed up with the most visible anti-Trump Republican in the town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP.

Harris campaigned in battleground Wisconsin with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP who, in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot on the U.S. Capitol, has vowed to do everything she can to prevent Trump from returning to power.

""I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the audience as she formally endorsed the Democrat presidential nominee. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

Harris praised Cheney as a leader who ""puts country above party and above self, a true patriot.""

The campaign event took place in Ripon, Wisconsin, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

The new poll also indicated Harris consolidating her support among older voters, and for the first time taking a slight edge over Trump in being identified as the candidate of change.

That's crucial in a race where voters have repeatedly shared with pollsters that they think the country's headed in the wrong direction. And the Trump campaign, feeding off such polling data, has repeatedly tied Harris to President Biden and their administration in the nearly three months since she replaced her boss at the top of the Democrats' 2024 ticket.

The poll was conducted Sept. 29-Oct. 6, with 3,385 likely voters nationwide questioned. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 2.4 percentage points."

'60 Minutes' defends handling of Hunter Biden laptop coverage as it hits Trump for skipping interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/60-minutes-defends-handling-hunter-biden-laptop-coverage-hits-trump-skipping-interview,2024-10-08T18:39:44Z,"CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley addressed former President Trump's absence from the ""60 Minutes"" election special.

""60 Minutes"" defended its coverage of the Hunter Biden laptop scandal while taking a swipe at former President Trump for skipping an interview for its traditional election special.

CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley addressed the behind-the-scenes drama that unfolded between the network and the Trump campaign leading up to the now-scrapped sit-down.

Pelley said that the campaign ""offered shifting explanations"" for its apparent reversal.

""First, it complained that we would fact-check the interview. We fact-check every story,"" Pelley said. ""Later, Trump said he needed an apology for his interview in 2020. Trump claims correspondent Lesley Stahl said in that interview that Hunter Biden's controversial laptop came from Russia. She never said that.""

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Pelley was likely referring to comments Trump told reporters last week when CBS News announced the former president would not be appearing on ""60 Minutes.""

""Last time I did an interview with them, if you remember, they challenged on the computer. They said the laptop from Hell was from Russia. And I said it wasn't from Russia, it was from Hunter. And I never got an apology. So, I'm sort of waiting,"" Trump said. ""I'd love to do '60 Minutes.' I do everything. I mean, I do you right now, right? And you're tougher than '60 Minutes' frankly. The laptop from Hell was from Hunter. It wasn't from me ... Lesley Stahl, we got into a little bit of an argument on the camera, talking about that and other things. And you know, they really owed me an apology.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREED TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Pelley didn't mention how Stahl dismissed the laptop scandal during her interview with Trump shortly before the 2020 election.

At the time, Trump insisted that then-candidate Joe Biden was ""in the midst of a scandal,"" referring to reports about the email's contents showing his involvement in his son's overseas business dealings.

""He's not,"" Stahl replied.

""Of course he is, Lesley,"" Trump sternly doubled down.

""No, c'mon,"" Stahl continued to reject the president's claim, before lecturing him, ""This is '60 Minutes' and we can't put on things that we can't verify.""

CBS News eventually went on and verified the infamous laptop in 2022. Numerous other mainstream media outlets dismissed or downplayed the laptop initially before eventually acknowledging its authenticity.

Pelley also doubled down on CBS News' assertion that Trump ""backed out"" of the interview after the Trump campaign insisted it never committed to one.

""The Trump campaign had told us that the interview would be this past Thursday at Mar-a-Lago. They also asked us whether we would meet 78-year-old Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was grazed in an assassination attempt. We agreed,"" Pelley told viewers. ""On September 9th, Trump's Communications Director Steven Cheung sent a text that said, quote, 'I'm working with our advance team to see logistically if Butler would work in addition to the sit-down.' 'Sit-down' meaning the interview in Florida. Days later, Cheung called to say, quote, 'The president said yes.' Then, a week ago, Trump backed out.""

Last week, Cheung denied Trump had ever officially accepted the invitation, posting on X, ""There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in."""
North Carolina residents will see changes to early voting after Hurricane Helene,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/north-carolina-residents-see-changes-early-voting-after-hurricane-helene,2024-10-08T18:33:53Z,"Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier explains how disaster declarations in counties are causing closures for some boards of elections offices on 'Special Report.'

North Carolina election officials are adjusting their voting rules to ensure residents in areas impacted by the recent hurricane damage can vote early in the upcoming election.

Hurricane Helene made a damaging sweep across the southeast, covering swing states that had already started early voting.

But the storm caused severe damage to several predominantly red counties and early voting centers as focus shifted to disaster relief.

On Monday, the North Carolina Elections Board passed a bipartisan emergency resolution that reformed the state's early voting process in 13 counties. Notably, all except one, Buncombe, voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020.

NORTH CAROLINA GOP FOCUSING ON 'HAND-TO-HAND POLITICAL COMBAT' TO RAMP UP GROUND GAME IN BATTLEGROUND STATE

The adjustments include changing or adding voting sites and maintaining their availability, extending the hours when a voting site is open, and adding or reducing days that any site is open within the early voting period, according to the election board.

Voters in these counties will also have more time to request an absentee ballot, with the deadline being Nov. 4.

RESIDENTS IN KEY NORTH CAROLINA DISTRICT REVEAL HOW THEY THINK THEIR COUNTY WILL VOTE IN NOVEMBER

The state's elections board identified 13 counties in western North Carolina as the most impacted by the hurricane.

The counties that will see the changes applied to their early voting processes include: Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Haywood, Henderson, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Transylvania, Watauga, and Yancey.

Voters in these counties will now have the option of turning in absentee ballots to another county's election board, rather than following previous protocol that mandated they only submit their ballots to their local counties.

Trump narrowly won North Carolina in 2020 by roughly 1.4 percentage points, and early voting has since been made a focus of Republican ground game efforts this cycle, the state's GOP told Fox News Digital in a recent interview.

The former president, however, told Fox News that he believes despite the storm's impact, voters will still turn out for the election.

""I believe they're going to go out and vote if they have to crawl to a voting booth,"" Trump told Fox News' Laura Ingraham in an interview that aired Monday. ""And that's what's happening.""

The former president added that his daughter-in-law, who co-chairs the Republican National Committee (RNC), is working on helping North Carolinians in impacted areas cast their votes.

""Lara is working on it. Other people are working on it, and we're trying to make it convenient for them, but they just lost their house,"" Trump said.

ABC's Kimmel fails to disclose fundraising for Harris campaign during friendly Walz interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/abcs-kimmel-fails-disclose-fundraising-harris-campaign-friendly-walz-interview,2024-10-08T18:17:38Z,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz shared a laugh with host Jimmy Kimmel after the Democratic vice presidential nominee made a comical gaffe during his first appearance on late-night TV.

ABC late night host Jimmy Kimmel interviewed Democratic vice-presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., Monday night without disclosing that he has both endorsed and led fundraising for the Harris campaign.

The ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" host hosted a celebrity-studded fundraiser in June that raised tens of millions of dollars for the then-Biden-Harris campaign and lent his name to a Harris campaign fundraising email last month, in which he endorsed Harris for president and trashed former President Trump.

Viewers would have missed those details in his interview with Walz, where they talked about the Harris campaign's vision for America, softened the vice-presidential candidate's recent gaffes with jokes and slammed the Trump campaign.

The anti-Trump late night host made no mention that he is backing the Harris-Walz campaign while giving Walz a late night network platform to speak to voters.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

During the interview, Kimmel called Walz a ""really nice man"" that the country needs, and referred to him as ""America's sweetheart.""

In turn, Walz told Kimmel about his campaign's positive vision for the country, noting that they will ""turn the page"" on the Trump era.

""For me, and being an eternal optimist, I always say that. I supervised a high school lunchroom - you're an optimist or you're dead,"" he said, adding, ""This idea that look, we get to turn the page on that, and I plan on waking up on November 6 with Madam President.""

Kimmel poked fun at Walz's last line, stating, ""I want to be clear, you won't be waking up together."" ""No,"" Walz replied laughing, as the host shot back, ""Unless you guys have gotten closer than we thought.""

""I have a problem about not being specific with my language. So thank you for that, specifically right,"" Walz responded, referencing the fact that he has been criticized for inaccurate claims about his career which he has chalked up to having ""misspoke.""

That Kimmel conducted a softball interview with Walz is no surprise considering how much the comedian has supported the Democratic presidential ticket.

JIMMY KIMMEL SAYS BIDEN'S TRUMP JOKE WAS CLEVER 'FOR A GUY WHO CAN'T PUT TWO SENTENCES TOGETHER'

In a joint September email from Kimmel and the Harris campaign that Fox News Digital recently obtained, the host stated, ""Sorry to break your cold little heart, Donald, but I endorse Kamala Harris for president. I've had the privilege of interviewing our Vice President several times. She is a kind, brilliant and delightful person who cares very much about our country.""

The email provided links for recipients to send money to the Harris-Walz campaign, and added another message from Kimmel. ""I want my four children to know I was on the right side of history (which is the left side). We need to protect our kids from the self-serving trolls who pretend to be fighting for 'freedom.' I believe in truth, justice and all the stuff we learned from Superman. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are our best hope in this battle for sanity.""

Kimmel also hosted a June fundraiser for the Biden-Harris campaign that featured celebrity guests George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and others, along with former President Barack Obama and raked in over $30 million for the Democratic ticket.

Kimmel's network, ABC, has also been scrutinized for its connections to the Harris-Walz campaign, as Dana Walden, a senior Disney executive whose portfolio includes ABC News, is one of Vice President Kamala Harris' ""extraordinary friends,"" according to a report in the New York Times. Walden and Harris have known each other since 1994, while their husbands, Matt Walden and Doug Emhoff, have known each other since the 1980s.

The executive has donated to dozens of Democrats and contributed to Harris' political campaigns since at least 2003, when she ran for district attorney in San Francisco. She went on to donate to her subsequent campaigns for California Attorney General and U.S. Senate, as well as her 2020 White House bid. Harris even credited the Waldens for her marriage at a fundraiser in April 2022, which was held at their home in Los Angeles.

New poll reveals which voter group are fueling Trump to a narrow edge over Harris in battleground,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-poll-which-voter-group-fueling-trump-narrow-edge-over-harris-battleground,2024-10-08T18:07:48Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former President Donald Trump holds a razor-thin two-point edge over Vice President Kamala Harris in battleground Arizona, according to a new public opinion poll.

Fueling the former president's margin appears to be support from voters age 50 and over.

Trump stands at 49% among likely voters in Arizona, with Harris at 47%, according to an AARP poll conducted Sept. 24-Oct. 1 and released on Tuesday. According to the survey, Green Party candidate Jill Stein grabs 1% support, with 3% undecided.

The survey points to a generational divide.

""Among voters 50+, Trump is ahead by 7 points, driven by a 14-point lead among voters 50-64,"" the poll's release highlights.

Harris holds a 4-point advantage among voters under 50, according to the survey, ""while the race is a tossup with seniors.""

The poll also points to a gender gap in Arizona which favors Trump.

The former president and Republican nominee is up 11-points over the vice president and Democratic nominee among men, but down only 6 points among female voters, the survey indicates.

The survey is the latest to indicate a margin of error race between Harris and Trump in Arizona, a state President Biden narrowly carried over Trump in the 2020 election.

Arizona's one of seven crucial battlegrounds whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's White House victory four years ago and are likely to determine if Harris or Trump win the 2024 election.

Besides being a crucial presidential swing state, Arizona is also holding one of a handful of competitive Senate elections that will decide if the GOP wins back the chamber's majority.

""We're diversified here,"" laughed dairy farmer Tom Oberhaus in an interview with Fox News Digital.

He explained that he and his wife are conservative Republicans who have been sure of who they were supporting in the 2024 election for a long time.

""There's no question in our mind that our four years under Trump management was much better than the three and a half years under Biden management - or whoever is, you know, that's the great mystery is, who is actually running the government right now?"" he asked.

They previously voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020.

One issue he has with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat presidential nominee, is that she vouched for President Biden's cognitive ability.

""It bothers the heck out of me that we're thinking about electing a person that just six weeks ago... told us 'Oh, Biden's on top of it. He's really aggressive and really knows what he's doing,'"" Oberhaus said.

""We all seen that in the debate, you know, he's past his time,"" he said of Biden's June debate with former President Trump that preceded his campaign suspension.

TRUMP, REPUBLICANS VENTURE TO BLUE AREAS IN WISCONSIN TO BOOST GOP TURNOUT

Critics have claimed Trump is bad for farmers, pointing to his fondness for tariffs and his past trade conflict with China. But Oberhaus said the tariffs, which ramped up in 2018, ""certainly didn't hurt us.""

""We're much better off with tariffs than having that government printing press printing out money,"" he added.

At Cozy Nook Farm, Oberhaus said their biggest struggle has been inflation. ""We've been [eaten] alive by inflation,"" he claimed.

He explained that they do not set their own prices, and they tend to ""run a couple of years behind everybody else.""

They're now paying ""twice as much for tires and fuel and feed and everything else."" However, ""our milk price stays the same, until just now in the last month that it finally came up.""

He also stressed illegal immigration as a top issue for him, even hundreds of miles from the southern border. But the problem is surfacing even as far north as Wisconsin, he explained.

""Little town of Whitewater 35 minutes away,"" he said. ""It's a town of, what, 15,000 people? And then they got a thousand new immigrants.""

Local Wisconsin outlets reported that last year Whitewater Police Chief Daniel Meyer and City Manager John Weidl penned a letter to Biden, asking for help after the ""rapid increase"" of about 800 to 1,000 immigrants since 2022.

""As a municipal government, our focus is not on legal status, but rather ensuring we are providing the resources expected of a municipality to all residents of the City. Unfortunately, we are increasingly finding it difficult to do that,"" the letter reportedly read.

""How do you handle that?"" asked Oberhaus.

As for those who argue that with strict immigration enforcement there would result in fewer people to work on farms, he called it ""baloney.""

On Trump, who recently ventured into Wisconsin's biggest Democratic enclaves in Dane and Milwaukee counties, the farmer said, ""I think that's the sign of a leader - that you're not afraid to go into the other camp and tell them what your ideas are."""

With a second powerful hurricane in less than two weeks bearing down on Florida, President Biden on Tuesday canceled an upcoming international trip in order to oversee federal storm preparations and response efforts.

As the death toll rises and nearly 200,000 people remain without power or running water over a week and a half after Hurricane Helen tore a path of destruction through the southeast United States, Hurricane Milton - an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm - is on course to slam into Florida on Wednesday.

""Given the projected trajectory and strength of Hurricane Milton, President Biden is postponing his upcoming trip to Germany and Angola in order to oversee preparations for and the response to Hurricane Milton, in addition to the ongoing response to the impacts of Hurricane Helene across the Southeast,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement on Tuesday.

The president was scheduled to leave for Berlin on Thursday, followed by a stop in Angola before returning home on Oct. 15. The trip would have marked Biden's first stop on the African continent during his tenure as president.

EYE OF THE STORM: BACK-TO-BACK HURRICANES IMPACT HARRIS-TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL RACE

Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, the president called Milton a potentially ""devastating"" storm that could be one of the worst to hit Florida in a century. He also urged anyone under an evacuation order to ""evacuate now, now, now.""

""It's a matter of life and death,"" Bien emphasized.

Biden also said he spoke on Monday with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, adding that the conservative governor had been cooperative and that he gave his personal phone number to DeSantis.

When asked about the federal storm response, DeSantis said during a news conference on Monday that ""we have gotten what we need from the feds... the president has approved what we asked for... I'm thankful for that.""

""Everything we've asked for from President Biden, he's approved,"" DeSantis highlighted.

The governor reiterated those comments Tuesday morning in an interview on ""Fox and Friends.""

""Every request that we've made - I've been in contact with the president, I've been in contact with the FEMA director,"" DeSantis highlighted. ""All of our requests have been answered.""

While DeSantis has complimented the president's actions, he has taken aim at Vice President Kamala Harris. The Democrats' presidential nominee on Monday - reacting to reports that the governor had refused to take her calls regarding federal storm efforts - described him as ""selfish.""

When asked about the dispute, DeSantis argued in his ""Fox and Friends"" interview that ""my focus has not been on dealing with Kamala Harris. I saw the news report. I didn't know that she tried to contact me. But I'd also say it's not about you, Kamala. It's about the people of Florida. My focus is exactly where it should be.""

""I've worked on these Hurricanes under both President Trump and President Biden. Neither of them ever tried to politicize it. She's never called on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president until apparently now. Why all of a sudden is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown any interest in the past? We know it's because of politics. We know it's because of her campaign. I have zero time to entertain these political games,"" DeSantis charged.

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS WEATHER UPDATES ON HURRICANE MILTON

The war of words appeared to be triggered by reports from NBC and later ABC News on Monday afternoon that the Florida governor was not taking calls from Harris regarding storm recovery efforts, citing unnamed aides to the governor who said the calls seemed political in nature.

When asked a couple of hours later, DeSantis said he was not aware Harris was trying to reach him.

""I didn't know that she had called. I'm not sure who they called. They didn't call me,"" he said. ""It wasn't anything that anybody in my office did, in terms of saying it was political.""

Speaking around the same time, as she departed the nation's capital for New York, the vice president took aim at DeSantis.

""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations...is just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris charged. ""It is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first.""

However, DeSantis, pushing back in his Fox News interview, argued that ""Harris is not even in the chain of command. She has no role in this. The idea that I should be...worrying about her when I'm focused on the task at hand is quite frankly absurd.""

When asked if his vice president has been helpful as the federal government deals with back-to-back dangerous hurricanes, Biden nodded and told reporters ""yes.""

Harris, speaking on Tuesday on the popular daytime program ""The View,"" said ""I have called and talked with, in the course of this crisis, this most recent crisis, with Democrat and Republican governors.... So, obviously, this is not an issue that is about partisanship or politics for certain leaders, but maybe it's for others.""

With four weeks to go until Election Day in November and Harris and former President Donald Trump locked in a bitter margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene -- North Carolina and Georgia -- among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election - the politics of federal disaster relief are once again front and center on the campaign trail.

Trump, for a week and a half, has been repeatedly attacking Biden and Harris over the federal response to Hurricane Helene, and making unproven claims.

On Monday, Harris clapped back, accusing Trump of pushing ""a lot of mis and disinformation.""

Mayorkas rips 'politicized' atmosphere over FEMA disaster response amid GOP criticism: 'It sows distrust',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayorkas-rips-politicized-atmosphere-over-fema-disaster-response-amid-gop-criticism-it-sows-distrust,2024-10-08T17:07:54Z,"Lawrence Jones views the devastation from Hurricane Helene.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who has been a political lightning rod for controversy during the Biden-Harris administration, on Monday pushed back against what he claimed was ""intentionally false information"" about the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) work.

""I have not seen it ever before at this level,"" he said on MSNBC, speaking to host Jen Psaki. ""You and I both remember a time when an extreme weather event, a natural disaster, actually brought people together. Now, unfortunately, tragically, quite frankly, it is politicized.""

Both DHS and FEMA have been under fire over their response to Hurricane Helene, with claims that it has diverted resources to illegal immigrants, has been delayed in its response, and is out of money.

SPEAKER JOHNSON RIPS 'LACK OF LEADERSHIP' IN BIDEN ADMIN'S HELENE RESPONSE: 'ALARMED AND DISAPPOINTED'

Much of the controversy was triggered last week when Mayorkas said FEMA ""does not have the funds to make it through the season."" He went on to say that the agency has the money for ""immediate needs"" but is concerned about not having a stable supply of funding. Congress recently freed up $20 billion for the disaster fund, but officials have called on Congress to pass a supplemental spending bill.

Critics quickly pointed to FEMA's role in distributing more than $650 million in funds to help illegal immigrants as part of its Shelter and Services Program (SSP). Former President Trump recently accused the Biden administration of stealing FEMA money ""for their illegal immigrants.""

However, the Biden administration has noted that that funding, which comes from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and is congressionally appropriated for grants to local governments and nonprofits, is entirely separate from the significantly larger Disaster Relief Fund.

""No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,"" FEMA said in a release this week.

HURRICANE HELENE: NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS FIGHT FOR THEIR SURVIVAL AS BASIC GOODS BECOME SCARCE

It has still faced questions from some Republican senators about whether its ""entanglement"" in the border crisis has affected its operational readiness.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., meanwhile, told Fox News Digital last week that the administration has ""failed in that response.""

""They are scrambling to cover their egregious errors and mistakes. And there's an effort to blame others or blame circumstances when this is just purely a lack of leadership and response,"" the speaker said.

FEMA also faced backlash last week after its unearthed emergency management ""equity"" blueprint went viral. The number one goal listed in the Biden-Harris agency's priorities is to ""instill equity as a foundation of emergency management.""

According to FEMA's plan, ""Diversity, equity, and inclusion cannot be optional.""

This week, FEMA has been pushing back against claims that FEMA grants have to be repaid, that it is restricting airspace for rescue and recovery operations, and that it is distributing aid based on demographic characteristics. It has published a fact sheet to check some of those claims.

Mayorkas, who was impeached by the Republican-led House this year, on Monday again stressed that there is help available for those who need it, and warned of the effects of misinformation.

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

""What happens is the people who are victimized by the natural disaster are the ones who will suffer,"" he said. ""It sows distrust in their government, and therefore they don't seek the help that they truly need.""

""We have funds to put in their pockets to be able to help them address immediate needs. These individuals are not seeking that relief because of the disinformation, the intentionally false information they are receiving.""

He also said the misinformation hurts the workforce.

""These are individuals who are putting their lives on the line to search and rescue for victims of Hurricane Helene, a hurricane of historic magnitude,"" he said. ""It is very sad.""

Kamala Harris's 'joy' is quietly turning to panic for Democrats,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-harriss-joy-quietly-turning-panic-democrats,2024-10-08T16:59:02Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In the days after Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential election to be replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris, there was real joy among Democrats across the country. That was not just a made-up media story, I saw it, but with less than a month to go, the joy is gone and a quiet panic is setting in.

In the first week of August I was, appropriately enough, in Harrisburg, Pa. and Democrats I spoke to were ebullient and effervescent at the change atop the ticket. One woman told me of calling her mother to celebrate together the chance at a Black female president.

Other left-leaning voters told me that they didn't love how Biden had been shown the door but that they felt Harris could turn the race around and take down Donald Trump. For about a month, it sure looked that way.

5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM KAMALA HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

In San Francisco, most voters I spoke to, red and blue alike, felt like Harris was likely to win, that the Democrats' stalled campaign had called AAA, gotten a jump, and was back on the road.

Harris had erased the lead Trump had over Biden, quickly eclipsing him as the frontrunner and much like a new restaurant opening in a small town, voters were eager to give her a try.

While Republicans and some in the media were frustrated by her unwillingness to do traditional interviews or hold so much as one press conference, her arrogant advisers smirked and said basically, ""So what? She's winning.""

Well, she's not winning anymore, and with her back against the wall appeared on ""60 Minutes"" this week, showing voters the real reason why she is camera shy when it comes to tough questions.

Asked if she and the Biden administration had lost America's influence with our Middle East ally Israel, the veep once again proved herself to be a walking, talking salad bar, here is what she had to say:

""Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.""

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

The most generous interpretation of this odd assemblage of verbiage is that she is saying, ""we're trying,"" the more likely one is that she has no idea what she is talking about.

Over the past two weeks in my travels, it has been increasingly difficult to engage Democrats about the presidential race, much like a fan whose team has dropped a few playoff games and who is avoiding the sports page, they just don't want to talk about it.

As one lifelong Democrat in Ohio who I did get to talk to put it, ""I don't know, she's just kind of there.""

It is hard to say exactly when the shine started wearing off the Harris penny, when joy gave way to frustration, but the failure of the Teamsters to endorse her, and the massive union's internal polling showing Trump with a lead seems significant.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

It was only after that, that I started hearing Democrats uttering words that seemed unthinkable back in August, namely, ""Maybe we should have stuck with Biden."" Ouch.

Biden himself even joked about it at a press conference, something he is at least still capable of, quipping ""I'm back in.""

Harris spokespeople are busy trying to talk Democratic voters down off the bridge, they insist she still leads in the polling averages, she has a war chest worth more than Fort Knox, and a ground game that Trump can only envy.

These points are all true, and the latter may prove decisive. The Harris movement may be Astroturf and not grassroots, much like her crowning as the nominee, but those busloads of supporters in matching teachers' union T-shirts are the same machine that gets out the vote.

But still, there is no mistaking that the thrill is gone.

It is not clear what Harris can do to reverse the clear trends favoring Trump today, ""60 Minutes"" wasn't it, and her appearances on podcasts, late night shows, and ""The View"" make her look like she is pitching a new Rom Com, not running for president of the United States.

The only answer left may be for Harris to make this fight uglier and dirtier as the clock runs out. If the joy is gone, and it is, the only thing left to do may well be to rage and rage, against the dying of the light."

""So far, Harris is falling short of the 24-26 point advantage that Joe Biden carried with Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada in 2020, according to the exit polls from those states,"" Suffolk University Political Research Center director David Paleologos highlighted. ""This Democratic shortfall is largely due to young Hispanic men.""

The Hispanic voters who spoke to Fox News Digital expressed a similar sentiment to what was highlighted in the polling and said they expect Trump will increase his numbers with Hispanic voters in 2024, in part because of the immigration crisis.

""President Reagan used to say Hispanics are Republicans. They just don't know it yet,"" Florez told Fox News Digital. ""We're finding out. I think that many Hispanics that are Democrats found out that the Democratic Party has taken them for granted for way too long. They have made us promises that they never fulfilled, including immigration reform that President Obama promised never happened.""

""We had a great time, it was a very prosperous time for us when President Trump was in the White House,"" Florez added, noting that Hispanic household income was up during the Trump presidency.

""I'm sure that Trump is going to win Nevada. Definitely."""

Vice President Kamala Harris told the co-hosts of ""The View"" on Tuesday that she couldn't think of anything significant she would have done differently from President Biden in the last four years.

""We're obviously two different people,"" Harris said, answering a question from co-host Sunny Hostin about what the biggest ""specific"" difference would be between a potential Harris presidency and a Biden presidency. ""One of the issues I'm focused on is what we do with home healthcare.""

The vice president scheduled multiple interviews for Tuesday, including ""The View,"" Stephen Colbert and radio host Howard Stern. It's Harris' first appearance on the liberal ABC News show since becoming the Democratic nominee.

""If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?"" Hostin followed up.

Harris responded, ""there is not a thing that comes to mind.""

""I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact,"" she added.

She touted the administration's policies in capping the cost of insulin and said she cared about the issue deeply.

""Allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and bring the cost of prescription medication down for seniors, but my intention is to expand that for all Americans,"" she added. ""The work we have done to invest in American industries whether it be, in terms of manufacturing, and creating almost 800,000 new jobs around manufacturing, those were all a shared priority,"" she said.

Later in the segment, while discussing health insurance policies, Harris said she planned to have a Republican in her cabinet and said that would be a difference between herself and President Biden, should she become the president.

Harris joined the co-hosts in early January for an interview on the show and admitted she was ""scared as heck"" of a Trump victory in 2024. At the time, Biden was the presumptive nominee, but he dropped out of the race in July and Harris quickly replaced him at the top.

PA gov takes victory lap after Supreme Court rejects GOP bid to overturn election law 'usurpations',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pa-gov-takes-victory-lap-after-supreme-court-rejects-gop-bid-overturn-election-law-usurpations,2024-10-08T15:59:03Z,"Fox News host Sean Hannity analyzes 2024 election polls and Vice President Kamala Harris' upcoming interviews on 'Hannity.'

The U.S. Supreme Court rejected hearing a Republican-backed challenge to an executive order signed by President Biden that works to broaden voting access and registration, just roughly one month before Election Day.

The Supreme Court reconvened Monday for its 2024-2025 term and rejected a bevvy of cases, including one backed by dozens of Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania who claimed President Biden's 2021 executive order on voter access was unconstitutional and attempted to interfere with the election. The lawsuit also targeted an edict from Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro for enacting automatic voter registration across the state.

The justices did not comment when rejecting the appeal.

Shapiro's office took a victory lap following the Supreme Court's rejection of hearing the case, calling GOP efforts a ""bad faith attempt"" to disenfranchise voters.

""This petition was yet another bad faith attempt to disenfranchise Pennsylvania voters - and the U.S. Supreme Court made the right decision to deny the Pennsylvania Freedom Caucus petition,"" Shapiro spokesman Manuel Bonder told Fox News Digital on Tuesday.

GOP STATE LAWMAKERS APPEAL TO SCOTUS TO CHALLENGE BIDEN'S 'USURPATIONS' OF THEIR POWER TO RUN ELECTIONS

""Governor Shapiro has consistently fought to protect our democracy - including defeating Donald Trump and his allies in court dozens of times to defend Pennsylvanians' votes and protect access to the ballot box. Yesterday, election deniers went 0-2 at the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Bonder said.

Biden signed the executive order on Promoting Access to Voting in March 2021, which directs federal agencies to expand access to voter registration, works to overhaul the government's Vote.gov website, and notes that the federal government has a ""duty to ensure that registering to vote and the act of voting be made simple and easy for all those eligible to do so.""

DOJ 'STONEWALLING' REQUESTS FOR DETAILS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF BIDEN'S 'FEDERAL ELECTION SCHEME'

Executive Order 14019 states that ""executive departments and agencies should partner with State, local, Tribal, and territorial election officials to protect and promote the exercise of the right to vote, eliminate discrimination and other barriers to voting, and expand access to voter registration and accurate election information.""

The executive order set off a firestorm of criticism among Republicans, most notably with 27 Republican Pennsylvania lawmakers filing a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality, Fox News Digital previously reported.

The lawmakers argued that the executive order essentially serves as an executive get-out-the-vote effort targeting demographics that would benefit the Democratic Party. They argued the move was unconstitutional as Congress never enacted a law that grants such an action from the White House.

A federal judge rejected the lawsuit in March, citing it lacked legal standing, setting up a legal showdown in the U.S. Supreme Court.

""We think it's really important for President Biden to be held accountable,"" Erick Kaardal, an attorney for the lawmakers, told Fox News Digital in April.

""For him to violate such a big law when all the little people have to follow the laws, even little laws ... it's clear President Biden has issued an executive order without congressional enactments to get himself re-elected. It's ridiculous,"" Kaardal added.

BIDEN'S GET-OUT-THE-VOTE EXECUTIVE ORDER CHALLENGED, HEADING TO SUPREME COURT: 'TARGET WELFARE POPULATIONS'

In their petition filed to the Supreme Court in April, the Republican lawmakers asked the court to weigh in on the case. They argued that, for the 2024 election, they cannot ""do their part"" in suing to stop ""federal and state executive usurpations of Pennsylvania state law, pursuant to the Elections Clause and Electors Clause, unless the Court does its part and declares individual state legislator standing in this case.""

The lawmakers had called on the Supreme Court to bypass the federal appeals court, and determine if they have standing to bring the case ahead of the 2024 election.

Following the court's rejection of the case, Shapiro's office told Fox Digital that the governor is zeroed-in on ""protecting our democracy and ensuring our elections are free, fair, safe, and secure.""

GOP lawmaker unveils effort to ban illegal immigrants from using IDs to buy guns,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-lawmaker-unveils-effort-ban-illegal-immigrants-using-ids-buy-guns,2024-10-08T15:31:39Z,"FIRST ON FOX: A House lawmaker is raising concerns about the possibility of people who are in the country illegally being able to purchase firearms through the same process a U.S. citizen would use.

Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., is unveiling a new bill called the ""No Guns for Illegal Aliens Act,"" which would explicitly ban illegal immigrants from buying firearms using government-issued IDs.

He also expressed support for former President Trump's controversial mass deportations plan, which would likely be the largest such move in U.S. history, while criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

MEXICAN GOVERNMENT BUSES MIGRANTS TO US BORDER AS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BECOMES TOP ELECTION ISSUE

""Border Czar Kamala Harris has allowed criminal illegal aliens to enter our country and roam our streets. Meanwhile, radical liberals like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are offering driver's licenses to illegals - creating a recipe for disaster,"" Clyde told Fox News Digital.

""As we await President Trump's historic mass deportation effort, we must ensure illegal aliens with government-issued IDs cannot obtain firearms and wreak havoc on our communities.""

It's the latest move in a wider push by House Republicans to direct attention to crime perpetuated in the U.S. by illegal immigrants after several high-profile incidents in the last few years, including the killings of Rachel Morin, Laken Riley, and 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray.

FOCUS GROUP REACTS TO TRUMP CLAIM THAT MIGRANTS ARE 'EATING THE DOGS' IN OHIO TOWN

The three high-profile killings did not involve a gun, but Clyde argued that progressive policies allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses could open the door to more crime.

Clyde, a gun store owner, has had his own firearms license for over 30 years, according to his office.

As of now, 19 states plus Washington, D.C., offer driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has also recently developed a pilot program to distribute federal IDs called ""Secure Docket Cards"" to people who cross the border illegally and are awaiting immigration proceedings. It's not immediately clear if these IDs can be used to purchase guns, however.

The rate of crimes committed by illegal immigrants is lower than that of U.S. citizens, according to a study by the National Institute of Justice.

But Republicans argue that the act of entering the U.S. illegally is a crime in itself, and that instances of violent crime by such groups could be prevented just by having tougher border and immigration laws.

Oregon mistakenly registered hundreds more voters without proving citizenship,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/oregon-mistakenly-registered-hundreds-more-voters-without-proving-citizenship,2024-10-08T15:29:01Z,"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich weighs in on concerns of illegal immigrants voting, the ABC News Presidential Debate and Chinas influence on American politics.

Officials in Oregon announced Monday that they have identified an additional 302 people on the state's voter rolls who didn't provide proof of citizenship when they were registered to vote.

The announcement comes just two weeks after officials in the Beaver state said 1,259 possible noncitizens have been registered to vote since 2021, bringing the total number of mistaken registrations to 1,561.

The mistakes occurred in part because Oregon passed a law in 2019 allowing some residents who aren't citizens to obtain driver's licenses. And the state's so-called ""Motor Voter"" law, which took effect in 2016, automatically registers most people to vote when they seek a new license or ID.

OREGON MISTAKENLY REGISTERED NEARLY 1,260 POSSIBLE NONCITIZENS TO VOTE, DMV ADMITS

The improper voter registrations stem from clerical errors at the state DMV.

On Monday, the DMV released an ""After Action Report,"" which identified errors in its processes that led to the mistakes, with Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade then directing county elections officials to inactivate all 302 voter registrations.

Griffin-Valade and Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, both Democrats, called for an independent, external audit of the motor voter system in a joint statement.

""Thanks to the swift action of elections officials, I have full confidence that these new errors will not impact the 2024 election,"" Griffin-Valade said. ""The DMV's After Action Report raises serious concerns about this important part of our voter registration system. The first step in restoring the public's trust in Motor Voter is a transparent review by a neutral third party operating under strict government auditing standards.""

DMV Administrator Amy Joyce said the agency believed two weeks ago that it was confident it understood and had reviewed all records at risk of error.

""We have since learned this confidence was misplaced based on new information outlined in this announcement and after-action report and for this, we are sorry,"" Joyce said in a statement. ""DMV will follow the Governor's directed actions and remains committed to continuous learning, corrective action, transparency and accountability.""

Griffin-Valade has ordered her office's elections division to immediately hire a new Motor Voter oversight position, according to the statement. And she has instructed the division to establish a documented process for performing regular data checks with the DMV and update the administrative rules governing the Motor Voter system.

She said the Oregon Elections Division will work with the 36 county election officers to determine if any of the erroneously registered voters have previously cast a ballot. Every registered voter in Oregon is sent a ballot in the mail and the state had an 81.97% voter turnout rate in 2020. President Biden beat former President Trump comfortably in the 2020 election, winning the state by more than 380,000 votes.

RNC BLASTS WALZ ADMIN'S NONANSWER ON HOW NONCITIZENS MADE IT ONTO MINNESOTA VOTER ROLLS: 'NO HYPOTHETICAL'

Of the 302 additional cases, 178 were due to people from the U.S. territory of American Samoa being misclassified as U.S. citizens, the DMV report said.

However, under federal law, people from American Samoa are U.S. nationals, not citizens, and don't have the same right to vote. Another 123 records stemmed from the previously identified clerical error, but weren't included in prior reviews due to a newly identified software issue. And one case was caught by the DMV's new quality controls.

Griffin-Valade's office says they are doing everything they can to prevent the 302 mistakenly registered voters from receiving a ballot, but cannot guarantee that all 302 ballots will be removed before they are mailed. Her office is putting in place a process that will ensure those ballots are not opened or counted.

Of the 1,259 possible noncitizens identified last month, 10 mistakenly enrolled individuals went on to cast a ballot, according to Oregon's secretary of state, although at least one became a citizen before voting.

A DMV audit found staff may have accidentally selected ""U.S. passport"" when presented with a foreign passport, or ""U.S. birth certificate"" when given a foreign document, triggering voter enrollment.

The DMV said its drop-down menu has now been rearranged so ""U.S. passport"" is no longer the first, default option. Staff must also enter the state and county for all U.S. birth certificates and respond to a prompt when passport information is entered confirming that the documentation is accurate.

About half of all states, as well as Washington, D.C., have implemented automatic voter registration, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

But there have been numerous allegations of improper enrollment in states without automatic registration too.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced in August that officials have purged 1.1 million ineligible names from the voter rolls since the 2020 presidential election.

Ohio's secretary of state referred 138 noncitizens believed to have voted in previous elections to the state's attorney general for possible criminal charges.

And a conservative watchdog group is suing Arizona's Maricopa County for allegedly failing to remove more than 35,000 people who did not provide proof of citizenship."

"'60 Minutes' says Trump axed interview after demanding apology for 2020 sit-down, complained about fact-checks",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/60-minutes-trump-axed-interview-demanding-apology-2020-sit-down-complained-fact-checks,2024-10-08T15:25:53Z,"CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley addressed former President Trump's absence from the ""60 Minutes"" election special.

""60 Minutes"" recently disclosed that former President Trump canceled an interview with the program after demanding an apology for how it conducted a sit-down with him in 2020. He also allegedly complained that the CBS News show would ""fact-check"" him.

CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley revealed the information at the opening of the show's Monday night episode, which featured an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris, explaining why a conversation with her opponent was absent.

""Then, a week ago, Trump backed out. The campaign offered shifting explanations. First, it complained that we would fact-check the interview. We fact-check every story. Later, Trump said he needed an apology for his interview in 2020,"" Pelley said.

CBS NEWS CASTS LONG SHADOW OF ANTI-TRUMP BIAS AHEAD OF ITS VICE-PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

The reporter began by noting that it has been ""tradition for more than half a century"" that each major presidential candidate do an interview with the show the month prior to election day. He detailed how Trump's team had initially agreed to the interview but backed out last week.

""But, unfortunately, last week, Trump canceled. The Trump campaign had told us that the interview would be this past Thursday at Mar-a-Lago. They also asked us whether we would meet 78-year-old Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was grazed in an assassination attempt. We agreed,"" Pelley said.

He added that Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung initially negotiated the sit-down and told ""60 Minutes,"" ""The president said, 'Yes.'"" However, days later, the campaign declined the invitation.

In addition to explaining that Trump didn't want to be fact-checked, the campaign slammed veteran ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl for how she conducted her interview with Trump ahead of the 2020 election, demanding an apology for how she dismissed the Hunter Biden laptop scandal during their conversation.

At the time, Trump insisted that then-candidate Joe Biden was ""in the midst of a scandal."" ""He's not,"" Stahl replied. ""Of course he is, Lesley,"" Trump sternly doubled down.

""No, c'mon,"" Stahl continued to reject the president's claim, before lecturing him, ""This is '60 Minutes' and we can't put on things that we can't verify.""

CBS News eventually verified the laptop in 2022.

CBS TARRED AND FEATHERED FOR ADMITTING EXISTENCE OF HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP TWO YEARS AFTER NEW YORK POST REPORT

The network released a statement on X last week saying that Trump punted on the interview after agreeing to it. At the time, Cheung replied, calling it ""Fake News.""

""Fake News. 60 Minutes begged for an interview, even after they were caught lying about Hunter Biden's laptop back in 2020. There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in. They also insisted on doing live fact checking, which is unprecedented,"" he posted on X.

Cheung reiterated the statement when asked for comment by Fox News Digital on Tuesday.

He said, ""Fake News. 60 Minutes begged for an interview, even after they were caught lying about Hunter Biden's laptop back in 2020. There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in. They also insisted on editing the President's answers with jump cuts, which is unprecedented... There was nothing scheduled or agreed upon. We had already long promised an exclusive on filming at Butler to another national outlet, which turned out to be Fox News. Also, President Trump wasn't even scheduled to be at Mar-a-Lago last Thursday, as we previously announced a campaign visit to Michigan."""

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program.

Here are some standout moments from the Harris interview.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Whitaker asked Harris about the ongoing crises in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, with Israel under assault from Iranian proxies and Ukraine persevering in the fight against Russia's invasion. In her answers, Harris did not do much to distinguish her foreign policy from that of the current administration.

On Israel, Harris echoed Biden's call for the war with Hamas to end, though she acknowledged the Jewish nation's right to defend itself after the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, when terrorists slaughtered 1,200 people and took 250 captives back to Gaza.

""I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end,"" Harris said.

Whitaker pointed out that although the United States has handed billions of dollars to Israel in military aid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted the Biden-Harris administration's call for a cease-fire with Hamas. When asked if the U.S. holds no sway over Netanyahu, Harris dodged the question and stayed on message, emphasizing the current administration's diplomatic efforts.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" she said.

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

Whitaker pressed, ""but it seems Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.""

Harris declined to answer that point. ""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""

On Europe, Harris stuck with Biden's position that Ukraine must be involved in any resolution to the war with Russia.

""There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the U.N. charter participating in what that success looks like,"" she said.

In a definitive statement, Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war unless Ukrainian representatives were present. However, she was less specific on whether Ukraine should join NATO.

""Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression,"" Harris said. ""Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREET TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Whitaker confronted Harris on her apparent flip-flop on immigration, noting that she supported Biden's efforts to reverse Trump's strict policies even as a historic flood of illegal immigrants crossed the border. Now, the vice president has ""embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers,"" he said.

Whitaker asked, ""If that's the right answer, now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?""

Harris responded by pointing to congressional Republicans who backed out of a bipartisan agreement on a border security bill negotiated by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. ""Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed. And he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress kill the bill. Don't let it move forward,"" she said.

However, Whitaker pushed back on the vice president, observing that in the first three years of the Biden-Harris administration, border arrivals quadrupled and there was no action from Biden or Harris.

""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?""

Harris did not answer the question but asserted that her administration has offered solutions ""from day one, literally.""

""We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem,"" she said, again echoing Biden.

To fight inflation, Harris said she intends to ask Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries. She would expand the child tax credit to $6,000, give first-time homebuyers $25,000 in down payment assistance and offer generous assistance to people starting a small business.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that the total cost of her economic proposals would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

""How are you going to pay for that?"" asked Whitaker.

""Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it,"" Harris answered. ""But my plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.""

HARRIS SAYS WEALTHY AMERICANS, CORPORATIONS WILL PAY HIGHER TAXES TO FUND ECONOMIC PLAN

Whitaker pressed again. ""Pardon me, madam vice president. The question was, how are you going to pay for it?""

The Democratic candidate's answer was that the rich must ""pay their fair share in taxes.""

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations, and I plan on making that fair,"" Harris asserted.

Whitaker followed up again, stating, ""we're dealing with the real world here"" and observing that Congress has shown no inclination to raise taxes.

""I disagree with you,"" Harris responded. ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

""None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy,"" she continued. ""Let me tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that I am also a capitalist, and I know the limitations of government.""

After a discussion on foreign policy, Whitaker took ""a hard left turn"" and asked Harris about her recent admission that she is a gun owner.

""I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time,"" Harris said after he asked what kind of gun she owns. ""And, I mean, look, my background is in law enforcement, and so there you go.""

Harris served as the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004-2011 and was California's attorney general from 2011-2017 before she was elected to the U.S. Senate and later selected as Biden's 2020 running mate.

She told Whitaker she has fired her handgun ""at a shooting range.""

Though Harris had served in government for decades before becoming vice president, she remains a largely unknown figure in national politics. She did not run for president in the 2024 Democratic primary and only became a candidate two and a half months ago, when Biden decided to drop out of the race amid mounting pressure from Democrats concerned that he was too old to win.

""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you,"" Whitaker told Harris. They don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""

""It's an election, Bill,"" Harris replied. ""And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support."

Ron DeSantis says Harris has 'no role' in Hurricane response: 'I don't have time for political games',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ron-desantis-says-harris-has-no-role-hurricane-preparation-i-dont-have-time-political-games,2024-10-08T13:08:05Z,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis discusses Vice President Kamala Harris accusing him of 'political gamesmanship' on 'Hannity.'

Gov. Ron DeSantis hit back at Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday during an interview on Fox News' ""Hannity,"" as the Florida governor prepares for another hurricane, Hurricane Milton, to hit the state.

""For Kamala Harris to try to say my sole focus on the people of Florida is somehow selfish is delusional,"" DeSantis said. ""She has no role in this, in fact, she's been vice president for three and a half years, I've dealt with a number of storms under this administration, she's never contributed anything to any of these efforts.""

NBC News, and later ABC News, reported on Monday that the Florida governor was not taking calls from Harris regarding storm recovery efforts, citing unnamed aides to the governor who said the calls seemed political in nature.

Asked by Fox News' Sean Hannity if she has ever called before while preparing for hurricanes, DeSantis said, ""no.""

""She has no role in this process. I'm in contact with the President of the United States. I'm in contact with the FEMA director, I'm obviously managing all of our state agencies, we're supporting all our local government,"" he added.

When Harris was asked about DeSantis reportedly dodging her phone calls on Monday, the vice president accused him of playing politics.

""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations ... is just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris said to reporters on Monday. ""It is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first.""

DeSantis said he worked well with both the Trump and the Biden administrations when it came to dealing with hurricane preparation and response efforts.

""She's the first one who's trying to politicize the storm, and she's doing that just because of her campaign,"" DeSantis said. ""I don't have time for political games. I've got people whose lives are on the line, I've got people whose homes and possessions are on the line, and we are focused 100% on that mission.""

Regarding the White House response, spokesperson Andrew Bates told Fox News Digital, ""A wide range of leaders in both parties and from every affected state have praised the bipartisan response to Hurricane Helene. The Republican governor of South Carolina, Henry McMaster, has called the response 'superb.' Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a Republican, said, 'They're doing a great job.' Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer said, 'We are seeing incredible help from the Federal government to the state.' The Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, has said he 'appreciated' President's Biden's offer to 'call him directly' with any 'other things we need.'""

Bates then listed other Republican officials, including Republican governor of Virginia and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham who offered praise for Biden.

Fox News Power Rankings: The biggest surprises come after October,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-power-rankings-biggest-surprises-come-after-october,2024-10-08T13:04:54Z,"Fox News Poll Republican partner Daron Shaw on how Trump and Harris are polling with significant voter groups and in swing states ahead of the general election.

A Democratic win in Indiana. A Republican victory in New Mexico. And an election where Missouri was decided by less than 4,000 votes.

They've all happened in the last twenty years.

These results are little more than trivia questions today (the answers are 2008, 2004, and 2008 again). At the time, they raised eyebrows and changed our understanding of the electorate.

Surprises happen on election week. And when the national race looks this close, one unexpected flip can decide who wins the White House.

Vice President Harris still has the edge in this week's forecast. It predicts that Harris will take home at least 241 electoral college votes to Trump's 219.

Her advantage is no larger than it was in September, and as this column has mentioned, battleground states are usually - and mostly - won and lost together. The six toss-up states in this forecast are worth 78 votes, enough to give either candidate a victory on election night.

National polls show a tight race: a Quinnipiac survey has Harris and former President Trump tied at 48%-48% with likely voters, while Marist has the candidates at 50%-48%, well within the polls' margins of sampling error.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON TWO TOP ISSUES

Neither poll shows Trump slipping with the national electorate. Other recent polls showed a point worth of erosion after the September presidential debate.

Battleground state polls have been sparse. (Hurricane Helene has devastated communities in Georgia and North Carolina, and Hurricane Milton will soon make landfall in Florida. This will affect the accuracy of polling in these areas.)

Overall, this race is still anyone's game.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance debated a week ago in New York City. Vance mostly broke through the character that Democrats had constructed for him, while Walz stumbled out of the gate.

A flash poll showed neither candidate winning the night. As always, wait for results from multiple polls conducted in the weeks after the debate to properly assess the polling impact.

That was the only scheduled event that could surprise voters this month. (Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate later in October.)

Of course, it's the unexpected events in years past that have done more to reshape the race. And events in two categories have already resurfaced.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Polarization will limit the impact of these events on the horserace. But watch Harris and Trump's support with independents over the coming weeks. Those voters made up 5% of the electorate in 2020, and they broke for President Biden by 15 points; recent polls put Harris in that ballpark. Trump likely needs to claw that back to win the race.

Two states that could surprise in November

There are nine ""likely"" races on the Power Rankings map. The two that would have the biggest impact on the race are Florida and Virginia.

Former President Trump improved his performance in Florida in the 2020 presidential election, bringing his margin up to about 372,000 votes.

That's a win of 3.4 points, or his second-closest victory of the cycle. (The closest was North Carolina, a toss-up in the rankings, which he won by 1.3 points.)

Republicans have strong advantages. The state's White working-class and senior voters lean towards Trump, while its large Hispanic population, particularly the Cuban and Venezuelan communities, has shifted right in recent years.

The GOP won big at every level in the midterms and enjoys a 1 million-plus voter registration advantage, and most tellingly, the Democratic Party is not making significant investments.

Democrats hope that a competitive Senate race, where incumbent Republican Rick Scott has personally spent more than $8 million, means the presidential election is closer than people think. Florida is also one of three competitive states with an abortion measure on the ballot.

It would take a blowout night for Harris to flip the Sunshine State. It would also be the first state after the battlegrounds to go blue.

Florida stays at Likely R in the rankings.

A win for Trump in Virginia would also be shocking, especially since Biden won this state by more than 10 points in 2020.

The state has a higher proportion of Black, suburban, and college-educated voters than the rest of the country, and all three groups help Democrats run up the margin. While Republicans talked about Virginia after the June presidential debate, the race has changed, and neither party is making big investments in the state today.

Some polls show a race that isn't over for the GOP. A survey from Virginia Commonwealth University in September put Harris at 47% with registered voters and Trump at 37%. A poll from the Washington Post earlier in the month had Harris at 50% to Trump's 42%.

Still, it would take a blowout in the other direction for the Old Dominion to reject Harris. Virginia remains a Likely D race.

Four weeks until election night

More than 1.5 million voters have cast their ballot as the countdown to election night continues. Early voting has now begun in:"
Harris takes slim lead over Trump in new poll as voters view her as candidate of change,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-takes-slim-lead-over-trump-new-poll-voters-view-her-candidate-change,2024-10-08T12:30:58Z,"Reason senior editor Robby Soave and syndicated columnist Josh Hammer on the media interviews agreed to by Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton suggesting social media censorship.

Vice President Kamala Harris has taken a slight edge over former President Donald Trump in a new poll released Tuesday that looked into which candidate voters view as the candidate representing change. Trump, however, maintained his lead among male voters and has kept the trust of most voters on economic issues.

The latest New York Times/Sienna College national poll found that if the election were held today, 49% of respondents would vote for Harris while 46% would vote for Trump. It marks the first time Harris has led Trump in the Times/Sienna poll since President Biden dropped out in July.

Harris took a slim lead among respondents who saw the vice president, not Trump, as a break from the status quo, garnering 46% compared with 44% for the former president.

Harris' lead in this category was greater when broken down into non-White and younger voters, garnering 61% and 58%, respectively, compared to 29% of non-White and 34% of younger voters favoring Trump, according to the poll.

Despite the slight change for Harris, the poll found Trump still maintained the majority of voter trust on what they consider their most important issues, such as the economy, with 48% compared to 46% for Harris.

Trump is also leading Harris with male voters by 11 points, a group which also favored Trump over Biden in the 2020 election, according to the poll.

While national polls are often a good indicator of the general mood among Americans, they don't always predict who will win elections, which often come down to important battleground states.

In the latest Fox News survey of registered voters in North Carolina, viewed as one such battleground state, Harris has a 2 percentage-point edge over Trump, 50% to 48%. A month earlier, Trump was ahead by 1 point (50% to 49%), for a 3-point shift in the presidential race.

The ABC morning program commented on Harris' recent appearance on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast Sunday night and the start of what some are referring to as a ""media blitz"" by Harris, who started making more stops on podcasts, radio shows and other programs. On Tuesday, she will do interviews with ""The View,"" Howard Stern and Stephen Colbert.

The panel praised Harris' media tour for reaching out to voters, with Goldberg pointing out that she is still the vice president alongside the ""acting president.""

""I think people should just know it is not easy to do what she's doing. Because she's still also the vice president, so she's still got other things she's supposed to be doing, as does our acting president Joe Biden,"" Goldberg said, in an apparent Freudian slip.

'THE VIEW' CO-HOST JOY BEHAR BEGS REPUBLICANS TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATIC PARTY: 'JUST DO IT THIS ONE TIME'

The term ""acting president"" historically refers to people who temporarily hold the position while the actual president is incapacitated, such as the vice president assuming the powers of the office while the president is having a medical procedure done. Biden stepped aside from seeking the 2024 Democratic nomination amid growing party concerns about his mental acuity and ability to defeat Donald Trump.

Other women on the panel also complimented Harris' upcoming media appearances, particularly her attention to podcasts.

""I've been saying for a while she should be doing these podcasts because one thing people are doing with their podcasts is everything else in their life. You can listen to a podcast and conquer life. So the amount in these audiences she's reaching is fascinating, and she is hitting it all,"" Sara Haines said.

Alyssa Farah Griffin added, ""I think it's incredibly smart. I would have done it two months ago, but I'm glad she did it.""

In a fiery rant, Ana Navarro complained how ""[t]here's been a lot of moaning and groaning for weeks now that Kamala Harris hasn't been doing interviews and then doing interviews.""

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

The Peach State could be critical to deciding the winner of the 2024 presidential race between Harris and former President Donald Trump.

The traditionally red Georgia has trended more favorably toward Democrats in recent years, particularly since Trump became the face of the GOP. Its pivotal turning point came in 2020, when President Biden won the state by just over 11,000 votes.

""I think if people show up and vote in numbers, I think Kamala has an edge here.""

Another person who only identified himself as Kevin said Harris would ""definitely"" win Georgia.

""She's the best candidate, in my opinion, from what I've read. And I follow it closely,"" he said.

However, despite Atlanta's reputation as a blue stronghold, not everyone there agreed Harris would take the state - a testament to Georgia's purple trends.

""Really, we're a Republican state,"" Tramel Simpson, a music producer, told Fox News Digital. ""Most people who voted in 2020 were just voting non-Trump...it's more of a decision now.""

Taylor Swift appeared at her third Kansas City Chiefs game of the season, and for the first time, was spotted in the same suite as Brittany Mahomes at Arrowhead Stadium.

For the first two games of the season, Swift and Mahomes sat separately as it seemed there may have been a growing rift between the two women because of the latter's apparent support for former President Donald Trump during the 2024 election cycle, while the former openly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.

The two showed face to the world at the U.S. Open when they went on a double date with their significant others - Swift with Travis Kelce and Mahomes with her husband Patrick. But still, they had not sat next to each other like they did for most of the 2023 season when the pop star first started to come to games.

That changed Monday night as the Chiefs went on to defeat the New Orleans Saints, 26-13. The ESPN broadcast showed the two women in the same suite cheering on the team.

Swift showed up to the stadium wearing a plaid dress while Mahomes had on a red get-up in which she posted about on her Instagram page.

Former President Trump announced a campaign rally in Aurora, Colorado, for Oct. 11 on Tuesday, vowing to highlight the ""flood"" of migrants in the city.

The rally comes after weeks of Trump blasting the migrant situation in Colorado, saying some 43,000 illegal immigrants have made their way into nearby Denver and Aurora. His campaign also highlighted the Tren De Aragua gang's takeover of multiple apartment buildings.

""Aurora, Colorado has become a 'war zone' due to the influx of violent Venezuelan prison gang members from Tren de Aragua. With approximately 43,000 migrants flooding the neighboring city of Denver since December 2022, many of these migrants have made their way to Aurora, bringing chaos and fear with them,"" the campaign said in a statement.

""Local families have been forced to flee their homes as Tren de Aragua members terrorize apartment complexes with guns, theft, and rampant drug activity. Kamala Harris' open-border policies are turning once-safe communities into nightmares for law-abiding citizens,"" the statement continued.

AURORA POLICE REACT TO ALLEGED VENEZUELAN GANG PRESENCE AT APARTMENTS: 'HAVE NOT TAKEN OVER'

""Kamala's border bloodbath has made every state a border state, leaving Colorado families at the mercy of criminals. The only solution to stop the border crisis is to elect President Trump, who will secure the border, deport dangerous criminals, and Make America Safe Again,"" the campaign added.

Tren de Aragua gang members first took over an apartment complex in Aurora in 2023. The Whispering Pines Apartments suffered violent assaults, murder threats, extortion, child prostitution and strongarm tactics, Denver law firm Perkins Coie wrote to city leaders in a nine-page report obtained by CBS News Colorado.

The firm was hired to investigate the alleged gang takeover of the apartment building, the outlet said, and interviewed witnesses and reviewed video footage from the complex prior to issuing its report.

Former President Trump and Republicans across the swing state of Wisconsin are ramping up campaign efforts everywhere, including deep blue areas, to close the margins.

""In a state this tight, we have to get votes in every single corner of the state,"" Wisconsin Republican Party Executive Director Andrew Iverson told Fox News Digital.

""Closing the margins just a little bit makes a huge difference,"" he said.

HERE'S WHAT 2 UNDECIDED WISCONSIN VOTERS ARE HOLDING OUT FOR IN 2024 ELECTION

This is paired with ""running up the score in red counties.""

The reason such an approach is necessary, he said, is ""this election will likely come down to 20,000-30,000 votes.""

In 2016, Trump defeated Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin by one point and less than 30,000 votes. When President Biden beat Trump in the state during the next election in 2020, it was similarly by about 20,000 votes.

Now, Wisconsin is once again expected to be a deciding factor in the presidential election.

SENATE REPUBLICANS MARK OCT 7 ATTACK 1 YEAR OUT AS ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR CONTINUES

""I would highlight that the Republican Party of Wisconsin and the Republican National Committee (RNC) - we have over 100 staff on the ground in Wisconsin, and we have 40 field offices,"" Iverson explained.

""So we have a great presence across the entire state.""

According to him, the path to victory for Republicans relies on pulling ""votes in every single corner of the state.""

He pointed to Trump's decision to hold a rally in Dane County, home to the state capital of Madison, Wisconsin. ""Republicans are going where we traditionally may not always go,"" he said.

SOROS-LINKED DARK MONEY GROUP PROPS UP NEBRASKA INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE IN KEY SENATE RACE

Iverson described Dane as ""the most liberal county in the state of Wisconsin,"" and said Trump's trip there is ""because he has to get votes in every single county and turn out Republicans in every part of the state.""

Former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, a Republican, told reporters earlier this month at a press conference in Milwaukee, ""Donald Trump called me and asked me, how do I carry Wisconsin?""

The longest-serving Wisconsin governor, who was in office from 1987 to 2001, said he told Trump to follow his lead, ""You got to go into southwestern Wisconsin.""

""I said to the president, you've got to come into Dane County. There hasn't been a presidential candidate in Dane County since 1996, when Bob Dole ran for president. Republicans stay away. I said, we have to go.""

TOP 5 MOMENTS FROM ONLY VP DEBATE BETWEEN VANCE, WALZ BEFORE ELECTION

Trump's visit to the blue stronghold that same day drew massive crowds, despite the county's reputation. Thompson remarked that there was a ""huge crowd all the way from the airport to the factory,"" where the event was held.

This attention to heavily Democratic-voting areas of the state is a departure from previous Republicans' strategy, as the former governor noted.

Iverson told Fox News Digital that while the election cycle is quite polarized and many people are decided on their candidate, ""there's a rather decent segment of voters who are still undecided, and they'll be making up their decision until the moment they vote.""

Christopher Steele, the author of the 2016 Steele dossier that featured discredited claims about then-candidate Donald Trump, claims he has uncovered new information about the former president during an interview with The Washington Post.

Steele became a key political figure after the dossier made unsubstantiated allegations that Trump committed sex acts with prostitutes in Moscow and helped underscore years of accusations of illicit Russia collusion. The dossier, which was funded through a law firm hired by the Hillary Clinton campaign at the time, was ultimately revealed to be largely uncorroborated and salacious rumors.

When asked if he would still go ahead and release explosive claims about Trump if he wrote the report today, Steele answered in the affirmative.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS AND FORMER ROBERT MUELLER LAWYERS DISCUSS RUSSIA COLLUSION CLAIMS: 'IT WASN'T A HOAX'

""Call me a stick in the mud,"" he told The Post, ""but probably, yes.""

""We know it happens. Anyone who knows Russia and Russian counterintelligence knows about honey traps and about the filming of things in hotel rooms and hookers, and all the rest of it is just part of -- part of the scene in Russia,"" Steele said. ""And so the actual thing itself is entirely credible. The truth of it would have to be built up through ... careful investigation, which is difficult now. It was slightly easier back then. And, as I say, we didn't just take one source's word for it. We interviewed other people that we felt might have knowledge of it.""

Steele chose to stand behind his dossier after its multiple unproven claims came to dominate the news cycle. Some allies of Steele, like former White House National Security Council official Mark Medish, advised Steele to defend only certain parts of his report, instead of all claims.

""His instinct is to do the latter,"" Medish said in an interview. ""I chalk it up to him being a fighter.""

""Any new information by this foreign agent who peddled the debunked Steele dossier should be wholly dismissed, and any media outlet that entertains anything he has to say is just the continuation of election interference intended to meddle in the campaign,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told The Post when reached for comment.

Steele, who is releasing a book about Trump and American democracy, said that he has not given up on the existence of the alleged sex tape.

""I think it's just not really been properly bottomed out,"" Steele told The Post. ""Excuse the pun.""

Liberal filmmaker and activist Michael Moore knocked Democrats who are panicking over the tight 2024 presidential race, admitting he's stunned that people on the left believe former President Trump could win the election.

""Democrats, they're such a frightened group of people,"" Moore said during a Monday interview on CNN. ""I mean, they still think that Trump is going to win.""

""This is kind of shocking to me. Like, don't you live with people? Are you not aware that there's going to be a tsunami of women voting between now and Election Day?"" he said, referring to backlash over the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.

MICHAEL MOORE WARNS KAMALA HARRIS TO NOT GO 'CENTRIST'

CNN anchor Brianna Keilar asked Moore if he believed polling which shows the race is close.

According to the latest national Fox News poll from September, Harris currently holds a two-point edge over Trump with voters.

""I don't think it's a dead heat,"" Moore responded. He clarified that while he wasn't outright dismissing polling, he had more faith in surveys that questioned voters on the issues, rather than the candidates.

He pointed to polling misses from the 2016 campaign, such as when The New York Times predicted on Election Day, 2016, that Hillary Clinton had an 85% chance at winning the presidential election.

""No, I don't think people should be running their lives based on these polls,"" he said.

Moore ripped Democrats pushing Harris to the center because of these concerns, arguing that the VP's progressive policy positions on abortion, the environment, guns and jobs are actually in the mainstream.

""You mentioned Democrats who want [Harris] to 'tone it down,'"" Moore continued. ""That's something women have been told for decades.""

""The reason she's so progressive -- because she believes in a woman's right to choose, she believes a 14-year-old shouldn't take an assault rifle to school....you go down all her positions and they line up exactly with where the majority of Americans are at,"" he continued.

""The majority of Americans believe climate change is real. The majority of Americans believe the minimum wage is too low. Just go down the list,"" Moore argued.

Last week, Moore warned Harris to not ""move to the center"" or it could backfire for Democrats.

""If Harris is advised by her wealthy donors to shun the left and drop her more progressive positions in favor of a 'move to the center,'"" Moore warned in a post on Substack, that could ""reduce or depress the vote."""

Democratic strategist Aisha Mills insisted Monday that former President Donald Trump ""would absolutely try to exterminate people"" if elected, likening the GOP nominee to Adolf Hitler.

In an interview on ""CNN News Central,"" Mills was asked to respond to a comment made earlier in the day by Trump, who remarked that the U.S. has ""a lot of bad genes in our country right now"" during a discussion about crime perpetrated by illegal immigrants.

Mills began by claiming that Trump ""revered the Nazis... revered Hitler.""

FORMER FBI AGENT WARNS RHETORIC LIKENING TRUMP TO DICTATOR LED TO ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: 'UNPRECEDENTED'

""Donald Trump has had a very sinister philosophy, wanting to be a dictator, absolutely dividing people up based on who they are, based on factors about them that have to do with their race, and their gender, etc.,"" she continued.

""And when he uses language like this, I don't think that it's a Freudian slip. I think that the danger of a Donald Trump is that he would absolutely try to exterminate an entire group of people because he thinks that their genes are somehow different than his and faulty,"" Mills said. ""And I say this with all the sternness that you hear in my voice because it is serious. And Americans should recognize that.""

Republican strategist Lahnee Chen, who joined the CNN segment, pushed back against Mills' assertion, calling it ""a little over-torqued, quite frankly.""

DONALD TRUMP JR. TELLS CNN THE 'MEDIA HAS RADICALIZED' PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ASSASSINATE HIS FATHER

Democrats and left-leaning pundits have repeatedly compared Trump to the Nazi leader. MSNBC host Joy Reid said earlier this year that, like Hitler, the former president was ""also viewed as a clown, a goon who could be kept in line."" MSNBC political analyst Claire McCaskill suggested during a media appearance in 2023 that Trump was ""more dangerous"" than Hitler and Mussolini. More recently, Hillary Clinton marked the 80th anniversary of the D-Day operation with a social media post that appeared to cast Trump as a threat to democracy on par with the Nazi dictator.

Mills' comment comes after Trump blamed the ""rhetoric"" from Democrats for causing him to be ""shot at"" in two separate assassination attempts, telling Fox News Digital last month that the suspected gunman in the second attempt on his life ""acted"" on ""highly inflammatory language"" from the left.

His son Donald Trump Jr. echoed the sentiment in a tense interview on CNN last week, blaming the media for being partly responsible for the assassination attempts against his father by pushing false narratives that radicalize his critics.

""The media did that, they created so much of that environment,"" Trump Jr. said. ""The media has radicalized the people that are trying to kill my father. I've had to deal with that twice now in the last two months,"" he continued. ""When someone allows someone to have a platform to call someone 'literally Hitler,' every day for nine years, it creates it. Whether you want to believe it or not, that's a fact."""
"Trump addresses criticism he's politicizing Hurricane Helene: 'Anything I do, they'll say, oh, it's political'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-addresses-criticism-hes-politicizing-helene-anything-i-do-theyll-say-oh-its-political,2024-10-08T10:15:09Z,"Former President Trump slams the Biden administration's response to Hurricane Helene and reacts to cases against him on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Former President Trump continued to hit the Biden-Harris administration for its response to Hurricane Helene amid criticism that he's attempting to politicize the disaster.

Trump spoke with Fox News host Laura Ingraham Saturday at his Butler, Pa., rally, which marked a return to the place where would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks attempted to end the GOP presidential nominee's life in July.

Ingraham asked the former president how he would have responded to the devastation wrought by Helene.

""I'd have a tremendous team of people here. They don't have any people here, the people who, look, I was in North Carolina yesterday. I was in Georgia -- and Georgia's different. You have a good governor. He's doing a very good job. But North Carolina is a disaster. And it was also hit very hard. But they don't have the people and they're complaining there's no people around to help,"" Trump said.

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell hit back at some claims that agency personnel haven't been seen on the ground in the aftermath of the storm, telling ""Special Report"" on Monday such insinuations are ""false.""

""We have been on the ground since before Hurricane Helene in Florida and before it crossed over [to] North Carolina. And what I would say is just because somebody doesn't see a person in a shirt doesn't mean that we're not in the area. We have a team located with the state side-by-side to help them understand their needs and move resources where they're needed,"" Criswell said.

FOX CORPORATION LAUNCHES DONATION DRIVE FOR AMERICAN RED CROSS HURRICANE HELENE RELIEF EFFORTS

""We've moved food and water, and much of what you're seeing delivered by the amazing National Guardsmen across North Carolina are the supplies that we've brought in. The entire federal family is there to support this response. We've been there. We will continue to be there as long as it's needed to make sure we're meeting everybody's needs.""

The White House announced over the weekend that President Biden ordered 500 active-duty troops to western North Carolina to assist in relief efforts, bringing the total number of troops to 1,500.

More than 6,100 National Guardsmen and more than 7,000 federal personnel have been mobilized to help residents and affected counties.

TRUMP LAUNCHES GOFUNDME TO HELP HURRICANE HELENE VICTIMS, RAISES MORE THAN $1M

The White House took aim at Trump and others for allegedly spreading false information about how disaster relief funds were being used, specifically a claim that FEMA money was used on migrants in the United States.

""No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. None. FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,"" a memo from the White House read in part.

""You know, anything I do, they'll say, oh, it's political. If I do anything good, no matter what I do, they'll say, oh, he did it for politics. I mean, they could have gotten there way before me,"" Trump said on ""The Ingraham Angle.""

Trump, Biden and Kamala Harris have all visited states impacted by Helene.

Ingraham asked the GOP nominee how he's working to ensure voters can cast their ballots amid the devastation.

""Republican areas got hit very hard. You know that. They got hit very, very hard. I believe - and many people are dead. You know, many people are dead. They don't even know what it's going to be in terms of the number. You know, they have hundreds are missing and I can't really speak to it. I can only say that I believe they're going to go out and vote, if they have to, crawl to a voting booth,"" Trump said.

He added Republican National Committee co-chair and daughter-in-law Lara Trump is working to address the issue.

""Other people are working on it and we're trying to make it convenient for them, too. But they just lost their house. We're trying to make it convenient for them to go out and vote, but we are doing very well in certain areas that we weren't expected to do. Virginia. We're doing well. We're doing well all over. I think we're going to do great in North Carolina because the response has been so bad to the hurricane. They have - this response has been horrific,"" Trump continued."
UFC star assisting in Helene rescue efforts says FEMA abandoned North Carolina: 'Still woefully absent',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ufc-star-assisting-helene-rescue-efforts-says-fema-abandoned-north-carolina-still-woefully-absent,2024-10-08T09:16:17Z,"Save Our Allies co-founder Tim Kennedy said FEMA has 'every priority wrong' when it comes to Hurricane Helene recovery efforts and called out the North Carolina governor's response as his organization works to help provide aid and support.

Tim Kennedy, former UFC star and Save Our Allies founder, scolded FEMA for being ""woefully absent"" in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene as his group and other private organizations continue to play a critical role in the recovery effort.

In an appearance on ""America's Newsroom"" Monday, Kennedy described the scene on the ground in hurricane-ravaged North Carolina, revealing that he pleaded with FEMA to hand over control of the recovery efforts to the U.S. military after seeing first hand the alleged lack of preparedness from the state and federal government.

FEMA ACCUSED OF PLAYING THE VICTIM AFTER INSISTING CRITICISM OF HELENE HANDLING IS 'DANGEROUS'

""What was clearly absent was the state and federal response. The men and women that showed up from FEMA, that is still woefully absent, there was no command and control. We were begging and pleading for the state to hand over command to the United States military... I wanted real leaders to understand a warlike scenario, this is what it is like to take control. It was absolutely broken,"" Kennedy, a former Green Beret, said.

""The men and women on the ground were doing the best they can. But FEMA has every priority wrong,"" he continued. ""They didn't know what to do or where to do it or how to access these mountains. They were turning people away trying to deliver funds. They're telling helicopters to land, the president's coming in and creating a no-fly zone while we're doing airborne evacuations. None of it made sense...for FEMA to come and start impeding the efforts of organizations like ours trying to get into deliver goods. It is unconscionable.""

FEMA has come under fire for a purportedly inadequate response to the devastation left by Helene. As of last Friday, the death toll in southeastern states hit the hardest by the storm has risen past 224, with more than 100 dead in western North Carolina alone.

Former President Trump, Republican elected officials, Elon Musk and volunteers have spoken out against the government's response to the hurricane, as crews continue searching for missing people and bodies across the affected region.

NORTH CAROLINA SENS. TILLIS, BUDD CALL FOR MILITARY LEADER TO OVERSEE HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson slammed the agency's relief efforts as an ""abject failure"" while Republican Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, both of North Carolina, urged the Biden administration to appoint a military leader to lead the recovery effort, sounding the alarm about the inadequate local response to the catastrophic flooding.

FEMA defended its response to Helene in a statement to FOX Business, stating that ""FEMA is continuing to work with our federal family and state and local partners in the impacted areas to effectively bring in life-saving resources to the people and communities who need it most.

""As of Oct. 3. FEMA has deployed more than 11.5 million Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), over 12.6 million liters of water, more than 400,000 tarps and 150 generators to areas impacted by Helene,"" FEMA's Director of Public Affairs Jaclyn Rothenberg said.

The agency also said it created a rumor response page to combat misinformation or online narratives about their handling of the hurricane.

After repeated calls for military intervention, 1,000 active-duty soldiers with the 101st and 82nd airborne divisions were dispatched to North Carolina Sunday to support the ongoing search-and rescue efforts.

""Nobody does it better than the men and women in the American military,"" Kennedy said.

Kennedy also credited nonprofit organizations like Save Our Allies, Samaritans Purse and others for stepping up to fill the void of an inadequate government response.

""While nobody could get through roads ...we are taking four-wheelers and getting in there...,"" he said.

""We're doing health and welfare checks and we're flying into deliver stuff...we have made multiple runs into Charlotte to pick up more body bags because the number just keeps rising and rising and rising. But once you get to that door, you don't know if somebody will answer the door or hug you and just be so grateful, which happened time and time again, or you start smelling what clearly is going to be a recovery operation instead of a rescue operation,"" he told host Dana Perino.

""I've never been more proud of the response from private citizens.""

Kennedy praised Helene victims in North Carolina for their resilience, revealing that many people have turned down items or assistance for fear of taking it from someone who may need it more than they do.

""It just breaks your heart,"" he said. ""These people are so tough they don't want to take it from somebody that might need it even though it's clear that they desperately need it."""
"Next presidential administration has to 'get serious' about immigration, say voters in key battleground state",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/next-presidential-administration-get-serious-about-immigration-say-voters-key-battleground-state,2024-10-08T09:15:40Z,"MARICOPA COUNTY, Ariz. - Immigration and border security are top concerns among Arizona residents, but voters Fox News Digital spoke with were split on whether former President Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris is better suited to tackle the issue.

""We have to have swifter incarceration at the border,"" Mary from Phoenix said. ""And if there's a suspicion that they're going to commit a crime, lock them up.""

More than 425,000 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions are currently out of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, according to data provided to lawmakers late last month. That includes more than 13,000 people convicted of homicide and nearly 16,000 convicted of sexual assault, according to ICE.

IMMIGRANT MURDER CONVICTIONS 'TENS OF THOUSANDS' HIGHER THAN ICE'S BOMBSHELL FIGURES: DATA EXPERT

""That is pretty tragic,"" Bob from Tempe said when asked about the data. ""The whole immigration needs to be reformed, and they need to get serious about it.""

Mary and Bob both thought Harris would do a better job of addressing immigration. Mary said Harris and Biden had a ""strong immigration bill before the Senate"" this past spring before Trump rallied his allies to block the legislation.

""That was infuriating,"" she said. ""And they all marched in step. So I know that if Kamala gets in, she will get it signed.""

But Nick from Sun City West said Harris' immigration policy has been ""dismal at best.""

""Control the border,"" he said. ""At least keep the border safe. Keep people from being able to get in that aren't supposed to be able to come in unless they come in through the regular normal channels.""

BATTLEGROUND SENATE CANDIDATE UNLOADS ON 'RADICAL' DEM OPPONENT FOR DISPARAGING TRUMP VOTERS

Trump narrowly leads Harris in the presidential contest in Arizona, according to a recent Fox News poll. Biden won the state in 2020 by less than half a percentage point, making him the first Democrat to capture the state since Bill Clinton in 1996.

In the Fox News poll, 56% of Arizona voters surveyed said they trust Trump to do a better job on the border, compared to 41% who preferred Harris.

""It sucks. Excuse my language,"" Greg from Phoenix said of Harris' handling of the immigration crisis. ""It's just bad. They need to keep track of people.""

Brian, also from Phoenix, said immigration is his top voting priority this year because it impacts ""almost every issue, one way or the other."" He's hoping the Grand Canyon State swings back to Trump this time around.

""He's been consistent [on the border],"" Brian said, adding that Harris, who visited the southern border last month for the first time since 2021, has been ""hypocritical.""

Brian said, ""She wasn't around, and now she is. That's politicians."""
"Early voting kicks off in Indiana, New Mexico, Ohio, Wyoming",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/early-voting-indiana-new-mexico-ohio-wyoming,2024-10-08T09:15:20Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Four more states began their early voting processes on Tuesday: Indiana, New Mexico, Wyoming and the major swing state of Ohio.

Here is everything you need to know about casting a ballot in each of the states.

Ohio is home to one of the most competitive Senate races on the map.

Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown has won the Midwestern state three times, but with Trump pushing White working-class voters toward the GOP and record spending from both parties, this is set to be a tight race. Brown faces Republican businessman Bernie Moreno.

Republicans have made inroads in the northeastern and heavily industrial areas bordering Pennsylvania. Trumbull County flipped to the GOP in 2016, and Trump increased his margin to 10 points in 2020; Mahoning County flipped in 2020 by almost two points. These counties played a key role in Trump's statewide wins.

Democrats are performing better than ever in the ""three C's"": Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. These areas have the highest percentages of college-educated voters. President Biden won the counties home to these cities by double-digit margins in 2020, with roughly 30-point wins in Franklin (Columbus) and Cuyahoga (Cleveland).

Unlike in other competitive states, Republicans still hold up in Ohio's suburban and exurban areas, particularly those surrounding Cincinnati.

Ohio's Senate race is a toss-up and the presidential race is ranked Likely R on the Fox News Power Rankings.

Meanwhile, New Mexico is also in the ""likely"" column, both at the presidential and senate level. The state delivered Biden an 11-point win in 2020, but Latino or Hispanic voters made up 35% of the state's electorate in the 2020 election, and those voters' support for the Democrat ticket has wavered in recent polls.

Republicans would need to run up their margins with these voters all across the state and keep Harris at bay in places like Doña Ana County, home to Albuquerque and which last voted for Biden by 18 points, to pull off a victory.

Voting also begins today in four House districts ranked Lean or Toss Up on the Fox News Power Rankings. For a full list of competitive races, see the latest Senate and House rankings.

"Kamala Harris set for extremely friendly interview blitz with 'The View,' Stephen Colbert and Howard Stern",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-set-extremely-friendly-interview-blitz-the-view-stephen-colbert-howard-stern,2024-10-08T09:14:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris will sit for a trio of interviews Tuesday, but don't expect a thorough grilling at any of them from some of the media's most fervent Democratic Party supporters.

Harris will make appearances with ABC's ""The View,"" radio star Howard Stern and CBS late-night comic Stephen Colbert, all hosts of extremely friendly venues for the Democratic candidate who have repeatedly railed against her opponent.

The co-hosts of ""The View,"" a talk-show under ABC's news division, have repeatedly expressed support for Harris and devote segments on an almost daily basis to attacking former President Trump as a threat to democracy.

The co-hosts quickly got behind the vice president in September in their season premiere after President Biden dropped out of the race and praised her ""flawless"" campaign.

ABC'S 'THE VIEW' WAS 100% NEGATIVE ABOUT TRUMP FOLLOWING ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: STUDY

Harris did an about-face on multiple far-left policies she openly supported when she ran for president in 2020, including on fracking, the Green New Deal, and on getting rid of private health insurance. Liberal co-host Sunny Hostin argued in early September that the vice president had always been ""moderate.""

""People evolve and grow,"" Whoopi Goldberg said, dismissing Harris' flip-flops during the discussion. ""The difference, perhaps now, is that someone has actually admitted it.""

Co-host Joy Behar even recently demanded Republicans vote Democrat to ""save the country.""

The show's two Republican hosts, former Trump aide Alyssa Farah Griffin and Ana Navarro, join the liberal hosts in criticizing the former president as an existential threat to the nation. Navarro even hosted night two of the Democratic National Convention in August.

""For me to have the chance to stand on that stage and help my girl, Kamala, make history, and become the Democratic nominee, it's just such a mind-blowing moment,"" Navarro said.

Griffin has not emphatically endorsed the vice president, but plans to headline an anti-Trump event in Pennsylvania alongside other anti-Trump Republicans such as Liz Cheney, who has endorsed Harris.

Navarro touted the Harris interview on ""The View"" and said her Tuesday media blitz was evidence the vice president was facing tough questions. CNN's Brian Stelter also suggested on Monday that the co-hosts of ""The View"" would have ""sharp"" questions for Harris on Tuesday.

Late-night comedy has become a hotbed for Democratic Party support in recent years, but Colbert has taken it to another level with his fawning monologues and interviews in recent years.

Colbert hosted a fundraiser alongside Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and President Biden in March, prior to Biden dropping out of the race. The star-studded Democratic fundraiser brought in over $25 million for Biden's campaign. In 2020, he popped champagne on the air over Biden and Harris winning the election.

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

Colbert's political and media guests have almost solely consisted of Democrats and liberal media figures. Colbert has hosted Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, CNN's Abby Phillip, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, MSNBC's Alex Wagner, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, Hillary Clinton, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Mark Kelly, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, CNN's Anderson Cooper, Bill Gates, MSNBC's Chris Hayes, and more.

Stern, who had the rare chance to sit down with Biden before he dropped out, has said he ""hates"" anyone who supports Donald Trump.

""I don't agree with Trump politically, I don't think he should be anywhere near the White House. I don't hate the guy. I hate the people who vote for him. I think they're stupid. I do. I'll be honest with you, I have no respect for you,"" Stern said during one of his shows in September.

The blitz this week follows a ""60 Minutes"" appearance and an interview on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast. Media analysts said Harris' approach of doing more softball interviews made sense given some of her shortcomings.

""Harris tends not to communicate effectively, whether it's her long-winded, non-answer answers or her demeanor, so for her it does make more sense to appear in friendly venues,"" said communications expert Tobe Berkovitz, a Professor Emeritus at Boston University.

Even Harris' other interviews before Tuesday have skewed toward being friendly, such as with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle. Lesley Lopez, a public affairs professional and assistant professor at George Washington University, dismissed the idea that Harris was erring by avoiding difficult interviews.

""One man's so-called bubble campaign is another's strategic earned media plan. I think her campaign is being really targeted in the final days of an election where the margins are slim,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who is now a Fox News host, said the trio of friendly interviews is a ""great idea"" but questioned the timing as Hurricane Milton has strengthened into a Category 5 monster storm heading towards Florida.

""I would have her, if I was on her team, in FEMA headquarters in the mornings, then you can go out and do a campaign stop, and then back to FEMA headquarters,"" McEnany said Monday on ""Outnumbered."""
Trump vs. Harris: The 'October surprise' is already here,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-vs-harris-october-surprise-already-here,2024-10-08T09:13:18Z,"The infamous ""October surprise"" - the black swan event that could bend the arc of the 2024 presidential election -- has arrived.

Hurricane Helene, which clobbered the Southeast recently, is not the surprise; after all, October is hurricane season, and we expect big storms. Rather, it is the disgraceful aftermath - the shockingly poor and tone-deaf response from Vice President Kamala Harris and the White House, the administration lying about FEMA spending hundreds of millions of dollars on illegal immigrants and then warning that emergency funds for hurricane victims may run short. The frantic warnings from liberal news organizations that complaints about the government's relief efforts are ""misinformation"" and speculation that the tardy recovery effort might prevent Trump voters from participating in the upcoming election.

For Harris' campaign, it was the perfect storm. And, it could get even worse as monster Hurricane Milton barrels into Florida, creating even more challenges for the incapable White House.

KJP SLAMMED AFTER HURRICANE HELENE OVER MIXED MESSAGES ON WHETHER FEMA RESOURCES USED FOR MIGRANTS

As early rescue efforts began, Homeland Security head Alejandro Mayorkas announced the federal government was close to running out of funds to help hurricane relief efforts. He said FEMA was ""meeting immediate needs"" but that ""FEMA does not have the funds, to make it through the season."" That, despite President Biden recently signing a stopgap funding bill that included an extra $20 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. And, despite Mayorkas three months ago assuring the nation that FEMA was ""tremendously prepared"" for hurricane season. Now that Milton threatens even more damage, where will Mayorkas find the funds necessary for the recovery of yet another blockbuster storm?

Soon after, Mayorkas issued that ominous warning about federal fund running low, as bodies were still being discovered in the western towns of North Carolina and thousands were without power or water, Harris posted this on X: ""I am concerned about the security and well-being of civilians suffering in Lebanon and will continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians there. To that end, the United States will provide nearly $157 million in additional assistance to the people of Lebanon for essential needs such as food, shelter, water, protection, and sanitation...""

Talk about tone deaf!

The idea...the idea, as an irate Joe Biden might say, that suffering Americans might take second chair to war victims in the Middle East is repugnant and ignited a firestorm on social media. Yes, the federal government budget is vast - too vast- and agencies that send aid overseas are separate from those that help with emergencies at home. But the impression given those trying to dig out from Helene is that their needs were not Kamala's priority.

That impression was reinforced by Harris and President Biden taking five days to finally visit the storm-damaged Southeast. That's the same number of days it took President George W. Bush to travel to Texas in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Voters read Bush's delay as a sign of indifference; his popularity never recovered.

When Kamala Harris finally arrived at the scene, she announced that FEMA would be giving out $750 checks for immediate aid. Families whose homes and lives had been swallowed by a tsunami of mud were incredulous; $750 does not go very far. FEMA was further mocked for putting out a statement encouraging people, who had no power or cell service, to apply for assistance online or by phone.

Critics were outraged by the paltry sum. Donald Trump Jr. posted on X: ""$750 for Americans in desperate need... $250 BILLION spent in Ukraine with a population of +\- 38 million equals a bit more than $6500 per person in F$&?ing UKRAINE!!! For what? Enough of this madness!""

To be fair, Harris also announced that the feds would in the future provide ""tens of thousands more dollars for folks to help them be able to deal with home repair"" and other needs. In the future.

Our government is not only spending billions on the people of Lebanon and the war in Ukraine; it is also supporting the millions of migrants that Border Czar Harris allowed to enter our country illegally. The Biden-Harris White House and sanctuary cities rolled out the welcome mat, encouraging illegal immigration with free housing, free food, cell phones and other goodies. FEMA has helped fund that effort, leading critics to charge that the Biden-Harris White House is putting people in the country illegally ahead of our own citizens.

White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre has adamantly denied that FEMA money has been spent on illegal immigrants. But there is video of her saying on September 16, 2022, that funding was available ""through FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter Program.... to support humanitarian relief for migrants."" In fact, the agency's Shelter and Services Program (SSP) spent $650 million in fiscal 2023 to assist migrants.

Unhappily, it is not just money that has been in short supply. Help has come too slowly, and some blame the federal government. Reports have circulated of hundreds of GIs arriving in North Carolina but remaining idle awaiting FEMA orders. Some, including Elon Musk's team, have complained that FEMA officials have barred them from delivering critical goods to stranded towns without water or food. The tiny town of Bat Cave, which was almost entirely demolished, was told by FEMA they were on their own because rescue workers could not drive around a ""road closed"" sign, though many helpers managed to do so.

As complaints have rolled in, panicky members of the legacy media have rushed to defend the White House, accusing critics of spreading ""misinformation."" Amazingly, they are even blaming ""misinformation"" for impeding the relief work!

None of this is surprising. The Biden-Harris White House contains few individuals with private sector managerial experience; stories about $8 billion spent to build one charging station or Harris being allocated $42.5 billion to deliver broadband to rural communities but not managing to break ground on a single project, are instructive. The Biden-Harris White House is, at its core, incompetent.

As Milton crashes ashore in Florida, will the Biden-Harris response improve? Or will this be, for Harris campaign, another perfect storm?"
Morning Glory: Trump stands with Israel,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-trump-stands-israel,2024-10-08T09:13:17Z,"Former President Donald Trump agreed to an interview on the first anniversary of the horrific massacre and mass kidnapping in Israel on October 7, 2023. The focus was primarily on Israel of course, but also on the explosion of antisemitism in the United States.

HH: Now Mr. President, when we spoke in April, you said to me that Israel needed to win and win quickly. They are winning, but they're still fighting, and they're now fighting in Lebanon. Do you think Biden and Harris have been holding back Israel from winning?

DT: I do. I think everything they do is the opposite. In particular, him. Now she's a dumber person than him, but he has the worst foreign policy of anybody in history, probably. You know what you do with him? I realized it the other day. You could be one of the greatest foreign policy presidents. All you do is listen to what he says and do the opposite. If you've done the opposite for 30 years with this poor guy, this poor, pathetic guy, if you've done the opposite for 30 years, you would have been successful. But he's never gotten it right. And you know, I don't have to go back into the old secretaries of state and all the people that talk about it.

HH: If Israel hits [Iran's] nuclear sites, will you applaud?

DT: Yeah. I dealt with Kim Jong-un. And he has nuclear weapons. And you tend to speak a little bit differently when they have nuclear weapons.

HH: Yes.

DT: Does that make sense to you?

HH: Yes, it does. Well, Nixon met with Mao, who was the greatest murderer of the 20th Century, because they had nukes. He met with Brezhnev.

DT: Right.

HH: I noticed you didn't meet with Khamenei, and he did not have nukes. Can they be allowed to have nukes?

DT: No, they can't have nukes. No, they can't have nukes. Nukes, if you would see the power of these weapons that I renovated and rebuilt at great cost, I rebuilt the whole military. And then, you know, they gave $85 billion of it away to the Taliban and to Afghanistan. Can you imagine? They gave $85 billion dollars away. They gave everything. This is the worst group of people, these are the worst negotiators in history.

Exchange three:

HH: Let me turn to antisemitism in the United States. Your daughter is Jewish. Some of your grandchildren are Jewish. Your son-in-law is Jewish. Jewish students are not safe on many American campuses. Your alma mater, my alma mater, Biden and Harris have ignored this. I mean, they really have ignored it. If you're president, will you send the DOJ to those campuses, the office of Civil Rights from the Department of Education to enforce the law?

DT: 100%. I mean, the law is being broken. 100%. You wouldn't think you'd even have this. Did you ever think two years ago, three years ago, that you'd ever have this discussion?

HH: No, I didn't.

DT: I'm unbelievable what's happening. And when you see these riots, and you see a lot of people, too. But you know, a lot of the people in that, a lot of those people are Jewish people. You know that. They're Jewish kids.

HH: Oh, yeah. There are some outliers, but most Jewish students are afraid to be overt on places like Harvard and Penn.

DT: Yeah, but then you have other Jewish students that are afraid. Yeah, that's true, and they should be afraid. I never thought I would see this in my life with the campus riots and what they're saying and what they're doing. And they have to put them down quickly. They really have to put them down quickly.

Some pro-Israel Americans would prefer that zero attention be given to the outliers, but as the excellent Commentary Magazine podcast occasionally mentions the insidiousness of Jewish Americans attacking Israel and defending, implicitly or even explicitly, Hamas, then it should not be shocking when the former president notices it too.

I highlight these three exchanges because the result in November's election will reverberate around the world but most especially in Israel.

US ON ALERT FOR POSSIBLE 'VIOLENT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY' ON AMERICANS ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7

It seems clear to me that a President Kamala Harris will be the least supportive American president of the Jewish State in Israel's 76-year history.

By contrast, the argument is solid that Trump in his first term was at least the equal of any previous president when it comes to a record of support for Israel in peacetime. (Richard Nixon ordering the Pentagon to ""send everything that can fly"" to Israel in an arms resupply during the 1973 Yom Kippur War is the sole example of when an American president stepped up at a moment of existential peril to Israel and does everything to help it short of sending American forces. Trump did not face such a choice in his first term, but might very well in a second if Iran crosses the nuclear threshold.)

The choice should be clear for any American who supports Israel and for whom the continued existence and vibrancy of the Jewish State and the Middle East writ large is a priority: They should vote for Trump.

Retired Navy SEAL who spent months behind bars in war crimes probe vows to not let it happen to others,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/retired-navy-seal-who-spent-months-behind-bars-war-crimes-probe-vows-not-let-happen-others,2024-10-08T08:14:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Eddie Gallagher knows how it feels to have a target on your back, both on and off the battlefield.

The decorated Navy SEAL, now retired, served his country for more than two decades in combat zones overseas, fighting terrorists who were determined to kill him and harm America. Then, after returning home from his eighth and final deployment in 2017, Gallagher was accused of war crimes, put in the crosshairs of both prosecutors and the media and imprisoned for nearly eight months before his name was cleared.

Now, as co-founder of the Pipe Hitter Foundation, a nonprofit that gives financial and legal support to ""veterans, police officers and their families,"" Gallagher is raising money to help others fighting similar battles.

Pipe Hitter has gone to bat for other controversial figures like Marine Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller, whose 17-year career ended in court-martial in 2021 after he went viral for questioning senior military leadership amid the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. Another is Cmdr. Erik Ramey, a Navy physician who was serving as the senior medical officer at Basic Training Command (BUDs) when Seaman Kyle Mullen died after completing ""Hell Week"" training in California.

NAVY SEAL EDWARD GALLAGHER FOUND NOT GUILTY ON MURDER AND ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGES

""What we do is we support active-duty military, law enforcement and first responders. If they're being unjustly accused for doing their job, we step in,"" Gallagher told Fox News Digital. ""We provide emergency relief aid to their families while they're going through that stressful time.""

On Oct. 12, the Pipe Hitter Foundation will host its first fundraiser, an event called ""Operator For a Day"" at Stronghold SOF Solutions in Defuniak Springs, Florida. Gallagher is teaming up with former New York Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik and other highly trained military special operators to give civilians hands-on firearms training, show how to fight from vehicles and put on a special operator close-quarter combat live demonstration.

""What we're going to do is have all retired special operators coming in to help instruct, and we're going to be doing some basic pistol, rifle carving course, some vehicle stuff. We're really going to make it a lot of fun,"" Gallagher said. ""For the people that do come, it's just going to give them a taste of what some of these individuals that they are supporting go through on a daily basis.""

The retired SEAL said he hopes the event will give attendees more appreciation for what Navy SEALS and Green Berets go through when they risk their lives for their country.

Tickets are $3,000 per individual with ammo provided, though there are group discounts. While that is by no means cheap, Gallagher says the money will serve those who first served the American people.

NAVY SEAL FOUND NOT GUILTY OF MURDER, RANK RESTORED BY TRUMP: WHERE IS HE NOW?

""The big thing which I like that we do is we help mentor those people through that process. We're able to share our experiences of what we went through, and that does a lot for them, because when you're put in a situation like that, there's very few people who know exactly what that feels like and the amount of pressure that's put upon you and your family when the government is targeting you,"" Gallagher said.

It's personal for Gallagher. In 2017, he was found not guilty of murdering an Islamic State fighter but was convicted of posing with the dead prisoner's corpse. The Navy reduced his rank from chief petty officer to petty officer first class and considered revoking his SEAL trident insignia.

Former President Trump took notice of Gallagher's story after it garnered national media attention and intervened on his behalf to restore his previous rank in 2019. He also stopped the Navy from seeking further disciplinary action against him and fired Navy Secretary Richard Spencer for his handling of the case.

After his acquittal, Gallagher sued his former attorneys for allegedly delaying his case to run up his legal bills. He also accused the prosecutors of acting illegally and unethically.

The prosecutors from the case were awarded a Navy Achievement medal just eight days after Gallagher was acquitted on most of the charges. Trump had the medals promptly rescinded and described the attorneys' actions as ""incompetent.""

EX-NAVY SEAL EDDIE GALLAGHER, ACQUITTED IN WAR CRIMES CASE, SPEAKS OUT: NEW BOOK 'GETS THE TRUTH OUT THERE'

Gallagher retired in 2020 to found the Pipe Hitter Foundation alongside his wife, Andrea. The 501(c)(3) organization has since aided a number of military and law enforcement personnel accused of wrongdoing, those like Ben Darby, an Alabama police officer accused of murder after he shot and killed a man threatening suicide.

Darby shot and killed Jeff Parker on April 3, 2018, after Parker called 911 and threatened suicide. The incident was caught on video and a review board deemed Darby's actions were justified. However, the Madison County district attorney pursued murder charges against the officer and Darby was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

The Pipe Hitter Foundation assisted Darby as he appealed his case. After serving about 20 months in prison, an appeals court overturned the conviction and Darby was released. The officer later pleaded guilty to manslaughter and a judge sentenced him to three years of probation in 2023, AL.com reported.

""He was able to go back to his family,"" Gallagher said of Darby. ""You know, the frights are never over there either. He has to overcome all of the fake news and just the way he was demonized in the media.""

TRUMP DECLARES NAVY WILL NOT TAKE AWAY EDDIE GALLAGHER'S SEAL TRIDENT AS ATTORNEY BLASTS ADMIRAL

Pipe Hitter recently became involved in Ramey's case as the Navy physician now faces an inquiry related to Mullen's death.

A Navy autopsy said Mullen was suffering from acute pneumonia and had an enlarged heart. An investigation released last year found there were widespread failures in medical care, poor oversight and the use of performance-enhancing drugs in the BUDs training program, the Associated Press reported. Ramey and the commander of Naval Special Warfare Training Command, Capt. Brad Geary, were among those officers identified as responsible after the BUDs student died.

The Pipe Hitter Foundation says the Bureau of Naval Medicine had already investigated and determined that Ramey met the standard of care and exonerated him.

""They're trying to hang those two out to dry,"" Gallagher said. ""When we saw this happening, we knew exactly what it was. And so we're supporting Dr. Ramey and hopefully pressuring the Navy to do the right thing and drop these charges against him because he is in jeopardy of losing his medical license.""

These cases are hard, but Gallagher argues that everyone is innocent until proven guilty and no one deserves to be vilified before they have their day in court, especially those who volunteer to serve the country. If service members are demonized, Gallagher said, fewer people will want to serve.

""I think it's a bigger problem than people know about,"" he said. ""I met people when I was locked up. I met young kids that did not deserve to be in there. They made a mistake in life, you know, and the overpunishment in the military is ridiculous. You had these kids serving five to six years for showing up late to a formation or failing a drug test.""

He noted that if some of those teens had gone to college instead of volunteering for military service, they would be free.

""The military has a nasty epidemic of overpunishing people to keep their prosecution rates up. So, it's a major problem. I think the UCMJ, which is the Uniform Code of Military Justice, is an outdated and archaic system, and it's very corrupt the way it's run.""

Gallagher said military justice reform is one of the pillars of the Pipe Hitter Foundation's mission. His hope is that their work, supported by Saturday's fundraiser, will encourage young men and women to volunteer to serve.

""We have a huge recruiting crisis going on. And I think it's due to the fact that these young men and women, who are coming up out of high school or in college, are seeing the way people in the military were treated, especially over the whole COVID vaccine mandate and all the individuals they kicked out illegally and then invited back years later without an apology.

""Young men and women are paying attention. So, if they can see that there are groups out there who support these people that are getting falsely accused or are grossly mistreated, hopefully that will give them some hope to stand up, raise your right hand and want to serve the country.""

Eye of the Storm: Back-to-back hurricanes threaten to upend Harris-Trump presidential showdown,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/eye-storm-hurricanes-theaten-upend-harris-trump-presidential-showdown,2024-10-08T08:10:52Z,"Fox News' Chad Pergram reports on the politics of disaster relief as FEMA pushes back on the 'dangerous' criticism of their Hurricane Helene response.

As the death toll rises and roughly a quarter of a million people remain without power or running water a week and a half after Hurricane Helen tore a path of destruction through the southeast United States, another powerful storm is bearing down on the region.

Hurricane Milton, now an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm, is on course to slam into Florida Wednesday evening.

With four weeks to go until Election Day in November and Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump locked in a bitter margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed President Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene -- North Carolina and Georgia -- among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election - the politics of federal disaster relief are once again front and center on the campaign trail.

Trump has been attacking the vice president and her boss over the federal response to Hurricane Helene for well over a week. Harris, on Monday, fired back, accusing Trump of pushing ""a lot of mis and disinformation.""

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS WEATHER UPDATES ON HURRICANE MILTON

The former president has repeatedly charged that Biden and Harris have been incompetant in their handling of rescue and recovery efforts.

""It is going down as the WORST & MOST INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED 'STORM,' AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, EVER SEEN BEFORE,"" Trump claimed last week.

On Monday, he argued in a social media post that the administration's storm response was ""the WORST rescue operation in the history of the U.S.""

And Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, charged Monday in a ""Fox and Friends"" interview that the administration's efforts were ""incompetence of the highest order.""

The Trump campaign, in announcing Vance would hold a town hall Thursday in Greensboro, North Carolina, argued that Harris ""completely left North Carolina behind in the wake of devastation post-Hurricane Helene.""

And in a blatant pitch for votes, the former president claimed that ""NORTH CAROLINA HAS BEEN VIRTUALLY ABANDONED BY KAMALA!!! DROP HER LIKE SHE DROPPED YOU - VOTE FOR PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP. MAGA2024!""

Trump's repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims as he's targeted Biden and Harris - among them that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia had been unable to reach Biden when Helene first tore through the Peach State. Kemp later confirmed that he had already been in contact with the president.

Despite the untruths from the former president, he did beat Biden and Harris to the scene, surveying the storm-damaged region two days before they did last week.

The optics put the president and vice president on defense, and they've been forced to repeatedly correct the record.

The White House has publicized FEMA's [Federal Emergency Management Agency] efforts in assisting the hard-hit states. Biden made back-to-back trips to the southeast last Wednesday and Thursday, as he stopped in the four hardest hit states, and Harris also made two trips to survey damage.

Huddled with Democratic and Republican politicians from the region last week, Biden emphasized that ""in a moment like this, we put politics aside, at least we should put it all aside. We have here -- there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans -- our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and as thoroughly as we can.""

Trump - along with his allies - has repeatedly aimed to tie the storm response to the combustible issue of border security, as he claimed that FEMA funds for the rescue and relief efforts in North Carolina were being diverted to support undocumented migrants.

The Harris campaign, firing back, said that Trump and Vance and their allies have been ""pushing debunked lies about Hurricane Helene response.""

A top North Carolina Republican - Sen. Thom Tillis - asked about the charges, said on the Sunday talk shows that ""I believe that we have to stay focused on rescue operations, recovery operations, clearing operations, and we don't need any of these distractions on the ground.""

Harris, on Monday, called Trump's actions ""extraordinarily irresponsible.""

""It's about him. It's not about you. And the reality is that FEMA has so many resources that are available to folks who desperately need them now, and resources that are about helping people get back on their feet and rebuild and have places to go,"" Harris emphasized.

But longtime Republican strategist David Kochel noted that Trump had been ""very aggressive"" with his initial quick trip to the storm-damaged region.

""I think he put a lot of pressure on them to try to do something,"" Kochel, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, told Fox News. ""He's out there pushing a line that they don't care, they're not doing anything, and I think they're reacting to it.""

Now, with Hurricane Milton bearing down on Florida, the Biden administration highlighted their efforts in a release headlined ""Federal Assistance for Hurricane Helene Exceeds $210 Million, FEMA Prepares for Dual Response with Hurricane Milton Strengthening as it Moves Toward Gulf Coast of Florida.""

As Biden declared a state of emergency in Florida on Monday, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said during a news conference that 5,000 National Guardsmen had been mobilized in his state, with another 3,000 on the way.

""We have gotten what we need from the feds,"" DeSantis said. ""The president has approved what we asked for....I'm thankful for that.. Everything we've asked for from President Biden, he's approved.""

This is far from the first time that a tropical storm has impacted a presidential race.

Then-President George H.W. Bush took a political hit over FEMA's disorganized efforts to provide relief in Florida from Hurricane Andrew, which pounded the then-key battleground state weeks before Election Day.

Fast-forward a decade and his son - then-President George W. Bush - likely enjoyed a political bounce in Florida during his 2004 re-election thanks to his aggressive response to Hurricane Charley, which hit in August of that year.

Bush was narrowly re-elected, thanks in large part to carrying the Sunshine State, but his administration's image in handling storms took a major hit the next year, over the botched response in Louisiana to Hurricane Katrina.

As he ran for re-election in 2012, then-President Barack Obama's aggressive response in dealing with Superstorm Sandy -which slammed into the Eastern Seaboard days before the election - likely boosted him to victory.

Trump, in his first year in office, faced criticism as Puerto Rico struggled to recover from a powerful storm. The president was pilloried for throwing paper towels to the crowd as he stopped by a relief center during a storm-related visit to the island.

But the incident - which took place three years before his re-election effort - was vastly overshadowed by his response to the COVID crisis, the worst pandemic to hit the globe in a century."
'Social cost of greenhouse gases': House GOP targets progressive Biden policy for rising energy prices,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/social-cost-greenhouse-gases-house-gop-targets-progressive-biden-policy-rising-energy-prices,2024-10-08T08:10:43Z,"FIRST ON FOX: House Republicans are moving to roll back a progressive Obama-era regulatory metric for greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that it's sandbagging the U.S. energy sector by using ""nonscientific"" standards.

""North Carolinians are struggling to fill up their tanks and pay their electricity bills. The last thing they are worried about is the 'social cost' of energy,"" Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., told Fox News Digital.

""We need to be unleashing American energy to lower prices, not crippling production with burdensome, costly regulations.""

Hudson, who also chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, is leading 12 fellow GOP lawmakers in introducing a bill to stop federal agencies using the ""social cost of carbon"" when creating new regulations for the U.S. energy sector.

HOUSE PASSES BILL BLOCKING BIDEN ADMIN ATTEMPT TO REQUIRE TWO-THIRDS OF NEW CARS TO BE ELECTRIC WITHIN YEARS

Models calculating the ""social cost"" of greenhouse gases use several factors, including population health, sea level changes, economic impacts and other human-felt costs.

Because of the vastly different indicators, ""social cost"" emissions projections can vary widely, according to the Brookings Institute.

It was first used as a federal regulatory tool under the Obama administration but was rolled back by former President Trump.

President Biden made it part of his clean energy plan when he took office, directing a task force to study where federal agencies should consider the ""social cost of greenhouse gases"" as part of an executive order titled ""Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis.""

BIDEN-HARRIS EV MANDATES WILL HURT WORKERS IN STATES LIKE MICHIGAN: TUDOR DIXON

Democrats have held it up as a necessary tool that presents a more holistic picture for the long-term harms of carbon pollution.

Republicans, however, have criticized the metric as a nonscientific tool that's responsible for burdensome regulations.

Republican Study Committee Chair Kevin Hern, R-Okla., a co-sponsor of the bill, said the ""social cost"" metric and the Biden administration's green energy push overall was pushing gas prices up.

""It's just a fact that government interference in the energy industry has directly contributed to these rising costs. No more manipulated studies and biased research - the American people deserve transparent and honest information,"" Hern told Fox News Digital.

Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, another co-sponsor of the bill, said, ""The Biden-Harris White House has proven their willingness to hide behind biased and flawed research to advance their war against American energy producers.""

""The White House should unleash clean, affordable American energy to bring costs down for the American people,"" he said.

The White House did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment."
"Kamala 2.0's challenge? Making more news, and not just with ultra-friendly hosts",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-2-0s-challenge-making-more-news-not-just-ultra-friendly-hosts,2024-10-08T07:11:26Z,"For well over a month, Kamala Harris rode a wave of the most positive press any presidential candidate has gotten in two decades, and her own skills, to turn what had been a lost cause for the Democrats into an extremely tight race.

But does she have a second act?

Kamala 2.0, under constant attack by Donald Trump and the Republicans, doesn't have much new to say. She is conducting a play-it-safe campaign, like a basketball team sitting on a lead and running out the clock.

But Harris doesn't have a lead in the three ""blue wall"" midwestern states she needs to win, and the loss of any one of them could hand Trump the presidency once again.

VANCE-WALZ VP DEBATE ENDED IN A 'DRAW': DEMOCRAT REP. DEBBIE DINGELL

For all the focus on Pennsylvania, Harris leads by 0.7 percent in Michigan - a statistical tie, based on the Real Clear Politics average.

On Sunday's ""Media Buzz,"" Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell told me her state could go either way.

""The vice president has a problem with union workers,"" Dingell said. ""Many of the men, as well as, quite frankly, African-American young men who have said to me, I was with a group with them last week. 'You know what, Donald Trump talks to us. Democrats take us for granted.'""

The lawmaker recalls how ""everybody got mad at me"" when she predicted in 2016 that Trump would win Michigan - which he did, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

A major problem for Harris is that she doesn't seem to know how to make news. With less than 30 days to go, with many voters understandably believing they don't know her, or enough about her policies, since she took over for Joe Biden, the VP is stitching together parts of her stump speech and recycling the same anecdotes virtually verbatim.

A presidential candidate has to deliver a few new lines, a new proposal, something to break into the news cycle, which is currently being dominated by Trump.

So what's on this week's agenda? Kamala will sit down with Howard Stern (who is totally against his old pal Donald); ""The View,"" where the ladies despise Trump, and Stephen Colbert, who hosted fundraisers for Joe Biden in 2020 and this year.

For good measure, she's also spoken to Alex Cooper, whose podcast, ""Call Your Daddy,"" is about sex.

WHY VANCE EASILY BEAT WALZ IN DEBATE, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE IN THE PROCESS

I'll go out on a limb here and say these sessions are designed to be friendly - not unlike the conversation with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle, who kept agreeing with Harris and had just pronounced Trump a danger to democracy.

In fairness, Harris also sat for a ""60 Minutes"" interview, an invitation declined by Trump.

Look, there's nothing wrong with candidates showing their softer side with unorthodox outlets in our fragmented media universe. We've come a long way since critics scoffed at candidate Bill Clinton answering the ""boxers or briefs"" question on MTV, calling it unpresidential.

On ""Call Your Daddy,"" Harris was actually quite thoughtful in responding to Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that her kids keep her humble and the VP doesn't have anyone to keep her humble.

Rather than jab at the Arkansas governor, which would have produced a cheap headline, she ruminated that families come in all shapes, bound by blood or love, that she is deeply involved with her stepchildren, and this isn't the 1950s anymore. They also discussed, uh, tampons.

Still, the party is getting nervous. ""Democratic operatives, including some of Kamala Harris' own staffers,"" says Politico, ""are growing increasingly concerned about her relatively light campaign schedule, which has her holding fewer events than Donald Trump and avoiding unscripted interactions with voters and the press almost entirely.""

Since the convention, the veep has spent more than a third of days on meeting and briefings, with no public events.

With early voting under way in more than half the states, Politico describes this ""a do-no-harm, risk-averse approach to the race.""

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan, who fervently doesn't want Trump to win, nonetheless is whacks Harris pretty hard:

""She hasn't fleshed out her political intent -- what she stands for, what she won't abide, what she means to establish, what she won't let happen.

What is her essential mission? Is it national 'repair,' is it to 'stabilize' an uncertain country, is it 'relaunch'?..

""She so far hasn't conveyed a sense of intellectual grasp. Her campaign has placed too many chips on the idea of the mood, the vibe, the picture.""

And vibes can only take you so far.

But the VP has certain duties, and spent two days visiting hurricane victims and relief workers in North Carolina and Georgia-which also happens to be good politics. She also met with Volodomyr Zelenskyy.

Harris attended a fundraiser over the weekend. Why bother? Her campaign has already had $400 million roll in. She's already outspending Trump 2-½ to 1 on ads. She doesn't need any more money. What's more, Harris doesn't make news at these fundraisers, which in any event are off camera. A ground game is great, but it has to be married to a winning message.

Here's one more: Dan Pfeiffer, a former top Obama White House official, says on Message Box, his Substack column, that ""the media -- and Politico Playbook in particular -- are fuming over the Harris-Walz media strategy.""

Kamala ""must be on offense at all times -- say new things, be edgy enough to get attention, and dictate the terms, or the campaign could ""take on water...In this media world, there is a never-ending, insatiable appetite for content. Either serve lunch or become the menu...

""Dominating attention is Trump's political superpower...Even when he doesn't have a big moment, Trump speaks so outrageously that it shifts attention to his issues of choice.""

Now it's easy to snipe from the sidelines. For Harris to be neck and neck in the core battleground states means she's obviously done many things right. She had to overhaul the Biden operation and vet a running mate while the campaign was in full swing, like changing the tires on a speeding hot rod. She could still win.

One positive sign: The Harris camp took off the bubble wrap and allowed Tim Walz to appear on ""Fox News Sunday."" This was an attempt at damage control, since he lost the debate so badly to JD Vance.

While Shannon Bream repeatedly pressed the governor on late-term abortions, his Minnesota record and his history of falsehoods and exaggerations, Walz was far more forceful than he'd been in the CBS debate. He ducked certain questions, but an interview format is much better suited to him than friendly exchanges with his opponent.

Tim Walz shared a laugh with host Jimmy Kimmel after the Democratic vice presidential nominee made a comical gaffe during his first appearance on late-night TV.

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz raised some eyebrows about what he plans to do on Nov. 6 during his late-night debut on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live.""

On Monday, Walz and liberal host Jimmy Kimmel took turns knocking his GOP rival Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, over his refusal to say that former President Trump lost the 2020 election during last week's vice presidential debate.

Walz called it ""very surreal"" to listen to, but pivoted to his own optimism that the country will ""turn the page"" on Election Day.

""For me, and being an eternal optimist, I always say that. I supervised a high school lunchroom - you're an optimist or you're dead,"" Walz said. ""This idea that look, we get to turn the page on that, and I plan on waking up on November 6 with Madam President.""

While the liberal audience roared with cheers, Kimmel jokingly asked for a clarification.

""I want to be clear, you won't be waking up together,"" Kimmel responded with a grin.

""No,"" Walz laughed.

""Unless you guys have gotten closer than we thought,"" Kimmel quipped.

""I have a problem about not being specific with my language. So thank you for that, specifically right,"" Walz chuckled.

MEDIA CRITICS PAN WALZ'S 'UNSTEADY' DEBATE PERFORMANCE: 'CLEAR LACK OF PREPARATION AND EXECUTION'

Walz previously went viral when he mistakenly claimed that he had ""become friends with school shooters"" during the vice presidential debate.

""I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it,"" Walz said.

WALZ STUNS THE INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

The poorly timed mishap occurred when Walz was asked about changing positions on banning assault weapons, which he previously opposed but now supports. Walz meant he had become friendly with parents who lost children to school shootings.

He also made headlines when he referred to himself as a ""knucklehead"" after he was pressed about his falsehood about being in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre.

During an interview on ""60 Minutes,"" Walz was asked whether he could be trusted as other past statements have faced intense scrutiny.

""Is that kind of misrepresentation- isn't that more than just being a knucklehead?"" CBS News' Bill Whitaker asked.

""I think folks know who I am and I think they know the difference between someone expressing emotion, telling a story, getting a date wrong ... than a pathological liar like Donald Trump,"" Walz said.

""But I think it comes down to the question of whether you can be trusted to tell the truth,"" Whitaker followed.

""Yeah, well, I can. I think I can,"" Walz responded.

""I will own up to being a knucklehead at times, but the folks closest to me know that I keep my word,"" Walz added."
GREG GUTFELD: Trump showed the election can be decided on the merits and not under the threat of the left,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-trump-showed-election-can-decided-merits-not-under-threat-left,2024-10-08T03:27:45Z,"Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and the panel discuss former President Trump's return to Butler, Pa., after an assassination attempt on his life on 'Gutfeld!'

So on Saturday, Donald Trump returned to Butler, Pa., where roughly three months ago, he was almost assassinated by a loser who couldn't make his high school rifle club but somehow mastered slanted roof technology. It was huge. So huge, the rest of the media had to cover it. First, Trump returns to the scene of his near death, and then opens with this.

MUSK ENERGIZES TRUMP SUPPORTERS AT BUTLER RALLY, 3 MONTHS AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON FORMER PRESIDENT

Yes, Trump's got charts while Biden's got sharts. Elon Musk showed up jumping around like a human embodiment of the First Amendment. All it needed was Hulk Hogan tearing his shirt off or Kid Rock putting a shirt on. The crowd was even bigger this time around, and it's solemn. It was funny and, dare I say it, joyous. Now compare that to the existential prophecies of a future Trump presidency. A ""threat to democracy, dictatorship, chaos."" Was there anything in Butler resembling that?

Tens of thousands of people from all over standing together to hear speeches that painted America as a place worth protecting, where safety matters, where borders matter, where American jobs matter, where our leaders would actually put our country first. All things that a Harris presidency would make disappear faster than an erection on Bikini Day at The View. That sentence started out so well.

Tens of thousands of people, the people that the legacy media demonizes all day long, people who happen to be in the ultimate swing state, by the way. Who do you think, though, our media is going to blame if Trump wins this thing? Just listen to these chuckleheads continue to push violent retribution if Trump wins.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: This is an increasingly desperate person who's preparing for civil war.

MSNBC GUEST: People right now in the Republican Party are, in fact, actively rooting for and inciting a split, you know, a division in the country.

MICHAEL COHEN: What he says he intends to do. And when he turns around and says he intends to use Seal Team Six or the military within which to round up his critics or his opponents, he intends to do it.

MSNBC GUEST: He's putting in place what he needs to disrupt the process and to create enough tension and confusion that you'll have people on the streets protecting and defending him.

So, you get the sense there's going to be chaos if Trump wins. That's the sense they want you to have. It's less an election and more of an extortion. And sadly, they may be right. There will be chaos if Trump wins because it will come from them. What they're saying is if you win, there will be blood, your blood. It's the mafia saying, nice country you got here. It'd be a shame if something were to happen to it. At least the thugs from Goodfellas had style. Democrat fellas look like this. Think about it. Has Kamala Harris articulated a single original policy point?

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

Sure, she mentioned not taxing tips, which she lifted from Trump like a Cartier watch during a smash-and-grab. She doesn't bother with policy because she doesn't have to. Because as the woman who babbles on about not going back from her own administration, it's always followed by 'or else.' Or else disaster, chaos, chaos they seem to be guaranteeing. We've seen their chaos in Chicago, New York, San Fran and Minneapolis. Well, Tim Walz, he missed that one. He was busy fighting ISIS in Iraq with exploding tampons.

Now, some of us might be a bit scared, but that's what they want. But you can't let them blackmail or threaten you into a Democrat win because, clearly, this is their last sure sign of desperation. From a side that doesn't have policy or history or even common sense on their side, only threats. But the good news, like Gerald Nadler's deodorant, it's not working. Tens of thousands of people standing shoulder to shoulder in a field that had the blood of Trump and three others in it showed him that. Trump came back like he promised.

He didn't let them set the limits. They took their best shot, literally, then he boldly returned to the scene of the crime. Like Brian Stelter, returning to steal from the CNN fridge. Trump showed up saying, 'Forget it.' The threats won't stop us. So it wasn't just about Butler, but the election itself. By gathering all those people in the same field where a weaponized nutcase tried to end Trump's run for president, Trump and thousands of others showed that this election can actually be decided on the merits and not under the threat of the left, vowing chaos if they don't get their way.

It's funny, the guy they're telling us will end elections and democracy is actually the one doing the most to preserve it. And tens of thousands joined him. They're ready to fight, fight, fight with a prez who has their backs every step of the way. So let the Dems keep telling you that Team Trump will end America as we know it. And if they're talking about the way we've known it the past four years, let's hope this is one time they're right."
Harris said candidates must 'earn' voter support  --  despite skipping primaries before becoming Dem nominee,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-said-candidates-must-earn-voter-support-skipping-primaries-becoming-dem-nominee,2024-10-08T02:29:45Z,"Fox News host Sean Hannity analyzes 2024 election polls and Vice President Kamala Harris's upcoming interviews on 'Hannity.'

Vice President Kamala Harris said political candidates should have to ""earn"" support from voters, despite previous criticism for becoming the Democratic presidential nominee without having to run in any primary election in 2024.

Harris was asked about why voters still have reservations about her during a ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired Monday night.

""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you, they don't know what makes you tick,"" ""60 Minutes,"" journalist Bill Whitaker asked during a sitdown interview. ""Why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""

BILL MAHER TRASHES KAMALA HARRIS FOR BEING 'FULL OF S---' ON ISRAEL, MIDDLE EAST: 'JUST SHUT UP'

""It's an election Bill, and I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote,"" Harris replied. ""This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support.""

""You have to earn it and that's what I intend to do,"" she added.

The Democratic Party has been accused by critics of anointing Harris as the party's nominee after Biden abruptly ended his re-election bid following his first debate against former President Trump.

Many Republicans and groups like Black Lives Matter accused the Democratic Party of installing Harris as its nominee and sidestepping the voting process. The Democratic Party coalesced around her, winning enough delegate support to secure the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August.

In response to the criticism, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the party's presidential nominating process was ""open,"" and Harris ""won it,"" despite the absence of any such contest."

Fox News host Sean Hannity reveals why Vice President Kamala Harris is now doing interviews before the election on ""Hannity.""

SEAN HANNITY: There is one huge reason, and only one reason, that Kamala is now going on and doing any interviews. Her internal poll numbers have got to be horrendous. Now, meanwhile, the publicly available poll numbers from the most credible pollsters in 2016 and 2020 and swing states we've been showing you (are) not great for Kamala Harris.

She is down in multiple polls in Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia. The race is even tighter in Virginia, where Kamala holds a slight lead. A brand new Yahoo News poll shows Trump surging nationwide.

Harris is desperately trying to make up ground. That's why she's finally doing friendly interviews, but lapping it up with Trump-hater Howard Stern, those hard-hitting interviewers on ""The View"" and Stephen Colbert, who's dull as dirt, or the ""Call Me Daddy"" podcast, while millions of Americans are suffering the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene and another major hurricane on the way, is not exactly the best look for the vice president when she and Joe Biden have been completely missing in action."

Vice President Kamala Harris was pressed by CBS News' Bill Whitaker about whether it was a ""mistake"" for the Biden administration to go soft on its border policies during a tense exchange on Monday's special election episode of ""60 Minutes.""

""You recently visited the southern border and embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers, and that crackdown produced an almost immediate and dramatic decrease in the number of border crossings,"" Whitaker said. ""If that's the right answer now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?""

""The first bill we proposed to Congress was to fix our broken immigration system, knowing that if you want to actually fix it, we need Congress to act. It was not taken up,"" Harris responded. ""Fast forward to a moment when a bipartisan group of members of the United States Senate, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, got together, came up with a border security bill.

""Well, guess what happened? Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed, and he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress, 'Kill the bill, don't let it move forward.'""

""I've been covering the border for years, and so I know this is not a problem that started with your administration,"" Whitaker said. ""But there was an historic flood of undocumented immigrants coming across the border the first three years of your administration. As a matter of fact, arrivals quadrupled from the last year of President Trump.""

""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?"" Whitaker then asked.

""It's a long-standing problem, and solutions are at hand, and from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions,"" Harris responded.

BILL MAHER SHOCKED BY MSNBC'S SOFTBALL KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW: I DIDN'T EXPECT THEM TO BE 'RUBBING HER FEET'

""What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place?"" the veteran CBS News journalist pressed.

""I think the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem, okay,"" Harris responded.

""But the numbers did quadruple under your watch,"" Whitaker interjected.

""And the numbers today because of what we have done, we have cut the flow of illegal immigration by half,"" Harris continued, as Whitaker attempted to ask the question a third time. ""We have cut the flow of fentanyl by half, but we need Congress to be able to act, to actually fix the problem."""
Political storm: Harris says DeSantis 'selfish' for reportedly not taking her hurricane-related calls,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/political-storm-harris-desantis-selfish-reportedly-not-taking-her-hurricane-related-calls,2024-10-08T01:35:15Z,"Florida Emergency Management director Kevin Guthrie discusses the harrowing wait the state faces as Hurricane Milton nears less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene.

Vice President Kamala Harris took aim at Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida on Monday for reportedly not taking her calls regarding federal storm relief efforts as a second powerful hurricane bears down on Florida.

""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations...is just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris charged on Monday. ""It is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first.""

The vice president's comments came a couple of hours after reports from NBC and later ABC News that the Florida governor was not taking calls from Harris regarding storm recovery efforts, citing unnamed aides to the governor who said the calls seemed political in nature.

Asked about ther reports at a hurricane news conference, DeSantis said he wasn't aware Harris was trying to reach him.

""I didn't know that she had called. I'm not sure who they called. They didn't call me,"" he said. ""It wasn't anything that anybody in my office did, in terms of saying it was political.""

Asked again about the report, the governor reiterated ""I didn't know that she had called.""

The dispute comes as Hurricane Milton, now an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm, is on course to slam into Florida Wednesday evening.

Milton is bearing down on Florida as the death toll rises and roughly a quarter of a million people remain without power or running water a week and a half after Hurricane Helen tore a path of destruction through Florida, Georgia, South and North Carolina, Tennessee, and parts of Virginia.

President Biden made stops last week in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida to survey storm damage from Hurricane Helene. While Biden was in Florida, DeSantis was holding a separate press event across the state in another area damaged from the storm.

""We were in Florida, we invited the governor of Florida to come, it was his decision not to attend,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday. ""The president has reached out around Hurricane Helene. He reached out. It is up to the governor, it is really up to the governor.""

The White House said hours later that the president held separate calls with DeSantis and Tampa Mayor Jane Castor ""to get a firsthand report on recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene, and to discuss preparations for Hurricane Milton.""

According to the White House, Biden urged the governor and the mayor to ""call him directly if there is anything that can be done to further support the response and recovery efforts.""

Asked about the federal response, DeSantis said during his news conference that ""we have gotten what we need from the feds....the president has approved what we asked for....I'm thankful for that.""

""Everything we've asked for from President Biden, he's approved,"" DeSantis highlighted.

With four weeks to go until Election Day in November and Harris and former President Trump locked in a bitter margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene -- North Carolina and Georgia -- among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election - the politics of federal disaster relief are once again front and center on the campaign trail.

Trump, for a week and a half, has been repeatedly attacking Biden and Harris over the federal response to Hurricane Helene. Harris, on Monday, clapped back, accusing Trump of pushing ""a lot of mis and disinformation.""

JESSE WATTERS: It's getting spooky. Democrats haunted by the echoes of Hillary Clinton. That's from Politico. Kamala went from being the next Obama to being Hillary. They're worried she's running the same ""Play it safe"" campaign.

Up to this point, she's had about the same number of events as Hillary. And 'Crooked' had pneumonia. Since the DNC, Kamala has spent half of her time in D.C., a third of it without any public appearances. Trump is everywhere. Anxious Dems wonder why Harris isn't.

CNN's Brian Stelter claims 'The View' will have 'sharp' questions for Kamala Harris,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnns-brian-stelter-claims-the-view-have-sharp-questions-kamala-harris,2024-10-08T01:09:54Z,"CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter claimed Monday that the left-wing daytime talk show ""The View"" will have tough questions for Vice President Kamala Harris this week.

Stelter, who recently returned to the network after being ousted two years ago, spoke about both former President Trump and Harris' media strategies on Monday as election day nears. Harris in particular has been criticized for avoiding interviews after she took up the nomination from President Biden, but now appears to be on what CNN referred to as a ""media blitz.""'

""Well, she's on '60 Minutes' tonight. That's the most watched news magazine in the United States. Donald Trump initially agreed to be on '60 Minutes,' then he backed out. I feel like he's getting off pretty easy,"" Stelter said. ""Imagine if Harris had agreed to be on '60 Minutes' and then backed out. I think she would have been vigorously criticized. So, Trump choosing not to do '60 Minutes,' Harris is on there. That will certainly be an example of tough questioning of the vice president.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREED TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Stelter went on to note that Harris will be on ABC's ""The View"" on Tuesday, claiming he had been assured the co-hosts will have difficult questions for the Democratic candidate. ""I was talking to producers of 'The View' last night. They have some sharp questions for her as well,"" he reported.

SUNNY HOSTIN VENTS ABOUT CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD FAILING TO ENDORSE BIDEN ON 'THE VIEW': 'IT WAS IRRESPONSIBLE'

""And let's remember, sometimes it's these non-traditional formats that actually reveal a lot about candidates. Remember when Kamala Harris was sitting down with Oprah Winfrey a couple of weeks ago, and that's when Harris said, 'If somebody breaks into my house, they are getting shot.' That was a very revealing soundbite, even though it was a friendly interview for Harris,"" he said.

Stelter's claim that ""The View"" will have sharp questions for Harris seems to contradict the show's political record, as the co-hosts have been openly anti-Trump and even slam those who fail to pledge to vote for the Democratic nominee.

On Friday, co-host Joy Behar implored Republican voters to put aside their party affiliation and vote for the Democratic Party just once to get rid of Trump, saying, ""Just do it this one time. Do it this one time. Vote for the Democrat to save the country.""

Former Trump staffer and ""The View"" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin is set to join former GOP lawmaker Liz Cheney and other anti-Trump Republicans for an event in Pennsylvania this week to warn of the dangers of re-electing Trump.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS IN 'DANGER ZONE' AS AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT COUNTRY'S DIRECTION, SAYS CNN DATA GURU

Co-hosts of ""The View"" have blasted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for refusing to pledge his support first to Biden and then his successor for the nomination, Harris.

""You cannot throw away your vote!"" co-host Sunny Hostin told Christie when Biden was still in the race in mid-July.

After facing continued pushback from co-hosts, Christie eventually responded, ""I'm sorry that I care for what people stand for. I apologize. I'm not gonna pre-commit to it! Let them perform and earn my vote! People should have their vote earned!""

In September, after Harris became the nominee, Christie stood by his position that he was still undecided.

On Monday, Stelter spoke further about Harris and Trump's parallel media strategies to court young women and men, respectively.

""That's why I thought 'Call Her Daddy' was really interesting as well. The interview actually revealed a lot about the candidate, and ultimately, that's what the Harris campaign is trying to do, in the same way that the Trump campaign is going on influencer podcasts, really trying to appeal to young men, doing YouTube shows and things like that,"" he said.

""Harris is trying to do these non-traditional formats like Stephen Colbert tomorrow night or Howard Stern tomorrow afternoon, but I just I think it's notable that sometimes we hear a lot and there are actually a lot of newsworthy comments in these interviews,"" he added.

Reporter's Notebook: All about the politics of disaster relief,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/politics-disaster-relief,2024-10-07T23:16:37Z,"Fox News' Chad Pergram reports on the politics of disaster relief as FEMA pushes back on the 'dangerous' criticism of their Hurricane Helene response.

Republicans are excoriating the Biden/Harris administration for how it responded to Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, Tennessee and other parts of the South. This is now about to be a double whammy as Hurricane Milton bears down on Florida.

It unfolds amid a tight presidential election. So the disaster response is now infused with politics in swing states like North Carolina and Georgia. There is also a competitive but not top-tier Senate race in Florida.

Storms can disrupt the typical electorate. The usual people who vote might not make it to the polls. It's hard to care about voting if you're low on food, lack electricity and can't even make it out of the holler in western North Carolina because Helene wrecked the road.

'IMMEDIATELY RECONVENE': SCOTT URGES SCHUMER TO RECALL SENATE AMID HELENE'S DEVASTATION

Pray tell, where should you vote in Tampa or Sarasota if your basement is swamped by Milton - after getting drenched when Helene spun through a few weeks ago? You were going to vote at the school down the street. But now it lacks power. You're now living at your sister's house inland. But you're not registered to vote there ...

You see what we're getting at.

Republicans are hammering the Biden/Harris administration for its response to the storm.

""It's like the DMV at industrial scale,"" said Republican vice presidential nominee and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, on Fox. ""It is incompetence of the highest order.""

""At the federal level, this has been a massive failure,"" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. ""When you talk to the people who are directly affected, they will tell you that this has been an abject failure. FEMA has lost sight of its core mission. The administration has not shown that they were prepared for this eventuality in this terrible disaster.""

""Kamala Harris has left them stranded. This is the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we've ever seen. Probably worse than Katrina. And that's hard to beat, right?"" asked former President Trump.

Storm responses are challenging. Hurricane Andrew was a powerful Category 5 storm that swept through Florida in August 1992. Former President George H.W. Bush's tepid response to Andrew slashed his support in Florida. ""Bush 41"" wound up narrowly winning Florida, besting former President Clinton by less than 2%. Bush won Florida by 22 points four years earlier. Moreover, the response to Hurricane Andrew raised questions about the competence of the administration weeks before the election. It's believed that cost Bush a few points nationwide.

When Clinton took office, he immediately beefed up FEMA to prepare and respond to other natural disasters.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

So, part of this tactic is the natural extension of Republicans to undercut the Biden/Harris administration at nearly every turn. This is another component of the GOP narrative that the administration can't handle the economy. Can't handle foreign policy. Can't handle the border.

Did someone say the border?

""We give $20 billion a year to FEMA. And unfortunately, they have drained everything dry,"" said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., on Fox Business. ""We spent $200 billion in Ukraine. We spent $220-$500 a month on our illegal aliens.""

This is where things get tricky.

FEMA is under the aegis of the Department of Homeland Security. DHS runs a program that sends money to cities besieged by the illegal migrant crisis. Some of the money goes for food and shelter for those in the country illegally. But it also helps those towns cope by addressing strains on their medical systems and other services.

Money for disaster recovery and migrant assistance constitute two separate line items in the DHS budget. Congress approved money for both these programs. In fact, some Republicans would prefer to spend more to help their communities grapple with an infusion of illegal immigration.

SPEAKER JOHNSON ADDRESSES CLAIMS FEMA DIVERTED FUNDS TO IMMIGRATION EFFORTS: 'AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTED'

About $640 million currently goes to assist these towns beset by an influx of illegal migrants. But some lawmakers would like that to spike to as much as $3 billion next year.

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., introduced legislation to halt the migrant assistance program. And Johnson blurred the line between FEMA disaster aid and migrants and the border.

""FEMA should be involved and the Federal Emergency Management Association. Their mission is to help people in times like this of natural disaster. Not to be engaged in using any pool of funding from any account for resettling illegal aliens who have come across the border,"" said Johnson on Fox.

Other Republicans believe this may be an opportunity to recalibrate spending overall. Keep in mind that many Republicans look askance at foreign aid to Ukraine.

""As an elected official, it's our responsibility to put Americans first. Whether you're in Florida, in my district or you're anywhere in the union, I think that it's important for us to prioritize Americans and restore hope and let them know they're not forgotten,"" said Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., on Fox.

But some Republicans compared issues with FEMA's response to how the administration addresses other subjects.

KJP SLAMMED AFTER HURRICANE HELENE OVER MIXED MESSAGES ON WHETHER FEMA RESOURCES USED FOR MIGRANTS

""This administration seems to have no problem finding money when they want to spend it on their priorities. When they need hundreds of billions of dollars to pay off student loans for graduate students and gender studies programs, they somehow find it. When it's trying to get helicopters to deliver food and water and cellular service and lifesaving medicine into these mountain valleys, they somehow can't seem to find the money,"" declared Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., on NBC.

FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell castigated Republicans for suggesting FEMA was focused on other issues rather than the storms.

""It's frankly ridiculous and just plain false. This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people,"" said Criswell on ABC.

Before leaving Washington, Congress green-lighted $20 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) as part of the interim spending plan to avoid a government shutdown. But Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas muddled matters when he said FEMA had enough funds to respond to Helene for ""immediate needs"" but not enough to get through ""the season.""

The ""season"" to which Mayorkas refers is the annual hurricane ""season."" It stretches through Nov. 30. Note that Mayorkas made this remark when there was the potential for another storm, but Milton hadn't yet formed in the Gulf of Mexico.

Some Republicans pounced on Mayorkas. But after considering the severity of Helene, it will likely draw down the DRF for ""immediate needs."" The key phrase here is ""immediate needs."" Milton will probably do the same. That's why Congress must likely tackle disaster relief in at least two tranches when it returns to session in November. Lawmakers will need to refill the DRF. And the price tags will start to roll in for Helene and Milton. That's to say nothing of outstanding disasters like Hurricane Beryl in Texas, tornadoes in Iowa, a typhoon on Guam and wildfires in Hawaii.

FEMA HAS FUNDS NEEDED FOR 'IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY,' DESPITE MAYORKAS' WARNING

However, Johnson is unwilling to summon lawmakers back to Washington to grapple with disasters.

""You don't just send estimates to the federal government. You send specific needs and requests based upon the actual damages. And that takes some time, especially with storms of this magnitude. So Congress will do its job,"" said Johnson on Fox.

So, lawmakers must first reload the DRF for future immediate needs, then mete out bigger chunks of change for Americans to cope with the impacts of Helene and Milton. The government funding deadline is Dec. 20. It's possible that the latter chunk of funding is folded into spending measures around Christmas.

But as for the politics? The election is fast approaching. The storms could impact voting this fall. And while Helene and Milton will certainly leave a mark meteorologically, they will probably leave a mark electorally, too."
CNN legal analyst skewers Hillary Clinton's comments on Jack Smith's case against Trump: 'Got her facts wrong',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-legal-analyst-skewers-hillary-clintons-comments-jack-smiths-case-against-trump-got-her-facts-wrong,2024-10-07T23:07:41Z,"CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig called out former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her commentary about Trump's ongoing legal battles, suggesting she mixed up two of the key judges.

CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig called out former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Monday for claiming that there is ""nothing out of the ordinary"" in how the legal system is treating former President Trump.

On Thursday, Honig wrote a column for New York Magazine where he scorched Special Counsel Jack Smith's ""procedurally irregular"" 165-page federal court filing regarding Trump's immunity from prosecution.

""The larger, if less obvious, headline is that Smith has essentially abandoned any pretense; he'll bend any rule, switch up on any practice -- so long as he gets to chip away at Trump's electoral prospects. At this point, there's simply no defending Smith's conduct on any sort of principled or institutional basis,"" Honig wrote.

He also wrote, ""Anyone who objected to James Comey's outrageous announcements about the Hillary Clinton email investigation on the eve of the 2016 election should feel the same about Smith's conduct now,"" and rhetorically asked what distinction there could be between these two cases.

5 KEY DETAILS IN SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH'S TRUMP ELECTION CASE FILING

Clinton rejected the comparison, however, arguing there is ""nothing out of the ordinary"" in this case.

""I think the situation is completely different, and this is in the context of an ongoing criminal procedure that the special counsel has brought against Donald Trump many, many months before the run-up to the election,"" Clinton said in an interview. ""It was, frankly, motivated by the orders of the judge in this trial, who has, it appears to me, been extremely favorable toward Trump, so I think that there is nothing out of the ordinary.""

The CNN legal analyst, when asked for his response, argued Clinton has ""got her facts wrong,"" including possibly confusing Judge Aileen Cannon and Judge Tanya Chutkan.

""Well, all respect to Secretary Clinton, she's the one who suffered the consequences for James Comey's, I believe, outrageous conduct in 2016; DOJ found later that it was outrageous. The problem, though, with Secretary Clinton's analysis of the Jack Smith case is, respectfully, she's got her facts wrong,"" Honig said.

""First of all, she's confusing the judges here. I think she's thinking of Judge Cannon, who, yes, has ruled almost entirely for Donald Trump. But that's the judge in the other case. The judge here is Judge Chutkan. I get it, similar names -- Judge Chutkan has ruled almost entirely against Donald Trump,"" he said.

HILLARY CLINTON DEFENDS 'DEPLORABLES' COMMENT: 'TOO KIND A WORD' FOR SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS

Honig went on to chastise Clinton for arguing that there was ""nothing out of the ordinary"" with this case.

""More to the point, the last thing we just heard Secretary Clinton say was -- quote -- 'There is nothing out of the ordinary.' But as I described before, the way they flipped this procedure is the opposite of the ordinary,"" he said.

""They reversed the actual way that motions are done. You can talk to a hundred former federal prosecutors who've collectively handled 100,000 cases. They will all tell you they never filed their motions first. And I think it begs the question, what was the rush here? Why did Jack Smith have to ask for this, to quote Judge Chutkan, procedurally irregular approach?"" Honig said. ""So, I respectfully disagree with the secretary there.""

"'Traitor' Liz Cheney walloped by Wyoming voters for Harris endorsement, break with GOP",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/traitor-liz-cheney-walloped-wyoming-voters-harris-endorsement-break-gop,2024-10-07T22:55:27Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney officially endorsed Vice President Harris for the Oval Office, breaking from the GOP to hit the campaign trail with the Democrat ticket in the key battleground state of Wisconsin last week.

Fox News Digital traveled to Casper, Wyoming, over the weekend to speak to voters about their thoughts on the upcoming election and Cheney snubbing the Republican presidential ticket in favor of endorsing Harris this cycle. Voters in the Cowboy State overwhelmingly admonished Cheney for the endorsement, with some slamming her as a ""traitor"" and ""turncoat.""

""I'm not impressed with that at all,"" Clark Johnson told Fox News Digital when asked about his thoughts on Cheney campaigning with Harris last week in Wisconsin.

""I think it's ridiculous. I think she's a traitor to the country,"" another Wyomingite, Gunner Berg, said of the campaign event.

KAMALA HARRIS TEAMS UP WITH LIZ CHENEY IN BIRTHPLACE OF REPUBLICAN PARTY

Cheney, who is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is a vocal critic of former President Trump, putting her at odds with the Republican Party and her former constituents, who overwhelmingly supported Trump in his 2016 and 2020 elections. Wyoming is again expected to vote red this election.

The vast majority of voters who spoke to Fox Digital from Casper said they are no fan of Cheney's and that she would unlikely hold another elected office in Wyoming due to her politics.

""I'm definitely not a fan, and it definitely kind of turned some tables there,"" Dillon Sigman said, adding that he does not believe Cheney could again successfully run for office in Wyoming.

""I think Liz Cheney, who originally was a Wyoming person that moved to Connecticut and then returned to Wyoming wearing cowboy blue jeans and a cowboy rodeo belt buckle and seated herself, completely flipped and became a turncoat. Liz has gone totally Democratic and appears to be down the road of the DEI inclusion and all the other dysfunctional things that are going on in her government,"" said a Wyoming resident who identified himself as ""Ralph.""

""I support her decision to campaign for whoever she chooses. However, I do not think that she is a voice for the Wyoming people. The majority of people I know do not back Kamala Harris or that campaign,"" Alicia Kellch told Fox Digital.

NIKKI HALEY DEFENDS TRUMP SUPPORT AFTER BEING CALLED OUT BY LIZ CHENEY: 'THIS IS ABOUT AMERICA'

Kellch said it is unlikely Cheney would be re-elected in Wyoming if she were to pursue such an avenue, adding that she believes many people who initially voted for Cheney feel ""sold out once they got her in office and realized what her true intentions were.""

Chuck Kucera added in an interview that Cheney is a ""backstabber,"" quipping that a Harris campaign event is ""probably a good place for her.""

John Shelton said Cheney could ""never"" run for office again in Wyoming and that he wouldn't vote for her even ""if she's the last one to be voted for.""

One Wyoming resident told Fox Digital that Cheney teaming up with Harris didn't ""bother"" him and didn't view it as an issue, while noting that ""most folks in Wyoming don't agree with"" Cheney endorsing Harris.

JAN 6 COMMITTEE ALLEGEDLY SUPPRESSED TESTIMONY SHOWING TRUMP ADMIN PUSHED FOR NATIONAL GUARD PRESENCE: REPORT

Two Wyoming residents told Fox News Digital they support Cheney teaming with Harris, with Jennifer Dillinger saying it was ""absolutely amazing.""

""It's amazing how somebody who is extremely conservative, has been Republican her entire life but will support the Constitution and the country and not be specific for the party,"" Dillinger said, adding that it's unlikely Cheney would make a successful return to Wyoming politics as the state is ""too conservative.""

TRUMP CALLS LIZ CHENEY A 'LOW IQ WAR HAWK' AFTER APPEARANCE IN SUPPORT OF HARRIS

Another woman, Randi Chepke, said she's ""thrilled that Liz Cheney is supporting Kamala Harris,"" arguing that Cheney is ""putting our country above her party.""

Chepke added that Cheney's endorsement of Harris will ""absolutely"" encourage some Republican voters to cast ballots for Harris next month.

""I think that she is a die-hard conservative and that she is stating her case about why she thinks it's important to put democracy first. And, you know, frankly, democracy is much more important than the cost of a loaf of bread or a gallon of gas at this point in our lives,"" Chepke said.

Cheney joined Harris in Ripon, Wisconsin, which bills itself as the birthplace of the GOP, on Thursday, and formally endorsed Harris for president.

""I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the audience. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

LIZ CHENEY CALLS SPEAKER JOHNSON 'DANGEROUS' FOR HELPING TRUMP 'UNDERMINE OUR REPUBLIC'

Harris praised Cheney as a leader who ""puts country above party and above self, a true patriot.""

Cheney was the third-most powerful Republican in Congress from 2019 to 2021 but saw her rising star fade in the party as she launched repeated attacks against Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.

""What is important is to recognize we just had a violent mob assault the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to prevent us from carrying out our constitutional duty,"" Cheney said on Jan. 6 after Trump supporters stormed into the Capitol.

""There is no question that the president formed the mob. The president incited the mob, the president addressed the mob. This is what America is not.""

HOUSE JAN 6 COMMITTEE DELETED MORE THAN 100 ENCRYPTED FILES DAYS BEFORE GOP TOOK MAJORITY: SOURCES

Cheney went on to vote to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting an insurrection, sat on the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack to investigate the protest and has continued leveling attacks on Trump this year.

""I ask you to stand in truth. To reject the depraved cruelty of Donald Trump,"" Cheney told the Harris supporters in Wisconsin last week.

Trump has meanwhile slammed Cheney as ""a low IQ War Hawk"" who suffers ""gravely from Trump Derangement Syndrome.""

Cheney lost her GOP congressional primary in Wyoming to Harriet Hageman in 2022, a candidate backed by Trump. She has not announced another run for political office, but Cheney has fueled speculation since leaving the House that she could one day run for president.

Trump sounds alarm on illegal immigrant murderers: 'A lot of bad genes in our country',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-sounds-alarm-illegal-immigrant-murderers-bad-genes-in-country,2024-10-07T22:26:45Z,"Former President Trump discusses new details on the assassination attempt in Butler, Pa. in an exclusive interview with The Ingraham Angle airing Monday at 7 p.m. ET.

Former President Trump on Monday described illegal immigrant murderers as having ""bad genes"" and warned that there are ""a lot of bad genes in our country"" as illegal immigrant crime remains a top issue for voters ahead of the November election.

""How about allowing people to come to an open border, 13,000 of which were murderers, many of them murdered far more than one person, and they're now happily living in the United States,"" the 2024 Republican presidential nominee told radio host Hugh Hewitt.

Trump appeared to be referring to the more than 13,000 illegal immigrants in the U.S. who are on Immigration and Customs Enforcement's non-detained docket with a conviction for homicide. The data was revealed in a letter to lawmakers last month. Some of those, although it is unclear how many, will be in federal or state prisons, and some came into the U.S. in prior administrations. The data says that, among those not in detention, there are 425,431 convicted criminals and 222,141 with pending criminal charges.

NEW POLL REVEALS TRUMP HAS SIGNIFICANT LEAD ON IMMIGRATION, BORDER SECURITY IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE

The data revelation has again fired up the issue of illegal immigrant crime, which has been a top concern for many voters amid a massive border security crisis in which record numbers were seen at the border and a number of high-profile crimes committed allegedly by illegal immigrants.

""You know, now a murderer, I believe this, it's in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now,"" he said.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF THE BORDER SECURITY CRISIS

Trump appeared to be referring only to murderers, but some media outlets quickly pounced on Trump's words and accused him of referring to immigrants more broadly. An NBC News headline described it as the ""latest disparagement of migrants"" from the former president.

The Washington Post, Politico and other mainstream media outlets also echoed this same narrative. Mediaite described Trump's comment as ""chilling"" and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, ""That type of language is hateful, it's disgusting, it's inappropriate. It has no place in our country.""

Trump has promised to take a tougher line on illegal immigration as well as some forms of legal immigration. He has promised to launch a massive deportation campaign if elected. He has also promised to finish the border wall that he started in his first administration and end Biden-era parole programs that have brought hundreds of thousands of migrants into the U.S.

Polls generally show that Trump is leading his Democrat opponent, Vice President Harris, on the issues of immigration and border security. Republicans have said that the Biden administration encouraged and fueled the border crisis by rolling back Trump-era policies and expanding catch-and-release.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

Harris has sought to position herself as the candidate better suited to handle border security, pointing to her past as a prosecutor who went after transnational criminal organizations. She has also backed a bipartisan border security bill unveiled this year that would surge funding for the border and also limit some asylum entries.

Harris and the Biden administration have accused Trump of opposing that bill for political purposes, but conservatives have said the bill would only codify high levels of illegal immigration.

Meanwhile, border encounters are down sharply at the border, with a drop of more than 50% since the summer. The administration puts that down in part to an executive order signed by President Biden that limits asylum entries into the U.S. Harris recently supported a move to toughen up that order further."
"Keith Olbermann calls for Elon Musk to be deported, says Biden needs to get mogul 'the F out of our country'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/keith-olbermann-calls-elon-musk-deported-says-biden-need-get-mogul-the-f-out-our-country,2024-10-07T22:14:56Z,"Elon Musk takes the stage to support Trump at his rally in Butler, Pa. since the assassination attempt against the former president.

Former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann called for Tesla mogul Elon Musk to be deported, suggesting President Biden should use presidential immunity to get the multi-billionaire business magnate ""the F out of our country.""

Olbermann, a staunch critic of former President Trump, is irked that Musk has criticized FEMA and supported the Republican presidential nominee on X, where he boasts over 200 million followers.

""It is now time to cancel all of Elon Musk's government contracts. Tesla, SpaceX, whatever other crap he's selling us,"" Olbermann said on a video posted to social media intended to promote his podcast.

ELON MUSK CALLS 2024 A 'MUST-WIN SITUATION' FOR FREE SPEECH, TOUTS TRUMP'S CHARACTER AFTER BEING 'UNDER FIRE'

While Olbermann doesn't want the government to work with Musk, the former MSNBC host posted the video to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter that is owned by Musk.

Olbermann accused Musk of spreading ""potentially fatal disinformation and misinformation about FEMA's recovery efforts and the impact in the effected states,"" as the Biden-Harris administration has been criticized after sending mixed messages on whether FEMA resources were used to support migrants.

""He is also now working in an in-kind donation turning Twitter X into a Trump advertising campaign. It's time to cancel all the contracts and re-assess his immigration status, and hopefully deport him the hell out of the country,"" Olbermann said.

""If we can't do that by conventional means, President Biden, you have presidential immunity,"" Olbermann continued. ""Get Elon Musk the F out of our country and do it now.""

Olbermann's rant comes on the heels of Musk joining Trump on stage at a campaign rally during his first return to Butler, Pennsylvania since facing an assassination attempt at the hands of 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks at the site just 12 weeks prior.

""The true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire,"" Musk said.

""We had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot,"" he continued. ""America is the home of the brave, and there's no truer test than courage under fire, so who do you want representing America?""

The crowd erupted, waving signs that read ""Never Surrender"" and ""Fight, Fight, Fight"" behind the stage.

Musk, who has outspokenly defended free speech, warned that next month's Nov. 5 face-off between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will be the ""most important election of our lifetime,"" with basic freedoms that are the bedrock of democracy at stake.

""This is a must-win situation,"" Musk told the crowd of 60,000.

Olbermann, the far-left firebrand known for his stormy exits from MSNBC and ESPN, has been among the most outspoken critics of Trump, even moving out of his luxury New York City apartment building because it was owned by him.

He once claimed that Trump and his family had done more damage to the U.S. than 9/11 mastermind Usama bin Laden. Olbermann also once tweeted at then-first daughter Ivanka Trump and called her father a ""neo-Nazi"" and a ""racist."" Olbermann frequently used profanity to criticize Trump.

Olbermann famously walked away from ESPN ahead of the 2020 election so he could speak out against Trump on YouTube and social media.

Aside from supporting Trump, Olbermann took issue with Musk, writing, ""Yup,"" to caption a video of White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre insisting last week that FEMA resources were not used on migrants despite a 2022 video of her saying otherwise. This has been a hot topic as Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Wednesday that FEMA, which he oversees, may not have enough funds to get through the hurricane season.

The White House has said FEMA funds spent on the migrant crisis came from a different funding stream, and those expenditures did not impact the part of FEMA's budget reserved for disaster relief.

LAURA INGRAHAM: What I saw in Butler,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/laura-ingraham-what-i-saw-butler,2024-10-07T21:42:59Z,"There are four weeks left until Election Day and in many states, voting has already started. According to every analyst, the race is going to be extremely close. And over the weekend, President Trump returned to Butler, Pennsylvania - where he survived an assassination attempt in July. The event - one of the most powerful he has ever done - created a unique opportunity to assess the status of the race, and President Trump's place in American history. Here are some observations:

First, the Musk Factor. His appearance for Trump and his urgent appeal to voters is monumental. He speaks for a new bloc of highly educated voters who were not traditionally Republicans yet who recognize that President Trump must win in order to preserve our constitutional freedoms. For months now, an array of former Democrats - including Robert Kennedy, Jr., former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and RFK's former running mate Nicole Shanahan - have been warning us that the people supporting Vice President Kamala Harris have built a political machine so powerful that it threatens our whole political system.

TRUMP REVEALS NEW DETAILS OF FIRST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT IN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: 'IT WAS THE CRAZIEST DAY'

Consider what Harris's supporters have done in recent years:

Elon Musk understands that if these people win again - if they can take a non-qualified puppet like Harris and put her in the White House - then none of us is safe.

Second, J.D. Vance continues to out-perform and impress. This should not be surprising to anyone who has followed him over the past few years (including his frequent appearances on ""The Ingraham Angle""). His rise has been one of the greatest developments of this year.

DAVID MARCUS: TRUMP'S DEFIANT SUPPORTERS FLOCK TO BUTLER RALLY WITH RENEWED CONFIDENCE

When the year began, many in Washington hoped that if they could beat President Trump one more time, then the America First movement he leads would be broken. They were openly rooting for people like former Rep. Liz Cheney to resume her seat in the GOP. They expected that after these elections, the Republican Party would go back to its role of serving as the establishment's junior partner. But now - after his crushing the vice-presidential debate - the establishment is learning that the 40-year-old Vance is a compelling politician who will likely be a national figure for the next 30 years.

Yet Vance is not an anomaly. Under President Trump's leadership, the GOP has developed a deep bench of talented leaders - such as Sens. Marco Rubio, Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Govs. Ron DeSantis, and Glenn Youngkin - who are ready to put their own stamp on this agenda. This crop of leaders will continue to grow the GOP into a multi-ethnic, multi-racial force for working-class people.

TRUMP HOLDS CAMPAIGN RALLY IN BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, MONTHS AFTER JULY ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Third, is Trump himself. The sheer size of the crowd in Butler spoke volumes. The atmosphere was electric. This time, the security was tight, sharpshooters on every visible roof.

President Trump's success has rested on his ability to convince tens of millions of voters that he fights for their interests. Love, gratitude, defiance and patriotism were on full display on the Butler fairgrounds. They are not a threat to democracy - they are simply smart enough to understand how the Washington D.C. Cabal has torn apart America.

Patrick Henry would recognize this type of patriot, as would Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. Most importantly, they are not mindless drones who do what they are told - if you're looking for mindless drones, check out the Network Hacks who take whatever position the Democrats' donors tell them to take. These are good, decent patriots who are trying to save a country they love.

Finally, I saw President Trump. For anyone who has covered politics over the last 30 years, it is obvious that President Trump is really the only person we have covered who truly deserves a place in the history books. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were talented and clever politicians, but they were never willing to say or do anything that really challenged the rich and powerful. The only other GOP administrations, besides Trump, since 1988 - the two Bush administrations - will not be remembered as transformative.

But President Trump has changed America. He has beaten the establishment so badly on economic issues that they have mostly given up trying to talk about them. His foreign policy was so much more successful than theirs that they don't want Harris talking about those issues either.

He has been vilified, impeached, indicted by the most powerful people in the world - he has faced unlimited opposition funding from some of the richest people in the world - and he just keeps fighting.

He is in a stronger position today than he was at this same point in both 2016 and 2020. By promoting Vance and other young Republicans, he has built a movement that will survive him whatever happens in November. And he has shown incredible physical courage by pressing forward in a situation where we have troubling evidence of sheer incompetence on behalf of the Secret Service.

Fifty years from now, one hundred years from now - two hundred years from now - no one will care about Joe Biden or Kamala Harris or Tim Walz. They will be regarded as mouthpieces for a failed establishment. But historians will still be trying to understand President Trump and his movement.

What I hope they will see is what I saw in Butler: Even after two impeachments, endless lawfare, and an assassin's bullet, Trump was a man who refused to give up in his battle for the forgotten working people of America."

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre got into a heated exchange with Fox News Channel's Peter Doocy over the White House sending aid to Lebanon during the hurricane season, which has had devastating effects on North Carolina.

Harris pledged Saturday to send $157 million of ""additional assistance"" to Lebanon while Israel attacks Hezbollah infrastructure and targets in the country. Harris argued the country was ""facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation."" Doocy asked Jean-Pierre why the Biden administration was soliciting congressional input before sending disaster loan funds to North Carolina, but not to send the slush funds to a foreign country.

""On this issue of funding, the administration has money to send to Lebanon without Congress coming back. But Congress does have to come back to approve money to send to people in North Carolina. Do I have that right?"" Doocy said.

""The president and the vice president has had a robust whole-of-government response to this... More than $200 million, ...for the disaster help,"" Jean-Pierre responded, adding that ""people want to do disinformation, misinformation, which is dangerous.""

Doocy asked whether the president's letter to Congress soliciting their help was misinformation.

""No. The way you're asking me the question is misinformation. There is money that we are allocating to the impacted areas, and there's money there to help people who truly need it. There are survivors who need the funding, who need the funding. And it's there,"" she said.

""You can't call a question you don't like misinformation,"" Doocy said.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

""No, what you're asking me is why Congress needs to come back and do their job. That's what you're asking me.

""You may not want that, but that's okay. That's what this president wants, and that's what the vice president wants.""

Jean-Pierre then stormed out of the briefing room.

The administration has been accused of mismanaging funds after Homeland Security's Alejandro Mayorkas said Wednesday ""FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.""

Critics on social media were quick to slam Harris for touting the foreign aid to Lebanon, arguing that many North Carolina residents are struggling to recover from Hurricane Helene.

""Kamala is touting giving money to the people of Lebanon-while stiff-arming the humanitarian crisis in North Carolina,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said on X. ""This is Kamala's Katrina.""

""Could this be any more tone deaf? We have Americans suffering and in danger right now after the hurricane and this is what Kamala has to announce. America First!"" Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., said on X.

The controversial tweet comes as the Biden administration has continued to face backlash for its handling of Helene, with former President Trump calling the federal response to the disaster the ""most incompetently managed 'storm,' at the federal level, ever seen before."""
MAGA candidate vying to flip Virginia Senate seat red stands firm on controversial military comments,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-virginia-senate-candidate-navy-veteran-hung-cao-challenges-turning-virginia-red-from-purple,2024-10-07T21:14:13Z,"Virginia Republican candidate for Senate and Navy veteran Hung Cao says the military should focus on physical and mental preparedness rather than social issues.

Republican candidate Hung Cao, running for the Virginia Senate seat currently held by Democrat Sen. Tim Kaine, is confident he can turn Virginia red from purple.

He's also doubling down on his controversial comments made during last week's debate about U.S. military personnel ""who are going to rip out their own guts, eat them and ask for seconds"" in a bid against progressive social training in the military.

Cao, a 25-year Navy veteran endorsed by former President Trump, told Fox News Digital in an interview, ""It's about warriors that are just going to do anything to win, and those are the people we need.""

VIRGINIA SENATE DEBATE: CLINTON'S EX-RUNNING MATE KAINE AND GOP CHALLENGER CAO SPAR ON IMMIGRATION AND DEI IN THE MILITARY

""And that's what I mean by rip out your own guts, eat them and ask for seconds. That's a true warrior, whether it's a alpha male or alpha female, but not some cross-dressing ... drag queen,"" he said. ""That's not what we need in the military. We need strong men and women that are willing to put their lives online to fight for this country.""

During last week's debate against Kaine, Cao criticized the military's collective failure to recently meet recruiting goals. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer than 30% of Americans aged 17 to 24 were eligible to serve in the military, and this number has declined even more since then.

""There's only so many hours in the day, and there's so much money. And when you're spending all your money and time to look at all these woke issues, you're taking away from time to train for war,"" Cao said.

VIRGINIA FAA CONTRACTOR ALLEGEDLY SPIED FOR IRAN, SHARED PRIVATE INFO ON US AIRPORTS, ENERGY INDUSTRY: DOJ

When it comes to flipping Virginia's Senate seat, Cao is confident he can achieve it despite the Cook Political Report designating the seat as solid blue.

Cao argued that the Cook report is wrong, noting how he reduced Biden's 19% margin in Northern Virginia to 6% in 2022. He highlighted that despite Trump losing Virginia by 10 points in 2010, Republicans won all statewide races in 2021 and gained a seat in 2022. In 2023, more Republicans voted than Democrats despite Democrat gerrymandering efforts.

""And so, you know, having moved north Virginia the way I did, and if the south comes out, we're going to win this race,"" he said.

Trump has endorsed Cao, and political scientists say his path to victory is narrow, given Virginia's moderate electorate, aversion to Trump in 2020 and Kaine's salience with voters, according to the Associated Press.

"Kamala Harris courts disillusioned Arab Americans over Jewish groups, records show",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-courts-disillusioned-arab-americans-over-jewish-groups,2024-10-07T19:30:40Z,"Fox News' Trey Yingst reports the latest on the devastation from the Oct. 7 attack on Israel one year later. The 'Outnumbered' panel also discusses the tragedy as the Israel-Hamas war rages on.

Vice President Kamala Harris appears to prioritize winning back Arab American and Muslim voters who were dejected by President Joe Biden's handling of war in the Middle East over courting the Jewish voter.

That's according to an internal review of her calendar meetups with both groups since becoming the Democratic nominee for president.

Harris met with Arab American advocates ahead of a campaign event in Flint, Michigan, on Friday. That followed a meeting with activists with the Pro-Palestinian Uncommitted Movement, which has declined to endorse her, in Michigan in July.

Her public schedule hasn't included meetings with Jewish groups since meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu privately in July, after she declined to preside over his joint address to Congress.

In August, her campaign nominated Ilan Goldenberg as its liaison to the Jewish community, and on Aug. 15, Harris sent campaign officials to meet with Jewish leaders in Michigan. In September, she called the parents of the late Hersch Goldberg-Polin, the American hostage slain by Hamas. Fox News Digital could not find a record of any other face-to-face Jewish outreach by Harris.

Wa'el Alzayat, the CEO of Emgage Action, told CNN that Harris had told the Arab group on Friday ""that she also wants the war to end and that she will do all she can to work in this regard.""

The Arab Americans told her she needed ""to show distance between how she would govern on this matter with the current administration policies, which we don't agree with.""

HARRIS REFUSES TO CALL NETANYAHU A 'CLOSE ALLY' ONE YEAR AFTER OCTOBER 7

Michigan, which Biden narrowly won in 2020, is a crucial battleground state this election. It has the second-highest population of Arab American residents, who make up around 3% of its population.

On the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, former President Donald Trump will speak to Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in Doral. Harris will briefly speak to journalists and plant a pomegranate tree on the grounds of the Vice President's Residence in honor of those killed a year ago.

One year on from the outbreak of war with Hamas in Gaza, Israel is now entrenched in war on other fronts too. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) recently launched a ground offensive in Lebanon to fight Hezbollah, and last week missiles rained down on Tel Aviv -- though most were intercepted -- from Iran.

Jewish Americans tend to vote Democratic -- in 2020, Biden won 69% of their vote. Trump won 30%.

Harris' focus on Arab American outreach could in part be due to shifting polling within the community and an aggressive outreach from the Trump campaign to capitalize on that.

Arab Americans also historically favor Democrats -- but new polling suggests that could change. Of likely voters in the community, Arab Americans favor Trump over Harris 46% to 42%, according to new polling by the Arab American Institute.

Trump has been airing ads aimed at Arab Americans in Michigan, and his former director of national intelligence Ric Grenell and his daughter Tiffany Trump's father-in-law Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman, have been leading his outreach to the community.

HARRIS WON'T SAY WHETHER BIDEN ADMIN HAS ANY 'SWAY' OVER NETANYAHU

""His outreach now is much better, much different than it was in 2016 and 2020,"" Adel Ayoub, leader of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, told Fox News Digital of Trump.

Biden won 60% of the Arab American vote in 2020, but support from that community has cratered since the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, 2023.

The National Uncommitted movement launched a campaign calling on voters to cast uncommitted ballots in swing state primaries to send a message to Democrats, and more than a million did so.

Harris spoke with leaders of the Uncommitted Movement in August. That same month, her campaign manager met with Arab and Muslim leaders.

Trump has blamed Harris and Biden for loosening sanctions on Iran, thus emboldening Iran's proxies to carry out the attack last year.

Trump has repeatedly said that Jewish voters who vote for Democrats ""should have their head examined"" and that if he loses the Nov. 5 election, ""the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that."""

Sen. JD Vance blasted the Biden-Harris administration on Monday for not doing enough to bring home the hostages that Hamas took from Israel during the deadly Oct. 7 attack one year ago.

Vance, R-Ohio, spoke during the Philos Project's Memorial Rally and March on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., briefly taking aim at President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

""I'm going to get a little political here. It is disgraceful that we have an American president and vice president who haven't done a thing,"" Vance said. ""Vice President Harris, our message is, 'Bring them home.' Use your authority to help bring them home. We can do it. We just need real leadership.""

Iran-backed Hamas terrorists launched a massacre against Israel in the Oct. 7 attack last year, killing about 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, and taking about 250 hostages. A year later, about 100 people, including several Americans, remain in Hamas captivity, as U.S.-led efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage release deal have sputtered out.

ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS SET UP ENCAMPMENT OUTSIDE JEWISH DEM REP'S HOME ON EVE OF OCT 7 HAMAS ATTACK ANNIVERSARY

The attack sparked a war in Gaza, where Israel has moved to eliminate Hamas and return those taken hostage. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians.

Harris came under fire Sunday for a lengthy ""word salad"" answer in which she appeared unable to fully commit to Israel during an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes.""

US ON ALERT FOR POSSIBLE 'VIOLENT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY' ON AMERICANS ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7

Meanwhile, Vance gave full-throated support for Israel, saying that former President Trump will make sure Israel has the right to protect itself and that the hostages are returned home.

""I speak for Donald Trump and saying that when he is president, America will protect our American Jewish brothers and sisters. We will stop funding anti-American and anti-Jewish radicals. And we are going to bring home American hostages wherever they're held and whoever is holding them,"" he said.

"Harris says wealthy Americans, corporations will pay higher taxes to fund economic plan",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-says-wealthy-americans-corporations-will-pay-higher-taxes-to-fund-economic-plan,2024-10-07T18:36:59Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris told CBS ""60 Minutes"" in an interview set to air on Monday that she plans to pay for her economic plan by taxing the rich.

Vice President Kamala Harris plans to increase taxes on wealthy individuals and large corporations as part of her economic plan if elected in November, she said in a new interview.

Since becoming the Democratic Party's official nominee for president, Harris has said she will provide $25,000 housing subsidies for first-generation home buyers, implement $100 billion in tax credits for the manufacturing sector and increase small business tax credits by tenfold.

""My plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy,"" Harris told ""60 Minutes"" in a clip released on Monday.

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

""60 Minutes"" correspondent Bill Whitaker reminded Harris that the question was ""how are you going to pay for it?""

Harris quickly said that wealthy Americans would foot the bill.

""I'm going to make sure that the richest among us, who can afford it, pay their fair share in taxes,"" Harris said.

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations,"" Harris continued. ""I plan on making that fair.""

Whitaker shot back, ""But we're dealing with the real world here,"" and asked how that plan would get through Congress.

""You know, when you talk, quietly, with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I am talking about,"" Harris said.

""Cause their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about,"" Harris added. ""Their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses.""

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

Harris' opponent, former President Trump, was invited to appear on ""60 Minutes"" as well for its election interview special, but he declined.

Last month, Harris unveiled new small-business tax proposals last week aimed at reducing the cost burden related to starting a new business. Among the proposals was a substantial increase in the standard tax deduction for small-business startup costs, from $5,000 to $50,000. ""It's essentially a tax cut for starting a small business,"" the vice president said during a stump speech announcing the new proposal. ""We're going to help more small businesses and innovators get off the ground.""

Harris has simultaneously expressed support for raising marginal tax rates for both corporations and individuals, which conservative economists argued would work to diminish the benefit received by the tenfold increase in the startup deduction.

In addition to Harris' new tax proposals for small businesses, she also laid out her plan this week for taxing capital gains. She wants to increase it to 33%, whereas Biden reportedly wants the current rate, which is at 23.8%, to be nearly doubled, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Harris has also suggested support for increasing government spending to support families' child care needs, while also expanding the child tax credit, among other proposals.

Georgia GOP chair shares 2-pronged election strategy as Trump works to win back Peach State,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-gop-chair-shares-2-pronged-election-strategy-trump-works-win-back-peach-state,2024-10-07T16:33:54Z,"ATLANTA - Georgia GOP Chairman Josh McKoon is ""cautiously optimistic"" that Republicans can win back the Peach State after it emerged as a critical battleground in the previous presidential race.

The path to victory lies in two key blocs - early voters, and those who lean Republican but are largely apathetic to the process overall - McKoon indicated in an interview with Fox News Digital.

""We feel good about things here in Georgia,"" the former state senator said. ""We've got a lot of work to do over the next month or so, but we feel like we're in position to win.""

KAMALA HARRIS' SUPPORT WITH ARAB AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN IS 'TENUOUS': DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST

He pointed to some recent surveys that show former President Trump with a slight edge over Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as early figures on absentee voting.

Early and absentee voters were key to President Biden's victory nationwide in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic largely forced Americans to stay home.

In Georgia, parts of which were ravaged by Hurricane Helene just over a week ago, early and absentee voters may prove just as critical this year. Biden beat Trump in the Peach State by roughly 12,000 votes in 2020.

""One very important lesson is the importance of early voting. We have three weeks of in-person early voting here in Georgia. Republicans traditionally have not done a whole lot to target our voters to get them out early - to make a plan and go ahead and bank those votes,"" McKoon said.

""As a result, we had to spend an enormous amount of time and resources trying to move the vast majority of our voters to the polls on Election Day.""

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

Motivating many of those likely voters to turn out early, McKoon explained, frees up state party resources ""to focus on low-propensity voters who are likely to vote for President Trump, if we just get them to the polls.""

""But of course, those voters need to be touched multiple times. And so, early voting plays a huge role in our overall strategy,"" McKoon said.

When asked how low-propensity voters could be reached, the Republican official explained it's more a matter of outreach than identification.

""Of course, all of that requires resources. That requires money - put mail in the mailbox, ads on television, telephone calls to their home, knocking on their door. We're trying to do all of those things,"" McKoon said.

Another factor of the Trump campaign's nationwide outreach - and in Georgia, in particular - is convincing Black male voters to vote Republican.

Trump allies have said that securing roughly 20% of support from Black men across the U.S. could be critical to swaying the election in his favor.

A recent Howard University public opinion poll found that roughly one in five Black men under age 50 who are living in battleground states support Trump.

""You see the work that's being done, you know, Black Voices for Trump, a lot of the other movements, grassroots movements, around the state. Direct voter contact, again, is really king in this area. But no one's better at that than President Trump himself,"" McKoon said.

""That's really about economic anxiety and the feeling that this administration, with its open borders policies, are making it even more difficult for Black voters to get ahead in this country.""

Georgia's early voting period runs from Oct. 15 through Nov. 1."

""Joe Biden does keep popping up,"" Dovere told CNN host Kasie Hunt, referencing recent exchanges with reporters, specifically after former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney endorsed Harris and when he made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room on Friday.

""On Friday, when Joe Biden felt like he had had a good week at the White House and wanted to go to the briefing room to talk about it, they did not coordinate that with the Harris campaign. The Harris campaign found out about that a couple of minutes before he showed up. He showed up right after Kamala Harris went onstage in Detroit. I can tell you that a lot of people on the Harris campaign did not find that helpful,"" Dovere said.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

""Biden in the next couple of days is heading to Angola and Germany. It's not like a really pressing foreign trip. A lot of people in the Harris campaign wish that he would maybe go away for longer at this point,"" he added.

He said that Harris was in a tricky situation as the incumbent vice president.

""Harris has to embody and embrace that change and speak to that change, while also being a quasi incumbent and having Donald Trump and JD Vance attack her as if she has been the one signing the executive orders,"" he said.

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Dovere reported on Sunday that Biden's closest advisers, citing people who have spoken with them in recent days, still believe the president ""would be in the same spot or better right now had he stayed in the race.""

A veteran Democratic consultant laughed when CNN mentioned the advisers' feelings and told the outlet, ""that's literally insane.""

Several high-profile volunteers with the group Women for Trump flew to Georgia to provide relief for victims of Hurricane Helene in the group's first mission before they crisscross the country to support communities in need.

RNC co-chair Lara Trump, former DNC vice chair and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, former Georgia GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler, former NASCAR driver Danica Patrick, and former ESPN anchor Sage Steele launched their ""Save America"" tour on Thursday in Austell, Georgia.

The group traveled to Austell via commercial air. Their travel was paid for by the Trump campaign, the group said.

The group donated thousands of dollars of supplies to Sweetwater Mission - a social services organization in Austell that helps to prevent hunger and homelessness - with the assistance of Goya Cares.

""They put us on the map. We got a call from a woman in New Mexico wanting to donate to us. And we said, 'How did you know about us?'

""You've put us on the map, and I can't thank you enough.""

Lara Trump said, in turn, Women for Trump is ""incredibly grateful for Goya Cares,"" because they have ""allowed us to donate thousands of pounds of non-perishable food for the people of this community.""

""We're here in the wake of Hurricane Helene and honored to be able to give back,"" Lara Trump said. ""We've also been able to secure water, blankets, diapers, and items to meet the immediate needs of those impacted by Hurricane Helene.""

With less than a month to go until Election Day in November, a new poll indicates Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Trump among self-identified Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada, two crucial southwestern battleground states.

But Trump has made gains with younger male Hispanic voters compared to four years ago, according to a pair of Suffolk University/USA Today surveys released on Monday.

According to the poll, Harris leads Trump 57%-38% among Hispanic voters in Arizona, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver both under 1% support. Three percent of voters remain undecided. When asked how they voted in the 2020 election, 55% of those Hispanic voters said they voted for President Biden, while a third said they voted for Trump.

The vice president's lead over the former president is slightly smaller in neighboring Nevada, at 56%-40%. According to the survey, Independent American Party's Joel Skousen is just over 1%, Libertarian Chase Oliver is under 1%, and 2% are undecided. When asked how they voted in the 2020 election, 56% said they voted for Biden, while 33% said they voted for Trump.

""So far, Harris is falling short of the 24-26 point advantage that Joe Biden carried with Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada in 2020, according to the exit polls from those states,"" Suffolk University Political Research Center director David Paleologos highlighted. ""This Democratic shortfall is largely due to young Hispanic men.""

In both states, a majority of men under 50 years of age are choosing Trump over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 53%-40% among Hispanic men ages 18-34 in Nevada, and tops her 53%-39% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

In Arizona, the Republican presidential nominee leads the Democratic Party standard-bearer 51%-39% among Hispanic men ages 18-34, and 57%-37% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

TIGHTEST PRESIDENTIAL RACE SINCE 2000 - WITH ONE MONTH UNTIL ELECTION DAY

The economy and immigration were the top two issues on the minds of those questioned in the survey in both states.

Arizona and Nevada have referendums to protect access to abortion on the ballot in November - and the poll indicates majority support for the measures in both states.

Arizona and Nevada - along with Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin - had razor-thin margins in the 2020 presidential election that decided Biden's victory over Trump. And all seven states are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election in the race for the White House.

Watch the full ""Ingraham Angle"" interview with former President Trump, Monday night at 7:00pm ET on Fox News Channel.

President Trump revealed new details about his first assassination attempt during his second rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, including how his son Barron found out about the attack during an exclusive interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham.

""Barron was playing tennis with his friends, and somebody walked over and ran over and said, 'Your father's been shot. He's been shot,'"" Trump told ""The Ingraham Angle."" ""Barron really likes his father a lot... and he came in [saying], 'Mom, mom, Mom, what happened?'""

""Then they saw me get up, and then they saw the fist bump... it's very interesting,"" he continued. ""When I got up, people thought maybe he's dead.""

Trump rallied tens of thousands of supporters at the same site in Butler where he was shot in the ear by gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks on July 13.

During the first attempt on his life, Trump was rushed off-stage by the Secret Service and taken to a local hospital, where he said it was shut down upon his arrival.

""The hospital was great, and I didn't realize this -- when a president goes to an area, they close the hospital in its entirety, it's ready for exactly this,"" he said. ""I didn't know they did. I got there, doctors and nurses were outside, and no people. They literally close it, almost like they expect this.""

""It's... genius, but who would ever think that? And I was so impressed,"" he continued.

After Trump was shot in the ear and Secret Service agents swarmed him, shoving him to the ground as shots were fired, he quickly got up as they escorted him off the stage and held his fist in the air while mouthing the words, ""fight, fight, fight.""

""I convinced them I thought I was only hit in the ear. It's very interesting,"" he recalled. ""But they got me up and I watched and it was dead silent, even though I was standing up and in vision because people didn't know I was alive or not, and then when I did the fist pump, everybody realized and they're screaming, 'USA, USA.' It was the craziest day. It was a crazy time.""

Trump also held a moment of silence for Corey Comperatore at 6:11 p.m., the exact time that Crooks began firing at the former president on July 13. Comperatore, a rally attendee, father, husband and firefighter, was fatally wounded while protecting his family.

Speaking at the beginning of his speech in Butler, Trump acknowledged Comperatore's death and thanked his relatives - including his widow and their daughters - for attending.

Elon Musk also made a grand appearance and delivered remarks, urging supporters to vote as the election nears.

""Just be a pest to everyone,"" he said to the audience. ""You know, people on the street everywhere: Vote, vote, vote!""

""Fight, fight, fight, vote, vote, vote,"" Musk added. At one point, the X owner jumped excitedly.

As U.S. support for aiding Ukraine continues to fracture Americans, Kersti Kaljulaid, the former president of Estonia, wants to remind Americans what's at stake.

Estonia, a country in Northern Europe bordered by the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland, is slightly larger than Denmark and has a coastline with 1,521 islands.

Kaljulaid described what's happening across the world as a ""tectonic shift,"" during a recent interview with Fox News Digital at her nation's embassy in Washington, D.C. ""There is the freedom-loving world. And then there are the others - the new Axis of Evil - China, Iran, North Korea, Russia. China is leading that coalition.""

""Ukraine, with its brave action, has offered us the opportunity to score the first victory in this battle, and I think we should not miss it,"" she said.

And the cost of securing the so-called ""freedom-loving world"" is relatively little, she argues.

""It's very important to understand that Ukrainians are dying, but we, the West, have not spent anything close to what normally needs to be spent to win war. We are spending at the rate of 0.1% of GDP. And frankly speaking, if we could spend 0.5, then Ukraine will win, and it would be first time in history where a major conflict can be actually be won with so little resources.""

Her visit came just after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the U.S., causing a stir among Republicans after he visited Pennsylvania - swing state - with only Democratic lawmakers and called Sen. JD Vance ""too radical.""

UKRAINIAN STRONGHOLD VUHLEDAR FALLS TO RUSSIAN OFFENSIVE

He was here to beg for the U.S.'s blessing to use the long-range missiles it provides to strike deep inside Russian territory. So far, his pleas have gone unanswered. The Biden administration fears provoking nuclear-armed Russia and furthering U.S. involvement in the war.

""I think the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast has demonstrated to us that the Russian threats [of escalation], they carry no value,"" Kaljulaid said.

In August, Ukrainian troops made a risky move, invading Kursk Oblast and taking over the Russian territory, using their best tanks in the offensive, which left several key villages and towns along the southern and eastern front lines for Russia's taking.

Kaljulaid said she supports Zelenskyy's request to lift restrictions on the ATACMs, pointing out that Ukraine already uses these weapons to strike in Crimea, which Russia views as its territory.

LITHUANIAN FM WARNS RUSSIA CAN DO 'SO MUCH DAMAGE TO ITS NEIGHBORS'

""You could say, I mean, paradoxically, there is nothing new.""

""Putin is not playing the old Cold War game where one side escalated, then the other side did, and then everybody sat down and negotiated the levels down again. I mean, Putin's regime is a terrorist regime.""

She went on: ""It doesn't abide by any rules. All the bridges are burned. So when they decide it's worth escalating, they will decide anyway, but we should do the right thing and not worry about escalation.""

A University of Maryland Critical Issues Poll conducted in July and August found 48% of Americans say the U.S. should support Ukraine in its fight against Russia's incursion ""as long as it takes."" Thirty-nine percent said support should last 1-2 years and another 11% thought it should last 2-5 years.

The U.S. has spent around $175 billion aiding the war in Ukraine, $106 billion of which went directly to the government of Ukraine. The rest funded U.S. activities associated with the war and other affected nations in the region.

""This is about a third of the money which is considered waste in the COVID pandemic spending [in the U.S.]""

""If we compare it to our economic might of the free world, then we haven't done that much,"" said Kaljulaid.

""Europeans are doing even more. And this is a common error as well, to think that Europe is not doing its part. Europe's doing even more than us right now, and I would really like to have a healthy competition. Who does more?""

The U.S. has given more money to Ukraine since the outbreak of war, followed by Germany, the U.K., Japan, and Canada. As a percentage of their GDP, Denmark, Estonia and Lithuania topped the ranking, with 1.8, 1.7, and 1.4%, respectively.

Kaljulaid declined to say whether relations would become more difficult under a second Trump presidency - Trump has spoken out against aiding Ukraine and claimed he could negotiate peace with Zelenskyy and Putin.

In fact, she had an optimistic outlook that Trump could come to support Eastern Europe if elected to a second term, just as she said he did in his first term.

""Eastern Europe had quite a big presence. Trump visited Poland, [former Vice President] Mike Pence visited Talinn [Estonia's capital].""

She noted Trump's work on the Three Seas Initiative and actions to end Syria's chemical weapons attacks on its civilians.

""That was not a simple thing. It was a quite courageous thing, and it was exactly what you expect from Republican foreign policy of the United States - to defend the free world."""
Harris' 'word salad' answer on Israel alliance confounds social media users: 'Someone please interpret',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-word-salad-answer-israel-alliance-confounds-social-media-users-someone-please-interpret,2024-10-07T13:03:40Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris did not directly answer a question about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's relationship with the U.S. and refused to say whether the U.S had any sway over him.

Vice President Kamala Harris was roasted on social media for a comment on Israel and how she ""can't make any sense at all"" in a new viral clip.

Harris gave a rare sit-down interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" Sunday, where Bill Whitaker asked whether the U.S. has any ""sway"" over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the war against Hamas continues. Monday marks one year since the brutal terrorist attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel. And when we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah presents, Iran, I think that it is without any question, our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks,"" Harris responded.

She continued, ""Now the work we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and create a cease-fire. And we're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.""

BILL MAHER TRASHES KAMALA HARRIS FOR BEING 'FULL OF S---' ON ISRAEL, MIDDLE EAST: 'JUST SHUT UP'

The lengthy ""word salad"" and her inability to commit to Israel as an ally shocked and frustrated several X users after the clip premiered.

""Kamala is asked about Israel, can't make any sense at all. Kamala is like a running team that's behind that can't throw the ball. After hiding her for months, they are now panicking and doing interviews everywhere. But that's going to get her behind more,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis, a supporter of former President Trump, wrote.

Former ESPN anchor Sage Steele asked, ""Someone please interpret what she just said here...""

""People talk this way when they have absolutely nothing substantive to say because they know next to nothing about the subject at hand,"" Federalist senior editor John Daniel Davidson said.

""Shocking,"" Fox News host Mark Levin exclaimed.

Comedian Tim Young commented, ""60 minutes asked Kamala if Netanyahu even listens to us after we give Israel weapons and money. Kamala replies with a pile of word salad. It would be easier if she just said that no world leader respects or listens to her even after we hand out money.""

""This is the real Kamala. And she's no friend of Israel,"" California Rep. Darrell Issa wrote.

New York Rep. Elise Stefanik wrote, ""Israel is taking out Iranian-backed terrorists across the Middle East, making the world safer for Israel and the United States yet Kamala Harris refuses to say that Prime Minister Netanyahu is a strong ally to America. Kamala Harris is unfit to be the President of the United States.""

NEWT GINGRICH SOUNDS OFF ON KAMALA HARRIS' 'WORD SALAD' INTERVIEWS, 'INSANE' POSITION ON ISRAEL-HAMAS

During the interview, Harris dodged repeated questions from Whitaker over her support for Israel.

Whitaker asked, ""Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?""

""I think with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people, and the answer to that question is yes,"" Harris responded.

Harris was also criticized last month for providing scant details about whether she would change her policies on Israel as president.

Blue Philly working class voters start leaning towards Trump ahead of election: 'People actually love him',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/blue-philly-working-class-voters-start-leaning-towards-trump-ahead-election-people-actually-love-him,2024-10-07T11:17:30Z,"Working-class Philadelphia Democrats may be planning to vote for former President Trump in November.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Wednesday about growing trends among poorer wards and districts in the Pennsylvania city to shift towards the Republican Party despite years of being solidly blue.

One example the report cited included 27-year-old Gabriel Lopez who registered as a Democrat and voted for Hillary Clinton for his first election in 2016. Since then, he changed his registration to Republican and voiced his support for Trump.

""Democrats keep saying [Trump] is going to bring down the economy, but he was already president for four years, and taxes were lower,"" Lopez said. ""We're tired of the same politics. We got a different type of guy, and the people actually love him.""

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

The article added, ""Lopez embodies one of Democrats' biggest problems in Pennsylvania: working-class voters in Philadelphia, a once reliable voting bloc for the party, have drifted right in recent years. And they've been disproportionately affected by rising prices over the last several years, an issue many blame Democrats for.""

Although Philadelphia, which holds 20% of the state's Democratic voters, may be crucial for Vice President Kamala Harris to win the state, the Inquirer reported the city lost the most Democratic voters out of any city in the 2020 election.

The trend was most pronounced in poorer, less-educated areas with majority-Latino neighborhoods showing the most movement, likely concerned about the economy.

Retired truck driver and registered Democrat Jim Kohn listed that as his top issue.

""When Trump was president, everything was cheaper,"" Kohn said. ""Now, everything is so sky-high.""

Other Democrats in the area remained optimistic about Harris' chances, though some understood the growing support for Trump.

""Many of us have people in our families who have gone to jail, or gone to schools that have failed us. We're not trustful of the government,"" Álvarez Febo, a Democrat who plans to vote for Harris, said. ""Then you have someone like Trump, who is a liar, and for some people, it's like, 'you know something? He's an honest representation of what we feel.'""

""They're saying Kamala is going to save our democracy,"" Febo added. ""That means very little for people who can't keep the lights on.""

Some Republicans, by contrast, were very optimistic about a potential political shift in the city.

""When I first started in politics in 1978, the managerial class was Republican -- no one votes the way their bosses vote,"" 45th Ward GOP Leader Charlie O'Connor said. ""Now, most people in the managerial class vote Democratic and no one is voting the way their boss is. So it's been a flip. Most of the bosses are Democrats and the Democratic Party has become the party of the upper middle class.""

Pennsylvania is considered one of the most competitive states for this presidential election. A Fox News survey found Harris and Trump tied at 49% among likely voters in the state. Trump previously won Pennsylvania in the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton but lost the state in 2020 to President Biden."

""Saturday Night Live"" creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels admitted he has not reached out and will not reach out to the presidential candidates for a potential cameo ahead of the election.

In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter Tuesday, Michaels explained it would be unlikely for former President Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris to appear for the show's milestone 50th anniversary season, citing the need for ""equal time"" to both of them.

""You can't bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,"" Michaels said. ""You can't have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.""

However, he did not rule out a potential appearance from either of them after the election, when they would no longer be presidential candidates.

""Everybody knows what we do, and I think we're going to do it again. It's what we're supposed to be doing,"" Michaels said. ""So, what's interesting is if you say to the people that we just did that to, 'Do you want to come on because we have a way to do it with you in it?' They almost always say yes.""

The Federal Communications Commission's ""equal-time rule"" was established in 1934 and required radio and television broadcast stations to provide the same amount of time for competing political candidates. There are exceptions to the rule such as newscasts, documentaries and political debates.

Despite the equal-time rule, ""Saturday Night Live"" has allowed political candidates onto its show without providing equal time to their opponents in the past. Then-Senator Obama appeared in the cold opening of a November 2007 episode several months after announcing his candidacy that year.

Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin also appeared in an episode in October 2008, one month before the 2008 presidential election.

Trump himself hosted an episode in November 2015, months after launching his first presidential campaign.

SCOTUS kicks off historic term under scrutiny amid ethics code debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scotus-kicks-off-historic-term-scrutiny-ethics-code-debate,2024-10-07T10:05:55Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Supreme Court begins its new term today amid lingering internal strife over several recent rulings, with details of its thorny internal deliberations selectively leaked to certain media outlets.

All of this as the nine justices have come under increasing public scrutiny and criticism over perceived blatant partisanship on hot-button issues, ethics controversies and its own wilting reputation as a body remaining above politics.

""The Supreme Court, in a sense, is on the ballot this election, or at least the future of the Supreme Court,"" said Thomas Dupree, an appellate attorney and former top Justice Department official. ""So any time the court wades into political waters, it's going to be upsetting people, people who are on the side that loses. And they'll say the court shouldn't have got involved in the political fray. The court recognizes that it's not something that it wants to do, but in some cases, it has no choice.""

JUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON SAYS SHE WOULD SUPPORT AN 'ENFORCEABLE CODE' OF ETHICS FOR THE SUPREME COURT

Here are five questions confronting the Supreme Court:

Directly or indirectly, the nine members of the Supreme Court could again play an outsized role in determining who will be the next president.

There is no indication yet of another Bush v. Gore, the case in which the justices in 2000 ended ongoing litigation over the Florida election results, essentially handing the presidency to George W. Bush.

But the high court four years ago summarily refused to consider a series of lawsuits from Trump and other Republicans in five states President Biden won: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Former President Trump has again promised court challenges if he loses, and in a recent social media post, he said this election ""will be under the closest professional scrutiny"" and ""people that cheated will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.""

Trump has proceeded with his campaign without the imminent cloud of legal jeopardy hanging over his head. His criminal sentencing in the New York business fraud conviction has been postponed until November at least.

And his two separate federal cases involving document mishandling and 2020 election interference have been deferred indefinitely. Those prosecutions could disappear entirely if Trump is elected and dismisses the Justice Department's special counsel.

All this after the Supreme Court in July ruled former presidents enjoy a substantial amount of immunity for ""official acts"" committed in office. Trump has used that ruling to demand both of his federal cases be dismissed.

Two justices took the unusual step of commenting publicly on its effect.

""You gave us a very hard question,"" Justice Neil Grouch exclusively told Fox News' ""America Reports"" co-anchor Sandra Smith. ""It's the first time in American history that one presidential administration was seeking to bring criminal charges against a predecessor. We had to go back and look at what sources were available to us.""

The Trump appointee said the Supreme Court ruled in Nixon v. Fitzgerald (1982) that civil claims cannot be brought against a president ""presumptively, in his official capacity, after he leaves office. Why? Because that would chill him from exercising the powers and duties of a president while he is president,"" Gorsuch said. ""He would be overwhelmed. His political enemies would simply bring suits against him forevermore.""

But Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was on the losing side of the 6-3 opinion, has taken another approach.

""I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances, when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same,"" she told CBS News while promoting her new book, ""Lovely One: A Memoir.""

The Supreme Court has already gotten involved in several pre-election challenges: allowing some redistricting maps for congressional seats to go into effect and blocking others.

And the justices last month allowed Arizona to temporarily enforce its law requiring proof of citizenship on state voter registration forms.

'STOP PRETENDING': CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST WANTS DEMS BEHIND SCOTUS ETHICS RULES TO TAKE THEIR OWN MEDICINE

Five days before President Biden withdrew as a candidate for re-election, he made the Supreme Court a major political issue.

Word leaked from the White House on July 16 that Biden was seriously considering proposals to establish term limits for the justices, and an ethics code that would be enforceable under law, amid growing concerns they were not being held accountable.

The proposal was made public days later, including a congressional law limiting justices to 18-year terms despite the Constitution's guarantee of life tenure for all federal judges.

Biden framed it as an effort to address ""recent extreme opinions the Supreme Court has handed down [that] have undermined long-established civil rights principles and protections.""

Public calls for changes came after revelations of previously undisclosed free trips and gifts by the justices and lucrative book deals. Recent public polls support greater ethics reform.

Other federal judges are bound by an enforceable code of conduct, but the high court had long resisted being included.

Under Chief Justice John Roberts' leadership, he and his colleagues adopted a revised code last year, but it still lacks any enforcement mechanism, which critics say makes it feckless and ineffective.

Fox News previously reported that the court had been privately meeting for months on how to structure a new ethics code, one that would address public concerns over its behavior without abdicating what Roberts in particular had said was the court's independence on such matters from congressional oversight.

So, the justices have near-total discretion to decide whether to abide by the new code.

But growing and very public calls for more have come from some justices in recent days.

""A binding code of ethics is pretty standard for judges,"" said Jackson, ""and so I guess the question is: Is the Supreme Court any different? I guess I have not seen a persuasive reason as to why the court is different.""

""I am considering supporting it as a general matter,"" she said. ""I'm not going to get into commenting on particular policy proposals, but from my perspective, I don't have any problem with an enforceable code.""

And Justice Elena Kagan, perhaps the most vocal advocate for an enforcement provision, said this month, ""It seems like a good idea in terms of ensuring that people have confidence that we're doing exactly that. So, it seems like a salutary thing for the court.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., recently told the chief justice that the unilateral ethics code adopted by the justices falls short and needs an enforcement trigger.

In a closed-door meeting with federal judges attending a semiannual policymaking conference at the high court, Durbin was seated next to Roberts and made clear that failure by the justices to strengthen their judicial code of conduct could prompt congressional intervention.

Sources say Roberts made no commitments but thanked Durbin for the ongoing dialogue on the issue.

But Justice Neil Gorsuch urged caution, telling ""Fox News Sunday"" host Shannon Bream last month that he did not want to get into ""what is now a political issue during a presidential election year.""

He added about the role of an independent judiciary, ""It's there for the moments when the spotlight's on you, when the government's coming after you. And don't you want a ferociously independent judge and a jury of your peers to make those decisions? Isn't that your right as an American? And so I just say be careful.""

TOP DEM PLOTS TYING SCOTUS FUNDING TO 'ENFORCEABLE' ETHICS CODE AMID THOMAS, ALITO CONTROVERSIES

Following the contentious conclusion of the court's term in July, much was written about the ""Barrett Factor"" and the supposedly evolving jurisprudence of Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

She has become something of a recent lightning rod on the right and left over her occasional willingness to depart from her fellow conservatives, especially in cases involving the man who appointed her in 2020.

The 52-year-old Barrett took issue with some conclusions in the former president's historic immunity ruling and criticized parts of the majority ruling keeping him on the ballot in Colorado.

And breaking with conservatives, she separately authored pointed dissents on an obstruction case dealing with a 2021 U.S. Capitol riot suspect as well as an environmental case on federal rules to manage downwind air pollution.

Many court watchers on the left characterized her ""burgeoning"" legal reasoning as an ""independent streak,"" increasingly ready to ""skewer"" her right-leaning colleagues and a ""principled voice in the middle"" with a strong set of principles that present a ""different world view"" from other conservative justices.

But other legal observers say it is too early to dub Barrett the new deciding vote on hot-button cases who would resist walking lockstep with any ideological bloc.

""I don't think she's really trying to become the 'swing' justice or auditioning for that role. She's calling these cases as she sees them, and she's, generally speaking, a conservative justice,"" said Dupree. ""But what we've seen over the last term is Justice Barrett really coming into her own. She has the confidence to write separately and in some cases to break from the other conservatives when she sees the law a little differently. I suspect that will continue.""

And it remains clear Barrett's conservative credentials in most cases are solid: She has ruled to strike down Roe v. Wade, expand gun rights and scale back affirmative action in higher education.

SCOTUS GIVES PARTIAL VICTORY TO GOP TRYING TO ENFORCE PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP TO VOTE IN ARIZONA

We recently highlighted potential Supreme Court nominees in another Biden or Trump administration, based on what sources in both camps exclusively told Fox News.

Now the dynamic has shifted, with Vice President Harris heading the Democrat ticket.

Campaign sources say the whirlwind of taking over the nomination from her boss in recent weeks has left Harris, her legal advisers and campaign team little time to focus on the what-ifs of choosing justices or broader legal policy.

But it is a topic of particular interest to the former prosecutor, state attorney general and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Administration sources say that since taking office, she has been part of the inner circle cultivating an informal White House list of high court possibles. And Harris was deeply involved in spearheading Jackson's selection and confirmation in 2022, Biden's only Supreme Court nominee.

As a senator, her 2018 questioning at the confirmation hearings for now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh were especially contentious, and she later called for his impeachment after unproven allegations of past sexual misconduct.

Harris herself was under serious consideration for a Supreme Court seat during the Obama years, but sources say her percolating ambitions at the time were directed to elected office.

As for Trump, sources close to him tell Fox News he is expected to soon release his own preemptive list of candidates, as the Republican nominee did in 2016. That evolving list of two dozen or so names became a centerpiece of his successful campaign and later presidency.

This time, the former president will rely on those he has already named to the federal bench for the top names he would choose from to fill any Supreme Court vacancy.

VP HARRIS OUTLINES 'ORDERLY AND SECURE' IMMIGRATION PLAN, RIPS TRUMP IN FIRST BORDER STOP SINCE NOMINATION

The Constitution's framers viewed the judiciary as the ""least dangerous branch,"" but to hear some politicians and pundits on both the left and right, the Supreme Court is prepared to lead the country into imminent ruin.

Such attacks on the justices are nothing new, but the tenor of the criticism, especially in a presidential year, coupled with self-inflicted missteps on ethics and docket discretion, have combined to put its nine members on the defensive.

And the public seems to have noticed.

A Gallup poll this summer found 43% approve of how the Supreme Court handles its job, with 52% disapproval. That is a drop of 15 points since 2020 (58%-38%). In 2000, 62% approved of the institution.

Especially concerning the court are continued leaks to the media of its internal, mostly secretive, operations.

A draft opinion of the 2022 ""Dobbs"" abortion case, published two months before the final ruling that struck down nationwide access to the procedure, sent shock waves in Washington in a massive breach of protocol.

That was followed by selective leaks in the past year over how the court decided hot-button issues like affirmative action and election redistricting.

And in recent weeks, the New York Times received leaked internal memos from the chief justice over his leading role in the Trump immunity opinion.

Court sources say the leakers, who have never been publicly identified, have further eroded institutional camaraderie and trust among the justices, long seen as essential to doing their jobs. It has led to outside partisan finger-pointing.

Roberts, who will gavel in his 20th term next week as chief justice, has not publicly responded to the latest controversies or calls for ethics reform, declining repeated invitations from the Senate to testify.

It reflects his ""less is best"" approach to explaining and promoting his own court's resolution of thorny legal and political issues.

In September 2022, after the abortion ruling was issued, he said, ""Simply because people disagree with opinions is not a basis for questioning the legitimacy of the court. I think just moving forward from things that were unfortunate is the best way to respond,"" he said.

And he has carefully glided over his role to force internal change and to defend his court's reputation all while being unable to stop the continuing leaks over their deliberations.

""It seems like at times they're [leakers] motivated to be able to potentially lead to mistrust in the [judicial] branch, attacks on what the branch is doing,"" said Jennifer Mascott, a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas and then-Judge Kavanaugh and now a Catholic University law professor.

Added Dupree, ""You can't have a court deliberate and perform its constitutionally assigned function if it can't be ensured of the sanctity of its deliberations, if it thinks that anything that one justice says to another colleague or any memo that they write internally is going to appear on the front page of the newspapers the next day. That's a very, very worrisome trend. It may be the new normal.""

After a three-month recess, the justices met together for the first time this week to reset their docket and discuss appeals that have been filed over the summer.

Sources say the chief justice, who leads the closed-door meeting, had sent a memo to his colleagues indicating some of the controversies surrounding the court, like the leaks and ethics reform, would be privately and candidly discussed.

The Supreme Court in its new term will confront issues like gun rights and transgender care for minors, with pending appeals over the Affordable Care Act, religious freedom, immigration and abortion access.

It is a unique, fast-moving time of change and challenge at an institution used to being slow and deliberate.

""I did learn early on that when you are holding the reins of leadership, you should be careful not to tug on them too much,"" said Roberts in 2016. ""You will find out they aren't connected to anything."""
"One year after 10/7, Iran is losing the war. Now, Israel must secure peace",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/one-year-after-10-7-iran-losing-war-now-israel-must-secure-peace,2024-10-07T09:22:56Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

One year ago, Iran took a gamble and started a war in Gaza with the attack by Hamas that killed nearly 1,200 Israelis, including over 40 Americans, and took more than 200 hostages

A year later, it is clear that Iran is losing this war.

For his part, Ayatollah Khamenei on Friday, October 4, 2024, remembered the massacre as ""logical and legal"" and used his first public Friday sermon in five years to proclaim that Iran ""won't back down."" He also had a rifle at the podium. He's that worried.

ISRAELI MILITARY KILLS 250 HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS SINCE START OF LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN LEBANON

You can measure the defeat of Iran in two ways. The first is restoring Israel's security and carrying out the military destruction of Iran's terror agents Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and more.

Israeli strikes of the past several weeks have brought this goal closer.

Second, getting Israel and Saudi Arabia back on track toward normalizing relations will be the ultimate defeat for Iran.

Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.

Iran couldn't stand it.

Last fall, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman were in serious, quiet negotiations. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan wrote in his Foreign Affairs article that the work toward joint infrastructure projects and new partnerships between Israel and its Arab neighbors was ""bearing fruit.""

""Every day we get closer,"" bin Salman said in an interview aired Sep. 20, 2023.

""We can forge a historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said to President Joe Biden during a televised meeting in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly sessions that same day.

The impending deal included a significant Palestinian component of concessions by Israel. ""It is not a done deal and there are many variables, but the odds are more than 50%,"" a senior Israeli official told Axios at the time.

Diplomacy was bubbling along, with Netanyahu invited to Washington, D.C., at the end of the year.

You can imagine how that went over in Tehran.

Less than two weeks later, Iran gave ""the green light for the assault at a meeting in Beirut"" on Monday, Oct. 2, 2023, sending word to Hamas and Hezbollah, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The objective was to force Israel into a war to blacken its reputation and scorch any path to peace.

To do it, Iran coached Hamas to change tactics.

Just three years earlier, in May 2021, Hamas waged an all-out missile war with huge salvoes to overwhelm Israel's missile defenses, to no avail. Even with the incredibly brief warning times characteristic of short-range launches, Israel's multi-layered defensive system held. Of course, the Israeli Air Force hit weapons caches and launch sites. Egypt stepped in to broker the ceasefire.

This time, the kind of war sought by Iran would have to go beyond missile attacks.

Officers of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps began specific planning with Hamas for the attack in August 2023. The goal was ""the most significant breach of Israel's borders since the 1973 Yom Kippur War,"" the Journal reported Oct. 8, 2023.

And so it was. Note Iran was content to let the civilians of Gaza pay a terrible price being caught of the middle of a war zone.

Most of the Hamas military structure in Gaza was destroyed by the spring of 2024. Biden offered a ceasefire on May 30. Hamas toyed with agreement, but this time there would be no ceasefire despite strenuous efforts by Egypt and Qatar. Iran wasn't ready.

Enter Hezbollah. A surge in rocket attacks across the alleged UN ""blue line"" effectively saw Hezbollah take the lead in fighting. Now, Israel would have to contend with Hezbollah, too. The war entered a new phase with the July 30 killing of Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas Politburo, in Tehran itself.

Israel's systematic campaign has decimated Hezbollah's leadership, culminating with the pager attacks and the death of Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's strikes in Lebanon are now attempting to restore border safety.

A year after the initial attack, Iran is the loser by any military standard. Two big missile attacks on Israel have been thwarted. The military advantage rests with Israel. However, I suspect more strikes on legitimate military and infrastructure targets to reduce Iran's power may be required.

Despite Israel's military successes, dangers remain. For a year, the American military has done everything President Joe Biden asked in the name of deterrence. This includes steps that made sense: U.S. Navy destroyers intercepting Iran's missiles, aircraft carriers and F-22s deployed with strike options. And measures that didn't, such as the Gaza aid pier. The bottom line is 40,000 U.S. forces deployed to the U.S. Central Command region, all to keep a lid on Iran. That can't go on forever (although China would like it).

The path ahead depends on restoring Israel's security and taking out Iran's capabilities. After that, the goal is to get back to the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a goal shared by the Trump and Biden administrations. It's not easy - the two-state dilemma remains. But it is the one sure way to defeat Iran, for good.

Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.

And it's important for Americans to stay committed to Israel's security and to the diplomatic goals, despite the pain caused by the shock unleashing of antisemitism. Too many 21st Century Americans turned out to be biased, ignorant, susceptible to foreign instigation, or all of the above. We Americans have to do better than this.

Don't forget that in the words of the Justice Department's Indictment of Hamas, the government of Iran's regional and global campaign of terrorism aims to ""weaken and ultimately destroy both the United States and Israel.""

America's best interest remains to support Israel - and take all military steps necessary to get back to the regional diplomacy that will shut down Iran for good."
"Early voting begins in California, Texas, 5 other states",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/early-voting-begins-california-texas-5-other-states,2024-10-07T09:11:07Z,"'Special Report' panelists discuss Jack Smith's election case against former President Trump weeks before the 2024 presidential election.

The country's two most populous states, California and Texas, begin early voting on Monday along with Montana, Georgia, Nebraska, New Hampshire and South Carolina.

Here is everything you need to know about the voter registration and early voting plans for each state.

Georgia has voted Republican in all but two elections in the last four decades. The first was former President Clinton's landslide win in 1992, and the second was 2020, when President Biden brought the state back to the Democrats by 11,779 votes.

A win for either candidate here would make their path to victory easier. The Peach State has 16 electoral votes on offer, and with recent polls showing a tight race, it's ranked Toss Up on the Fox News Power Rankings.

Democrats do well in metro Atlanta, home to more than half the state's population, and particularly its densest counties, Fulton and DeKalb. There is a higher concentration of Black and college voters there. The surrounding suburban areas also help Democrats run up the vote.

Republicans win big with rural voters, who can be found just about everywhere else. The GOP won all but 30 counties in the last election, with many of the largest victories in the sparse northwest and southeast regions.

Over in the northwest of the country, Montana is a Republican stronghold at the presidential level, but it also hosts one of the most competitive Senate races in the country this cycle. Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester faces Republican Tim Sheehy in a race where Trump's popularity and Sheehy's discipline gives the GOP an edge. It's Lean R on the rankings.

Finally, absentee in-person voting begins today in Nebraska, where absentee voting is already underway. The state is home to three competitive races.

Voting also begins today in nine House districts ranked Lean or Toss Up on the Fox News Power Rankings. For a full list of competitive races, see the latest Senate and House rankings.

Battleground Senate candidate unloads on 'radical' Dem opponent for disparaging Trump voters,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/battleground-senate-candidate-unloads-radical-dem-opponent,2024-10-07T08:07:07Z,"PHOENIX, AZ - Arizona GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake is blasting her Democratic opponent Rep. Ruben Gallego and labeling him as ""radical as they come"" after a resurfaced interview of him disparaging Trump voters.

""Isn't that terrible?"" Lake said in response to Fox News Digital reporting of a comment made by Gallego in 2016 where he said that Trump voters were ""dumb"" and the ""worst people in the world.""

""He's been lying about who he is,"" Lake added. ""He's trying to paint himself as a moderate, which is it's laughable if it wasn't so dangerous.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Gallego ""bullied"" moderate Sen. Kyrsten Sinema out of the race ""because she wasn't liberal enough.""

KARI LAKE SHREDS VP HARRIS' 'DESPICABLE' SOUTHERN BORDER VISIT: JUST TO MAKE THE 'MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAPPY'

""Now he is doing all these ads trying to say he's a moderate when, in fact, he's voted to spend our federal dollars, our tax dollars, our money, supporting sanctuary cities and states. He's voted against securing our border every step of the way. He's for an open border America. He's voted to defund the police. He actually co-sponsored the George Floyd legislation, which would have defunded the police nationwide.""

Lake went on to tell Fox News Digital that Gallego has ""never batted an eyelash"" when it comes to spending bills and has not been strong enough defending women's sports.

""He wants biological men to participate in women's athletics.,"" Lake said. ""That means it's an end for girls sports. Anybody out there who played sports? I did for a little bit. It's an end. I mean, if you have to compete with biological men, what's the purpose of having girls sports?""

ENIGMATIC VOTER GROUP COULD SPLIT TICKET FOR TRUMP, DEM SENATE CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA

Lake added, ""It's absolutely crazy and he's as radical as they come.""

Gallego and Lake will both be attempting to sway independent voters, especially in Maricopa County, the largest county in the state, where independents make up a third of the electorate. Lake told Fox News Digital she is optimistic she can win votes from Arizonans who aren't Republicans.

""I do believe that independents are with me, I think we're doing pretty well, our polling is showing that we're building on the independent vote,"" Lake said. ""And I think a lot of Democrats, while he [Gallego] hates Trump voters and he hates Republicans. I don't hate Democrats. I actually believe that disaffected Democrats are going to help us turn the corner.""

""They're realizing, looking at Kamala Harris and Ruben Gallego, and they're saying, wait a minute, this isn't the Democrat Party that I signed up for years ago, the old Democrat Party used to care about the working class. The old Democrat Party wanted a strong economy for everybody. This Democrat Party is a bunch of globalists, and they are for, they want to spend more money helping people coming here illegally than they do people who are American citizens.""

While the Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Gallego leading Lake by about 7 points, Lake told Fox News Digital she is confident the race is much closer and says her internal polling shows that she is within the margin of error.

""We have to go into it acting like we're ten down, but we're not ten down,"" Lake said. ""This is a very tight race. I'm proud of that, considering, as I said, he spent 75 million. He's been outspending us massively and the fact that this is such a tight race is incredible. Chuck Schumer is in a panic about Arizona. He's dumping 5 million bucks a week into Arizona.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Democrats are in a ""tailspin"" in Arizona because their efforts to make the election about abortion have not been fruitful because most voters are focused on other issues like the economy.

Lake also criticized Gallego over his record before he entered politics, including his involvement with a bank that worked with illegal immigrants, a harassment claim against him by a 20-year-old intern while he worked at city hall, and his time working for an ambulance company that was being investigated for fraud.

""The people of Arizona know me and they trust me and I love the people of the state, Lake said. ""I want to represent all of them, including people who maybe don't even vote for me. If you choose not to vote for me, I hope I can earn your vote, but I still want to represent you and I want to do a great job for you in Washington, D.C. We need decent, honest people back to D.C. and Ruben Gallego was not honest before he got into politics.""

FEMA head denies agency is short on money for disaster relief because funds went to illegal immigrants,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/fema-head-denies-agency-short-money-disaster-relief-because-funds-went-illegal-immigrants,2024-10-07T01:10:18Z,"FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told ABC's ""This Week"" that information spreading about disaster relief funds going toward illegal immigrants was ""frankly ridiculous and just plain false."" (ABC)

In the wake of Hurricane Helene's destruction in the southeastern U.S., the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said it was ""just plain false"" that the agency was short on disaster relief funds because the money was spent on illegal immigrants.

FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell was interviewed by ABC's George Stephanopoulos on ""This Week.""

""Let's let's talk about some of the misinformation that is out there, including these claims from former President Trump that FEMA is about $1 billion short because money has been going to undocumented immigrants,"" Stephanopoulos said.

""You know, it's frankly ridiculous and just plain false,"" Criswell said. ""This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people. You know, it's really a shame that we're putting politics ahead of helping people, and that's what we're here to do. We have had the complete support of the state.""

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 'FAILED TO ACT' IN HURRICANE HELENE AFTERMATH: REP CORY MILLS

She continued by saying FEMA has had local officials help push back on the ""dangerous"" narrative that has created fear among those whose lives were devastated by the damage done by Helene in places like western North Carolina and Georgia.

""You know, people need resources, and we need them to get into the system, and it's just a shame that people are sitting home on their comfortable couches while we have thousands of people here on the ground that have left their own families to be able to help those in need,"" Criswell said.

Stephanopoulos then asked Criswell about the misinformation spreading online and going viral, with one social media user suggesting a militia should go against FEMA.

""It has a tremendous impact on the comfort level of our own employees to be able to go out there. But it's also demoralizing to all of the first responders that have been out there in their communities helping people, FEMA staff, volunteers, the private sector that are working side by side with local officials to go out and help people,"" she said. ""I need to make sure I can get the resources to where they are needed. And when you have this dangerous rhetoric like you're hearing, it creates fear in our own employees. We need to make sure we're getting help to the people who need it.""

LAWMAKERS OUTRAGED OVER FEMA FUNDING CONCERNS

Fox News Digital reached out to FEMA to get clarification on what misinformation was being spread, and a spokesperson said disaster relief funds and immigration come from ""two different pots of money.""

The spokesperson explained that the disaster money for the Disaster Relief Fund comes from Congress, adding that no money has been used for anything else other than disaster relief operations.

Criswell, the spokesperson said, was talking about misinformation and how much that misinformation hurts the operation. Those who need assistance, the spokesperson explained, believe the rumors.

FEMA HAS FUNDS NEEDED FOR 'IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY,' DESPITE MAYORKAS' WARNING

FEMA said the agency is not short on money for disaster relief despite what has been said.

Along with funding, the Biden administration is also pouring resources into hard-hit areas.

On Sunday, President Biden ordered 500 additional active-duty troops to support on-the-ground efforts. There are now 1,500 troops mobilized to assist National Guard and federal personnel.

The Department of Homeland Security said Thursday that FEMA had the funds needed for ""immediate response and recovery"" despite Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warning about the potential lack of money.

""FEMA has what it needs for immediate response and recovery efforts,"" spokesperson Jaclyn Rothenberg said on X. ""As [Administrator Deanne Criswell] said, she has the full authority to spend against the President's budget, but we're not out of hurricane season yet so we need to keep a close eye on it.""

The agency had recently lifted immediate needs funding, which allows the agency to focus on urgent efforts and pause nonurgent projects, but Rothenberg said the agency may still need to go back to that ""and we will be watching it closely.""

Mayorkas grabbed headlines on Wednesday when he said FEMA does not have enough funding to make it through hurricane season, which lasts until November.

""We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have. We are expecting another hurricane hitting,"" he said. ""FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.""

FOX CORPORATION LAUNCHES DONATION DRIVE FOR AMERICAN RED CROSS HURRICANE HELENE RELIEF EFFORTS

Congress recently made $20 billion in immediate funding available for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund as part of a bipartisan deal to avoid a government shutdown at the end of last month. But Congress is currently out until mid-November, after Election Day (Nov. 5).

Mayorkas' remarks about a potential lack of funding sparked criticism from Republicans and conservatives, who pointed to funding used by FEMA for grants to house and care for illegal immigrants who crossed the southern border.

Critics referenced the Shelter and Services Program, which spent $650 million in fiscal 2023 on grants to nonprofits and local organizations to assist migrants. But the Biden administration pushed back, noting that the funding is appropriated by Congress and completely separate from disaster relief funding.

JOHNSON SLAMS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S 'ABJECT FAILURE' ASSISTING HURRICANE HELENE VICTIMS

Her comments faced immediate backlash online, with critics slamming the top disaster relief official for playing the victim card in a crisis of this magnitude.

""In this time of crisis, the important thing to remember is protecting the feelings of FEMA workers,"" Grabien founder Tom Elliott wrote alongside a clip of Crisewell's ABC appearance.

""The comfort level of hurricane victims matters way more to me right now than the comfort level of FEMA employees,"" writer Kristen Weg commented.

""FEMA chief Deanne Criswell says criticizing her agency is 'dangerous.' The audacity,"" conservative journalist Ian Miles Cheong posted.

""In these times where people lost everything and roads are impassable with towns wiped off the map, remember the real victims: FEMA workers,"" NewsBusters Managing Editor Curtis Houk wrote.

""Amazing. Criticism elicits ""fear."" What a game bureaucrats play. Same with the FBI, IRS, HHS, DHS, etc. ""Don't criticize us. It's scary. We feel threatened,"" podcaster Chris Stigall weighed in.

The Biden administration has come under fire for a purportedly inadequate response to the devastation left by Helene. As of last Friday, the death toll in southeastern states hit the hardest by the storm has risen past 224, with more than 100 dead in western North Carolina alone.

Former President Trump accused the agency of obstructing relief efforts in Republican areas in a post on Truth Social last week after reports circulated about delayed assistance in some communities.

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

Republican elected officials, Elon Musk and volunteers have also spoken out against the government's response to the hurricane, as crews continue searching for missing people and bodies across the affected region.

Musk accused FEMA of blocking shipments of Starlink satellite internet deliveries in hurricane-ravaged North Carolina, writing on X, ""FEMA is not merely failing to adequately help people in trouble, but is actively blocking citizens who try to help!"" FEMA categorically denied the claims in a response to FOX Business.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson slammed the agency's relief efforts, calling the federal government's response an ""abject failure.""

Criswell flatly rejected the assertions from Trump and his allies as ""ridiculous and just plain false.""

""This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people. You know, it's really a shame that we're putting politics ahead of helping people, and that's what we're here to do,"" she told Stephanopoulos.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Wednesday that FEMA does not have enough funding to make it through hurricane season, which lasts until November.

MSNBC anchor Andrea Mitchell said on Sunday that Vice President Kamala Harris is struggling to resonate with White and Black male voters.

Michell said on ""Meet the Press"" that Harris needs to show up more in the media because she is not being seen as a ""heavyweight.""

""She's got such a big problem with men,"" Mitchell said, adding that support for Trump among that demographic could be underestimated.

She proceeded to blame misogny as one of the reasons Harris wasn't being taken as seriously among both Republican and Democratic men.

And a lot of this is gender, but she's got to be more specific about her economic plans,"" Mitchell continued. ""I think they've got to double down on doing more interviews and serious interviews.""

Harris has taken heat for largely avoiding the press. Since becoming the Democratic nominee 72 days ago, she has yet to hold a single official press conference. In response to the criticism, Harris has shifted her strategy, stepping up interviews.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson addressed claims that the Biden administration diverted Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funds to immigration efforts, saying the pools of funds are ""different,"" but that he understands why Americans are ""frustrated.""

""The streams of funding are different, that is not an untrue statement, of course,"" Johnson, R-La., told Fox News' Shannon Bream on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""But the problem is with the American people, see, and what they're frustrated by, is that FEMA should be involved.

That's what the Biden administration, Kamala Harris and Secretary Mayorkas have been engaged in.""

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre last week denied that FEMA resources were going to migrants, but cited FEMA funds for migrants in 2022.

""Former President Trump is accusing the Biden administration of using FEMA funding to support undocumented migrants. How is the White House responding to that?"" a reporter asked during a Friday press conference.

FEMA HAS FUNDS NEEDED FOR 'IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY,' DESPITE MAYORKAS' WARNING

""I mean, it's just categorically false. It is not true. It is a false statement,"" Jean-Pierre responded.

Critics have since compared her statement to comments made in 2022, where she cited FEMA resources were available to illegal immigrants.

""FEMA Regional Administrators have been meeting with city officials on site to coordinate - to coordinate available federal support from FEMA and other federal agencies,"" Jean-Pierre told reporters at a Sept. 16, 2022, press conference.

""Funding is also available through FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter program to eligible local governments and not-for-profit organizations upon request to support humanitarian relief for migrants,"" she added.

FEMA has a pool of funds explicitly used for natural disasters, while Congress called on FEMA in 2022 to disseminate funds from Customs and Border Protection to assist American communities affected by the immigration crisis.

KJP SLAMMED AFTER HURRICANE HELENE OVER MIXED MESSAGES ON WHETHER FEMA RESOURCES USED FOR MIGRANTS

FEMA's website currently has a ""Hurricane Helene: Rumor Response"" page to address false claims surrounding recovery efforts, including a rebuke of the claim that FEMA diverted disaster response funds to ""border related issues.""

""This is false. No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,"" FEMA posted in response to the claim.

Hurricane Helene has left more than 220 people dead after flooding devastated towns and cities across Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee.

Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas drew national attention last week when he indicated that FEMA does not have enough funding to make it through hurricane season, which typically wraps up in November.

""We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have. We are expecting another hurricane hitting,"" he said Wednesday, heightening concerns around funds for Americans left displaced by the hurricane. ""FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.""

The DHS, however, said the following day that FEMA has the funds needed to assist those currently affected.

""FEMA has what it needs for immediate response and recovery efforts,"" spokesperson Jaclyn Rothenberg said on X.

Johnson said during his interview Sunday that when citizens take public transportation and spot illegal immigrants traveling the nation, their tickets are ""gleefully"" paid for by the Biden-Harris administration via non-governmental organizations.

""When you see illegals in your local airport and you see them being transported around the country with planes, trains and automobiles to every community, everywhere, every state's a border state now, because of that. That's the NGOs, the non-governmental organizations mostly, that are transporting those people around. And then they send the receipts to the federal government,"" he continued.

Conservatives blasted Pennsylvania's Department of State this month for scheduling a system maintenance update to its voter registration website the same day former President Trump returned to Butler, where he survived an assassination attempt in July.

The operation would have taken the site offline for several hours during the same time frame the Trump campaign expected to register voters. The department, however, moved the window of time for maintenance to later in the night amid an early outcry.

""The PA State Department voter registration website will be unavailable on Saturday, October 5th, the day that President Trump will be triumphantly returning to the site of the assassination attempt in Butler County, PA. W/ all eyes on PA, the site will be down. Coincidence?"" GOP activist Scott Pressler posted to Instagram on Thursday.

Fox News Digital reviewed archived data from the Pennsylvania Voter Registration website and found that it issued a disclaimer to voters that the website would be unavailable on Oct. 5 beginning at 6 p.m.

""This website will undergo scheduled system maintenance and be unavailable Saturday, October 5 from 6 p.m. until 12 a.m. We thank you for your understanding.,"" the Pennsylvania Voter Registration website stated on Oct. 1, an archived page reviewed by Fox News Digital shows.

The Pennsylvania Voter Registration website announced its scheduled maintenance sometime between Sept. 30 to Oct. 1, archived data for the site reviewed by Fox Digital shows.

Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump and Pressler sounded the alarm on the scheduled maintenance earlier this month, questioning the timing and slamming the move as election ""interference.""

""Wow, they aren't even trying to hide their blatant interference - appreciate you flagging, @scottpresler - @gop legal is on it and formally requesting the 'system maintenance' is moved to a different time,"" Lara Trump posted to Facebook on Thursday, accompanied by a screenshot of an Instagram post from Pressler asking if the timing of the maintenance was just a ""coincidence.""

TRUMP'S RETURN TO BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, SITE OF FIRST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, IS 'GUTSY,' SUPPORTERS SAY

Archived records of the website show that Pennsylvania officials updated the page on Oct. 3 - the same day Pressler and Lara Trump publicly posted about the timing of the maintenance - to reflect that the site would undergo maintenance at 10 p.m. to 4 a.m., instead of 6 p.m. until midnight.

Trump was scheduled to take the stage in Butler at 5 p.m. Saturday, meaning the site would have gone dark as he rallied his base and encouraged residents to register to vote.

Pressler joined Human Events' Jack Posobiec about the matter last week, taking a victory lap that the time was changed to later in the night, following the rally, but added he's still not ""100 percent happy"" with the timing of the schedule maintenance. Pressler noted that website updates are typically scheduled for the dead of night, when users are less likely to use the platform.

""It was clear that the Pennsylvania Department of State was engaging in election interference, trying to stop all of this national attention from translating into new voter registrations,"" Pressler said.

ARDENT TRUMP SUPPORTERS WEIGH IN ON SAFETY AT HISTORIC PENNSYLVANIA RALLY

Lara Trump also celebrated how the scheduled maintenance moved to later in the night, sharing on Facebook Thursday, ""And just like that, we got PA to move it. Great example of what happens when citizens demand fairness.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the Pennsylvania Department of State on Sunday for comment on the matter, but did not immediately receive a reply.

The website is working as of Sunday morning, and no longer includes the disclaimer for a scheduled maintenance outage. Fox News Digital did not document the site shutting down for maintenance from Saturday evening into Sunday morning, though screenshots of the site posted to social media show the site's reported error page for maintenance.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES OUTDOOR PENNSYLVANIA RALLY TO 'FINISH OUR SPEECH' AT SITE OF FIRST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

A review of the Department of State's social media shows the website has previously shut down for scheduled maintenance at odd hours during the day, including on June 29 from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. the following day.

The historic rally in Butler drew thousands as Trump made a return to the same grounds where he was nearly killed, as well as short remarks from tech billionaire Elon Musk who stressed the importance of registering to vote.

""I think it's the most important election of our lifetime. This is no ordinary election. The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech. They want to take away your right to bear arms... They want to take away your right to vote effectively,"" Musk told the crowd on Saturday.

Musk repeatedly encouraged the crowds to get everyone in their social circles and beyond to register and vote come Election Day.

""And honestly, you want to just be a pest. Just be a pest to everyone. You know, people on the street everywhere,"" he said.

Voters attending a rally for Vice President Kamala Harris in Flint, Michigan, argued that the Democratic nominee is better on immigration and that former President Trump is to blame for the current situation at the border.

""She comes with compassion and a plan,"" one voter attending the Harris rally Friday told Fox News Digital. ""We know that we have problems down there, but we have to do it specifically to make the changes... just throwing out rhetoric and building a wall is not going to do it. This is about people's lives who have come here because they're in distress and danger, and we need to help them because that's who we are.""

The comments come as both Trump and Harris made multiple appearances in Michigan last week, highlighting the critical importance of a swing state that could decide the fate of November's election.

KAMALA HARRIS' SUPPORT WITH ARAB AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN IS 'TENUOUS': DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST

With the election just over four weeks away, polling shows Michigan could be decided by a razor-thin margin once again. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average as of Sunday, Harris currently holds a narrow 0.7 point edge in the state.

At the top of mind for voters in Michigan at both Trump and Harris rallies last week was immigration, with both sides agreeing that work needed to be done to secure the southern border. But while Trump supporters mostly pin the blame on the Biden administration, Harris supporters in Flint argued that it was Trump's effort to kill President Biden's bipartisan border legislation that was to blame for the current situation.

""She has worked on a bill that she said that if she's elected she's going to sign into law that directly puts more people on the front line that would actually be helping with the border, while Trump shot that down,"" a voter told Fox News Digital.

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

""The Biden administration tried to put through an act that would make border crossings more limited and better. It was basically a slam dunk, Trump went and told his people 'Hey, we need to shoot this down, we can't let them get a win,'"" another voter said.

Meanwhile, some voters argued that all Trump brings to the table on the issue is ""rhetoric"" that divides people, while Harris has the experience to solve the problem.

""Harris is better on immigration because she's experienced in border security, the policies and legislation that are necessary to result in a secure border,"" a voter said.

Former first lady Melania Trump spoke with former President Trump before writing about her support for abortion in her self-titled memoir, she told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on Sunday.

""He knew my position since the day we met, and I believe in individual freedom. I want to decide what I want to do with my body. I don't want government in my personal business,"" she said in an exclusive ""Sunday Morning Futures"" interview.

""I think it's very important and, as I said in the book, and it's very well explained in the chapter, 'What does my body, my choice mean?' because timing really matters and also the restrictions, so I encourage people to read it because we live in a world that everybody should have individual freedom,"" she continued.

Trump is promoting her upcoming ""Melania"" memoir, which disclosed a shocking truth to many of her husband's supporters regarding her stance on the controversial issue, calling abortion a ""fundamental right of individual liberty,"" according to a report from last Wednesday.

MELANIA TRUMP'S ABORTION VIEWS IN NEW MEMOIR SPUR OUTRAGE FROM PRO-LIFERS: 'SHE IS WRONG'

She reportedly wrote, ""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government.""

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes. Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

MELANIA TRUMP'S PRO-CHOICE STAND ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER REPUBLICAN FIRST LADIES

The revelation ignited a flurry of responses across the political spectrum, with pro-lifers slamming her for the view they argue fails to align with the Catholic faith, to which she subscribes.

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America advocacy group, called the view ""anti-feminist"" and the ""opposite of empowerment.""

Others, including Lila Rose and president of pro-life advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, criticized the stance as well.

On the left, ""The View"" co-host Joy Behar accused Trump of lying about being pro-choice, calling her stance a ""big scam.""

Others have posed the question: why make the revelation just before the election?

""That was not written in the last week or the last month,"" Trump told Bartiromo.

""That book was written months before, and it was in print months before, so that was my belief, and it is my belief, and I wanted to put it in the book because I want to be authentic. I want people to read the book because they could find out a lot of things that were never discussed. I'm very selective in what I do, and when I'm doing interviews or not or where I am or not, and this is my story. This is my perspective and the truth, and there is a lot of misinformation about me and falsehoods written about me, so that book, 'Melania,' will bring out my truth.""

"Fetterman lauds Israel for leaving Iran 'exposed and humiliated' after strikes on Hamas, Hezbollah",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fetterman-lauds-israel-leaving-iran-exposed-humiliated-after-strikes-hamas-hezbollah,2024-10-06T17:19:02Z,"Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., says he will not 'politicize' the Israel-Hamas during an appearance on 'Fox News Sunday.'

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., on Sunday said that he will continue to ""support and follow"" Israel after seeing how the Jewish State has been able to humiliate Iran and its proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah.

Fetterman made the remarks on ""Fox News Sunday,"" telling anchor Shannon Bream that Israel knows best about how to take on Iran and the regime's proxies.

""Whatever they decide to do in response to Iran, I'm going to support that because Israel will have a better idea of the intelligence and the circumstances on the ground,"" Fetterman said. ""And that's why I'm going to support and follow that.""

The Democrat praised Israel for their effective responses against Hezbollah and Hamas that he said left the Iranian proxies ""cowering.""

BIDEN SAYS HE WOULD NOT BACK ISRAELI STRIKE ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR SITE

""I also want to celebrate what Israel has been able to do,"" Fetterman said. ""They've demolished Hamas and now they have humiliated Hezbollah and they are now cowering. And Iran shot, you know, 200 missiles and [Israel] vaporized those. So, Iran now is left exposed and humiliated, and Israel has put them back on the ropes. And I am going to support what they continue to do.""

Iran bombarded Israel with 181 missiles last week in what the regime said was retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike in September and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.

Meanwhile, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have traded attacks with Israel since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7.

Fetterman's comments come days after President Biden told reporters that he would not support an attack by Israel on Iranian nuclear sites in retaliation for Iran's missile attack against Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

Biden said all the G7 leaders on a recent call - France, Canada, Japan, Britain, Italy and Germany - agreed that Israel had the right to ""proportionally"" respond to Iran's military strike.

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

Biden's response came under fire from former President Trump, who told Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin on Thursday that Biden's response on Israel attacking Iran was the ""craziest thing I've ever heard. That's the biggest risk we have. The biggest risk we have is nuclear.""

Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday called out Western leaders who he said had called for an arms embargo on Israel over its airstrikes against Hamas in Gaza.

""As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilized countries should be standing firmly by Israel's side, yet President Macron and other western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them,"" Netanyahu said in a statement.

He continued, ""Is Iran imposing an arms embargo on Hezbollah, on the Houthis, on Hamas and on its other proxies? Of course not. This axis of terror stands together, but countries who supposedly oppose this terror axis call for an arms embargo on Israel.""

DAVID MARCUS: Pennsylvania's Gen Zers embrace Trump like Millennials never have,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-pennsylvanias-gen-zers-embrace-trump-like-millennials-never-have,2024-10-06T17:16:46Z,"Gen Z voters Jahmiel Jackson and Ranger Irwin discuss the deep divide between young male and female voters on 'The Story.'

Over the last two months, I have spent more time in Pennsylvania than any other state for the obvious reason that the outcome there will very likely determine whether our next president will be Donald Trump or Kamala Harris.

One increasingly clear phenomenon I have slowly seen, and it's backed up by some polling, is that Gen Z voters who are between the ages of 18 and 27 are far more open to supporting Trump than their Millennial elders, who are mainly in their 30s.

GROWING NUMBER OF GEN Z MEN SUPPORTING TRUMP REPRESENTS 'ONGOING CULTURE SHOCK' IN US POLITICS, VOTER SAYS

A recent poll from Harvard has Harris leading Trump 61 percent to 30 percent among Millennials, but an NBC News poll shows that with voters 18-29, that lead shrinks to 16 points at 50 to 34.

It tracks with what I have been seeing on the ground.

At a Trump rally in Harrisburg back in August, I met young, blue-collar Gen Zers who believed Trump would provide more opportunity, a JD Vance event in Hershey was overflowing with twenty somethings, and Saturday in Butler, I met dozens of first-time voters planning to pull the red lever.

It came into clear focus later on Saturday night at Jack Jolly's Holiday Bar in downtown Butler, a town which, unlike many of the hollowed out Ohio cities I've seen that are more rust than belt, is actually quite charming and seems to be thriving.

Jack Jolly's is one of those cocktail lounges where they infuse everything or put smoke in the glass, and the first people I met there were a trio in their late 30s; one married couple and their guy friend.

All were childhood buds from Butler who had moved away after college and recently returned to purchase homes in this lovely hillside hamlet. They were no fans of Trump, and they also weren't overly interested in politics.

GEN Z VOTER FLIPS FROM SANDERS TO TRUMP: HARD TO VOTE FOR THE PARTY PUTTING 'TAMPONS IN BOYS' BATHROOMS'

At one point, I asked them if the emerging well-to-do segment of the population and the longer-standing middle and lower classes mingled well. They looked at me quizzically and I said, ""I mean, your kids must go to school together, right?""

""Oh, we don't have kids,"" the single guy told me, though the woman is a teacher.

And they are a type of voter I have seen elsewhere, in San Francisco and Chicago -- good jobs, few responsibilities, and not terribly ill at ease with the state of their lives, the country, or the world.

About the time they took off, another trio took their place, this time, three dudes, younger, mid to late twenties. Two were Trump fans, and the other, a history teacher, supports Harris, but also said, ""I don't think Trump is a threat to democracy.""

What followed was a robust conversation about politics, America, and life. They were well-informed, avid social media users, and importantly, they all seemed to have a grasp on the best arguments of the other side.

Whatever is driving these young voters into the arms of the GOP, it will have profound implications not just on this election, but going forward for decades.

Earlier in the day, I had spoken to Johnny and Rocky at the Trump rally, who were also either Gen Z or close. They are buddies, but I was surprised when Johnny said, ""Rocky and I watched the VP debate together.""

When I was 27, we did a lot of things, but get together to watch a vice presidential debate was not among them. Then again, in the 1990s, we thought a bright future was inevitable. Unlike Gen X, Gen Z is very well aware that it isn't.

Part of the reason that I was slow to pick up on the reddening of Gen Z, especially, but not only, Gen Z men, is that I couldn't really explain it, and I still struggle to.

Are they less connected to and susceptible to the neoliberal pablum of the leftist media and entertainment industry? Is it because they grew up, in part, under a Trump presidency and so do not find it abhorrent or abnormal? Is it counter-cultural?

Whatever is driving these young voters into the arms of the GOP, it will have profound implications not just on this election, but going forward for decades. Ten years from now, they will start accumulating the power that Millennials have today.

And unlike Millennials, who seem quietly resigned to a country and society that isn't going to get any better, there seems to be flickering hope among our youngest voters, as if they dare to dream.

And we should all have such hope, because maybe, just maybe, the kids are alright."

Users on social media took aim at Vice President Kamala Harris after the Democratic nominee took to X to pledge millions of dollars in aid for Lebanon at the same time residents of North Carolina struggle to recover from Hurricane Helene.

""This has to be fake. Even Kamala Harris, the gold standard of stupid, isn't stupid enough to post this,"" actor James Woods said on X Saturday. ""Certainly not while North Carolinians are pulling the bodies of their neighbors from the wreckage. It's simply inconceivable.""

The post came in response to Harris pledging Saturday to send $157 million of ""additional assistance"" to Lebanon, which, she argued, is ""facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation.""

Users on social media were quick to slam Harris for the post, arguing that many North Carolina residents are struggling to recover from Hurricane Helene and that the money would be better spent on those relief efforts.

""Could this be any more tone deaf? We have Americans suffering and in danger right now after the hurricane and this is what Kamala has to announce. America First!"" Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., said on X.

Tim Walz discusses Israel's right to defend itself and Kamala Harris' economic policies on 'Fox News Sunday.'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sought to distance Vice President Kamala Harris from laws he himself signed that granted benefits to illegal immigrants in Minnesota on Sunday.

Walz made the comments during a wide-ranging interview on Fox News Sunday with host Shannon Bream. Bream pressed Walz on his military history and his record on abortion in addition to questioning him on legislation he signed in Minnesota that allows illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and receive state-funded tuition assistance, among other benefits.

""Are those not magnets to draw people here, many times on dangerous journeys for themselves? And why should your taxpayers in Minnesota or across the states pay for those programs?"" Bream asked.

""Well, that's not the vice president's position,"" Walz admitted, before going on to defend his leadership in Minnesota.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUSHES BACK ON 'SNL' SKIT ABOUT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS: 'DISGUSTING'

""But I will say this, Minnesota ranks as a top five business state. We rank as a top three state for children living, and we're a top state for health care access,"" he said. ""Look, the Vice President has made it clear that she has policies that make a difference. Her border policies are the most strongest, the fairest we've seen.""

Bream also challenged Walz to clarify his ticket's position on abortion access. The exchange ultimately led to Walz flatly accusing former President Trump of lying when he said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

Bream began by pointing out that Minnesota's abortion law imposes no limits on abortion procedures through all nine months of pregnancy, something that goes far beyond the provisions of Roe v. Wade, which Harris and Walz said they support.

""You signed the bill that makes it legal through all nine months. Is that a position you think Democrats should advocate for nationally?"" Bream asked.

""The vice president and I have been clear the restoration of Roe versus Wade is what we're asking for,"" Walz responded.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGES MORE MEDIA INTERVIEWS AS VOTERS STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER POLICIES

""But that law goes far beyond Roe v. Wade,"" Bream pressed. ""Let's agree, in what you signed there's not a single limit through nine months of pregnancy. Roe had a trimester framework that did have limits through the pregnancy. The Minnesota law does not have that.""

""This doesn't change anything. It puts the decision back on to the woman, to the physicians,"" Walz responded. ""And we know that this is simply something to be brought up - to be very clear Donald Trump's asking for a nationwide abortion ban.""

""[Trump] has said repeatedly that he will not sign a national abortion ban. Are you calling that a flat out lie?"" Bream asked.

""Yes, of course, and Senator Vance has in the past said so too,"" Walz said.

Bream concluded the interview by giving Walz a chance to respond to criticism of his frequent ""misstatements,"" such as his claims about military service and his assertion that he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre.

""Look, I speak passionately. I had an entire career, decades before I was in public office. They know, and I'm very proud of my 24 years in service and my record. I have never disparaged someone else in this, but I know that's not what Donald Trump does. They disparage everyone,"" Walz said.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUSHES BACK ON 'SNL' SKIT ABOUT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS: 'DISGUSTING'

""I don't know, Dougie, I kind of wish I had picked Josh right now,"" Rudolph said, after the debate moderators asked a question about the Middle East and both candidates failed to provide answers.

""Who, Josh Shapiro?"" Samberg asked as Rudolph responded, ""no, Josh, Cabernet,"" while holding up a bottle of ""Josh"" wine.

Samberg told Rudolph not to worry because it wasn't like Gaffigan would say something ""crazy.""

""I've become friends with school shooters,"" Gaffigan then said, referencing a moment from Walz during the debate.

Rudolph subsequently broke her wine glass in her hand as Samberg acknowledged a ""flub"" by her running mate.

Later in the skit, Samberg walked into the room and told her President Biden was there to see her.

Biden, played by Dana Carvey, walked in and said, ""You've been watching this guy, come on Walz! What's wrong with that guy? He's crazy, get your facts straight, Jack!""

Gaffigan and Yang depicted multiple key moments of the actual debate between Walz and Vance, including questions about whether Walz was in Tiananmen Square, and Vance calling out the debate moderators for attempting to fact-check him.

""Honey, we did it, we got the soundbite!"" Samberg said, mocking Vance's answer to a question during the debate about whether former President Trump won in 2020. ""What are the pollsters saying?""

""This is a huge victory, it made no difference!"" Rudolph responded."

A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that former President Trump is winning the Catholic and Protestant vote.

Conducted from Aug. 26-Sept. 2, the survey found that 52% of Catholics and 61% of Protestants support Trump for president, while 47% of Catholics and 37% of Protestants back Kamala Harris.

As more Americans become aware of how radical Harris is, it's clear to see why Trump has won this support from religious voters.

Harris may have been the surprise replacement for Joe Biden, but her position on issues is far from unknown. She claims to be a future-oriented, change candidate eager to ""turn the page and chart a new way forward.""

DEMOCRATS DRIVING RELIGIOUS VOTE AWAY FROM PARTY AS TRUMP COURTS CATHOLICS: 'ANTI-CHRISTIAN' PARTY

However, Harris is a professional politician with a radical policy record that she can't defend among the religious electorate.

Consider that in 2014, in the case of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, Attorney General Harris filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court and was joined by 13 states and the District of Columbia.

Harris called on the court to force Hobby Lobby to violate its religious beliefs and cover the cost of contraception for its employees. (The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, protecting the family-owned arts and crafts chain to operate its business in line with its religious beliefs and values.)

5 REASONS KAMALA HARRIS IS SNUBBING THE AL SMITH DINNER, CATHOLICS, AND TRADITION

Also, as attorney general of California, Harris was a vocal advocate and ""proud"" co-sponsor of the Reproductive FACT Act, which Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law in 2015. The law required medically licensed pro-life pregnancy centers to display signs advertising low-cost or free abortions available in California.

The law ""was very clear that it was targeting pro-life viewpoints,"" said Denise Harle, who served as senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom. In a 2018 decision, the Supreme Court agreed with this view and struck down the law.

Writing for the majority in National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra (initially named NIFLA vs. Kamala Harris), Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the majority opinion, ""the FACT Act unduly burdens protected speech.""

As a U.S. senator of California from 2017-2021, Harris introduced and was the lead sponsor of the Do No Harm Act, which would have ended religious exemptions for certain government mandates, such as rules requiring insurance coverage of specific medical procedures. As a legal expert at First Liberty wrote at the time, ""This country was founded on religious liberty. The Do No Harm Act strikes at the heart of that freedom.""

Additionally, the Do No Harm Act would have undermined the bipartisan Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 landmark law that protects the rights of people of faith to worship freely and in accordance with their conscience.

Further, Sen. Harris was also an original co-sponsor of the ""Equality Act,"" a bill that would have further unraveled the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and enabled the government to prosecute faith-based institutions for refusing to hire employees who openly oppose their religious teachings. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was clear in denouncing the proposed legislation and said the Equality Act would ""run roughshod over religious liberty.""

Additionally, Sen. Harris questioned three judicial nominees on their affiliation with the Knights of Columbus, suggesting that involvement with the Catholic fraternal organization disqualifies a nominee for potential bias.

When I served as President Trump's ambassador to the Holy See, I witnessed the importance of having a president who stands up for religious freedom. President Trump has a proven track record for promoting and protecting religious freedom at home and abroad. Kamala Harris has repeatedly advanced an anti-faith agenda."

Elon Musk stood behind bulletproof glass as he spoke to a packed crowd of Trump rallygoers in Butler, Pennsylvania, Saturday evening.

""The true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire,"" he said, donning a dark ""MAGA"" hat and a shirt that read, ""Occupy Mars.""

""We had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot,"" he continued. ""America is the home of the brave, and there's no truer test than courage under fire, so who do you want representing America?""

The crowd erupted, waving signs that read ""Never Surrender"" and ""Fight, Fight, Fight"" behind the stage.

The multi-billionaire business magnate joined Former President Trump on-stage during his first return to Butler since facing an assassination attempt at the hands of 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks at the site just 12 weeks prior.

Musk, who has outspokenly defended free speech, warned that next month's Nov. 5 faceoff between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will be the ""most important election of our lifetime,"" with basic freedoms that are the bedrock of democracy at stake.

""This is a must-win situation,"" he told the crowd of 60,000.

So, how are you supposed to have a good, proper election if there's no ID? It's meaningless.""

Musk metamorphosed the Trump base's ""Fight, Fight, Fight"" slogan into a call to action - ""Vote, Vote, Vote"" - a chant embodying his pressure on those present to ""be a pest"" by repeatedly telling others to get out, register and vote.

""If there's one takeaway for anything that will matter is getting those registrations and then and then getting everyone to actually vote. That is what will decide this election, especially in Pennsylvania,"" he added."
KJP slammed after Hurricane Helene over mixed messages on whether FEMA resources used for migrants,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kjp-slammed-after-hurricane-helene-over-mixed-messages-whether-fema-resources-used-migrants,2024-10-06T11:55:22Z,"Fox News White House senior correspondent Peter Doocy asks the press secretary about President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' handling of the devastating floods that wreaked havoc on the southeast.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is facing heavy criticism after sending mixed messages on whether the Biden-Harris administration has been using FEMA resources to support migrants last week.

Jean-Pierre flatly denied that FEMA resources were going to migrants in a press conference last week, but she stated the opposite when asked about the issue in the fall of 2022.

""Former President Trump is accusing the Biden administration of using FEMA funding to support undocumented migrants. How is the White House responding to that?"" a reporter asked during a Friday press conference.

""I mean, it's just categorically false. It is not true. It is a false statement,"" Jean-Pierre responded, going on to cite a Washington Post fact-check article on the subject.

LAWMAKERS OUTRAGED OVER FEMA FUNDING CONCERNS

Social media critics then compared her statement to comments made in 2022, where she appeared to explicitly state that FEMA resources were available to illegal immigrants.

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 'FAILED TO ACT' IN HURRICANE HELENE AFTERMATH: REP. CORY MILLS

She made the statement during a Sept. 16, 2022, press conference when Jean-Pierre was asked about assisting cities in handling the busloads of migrants being sent across the country from Texas.

""FEMA Regional Administrators have been meeting with city officials on site to coordinate -- to coordinate available federal support from FEMA and other federal agencies,"" Jean-Pierre told reporters at the time.

""Funding is also available through FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter program to eligible local governments and not-for-profit organizations upon request to support humanitarian relief for migrants,"" she added.

Scrutiny on the Biden-Harris administration's use of FEMA funds comes amid catastrophic flooding in North Carolina. Vice President Kamala Harris announced a $100 million package to support the state.

Critics pointed out, however, that the package was much smaller than the $157 million in foreign humanitarian support Harris had announced for Lebanon the same day.

""The people of Lebanon are facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation. I am concerned about the security and well-being of civilians suffering in Lebanon and will continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians there,"" she wrote on X.

""To that end, the United States will provide nearly $157 million in additional assistance to the people of Lebanon for essential needs such as food, shelter, water, protection, and sanitation to help those who have been displaced by the recent conflict. This additional support brings total U.S. assistance to Lebanon over the last year to over $385 million,"" she added.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital."
"Georgia's Muslim voters opposing Harris, Trump in election over both candidates' support for Israel",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgias-muslim-voters-opposing-harris-trump-election-over-both-candidates-support-israel,2024-10-06T10:17:03Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A growing group of Muslim voters in Georgia say they will not back either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump in next month's election because of both candidates' support of Israel amid the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

Harris has said she supports Israel's right to defend itself and would not withhold weapons from the country, but has also called for a ceasefire in Gaza, while Trump said recently he is Israel's ""protector"" and reaffirmed his support for the Jewish state.

In battleground Georgia, where Trump narrowly lost in 2020 to President Joe Biden, the Peach State could help determine whether Harris or Trump wins the presidency.

The Muslim population in Georgia could also impact which candidate wins the state's 16 electoral votes. Muslim voters across the country are virtually tied between Harris and Trump, with Harris only securing a single-point advantage, according to a recent poll by the Arab American Institute.

KAMALA HARRIS' SUPPORT WITH ARAB AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN IS 'TENUOUS': DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST

Kristen Truitt, a Muslim American voter in Atlanta, has voted for Democrats in prior elections but now says the party will not have his support over its position on Israel.

""Just to give unlimited funds and access to Israel, I think that is totally ridiculous,"" Truitt told Fox 5 Atlanta.

This comes just ahead of the one-year mark of the ongoing war in Gaza between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists. The conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel and took more than 250 hostages, which prompted retaliatory action from Israel's military.

The Hamas-run government's Gaza Health Ministry estimates that more than 41,000 people have been killed in the conflict, although it does not distinguish between civilian and terrorist deaths. More than 1,500 people have reportedly been killed in Israel since the start of the conflict, with most of them being killed on Oct. 7 and its immediate aftermath.

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

The growing group of Muslim voters in Georgia and across the country have said they will not vote for Harris or Trump due to both sides' vocal support of Israel in its war in Gaza, and the conflict is now expanding to include Israel attacking Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanon.

""What we're trying to say is we should really do away with the logic of voting for the 'lesser of two evils,'"" Kareem Rosshandler, Georgia co-chair of the ""Abandon Harris"" campaign, told Fox 5.

The ""Abandon Harris"" campaign group is urging Muslims to vote third-party to send a message to Republicans and Democrats that they need to earn the votes of the Muslim community.

""I think the main one is to say that the Muslim community in the United States won't be taken for granted,"" Rosshandler said.

Rosshandler said the group has already secured commitments from more than 10,000 Muslim voters to support third-party candidates. Some third-party candidates, including Libertarian Chase Oliver and the Green Party's Jill Stein, have been critical of Israel's war in Gaza.

The loss of Muslim voters is expected to hurt Harris more than Trump, as the Republican candidate has previously struggled to secure Muslim votes.

""That would essentially have a greater adverse impact on the Harris-Waltz ticket than it would on Trump-Vance,"" Emory University assistant professor of law Alicia Hughes, who is also a voting expert, told Fox 5 Atlanta. ""Trump, historically, has not been able to count on those votes.""

Hughes also says that if Harris or Trump were more vocally critical of Israel, it may not help their election chances either.

""There's a great possibility that you would lose more from the change than you would actually gain,"" she said."
"New York company unveils 100-foot 'Vote for Trump' sign, gets sued by Democratic mayor",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-company-unveils-100-foot-vote-trump-sign-sued-democratic-mayor,2024-10-06T10:07:56Z,"Sticker Mule CEO Anthony Constantino spoke to Fox News Digital about his efforts to post a large 'Vote for Trump' sign on top of a building in Amsterdam, New York, and the mayor's efforts to stop it.

A 100-foot wide ""Vote for Trump"" sign in upstate New York is stirring controversy after the City of Amsterdam claimed it's a big, glowing code violation.

Sticker Mule CEO Anthony Constantino told Fox News Digital he installed the sign on top of the old Fownes glove factory to symbolize the return of American manufacturing and what he calls ""the triumph of the underdog against insurmountable adversity.""

""I think that's what President Trump did. He triumphed against massive adversity. He's still doing that with bullets flying by his head,"" Constantino said. ""And we triumph too. Nobody thought we could build a massive sticker company or a massive tech company in upstate New York.""

But his company now faces adversity in the form of legal action by the City of Amsterdam to prevent the ""displaying"" and ""illumination"" of the pro-Trump sign, which is visible from the New York State Thruway.

TRUMP'S RETURN TO BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, SITE OF FIRST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, IS 'GUTSY,' SUPPORTERS SAY

According to court documents, the sign violates city code because it ""presents a dangerous distraction and impacts traffic flow,"" especially at night when it is illuminated. Local officials allege Sticker Mule was informed it would need a permit and several variances to install the sign in August, but the company never responded before the sign went up Oct. 1.

Constantino and his legal team contest the city's claims. The CEO believes Amsterdam's Democratic Party-endorsed independent mayor is anti-Trump and has vowed to fight a temporary injunction that requires the sign to be covered up. Amsterdam Mayor Michael Cinquanti did not respond to requests for comment.

Dressed in a black T-shirt that said ""Trump For Peace,"" Constantino describes Sticker Mule as ""the internet's fastest growing printing company"" with 1,200 employees in 39 countries. His online business began by making stickers but has since expanded to print T-shirts, buttons and magnets and even operates its own online store platform, Sticker Mule Stores. He is proud to report that Sticker Mule has created nearly 1,000 manufacturing jobs in the U.S. over the past few years.

""I like to move fast and do interesting things,"" Constantino told Fox News Digital. Success in business gave him the means to reinvest in his hometown of Amsterdam, and the Fownes factory was one of several buildings he bought and restored, filling them with machines and workers.

FORMER NFL STAR AND TRUMP SUPPORTER ANTONIO BROWN JOINS VOTER REGISTRATION EFFORT IN KEY SWING STATE

""Fownes was a glove manufacturer that left my hometown when I was 2 years old in 1984,"" he said, explaining that Amsterdam was ""decimated"" by job loss when the factory, with its iconic ""Fownes"" sign, closed its doors.

""This Fownes sign for years symbolized American manufacturing going to China,"" Constantino said. Now, the $150,000 ""Vote for Trump"" sign sits in its place, heralding a new era of American manufacturing jobs.

The impossible-to-miss sign attracted ""major interest,"" according to Constantino. To celebrate its installation, his political action committee, StickerPAC, plans to host a ""Trump Sign Lighting Party"" Oct. 7 at 6 p.m. A news release about the event says UFC superstars Henry Cejudo, Kelvin Gastelum and Tracy Cortez will join Constantino to speak and support the ""historic event.""

According to a representative for Constantino, House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is also expected to speak at the event. Stefanik's office did not respond to a request for comment.

""The enthusiasm just went through the roof. We've got three UFC superstars that wanted to come see it. We've got people that want to come from all over the state of New York, people that want to fly in or drive in from all over the country, really, to see the sign get lit up,"" Constantino said.

'TIGHTEST RACE SINCE 2000': HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN HITS FINAL STRETCH UNTIL ELECTION DAY

But the festivities may be cut short by legal action from Amsterdam. On Oct. 3, the city code enforcer sent a notice of violation to Sticker Mule that gave the company two days to remove the ""Vote for Trump"" sign. The city also requested an injunction from the Supreme Court of the State of New York to prevent the sign from being displayed.

""The affidavit claims, without evidence, that the city will suffer irreparable harm because the sign is a dangerous distraction for drivers due to its novelty and the fear that people will stop to take pictures of it,"" said Sal Ferlazzo, general counsel for Sticker Mule. ""The court, based solely on the city's presentation and without any opportunity for me to respond, did initially grant a preliminary injunction and restraining order.""

A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 8 at 10 a.m. Until that time, the court ordered Sticker Mule to refrain from ""displaying any sign and/or illumination of any sign on the roof of 26 Elk Street.""

On the advice of legal counsel, Sticker Mule has temporarily covered up the pro-Trump sign to comply with the court order.

TRUMP-VANCE TICKET HAS DONE COMBINED 63 INTERVIEWS SINCE AUGUST COMPARED TO 24 FOR HARRIS-WALZ

""I think it's deeply disturbing,"" Constantino said of the city's action. ""I brought nearly a thousand jobs to my hometown, which was decimated when the Fownes company and other companies left. And I'm trying to do something positive, exciting for the community.""

He suggested Mayor Cinquanti has ""TDS"" -- Trump derangement syndrome -- and is fighting the sign for political reasons.

""They do know that they are in violation,"" Cinquanti told The Daily Gazette. ""They've been cited, and we'll just let that play out as we would with any code violation.""

The mayor, who according to the newspaper has previously called Trump his least favorite president in American history, insisted the city's objections to the sign are about safety, not politics.

""I don't care what the sign says, but distracting the attention of drivers on the freeway is something that needs to be looked at, and that's what we're doing,"" he told the outlet.

""Any sign that represents a hazard to the safety of drivers concerns me,"" he added. ""Anyone who violates city codes is an issue that we deal with, and we are in the process of dealing with it and trying to alleviate what I consider a hazard.""

Regardless of the city's objections, Constantino said Monday's event will continue as planned, ""featuring UFC Superstars, Free Fish Filets, Cybertrucks and a beautiful Trump sign.""

""The sign is a beautiful sign whether you're a Democrat or Republican. The sign is a big win for upstate New York, a big win for Amsterdam, New York. It's a beautiful and uplifting sign. And I think it's going to become a major tourist attraction, especially if Trump wins,"" Constantino said.

""It's going to be a unifying event. I'm inviting Democrats and Republicans alike to come watch me unveil the sign. We don't want all the division going on in this country anymore."""
Absentee voting kicks off in Maine,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/absentee-voting-kicks-off-maine,2024-10-06T09:15:23Z,"Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier explains how disaster declarations in counties are causing closures of election offices on 'Special Report.'

Absentee voting in Maine is getting underway, with the state's four Electoral College votes up for grabs and a number of other national, statewide and local races on the ballot.

Maine is one of two states in the U.S. -- the other is Nebraska -- that does not use a winner-take-all system for all its electors. In the presidential race, two electors are given to the winner of the statewide popular vote, while one elector is awarded to Maine's District 1 and District 2, respectively.

Maine is one of several Democratic-leaning northeastern states. President Biden won here by about nine points in 2020, improving on Hillary Clinton's margin four years earlier. And it hasn't voted for a Republican at the statewide level since 1988. It is ranked Likely D on the Fox News Power Rankings.

Like Nebraska, it also allocates its electoral votes by congressional district. The winner of the statewide tally receives two votes, with another vote for the winner of the presidential tally in each of its two districts.

The small coastal 1st District is solid blue territory. The 2nd District, which is predominantly rural and represents almost all the land area of the state, leans conservative.

Trump won the 2nd District by 7.4 points in his last race, and it's ranked Likely R this cycle. The former president will look for a win here to get one step closer to the 270 electoral votes he needs to win the presidency.

The same district is also home to a competitive House race.

Maine's 2nd District: Incumbent Rep. Jared Golden is one of five Democrats running in districts Trump won in the last presidential election (Golden won by 6 points). The former Marine made headlines this year when he said he ""didn't know"" whether he would vote for Biden again and was one of the first Democrats to question Biden's mental fitness. This time, he's up against Maine State Representative and former NASCAR driver Austin Theriault, who says he wants ""more balance and less extremism"" in politics. This race is a Power Rankings toss-up.

Hillary Clinton says social media companies need to moderate content or 'we lose total control',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/hillary-clinton-says-social-media-companies-need-moderate-content-we-lose-total-control,2024-10-06T08:51:40Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Saturday that social media companies must moderate content on their platforms or else ""we lose total control.""

Clinton told CNN host Michael Smerconish that while there have been some steps taken at the state level to regulate social media, she wants to see more done by the federal government to moderate content.

""We can look at the state of California, the state of New York, I think some other states have also taken action,"" Clinton said.

""But we need national action, and sadly, our Congress has been dysfunctional when it comes to addressing these threats to our children,"" she added.

HILLARY CLINTON DEFENDS 'DEPLORABLES' COMMENT: 'TOO KIND A WORD' FOR SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS

Clinton said she believes the issue should be ""at the top of every legislative political agenda"" and called for the repealing of Section 230 of the Communications Act, which protects online platforms from being held liable for third-party content, such as user content on social media. This immunity applies to the content itself and the removal of content in certain circumstances.

""We should be, in my view, repealing something called Section 230, which gave, you know, platforms on the internet immunity because they were thought to be just pass-throughs, that they shouldn't be judged for the content that is posted,"" Clinton said.

""But we now know that that was an overly simple view, that if the platforms, whether it's Facebook or Twitter/X or Instagram or TikTok, whatever they are, if they don't moderate and monitor the content, we lose total control,"" she continued. ""And it's not just the social and psychological affects, it's real life.""

Clinton said the social media companies should have their immunity stripped so ""guardrails"" could be implemented.

She said that cellphones should be restricted in schools, an effort that has been approved by several states in the U.S., including Florida and California. Individual school districts in various states across the country have also adopted policies banning or limiting cellphone use during school hours.

""Take phones out of schools,"" she said. ""I'm so happy to see schools beginning to do that, where the kids turn their phone in when they walk in the door.""

""And guess what? Kids are paying better attention in class,"" Clinton added. ""They are talking to each other in the lunchroom, things that used to be part of your daily life when you were a child in school.""

Last month, Clinton suggested during an appearance on MSNBC that Americans accused of interfering in U.S. elections by spreading ""propaganda"" promoting former President Trump should be civilly or even criminally charged, as she cited the 2016 election in which she lost to Trump."
Here's what two undecided Wisconsin voters are holding out for in the 2024 election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/heres-what-2-undecided-wisconsin-voters-holding-out-2024-election,2024-10-06T08:21:55Z,"WISCONSIN -- With only one month until the presidential election, very few voters are still uncertain about their choice, but in a battleground state like Wisconsin that has flipped in the past two elections, those undecided voters could make the difference.

Estimates of still-undecided voters in Wisconsin are in the low single digits, with the latest Marquette Law School poll reporting that just 4% identified themselves as such.

Fox News Digital spoke with two such voters, who laid out why they are still holding out and what they need to seal the deal.

TRUMP ATTORNEYS ARGUE JACK SMITH'S OBSTRUCTION CHARGES BE DISMISSED, CITING SUPREME COURT'S 'FISCHER' DECISION

""I got to make up my mind when I fill out the paper,"" said 86-year-old Edgar Schiekiera of Waukesha, Wisconsin.

""I'm going to throw a dart,"" he laughed.

Schiekiera is an immigrant from Germany who noted that he grew up during the Second World War. For him, former President Trump's comments on foreign policy have been troubling, enough so to make him hesitate to support Trump for a third time.

""I voted for Trump the first year. I voted for him the second year. I don't -- this time, I don't know,"" he said.

""I'm from Germany, and things that he's said about [the] NATO Alliance -- he wants quit it, and he doesn't know what to do,"" he said of what's making him unsure of Trump. ""A real danger lives overseas.""

Schiekiera was also concerned about what Trump has said with relation to conflicts around the world, particularly involving Ukraine and Iran. ""He can stop the war?"" he asked, in reference to Trump's own claims about the war between Ukraine and Russia. ""He cannot stop the war.""

However, he added that ""Biden or Kamala Harris -- she doesn't know what's going to happen,"" either. According to him, he isn't confident that either of the top candidates can effectively lead on the world stage in the current geopolitical climate.

There are other issues that Schiekiera is taking into consideration as well, such as abortion. ""I got my own ideas,"" he said.

He noted that Trump has appeared to change positions on ""issues nationally [and] worldwide.""

""Trump's gone one way, and then he [goes] to another way. He's undecided what he's going to do, really.""

In contrast, Keon Pierce of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, isn't considering Trump at all. But he is not sold on Vice President Kamala Harris either.

""I'm leaning Kamala, but I have to see. She's got to convince me a little more,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""I'm waiting to see who has the best -- the best protection for different groups of people. You know, the best rights and best laws that can help all groups of people.""

Pierce explained that he wanted to be sure the president would ""help all people. Asian people, Indian people, Black people, everybody.""

When Fox News Digital noted that Harris is both Black and Indian, he responded, ""We had a Black president before, and it didn't necessarily translate to helping the people,"" in reference to former President Barack Obama.

He said he was ""open to"" Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who will appear on the Wisconsin ballot after a court challenge to see her ousted was denied.

""It's possible that I wouldn't vote as well,"" he added.

As for the Milwaukee area, Pierce explained, ""It's bad here. It's really segregated here, and opportunities are limited.""

He said he needs to hear more about what will be done to bring more ""opportunities, jobs, education, [and] a better school system in the inner city.""

Kurdish official warns US: 'now is not the time' to pull forces out of Iraq',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kurdish-special-representative-talks-about-us-plan-withdraw-from-iraq,2024-10-06T08:21:49Z,"National security analyst Rebecca Grant joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the attack on the U.S. airbase in Iraq and why she believes Biden is nearing war with Iran as tensions escalate.

As the U.S. mulls over a plan to withdraw troops from Iraq, its Kurdish allies have a message: Don't forget us.

""This is not the time to reduce coalition forces in Iraq,"" Treefa Aziz, the Kurdistan Regional Government's special representative to the U.S., told Fox News Digital.

""Extremist groups like ISIS and armed militias continue to pose a serious threat to the people of Iraq and the Kurdistan Region.""

The U.S. announced plans to shrink the U.S. ""footprint"" in Iraq and end the current mission of coalition forces - including the Kurds - to fight ISIS, but declined to say how many of the 2,500 troops currently stationed there would remain.

""A decade ago, Kurdish Peshmerga forces worked alongside U.S. troops to defeat ISIS and continue to actively combat ISIS remnants to prevent a resurgence of terror today,"" Aziz said. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) ""has been a reliable security partner for the United States and remains ready to enhance cooperation.""

But now, if Baghdad is pushing the U.S. out of Iraq, the U.S. could feel it must honor that request or risk making another enemy in the Middle East. The KRG says it would be ""willing and able"" to host U.S. coalition forces in its territory.

The current mission is now set to end by September 2025, with a plan to keep the number of forces on the Iraqi side to back up the 900 U.S. troops in Syria until at least 2026.

News of a plan that could amount to a significant drawdown of U.S. forces called to mind 2019, when former President Donald Trump announced plans to pull out of Syria and the Kurds felt abandoned by a partner they had fought alongside for years - leaving them open to an attack by Turkish forces.

PENTAGON PLANS TO SHRINK US 'FOOTPRINT' IN IRAQ

Trump, at the time, left the Kurds with a warning to their longtime enemies: ""I have told Turkey that if they do anything outside of what we would think is humane . . . they could suffer the wrath of an extremely decimated economy.""

The U.S. relationship with the Kurds - an indigenous group of daring fighters whose quest for their own formal state has been unsuccessful - spans back decades.

When the Turks denied the U.S. passage into Iraq for the invasion in 2003, Iraqi Kurds helped the U.S. overthrow Saddam Hussein.

The Kurds have fought with U.S. coalition forces since they reentered Iraq in 2014 to fight ISIS, and the U.S. pledged arms support and humanitarian aid.

The group faces attacks from terror groups on all sides. And as Iran increasingly encroaches on the Iraqi government, Baghdad has the KRG in a choke-hold, officials say.

US, IRAQ TEAM UP TO KILL 15 ISIS OPERATIVES

""There is growing concern regarding efforts to weaken the federal system in Iraq. The constitutional framework, which is designed to ensure shared governance, is disregarded,"" one Kurdish official said.

""The continued suspension of oil exports from the Kurdistan region has placed significant economic strain. More than a year and half later, we have yet to see the resumption of these exports.""

The KRG has been trying to work with the Iraqis on a power-sharing agreement with no real results.

""Some of these actions appear to align with external influences rather than the broader national interest,"" the official said, referring to Iranian influence. ""With the assistance of our allies, we believe these issues can be resolvable through constructive dialogue and cooperation.""

The KRG is also asking the U.S. government to ""honor its commitment"" included in the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to ""provide the KRG with a comprehensive air defense system.

The law required the Department of Defense to submit and implement a plan for providing the Iraqi security forces and Kurdistan Region with air defenses by July 2024.

""As a steadfast U.S. ally that is regularly targeted by extremist violence, the KRG requires assurances that it will be protected from all threats, both internal and external,"" said Aziz.

Gen. Michael Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, told the House Armed Services Committee in March that ISIS-K, which launched a horrific attack in Moscow earlier this year, ""retains the capability and the will to attack U.S. and Western interests abroad in as little as six months with little to no warning."""
"Eric Adams channels Trump as he ramps up revenge accusations against the Biden admin, expert says",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/eric-adams-channels-trump-he-ramps-up-revenge-accusations-against-biden-admin-expert-says,2024-10-06T08:19:20Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A former federal prosecutor who led the last major takedown of a big city mayor on corruption charges says embattled Big Apple boss Eric Adams is following an aggressive defense tactic he may have learned from former President Donald Trump.

""It appears like the Adams defense team is taking lessons from the former president about how best to litigate against the government,"" Mark Chutkow, a former federal prosecutor who led the public corruption case against former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick a decade ago. ""In other words, your best defense is often an aggressive offense.""

Although Trump's New York trial took place in state court, prosecuted by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office and not the U.S. Department of Justice, there was a strong perception that the charges were politically motivated. And critics have raised similar concerns about the investigation by special counsel Jack Smith.

Chutkow pointed to a pair of defense motions that he said were filed ""extremely fast"" -- the mayor's motion to dismiss the bribery charge against him and a motion asking the court to investigate a series of Justice Department leaks that the defense says has damaged Adams' public image and compromises his right to a fair trial.

CNN LEGAL ANALYST SAYS SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH BENT RULES TO GET 'CHEAP SHOT' IN ON TRUMP BEFORE ELECTION

""I do think that how quickly the defense has filed a motion to dismiss, and this motion related to the leaks, shows not only are they being very aggressive in their defense, but they're going to shape public opinion about the case, almost the way you would in a political campaign,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""They're looking at who gets to define the narrative.""

Adams, a moderate Democrat, has accused the Justice Department of going after him and people in his orbit in retaliation for his criticism of the Biden-Harris administration on border security.

""Like Trump, Adams' legal strategy is to deny and defend,"" said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who runs a private practice in Los Angeles. ""That's helpful for a candidate in the middle of an election, but there's more than a public relations and political benefit. By attacking the prosecution and putting them on their heels, that forces the government into a defensive position and delays the proceedings.""

In a battle of attrition, delays benefit the defense, he said.

""Prosecutors have limited resources and rarely deal with defendants with access to the best and brightest lawyers, like Trump and Adams do,"" he said.

The argument that the U.S. Department of Justice is punishing the administration's political opponents has been raised before -- by Trump and his supporters. In addition to the cases against Trump, critics have questioned aggressive prosecutions of people involved in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

ERIC ADAMS LIKELY TO FACE MORE CHARGES AS EMBATTLED MAYOR ACCUSES BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN OF POLITICAL PROSECUTION

Congress even has a House Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, which held a hearing in late September to explore claims that the FBI was purging conservatives from its ranks.

U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams, whose office is prosecuting Adams, denied a political motive in connection with the case when he announced the indictment last week.

""We are not focused on the right or the left,"" he said during a news briefing last month. ""We are focused on right and wrong. That is our duty, and we will fulfill it.""

But the government's motive doesn't really matter if a crime has been committed, said Chutkow, the former federal prosecutor.

ERIC ADAMS DEFENSE HINGES ON SUPREME COURT RULING IN HEARTLAND TRUCKING CASE

""You either committed the crime or you didn't,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""It doesn't really matter why the government chose to prosecute you.""

But Adams' publicity campaign could be designed to influence the jury pool. It could take just one sympathic individual on the panel to break the case.

""[Prosecutors] would have to be somehow defending against their own actions,"" Chutkow said. ""Most judges control that pretty tightly in the courtroom, but it's more difficult to do that in the court of public opinion. That's what you've seen with the former president, where he or people supportive of him made a lot of statements in the press.""

The judge in Trump's case, Juan Merchan, struggled to control out-of-court comments despite a gag order, he added.

""It's difficult when you're dealing with a public official, because they have First Amendment rights,"" Chutkow said. ""The judge is always going to have to weigh the right of free speech over concerns of contaminating the jury pool.""

"Musk energizes Trump supporters at Butler rally, 3 months after assassination attempt on former president",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/musk-energizes-trump-supporters-butler-rally-3-months-after-assassination-attempt-former-president,2024-10-06T01:14:50Z,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a memorable appearance at former President Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday - a rare appearance for the tech entrepreneur.

Wearing a black ""Make America Great Again"" hat and a T-shirt reading ""Occupy Mars,"" Musk appeared on stage shortly after Trump made his own remarks. The rally was held at the same site where Trump was shot by gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks on July 13.

Although Musk has become a vocal Trump supporter, the speech marked the first time that the tech entrepreneur stumped at a major presidential rally. Musk confirmed that he would be at the rally on social media this week.

""I want to say what an honor it is to be here and, you know, the true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire, right?"" Musk said at the beginning of his remarks. ""And we had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs, and another who was fist pumping after getting shot.""

Musk, considered one of the most influential people in the world, also encouraged the audience to ""vote, vote, vote.""

""Just be a pest to everyone,"" he said to the audience. ""You know, people on the street everywhere: Vote, vote, vote!""

""Fight, fight, fight, vote, vote, vote,"" Musk added. At one point, the X owner jumped excitedly.

WALZ ROASTED AFTER DECLARING 'WE CAN'T AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF THIS' AT RALLY

Trump's speech, which he opened with a roaring start by thanking the people of Pennsylvania and making a light joke about the attempt on his life in July with the line ""And as I was saying..."", was largely positive and uplifting, a departure from his normally acrid criticisms of his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. During the speech, the Republican candidate did make pointed remarks about his opponents who ""maybe even tried to kill me.""

""Above all, you deserve leadership in Washington that does not answer to the lobbyists, to the bureaucrats, or to the corrupt special interests, but answers only to you, the hardworking citizens of America, of which there are a lot of them,"" Trump described.

""We have a lot of them. We have a lot of them over the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, tried to throw me off the ballot, and who knows, maybe even tried to kill me,"" the candidate continued. ""But I've never stopped fighting for you. And I never will.""

The Republican candidate then turned his attention to the immigration chart he had put up - the same one that was displayed when he was shot on July 13.

""I love that chart,"" Trump said. ""I love that graph. Isn't it a beautiful thing?""

""But also beautiful because look at the number, that's the day I left office,"" he continued. ""It was the lowest Border Patrol [apprehensions]...Today, it's out of control.""

Trump also held a moment for Corey Comperatore at 6:11 p.m., the exact time that Crooks began firing at the former president on July 13. Comperatore, a rally attendee and firefighter, was fatally wounded.

Speaking at the beginning of his speech in Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump acknowledged Comperatore's death and thanked his relatives for attending.

Former President Trump on Friday met a Vietnam veteran who was inspired to give Trump his Purple Heart after an assassination attempt on Trump.

""I couldn't think of anybody more deserving of a Purple Heart,"" the man, identified only as Dwight, told Trump on stage during a town hall campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

""You took it. You laid down there. You got back. And the first words out of your mouth were 'Fight, fight, fight,'"" Dwight said of when Trump was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July by a 20-year-old attempted assassin.

""You didn't even have anything to shoot back at him. You got guts. It was a minor wound, but it was close to being a terrible one.""

""My wife and I both thought it appropriate. God bless you, your family, and the United States of America. Sincerely, Dwight.""

""I got very lucky,"" Trump responded. ""And maybe it wasn't so much luck. Maybe it is something else, right? Maybe there's something else up there.""

Johnson has long been a supporter of the Democratic Party, previously endorsing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.

When he appeared in Flint, Johnson said Black men need to vote, but with a conscience.

Johnnson added that Black men need to ""understand"" that Donald Trump ""did not deliver on"" promises he made ""to the Black community.""

So, they should vote for Harris, Johnson said.

DAVID MARCUS: Trump's defiant supporters flock to Butler rally with renewed confidence,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-trumps-defiant-supporters-flock-butler-rally-renewed-confidence,2024-10-05T21:30:01Z,"Thousands of supporters of former President Trump returned to Butler, Pa., Saturday, amid an increased presence of Secret Service and security details and checkpoints.

In the couple of weeks after Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket, there was a decided doldrum I detected across the country from Trump supporters.

But Saturday, as Trump returned to the site of his July 13 near assassination and the tragic murder of Corey Comperatore, a new confidence was clear among his faithful.

Rob is a teacher who lives in Pennsylvania and was carrying a clipboard, registering voters who stood in the vast line to get in.

""I coach wrestling,"" Rob told me, ""and when they switched in Harris it was like a wrestler had his opponent pinned, and suddenly they swap in a new, fresh opponent. Even if that new opponent is weak, it's still deflating.""

TRUMP SUPPORTERS WEIGH IN ON SAFETY AT HISTORIC PENNSYLVANIA RALLY

But now, Rob, who had registered about a dozen new voters when I spoke to him early in the day, thinks Trump has turned a corner, and is poised to defeat Harris.

He wasn't alone.

On a park bench in the shade, I found Karen and George, both in their 60s, along with Johnny and Rocky, in their late 20s or so. The two pairs, all decked out in Trump gear, had only just met. But when I was talking to them, I honestly thought they were family members who had known each other forever.

""It's like a Grateful Dead vibe,"" Johnny told me, ""it's all about love.""

Karen agreed, at least about the love part, not sure about the Dead, and she is confident that Trump can unite our deeply divided country. ""He's already showed he can get people what they need. He was in North Carolina right away after the hurricane. Where were Harris and Biden?""

Karen, like many I spoke to, believes that Trump won the 2020 election, and expects similar shenanigans this time around. However, she is confident not just that Trump will win, but that Republican Dave McCormack will beat incumbent Bob Casey Jr., in the Keystone State's critical Senate battle.

Rocky agreed, ""Casey is just a career politician,"" he mused. ""One thing I wish Trump would talk more about is term limits, because these are the people destroying the country.""

I've been to a lot of Trump rallies, but the pure scale of this one was off the charts. It took an hour to park in a nearby field. My little Mitsubishi Lancer had never driven on grass before, but she did okay, and the atmosphere was incredibly festive notwithstanding the long, long waits.

Joe, a retired NYPD officer, had driven six hours from Staten Island with his 18-year-old nephew, Uriel.

I'll note I saw no evidence of anyone being bused in. This crowd was truly as organic as a vegan's lunch.

When I asked Joe how long he had supported Trump, he told me, ""All my life."" It was his way of saying The Donald was the politician he had been waiting for.

I've been to a lot of Trump rallies, but the pure scale of this one was off the charts.

""In Staten Island, people are excited about Trump,"" he told me, and his nephew, set to vote for the first time, agreed.

I asked Uriel, what would make an 18-year-old vote for Trump?

""He'll make it a better country,"" he said quietly, in his Yankees t-shirt. ""More opportunity?"" I pressed, ""Yes,"" he replied. It mirrored what young voters have been telling me across the Rust Belt, and beyond.

I spoke to several attendees who had been in the same place on that fateful July 13, but the one who stood out was another Joe.

""Everybody was so calm and orderly, that's what I remember,"" he said. ""But I felt so bad for the kids, I mean, they were really scared.""

Joe did admit to feeling some emotions coming back to the Butler Farm Show grounds, but he's a dude and declined to elaborate on them too much.

As for the election? Like everyone I spoke to, the confidence is growing. ""Look at this crowd,"" he said,"" how can he lose?""

I'll admit, it sounded a bit like hubris, especially given the events of the last eight years, but it absolutely reflects the attitude of Trump voters over the past month, who have moved from a sense of nervousness, to increasing belief that this election is now squarely moving in Trump's direction.

On Saturday in Butler, it felt like a reset. After all, the tragic shooting took place just two days before the Republican National Convention. Just a week later, Biden was out, Harris was in, and confusion was everywhere.

There is now a month to go until Election Day, and if the sprawling crowd at the second Butler rally is to be believed, Donald Trump, decidedly has his groove back."
"Latinos shifting to Trump because they have 'internalized racism,' journalist claims",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/latinos-shifting-trump-because-have-internalized-racism-journalist-claims,2024-10-05T21:09:19Z,"Paolo Ramos argues in her new book that Latinos are shifting toward former President Trump because of internalized racism stemming from colonization.

Journalist and MSNBC contributor Paola Ramos, daughter of Jorge Ramos, blamed ""internalized racism"" for why Latinos are leaving the Democratic Party and supporting former President Trump.

Ramos appeared on PBS' ""Amanpour & Company"" this week to address the trend covered in her new book, ""Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means.""

Trump appears to be outperforming his 2020 support among Latinos who prefer the Republican over Vice President Kamala Harris on handling the economy and immigration.

The Democratic Party's advantage with these voters is shrinking, according to NBC News, whose poll last week found the Democrats' edge is at its lowest level in the past four presidential election cycles.

MSNBC GUEST CLAIMS LATINOS 'WANT TO BE WHITE' WHILE DISCUSSING THEIR SHIFT TOWARD GOP

In discussions with Trump-supporting Latinos for her book, Ramos said she found that ""tribalism, traditionalism, and political trauma"" were the three driving forces behind this growing trend.

""Really understanding the sort of racial baggage that I believe a lot of Latinos, including myself, and a lot of us are carrying from Latin America. What it means to sort of been colonized for so many years, the weight of colonization, that, in of itself, I believe, creates a lot of internalized racism, a lot of colorism, that then manifests in American politics in so many ways,"" Ramos began.

""And that's then how you can explain the fact that even someone like Donald Trump feels so comfortable going to the Bronx, talking to a group of Black Latinos, and Latino Trump supporters, because he believes that he can sort of tap into a racial and ethnic grievance that is very familiar,"" she continued.

Ramos told USA Today that traditionalism and trauma also play into the trend.

""There's traditionalism which is just breaking down what centuries of colonization have done to us and has led us to be so fixated on certain gender norms and sexual norms and then also leads us to this slippery slope of admiring things like Christian nationalism and then the trauma of this sort of admiration and a lot of Latinos flirting with the strongman rule and where that comes from,"" she said.

Last week, MSNBC guest Maria Hinojosa claimed Latinos ""want to be White"" while discussing the political shift toward Trump among Hispanics.

""And what I said to you when we asked a question was, Latinos want to be White. They want to be with the cool kids,"" she said.

Hinojosa went on to say that those voters could cost Harris the election.

""But those numbers? They could cost Kamala Harris the election. Everything that I've been saying that Latinos could push her over the top, these are the numbers that could also take her down,"" she said.

Vice President Kamala Harris currently has a 12-point lead among registered Hispanic voters, according to the latest Fox News poll.

Police were ubiquitous among the crowd estimated by a Butler County Sheriff's officer to number up to 60,000 people, snipers could be seen perched on rooftops ahead of the rally, and the Secret Service acknowledged heightened security. The event marked Trump's return to the Pennsylvania venue where he narrowly survived an assassination attempt in July. The former president's remarks are scheduled for 5 p.m. EST.

TRUMP'S RETURN TO BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, SITE OF FIRST ASSASSINATION, IS 'GUTSY,' SUPPORTERS SAY

Friends who traveled over three hours to see Trump said that their families had concerns about them coming to the rally, but expressed how they felt safe with the bolstered security.

""Our families weren't too crazy about us coming today,"" Jody Cavalieri said. ""But we see the snipers, the police everywhere, and the camaraderie, and it's great.""

""People coming from all around the country, it's an amazing feeling,"" Dena Diebold said.

The Secret Service have upped security since the first Butler rally in July -- which included the roof of a nearby warehouse where investigators say that 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks fired from on July 13.

Crooks unleashed eight rounds of bullets, grazing Trump's ear, killing a 50-year-old firefighter and father of two daughters, Corey Comperatore, and wounding two others.

U.S. Secret Service (USSS) spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement to Fox News Digital that Trump was receiving ""heightened"" security during the second Butler rally.

""Since the attempted assassination of former President Trump on July 13, the U.S. Secret Service has made comprehensive changes and enhancements to our communications capabilities, resourcing and protective operations,"" he said. ""Today, the former President is receiving heightened protection, and we take the responsibility to ensure his safety and security very seriously.""

Guglielmi said that the USSS is ""coordinating closely"" with the Pennsylvania State Police as well as local law enforcement.

""We are also leveraging other federal security resources to expand personnel and technology,"" he said. ""To maintain the integrity of our protective operations, we cannot go into specifics regarding the security enhancements. Residents in the area should expect traffic delays and an increased presence of state, local, and federal law enforcement as part of our efforts.""

Supporters noticed the heightened protection and said they felt safer than they did during the July 13 rally.

""It's obviously more secure. Way more secure,"" David Mills told Fox News Digital, pointing to the snipers on the rooftops. ""You have snipers up on the roof back there. Law enforcement is everywhere.

""I didn't feel unsafe in July, but the security back in July was way less than four years ago [in Butler] and today,"" he added.

Dan Beasley, a real estate broker, quipped that this was the ""safest place in America.""

""It's probably the safest place in America right now,"" he said, laughing. ""I'll say that.""

Former Obama senior adviser David Axelrod argued that Vice President Kamala Harris voters will be clever enough to navigate voting in the wake of the devastation from Hurricane Helene, while saying that rural Trump voters will have a harder time getting to the polls.

Axelrod made the claim during an episode of his podcast ""Hacks on Tap"" that aired Wednesday, predicting that liberal voters in Asheville, North Carolina - a predominantly blue area in the state - will ""figure out a way to vote"" more so than conservatives in the storm's aftermath.

Describing Asheville as a ""blue dot"" in the state, he continued, ""Those voters in Asheville are - they're, you know, the kind of voters that will figure out a way to vote. You know, they're upscale, kind of liberal voters, and they're probably going to figure out a way to vote,"" Axelrod said.

He continued, stating rural conservatives may not be as resourceful in finding ways to vote following the destruction of their homes and communities.

""I'm not sure a bunch of these folks who've had their homes and lives destroyed elsewhere in western North Carolina - in the mountains there - are going to be as easy to wrangle for the Trump campaign,"" the political commentator hypothesized.

""I don't know how that's all going to play out, but it's an unpredictable element in North Carolina that has made it, maybe a little more interesting,"" he mused.

Communities in North Carolina - which Axelrod noted is the second-most rural state in the country - were hit especially hard by the effects of Hurricane Helene. Catastrophic flooding has destroyed roads and bridges, cutting off communities from getting much-needed aid.

More than 70 people are now confirmed dead in North Carolina, and hundreds of people remain unaccounted for due to the lack of power and communication access.

As of Thursday, the death toll among the six states most affected by Helene - Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee - sits at 170. Disaster response teams fear that number will climb as they regain access to communities isolated by the storm.

This is why Kamala and Biden aren't helping, they benefit from the disaster.""

The Federalist editor-in-chief Mollie Hemingway commented, ""I fear that Axelrod's point is why Harris and Biden are letting these people drown.""

Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce slammed Axelrod over his take, asking, ""Did ya know that famous Democrat operative David Axelrod figures city Democrats are smarter and more resourceful and will figure out how to vote whereas the dumb Trump deplorables up in the mountains of NC who just lost everything, won't. Was he on the verge of a Kamala cackle?""

Reporter and commentator Drew Hernnadez stated, ""David Axelrod says Hurricane Helene victims in North Carolina that are Trump voters will have a hard time voting in the 2024 election. They hate you.""

A former North Carolina judge whose church is supporting relief efforts for those affected by Hurricane Helene told Fox News Digital there ""is a resounding faith"" among residents that ""God's still in control of this and that he will carry us through this.""

Judge Phil Ginn, a resident of Boone, said the Perkinsville Church in the western North Carolina town is one of several in the region stepping up in the wake of the devastating storm, which has so far left more than 230 dead and caused billions in property damage.

""We're housing people in our church. We've given up all of our Sunday school space to literally house people who are coming to work,"" said Ginn, president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary. ""And so our church had just seen fit to not only help our neighbors, but to help those who are coming here to help our neighbors by feeding them. We've got a shower trailer set up and washer and dryer to keep their clothes clean.""

Ginn described the storm as a ""generational event"" and said the recovery effort is going to be a ""marathon that's going to last for years."" However, he added that ""it's amazing to me to see God has come to us during the storm.""

SAMARITAN'S PURSE CONTINUES HELENE RELIEF EFFORTS WITH THREE WATER FILTRATION SYSTEMS IN NORTH CAROLINA

""There is a resounding faith among folks that I'm talking to out there that God's still in control of this and that he will carry us through this. And so we have that faith to lean into,"" Ginn told Fox News Digital. ""And it is stronger now than it ever was. The bond between us as human beings, as brothers and sisters, has really increased.""

The help seems to be coming more from local people than the federal government, Ginn said.

President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump have each made multiple trips to affected areas, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has committed $110 million in federal aid to Helene victims, the White House said Saturday.

Ginn said people are coming together to help each other regardless of their circumstances or backgrounds.

""Nobody's asking what your politics are. Nobody's asking what your faith is. Nobody's asking if you just got out of prison. There's nothing of that,"" he said. ""It's just if you need help, you're getting it from local people.""

GEORGIA MAN SHARES STORY OF SURVIVAL IN NORTH CAROLINA AFTER HURRICANE HELENE: 'INCREASED MY FAITH IN GOD'

Ginn's seminary, working alongside Samaritan's Purse and the North Carolina Baptist Men's Association, has established the SES Benevolence Fund for Hurricane Helene Relief, which is helping provide food, water, hygiene items, first aid kits and other essentials to those in need across four southeastern states.

""The great problem that we have right now is that virtually all of the damage was caused by water or mud, and none of that is covered by insurance. And so we've got families who were barely edging by with inflation and everything else, and now they've lost everything,"" Ginn told Fox News Digital.

""They've lost all their personal possessions. They can't live in their home. Their property is gone ... so it's going to be a mental health issue, and it's going to be an economic issue as well.

""It will never return to what it was,"" Ginn added. ""We have not only buildings gone and towns gone, but the land on which these buildings are set ... that's gone too. Rivers have changed courses.

Trump is set to appear at the site where he was nearly killed in a deadly July 13 shooting, with the Republican presidential nominee slated to speak at 5 p.m.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES OUTDOOR PENNSYLVANIA RALLY TO 'FINISH OUR SPEECH' AT SITE OF FIRST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Supporters decked out American flags and Trump slogans shared with Fox News Digital that Trump's return to the site was ""gutsy.""

""I think it's gutsy. It really shows strength to the people that he's here, and he's not hiding,"" 21-year-old River Jager, from Buffalo, Ohio, said.

""If anyone else got shot at, they would duck away,"" he said. ""Instead of running off, he got his composure and pulled himself together to show us he was all right.""

Father-daughter duo, 44-year-old Tom Bye and 19-year-old Brooke Bye, said that Trump's return proved that ""he's doing this for us,"" saying that his actions ""speaks volumes.""

""He's not afraid. He's doing it for us. He doesn't have to. He speaks for the people, the way people speak,"" Tom said. ""It speaks volumes, he's not going to run and hide.""

""He's coming back to show that he's strong,"" Brooke said.

The pair shared their hope for change under a Trump administration, saying that the ""country is going downhill.""

""If he doesn't become president now, this country is not going to be able to be saved,"" Tom said. ""It's time for a change.""

Brooke echoed her father's sentiment, citing the rise in illegal immigration as her top voting issue.

""It needs to be changed,"" she said. ""Things with our immigrant problem - things need to change.""

Friends Jody Cavalieri and Dena Diebold said that they drove three hours from Buffalo, New York to see Trump.

The pair commended Trump's bravery, saying that ""life was so much better under Trump.""

""Brave - for the country, for the people,"" Cavalieri said.

""Ditto,"" Diebold said, agreeing. ""God bless Trump.""

""Life was so much better under Trump,"" Cavalieri said. ""I want my kids to feel good about buying a house. My 24-year-old still lives at home, and it's not easy to get out and to get a mortgage. I want things to be better for our kids.""

""We felt safer when Trump was in office,"" Diebold said. ""There was peace around the world. Not so much right now.""

Dan Beasley, a real estate broker, said that the former president was ""very courageous"" to return.

""I think he's very courageous,"" he said. ""God has an explicit purpose for him. He's coming back to give that message.""

Trump's campaign said that the former president return to Butler would honor those lost in the assassination attempt during the rally.

Corey Comperatore, 50, was a firefighter and a father of two daughters. He ""historically sacrificed his life to shield his wife and daughters"" during the assassination attempt against Trump, the campaign said.

Trump will also recognize the two other Americans who were wounded by the shooter, David Dutch and James Copenhaver.

""He will express his deep gratitude to law enforcement and first responders, and thank the entire community for their outpouring of love and support in the wake of the attack,"" the campaign said.

Political commentator and Democratic strategist Ameshia Cross warned that Vice President Harris is facing warning signs among Arab and Muslim communities, especially in key battleground states like Michigan.

""It's very tenuous at this point,"" Cross said of Harris' support among the Arab community on CNN Friday. ""I think that what we saw over the summer and prior to that with the campus uprisings across the country, we heard from young people who are very concerned, but also saw that certain college presidents lost their jobs and we've seen the community over and over again, specifically the uncommitted vote, call out where President Biden as well as Vice President Harris are on this issue.""

Some Harris allies have also signaled concern at Harris' support in Michigan, with Democratic Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin telling donors that Harris is ""underwater"" with voters in Michigan, per audio obtained by Axios.

""I think that at this point there has to be especially a concern in Michigan because you have such a large population of Arab voters,"" she said.

""But in addition to that, we've seen this really affect younger voters and their preferences as well,"" Cross continued, also advising Harris that she should ""take a very clear stance on what will happen, how the U.S. will continue to move forward, are we in support of watching thousands of innocent Palestinians continue to die in this war?""

Harris received 48% of support among likely Michigan voters in a New York Times/Siena College poll this week, while Trump garnered 47% support in the poll -- effectively locking the pair in a tie well within the poll's margin of error.

Vice President Kamala Harris recently recorded an interview with the raunchy and often-sexually explicit ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, though she continues to play coy with traditional media outlets.

The Harris campaign confirmed that Harris sat down for the interview this past Tuesday where she focused on talking to audiences about abortion and reproductive rights issues. The interview is set to air sometime next week.

Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview comes as she has been criticized for not doing enough traditional news interviews since the start of her presidential campaign in late July.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS IN 'DANGER ZONE' AS AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT COUNTRY'S DIRECTION, SAYS CNN DATA GURU

So far, Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., have done a combined 24 interviews, a number which pales in comparison to the Trump-Vance ticket's combined 63 interviews in that same time frame.

Harris still has not held a formal press conference since replacing President Biden as the Democratic nominee, while Trump has held five since the beginning of September.

The ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, put on by SiriusXM, is hosted by Alex Cooper and reaches a massive, predominantly female audience. According to Spotify, it is ""the most-listened to podcast by women.""

The podcast is well-known for hosting explicit discussions about sex and women's health advice. Axios reported that the vice president's appearance on the podcast ""highlights her campaign's emphasis on appealing to women voters and younger audiences."" According to CNN, the podcast generally has ""a reputation for raunchy sex and relationship conversations.""

Former President Trump and his running mate JD Vance have done multiple interviews on major podcasts shows in recent months, trying to bring their messaging to younger audiences.

Trump recently sat down with podcaster and influencer Theo Von on his podcast and did a livestream with popular influencer Adin Ross that was conducted at the former president's Mar-a-Lago residence. Vance did an interview on the Full Send Podcast in August.

That Harris would opt for a sit-down with the sex-positive show generated some chatter on social media.

Kim Ward, R-Pa., discusses the 2024 election in key swing states on 'Fox Report.'

The former Pittsburgh Steelers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers star wide receiver announced in a post on X on Friday that he is looking to get Pennsylvania voters registered for the upcoming election. Brown also suggested that he would be making an in-person appearance at the Steelers game against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night to promote these efforts.

""Steeler Nation see you on Sunday at the game. Before then make sure to sign up to vote in this year's election,"" Brown wrote.

Brown even posted an alleged screenshot with Trump's running mate JD Vance, in which Vance expressed hope to meet the former NFL star soon.

As a former star with the Steelers, many of Brown's fans reside in western Pennsylvania and could cast critical votes in November.

Brown has been a vocal supporter of former president Trump throughout the current election cycle. The former football star said he would officially endorse Trump, back in May, during an interview with OutKick's Nick Adams, praising the former president's background and contributions to figures in the Hip-Hop industry.

""I've never met him. I've got admiration for his business moves and I study his dad, Fred Trump. But, I think Donald Trump is a good businessman and come[s] from a good family and has been a good president,"" Brown said. ""I think he does some great things for my brothers in the music industry in regards to Lil Wayne, Kodak [Black].""

In the days leading up to the 2020 presidential election, five-time Grammy Award winner Lil Wayne met with Trump at a Florida golf club. Just a few weeks after the meeting, Wayne was charged with felony gun possession. He proceeded to enter a guilty plea. At the time, the music star faced up to a decade in prison.

But Wayne's sentencing never happened, as the hip-hop artist was among the 143 pardons and commutations announced by the former president on his final day in office. On Jan. 21, 2021, Wayne thanked Trump for granting his pardon. Kodak Black was also pardoned by the former president just before he left office after the rapper was sentenced to almost four years in jail in 2019 for making a false statement to buy a firearm.

ANTONIO BROWN AVOIDS CHARGES IN FLORIDA FOLLOWING ALLEGED DOMESTIC DISPUTE

Attorney Bradford Cohen, who represents both Lil Wayne and Kodak Black, told Rolling Stone magazine: ""President Trump and his administration have been tireless advocates on behalf of the African-American community.

""These pardons are a perfect example of this administration following up on its reforms and commitments.""

Desiree Perez, the CEO of Jay-Z's entertainment company Roc Nation and Death Row Records co-founder Michael ""Harry O"" Harris, were also on the list of individuals who received pardons or commutations.

Brown, a controversial figure on social media, has frequently expressed his support for Trump in the form of memes and more straightforward political messaging on the former NFL star's social media platforms in recent years.

When Taylor Swift was seen hugging Brittany Mahomes at the U.S. Open in early September, Brown made a post on X that read, ""White People for Trump,"" referencing Mahomes being linked to displays of support for Trump on social media.

After the assassination attempt against Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in August, Brown commended the former president for his resilience.

""Cue up Many Men by 50 and we gonna win the presidency in a landslide F---ing Legend of the Decade,"" Brown wrote on X.

Brown's efforts to help Trump in Pennsylvania will be aiding one of the most important swing-state ground games of the entire election.

Pennsylvania is viewed by many as the biggest swing state of this cycle, as Trump won the state in 2016 to essentially clinch the presidency that year, but lost in 2020.

Trump will be returning to Butler on Saturday to give another rally, and billionaire tech mogul and X owner Elon Musk is expected to join the former president on stage.

""I will be there to support!"" Musk wrote on X late Thursday in response to an image Trump shared promoting the upcoming event.

The July results, conducted shortly after President Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris, but before she was conclusively the nominee, were deadlocked at 49% each. But even in March, when Biden was the presumed nominee, the contest was close to even.

Since July, Harris has widened her lead among women (by 9 points), nonwhite voters (+8), and voters under age 30 (+17). Her support has held steady among two other sources of strength: college graduates and urban voters. Ninety-two percent of Harris supporters are certain of their vote versus 86% of Trump supporters.

Trump's best groups include men, Whites without a college degree, independents and rural voters. He has nearly doubled his lead among men and the small group of independents since July."

MULTIPLE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS PUT ON LEAVE FOLLOWING TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Trump narrowly dodged death twice, once at an open-air rally outside Butler, Pennsylvania, in July and another at the Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach County, Florida, in September.

He first escaped a bullet that would have struck his skull if not for a fateful last-second turn. Instead, the bullet struck his ear, sending blood streaming down one side of his face as he dropped to the floor, surrounded by Secret Service agents as the threat - 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks - was neutralized.

His life was spared a second time when a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of a gun pointing through a fence and immediately opened fire, sending suspect Ryan Wesley Routh fleeing until he was apprehended shortly after.

Though his Secret Service detail now matches that of an incumbent president, both incidents ignited a flurry of concerns that the Republican candidate could still be in danger.

""He believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,"" he told Fox News Digital of Routh following the second apparent attempt on his life.

The New York Times Magazine's Ethicist columnist on Thursday answered a reader's question about whether it is appropriate to leave the country if the ""wrong"" candidate becomes president.

Without calling out former President Donald Trump by name, the reader, along with some friends have ""no doubt that the U.S. would fall to some form of authoritarianism if the wrong candidate were elected.""

""They, and I, are white, well educated, nonimmigrants and upper middle class, with a wide range of well-connected and financially stable friends,"" the reader said of themselves and their circle of friends. ""Our demographic backgrounds are relevant to my question, which is on the ethics of leaving a country because its democratic institutions are failing.""

""As members of some of the groups who most likely will retain many tangible privileges and are least likely to be negatively affected, do we have an ethical obligation to stay and help those who will be impacted more harshly than us, or is it ethically acceptable to leave the country? -- Name Withheld"" the question reads.

The headline for the advice column read: ""Is It OK to Leave the U.S. if the Wrong Candidate Becomes President?""

Ethicist columnist Kwame Anthony Appiah compared it to the G.K. Chesterton complaint that to say ""my country, right or wrong,"" was like saying ""my mother, drunk or sober.""

HUNTER BIDEN WORRIED HE'LL HAVE TO FLEE THE COUNTRY IF TRUMP WINS IN 2024: REPORT

""By my lights, though, when genuine patriots say 'my country, right or wrong,' they mean that it's their country whether or not they agree with what is done in its name,"" he wrote. ""That's the opposite of giving the country a free pass. It expresses a commitment to trying to help your country do what it should -- which is how we should normally feel about our families too.""

But, he argued that pride and shame in your country is about a concern for national honor and a shared responsibility for its fate.

""Leaving your country because you think it has gone off the rails isn't really consistent with this sense of shared responsibility or with a commitment to trying to make things better,"" he wrote.

While the columnist admitted ""skedaddling does strike me as unpatriotic,"" it ""doesn't mean patriotic self-sacrifice is a duty. If you're convinced that life here will be unbearable for you, you are morally free to go.""

Appiah said he didn't share the reader's concern that the U.S. was on the brink of authoritarianism as he grew up under civilian and military dictatorships in Ghana, where his dad was a political prisoner.

""But if I did believe what you believe, I confess that, as a patriot, I would want to stick around and join with others to help bring us back from disaster,"" he concluded.

The New York Times this week endorsed Kamala Harris for president and has endorsed every Democrat for president since John F. Kennedy in 1960.

Liberal celebrities have, for years, threatened to flee the country if Donald Trump was elected commander-in-chief.

Comedian Bill Maher called out the Hollywood stars in February over their previous vows to flee, but pointed out that they are ""still here.""

""And is it possible for a country to lose itself so much that leaving it is justified? Yes, but we're not there yet,"" Maher said. ""Not by a long shot. And we don't need quitters. We need people who will stay and fix it.""

""Maybe the problem isn't that America isn't worth defending. Maybe the problem is that lots of people today are entitled whiners who have no perspective and no idea how good they have it,"" he continued.

Maher recalled some of the celebrities who vowed they would leave the U.S. before Trump was elected president in 2016.

""Miley Cyrus once said 'I am moving if Trump is my president. I don't say things I don't mean,"" Maher said. ""Here she is looking miserable having to endure America at the Grammys last Sunday. I guess she flew back from Tajkisistan.""

""In 2016, Eddie Griffin said, 'If Trump wins I'm moving to Africa' - apparently very slowly because in Trump's four years, he only got as far as Van Nuys,"" he continued. ""George Lopez once said that if Trump won, he 'won't have to worry about immigration. We'll all go back.' George Lopez, still here. And it doesn't look like the migrant traffic is going back.""

Last month, Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen, said he would leave the U.S. in the event of a second Trump term for fear of political retaliation after he cooperated with investigations into his former boss, publicly testifying against him during Alvin Bragg's hush money trial and becoming a vocal critic.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance, as anticipated, easily won the vice-presidential debate Tuesday, October 1, on demeanor, facts, and analysis. But in fairness to a sometimes herky-jerky and nervous Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, he had the harder task of defending the temporary pseudo-conservative make-over of Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

His additional burdens were her co-culpability for the last three-and-a-half-years of the Biden disaster, and her unwillingness to implement her supposedly ""change"" agenda in the last months of her vice-presidential tenure.

The CBS News moderators, Nora O'Donnell, and, especially, Margaret Brennan, also as expected, ganged up on Vance. They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing from the last disastrous, and biased debate moderators.

EMHOFF DENIES REPORT HE SLAPPED EX-GIRLFRIEND OUTSIDE RITZY OVERSEAS MOVIE EVENT

The two moderators shamelessly broke their own rules by fact-checking (wrongly and solely) Vance. They ignored questions of the administration's tardy responses to Hurricane Helene, the Ukraine war, the recent Trump assassination attempts, or crime, while only briefly touching on Iran and a Middle East on the brink of total war. Instead, they concentrated, as also expected, on climate change, abortion, healthcare and childcare.

All were issues they thought might more easily embarrass Vance. And, of course, as also expected, the two ended the debate pressing Vance on January 6. And yet Vance again parried easily and won decisively. In doing so, he dispelled the smear that he was somehow ""mean,"" when, in fact, he proved calm and magnanimous as he methodically dissected Walz.

The nation perhaps learned that a confident Trump selected him to articulate his MAGA positions, and perhaps in a manner superior to Trump's own.

In contrast, an insecure Harris picked Walz. The vice president was assuming that he would not upstage her and perhaps, by his limitations, would make her look competent in comparison.

The debate will give some momentum to Trump-Vance in the last month of the campaign.

It follows the lethargic Biden-Harris reaction to Hurricane Helene, whose toll in human life and property had been initially and vastly ignored by the media.

It follows the growing specter of a theater-wide Middle East war, as a solitary Israel faces off against Iran and its appendages (all empowered after 2020 by Biden-Harris).

It follows the chaos of a longshoremen's strike intended to shut down the entire country. And it follows Harris's continued inability to survive even serial soft-ball interviews without her memorized and banal answers.

As a result, the slow, steady hemorrhaging of support for Harris-Walz will likely still continue in the last month of the election."
Conservatives joke Biden made Trump campaign ad by calling Harris a 'major player in everything' admin does,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/conservatives-joke-biden-made-trump-campaign-ad-calling-harris-major-player-everything-admin-does,2024-10-05T11:11:41Z,"President Biden touted the September jobs report and said that he may need to ask Congress for more money for Hurricane Helene disaster relief, Friday, Oct. 4, 2024, during a surprise White House press briefing appearance.

Many conservative commentators said Friday that President Biden tying Vice President Kamala Harris so closely to his administration's record is a boon to former President Trump's campaign.

For the first time, Biden made an appearance during a White House press briefing where he spoke briefly about the averted port workers strike, Friday's positive jobs numbers and announced that he may request additional money from Congress to fund Hurricane Helene relief efforts.

Biden was asked what role Harris has played amid numerous crises at home and abroad.

""Well, she's, I'm in constant contact with her. She's aware we all, we're singing from the same song sheet. We, she helped pass all the laws that are being employed,"" said Biden.

""Now, she was a major player in everything we've done, including passage of legislation which we were told we could never pass. And so she's been, and her, her staff is interlocked with mine in terms of all the things we're doing,"" Biden continued.

Fox News contributor Joe Concha mocked the statement by writing, ""Look ma. A campaign ad!""

""I'm Donald Trump and I approved this message,"" Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita joked.

CNN pundit Scott Jennings wrote, ""He is literally trying to destroy her campaign and it's just incredible.""

Biden's surprise media appearance occurred at almost the exact same time as Harris was speaking at a major event, causing networks to cut away from her to focus on the president instead.

""We were actually about to go live to Vice President Kamala Harris, who's speaking right now in Detroit, Michigan and apparently she's talking about this port strike ending,"" CNN host Boris Sanchez said on Friday.

Former President Trump on Friday said that Israel should attack Iran's nuclear facilities while mocking President Biden's answer earlier this week on the subject.

While speaking at a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, he said when Biden was asked about Israel attacking Iran, the president answered, ""'As long as they don't hit the nuclear stuff.' That's the thing you wanna hit, right? I said, 'I think he's got that one wrong. Isn't that what you're supposed to hit?'""

Trump went on to say that nuclear proliferation is the ""biggest risk we have.""

TRUMP SLAMS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE TO HURRICANE HELENE

The former president said he rebuilt the ""entire military, jets everything, I built it, including nuclear"" while he was president. ""I hated to build the nuclear, but I got to know firsthand the power of that stuff, and I'll tell you what: we have to be totally prepared. We have to be absolutely prepared.""

He said when Biden was asked about Israel and Iran: ""His answer should have been ""'Hit the nuclear first, worry about the rest later.'""

Trump made similar comments in an interview with Fox News on Thursday, telling correspondent Bill Melugin Biden's response on Israel attacking Iran was the ""craziest thing I've ever heard. That's the biggest risk we have. The biggest risk we have is nuclear.""

TRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISORS MOCK BIDEN'S WARNINGS TO ISRAEL TO STICK TO 'PROPORTIONAL' IRAN RESPONSE

He continued, ""I mean, to make the statement, 'Please leave their nuclear alone.' I would tell you that that's not the right answer. That was the craziest answer because, you know what? Soon, they're going to have nuclear weapons. And then you're going to have problems.""

Former deputy director of national intelligence Kash Patel, who served under Trump, said this week: ""Iran launched a war into Israel, so to say that the Israelis who are defending themselves and our hostages shouldn't attack sites in Iran that could kill them - especially when you're the one who gave Iran $7 billion as a commander in chief and then allowed them to acquire nuclear materials - is wildly political.""

Following Tuesday's attack by Iran on Israel, Biden told reporters at Joint Base Andrews, ""the answer is no,"" of Israel potentially targeting the country's nuclear program.

Fox News Digital spoke with residents just south of Houston, Texas this week about the economy and who they trust more between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to boost the economy as president.

After shopping at Costco, local residents expressed frustration with current overall costs and the economy as a whole, both on and off camera.

""All the prices have gone up,"" Melissa told Fox News Digital.

""No, it's not doing well at all,"" said another resident, originally from Egypt.

Ralph said the economy has resulted in increased costs for his family, stating, ""I think inflation is out of control. Housing and interest rates are out of control. Grocery trips have doubled. And a good grocery trip used to be like 150-125. Now an average grocery trip is now 250-300.""

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

Locals also shared who they feel will best handle the economy as president.

""When Trump was in office, you know, things were doing well,"" said Mark.

Ralph said he ""definitely"" trusts Trump more to tackle the economy.

""I don't think Kamala even knows what's going on. I think she's a puppet,"" he said. ""He's got a proven track record, hoping he gets back in and rescuing this Harris economy.""

Another resident also said she trusts the former president more: ""Trump, because he's the only businessman that's capable of running our country.""

Mark cited Trump's time in office compared to the current Biden-Harris administration as a reason for trusting the former president.

""Trump because of what he did the last time, who was in office and what the current administration, what's happened with the current administration over the past four years,"" he said. ""If it's not broke, don't fix it. You know, they tried to fix it. So here we are today.""

No Republican presidential candidate has lost Texas since 1976, but the state has become increasingly competitive in recent elections. Trump won it by less than six points in 2020, a sharp contrast from just 12 years ago when Mitt Romney carried the state by nearly 16.

The economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in the presidential election.

A September Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

While the nation's economic recovery from the pandemic continues, inflation remains a leading concern among Americans.

The former president's up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, and favored by 7 points in an ABC News Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only 5 points in the Fox News poll, and just 2 points in the AP/NORC survey.

Harris has touted what she calls the ""opportunity economy"" and said her administration will crack down on price gouging and also lower taxes for middle-class Americans. Trump has pointed to economic performance under his administration as successful and that a return to office would bring back those days.

As the presidential campaign enters the home stretch, it remains a margin-of-error race nationally and in the seven key battleground states likely to determine the winner of the election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump.

Both national party chairs are confident of their chances.

""We're playing offense right now,"" Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley said in a Fox News Digital interview earlier this week. ""We feel very, very good about the map.""

Since replacing President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in mid-July, Harris has enjoyed a wave of momentum and enjoyed a surge in fundraising. In the all-important cash dash, Harris and the DNC appear to hold a large advantage over Trump and the RNC.

And that's helped bolster what was already a very impressive ground game organizational advantage the Democrats held over the Republicans.

""We started laying the foundation well before 2024 by investing in our ground game,"" Harrison highlighted. ""We have been on the ground since the earliest days of this campaign getting our message out.""

The DNC chair touted that there are ""more than 312 coordinated offices across the battleground states,"" with ""over 2,000 coordinated staff...doing the hard work on the ground.""

But Whatley wasn't phased.

""The Democrats have a ton of money. The Democrats always have a ton of money,"" Whatley said, noting that Trump was outraised in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.

The RNC chair emphasized that ""we have the resources we need to get our message out to our voters and to every voter. I feel very, very comfortable about the campaign plan.""

And while the Harris campaign and allied groups have outspent Trump and his aligned groups in the ad wars, Whatley pointed to the former president's ability to capture free media.

""Donald Trump is out there talking every single day to the voters in a way that only he can. He can generate news. He can go out there and generate social media hits. He can communicate directly with the American voters like no other politician of our generation, so it's a huge advantage for us,"" he said.

Veteran Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducted the Fox News Poll along with longtime Republican pollster Daron Shaw, said with four weeks to go, ""my expectations of plausible outcomes range from a narrow Electoral College victory for Trump to a modestly more comfortable victory for Harris.""

TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE IN THE 2024 FUNDRAISING FIGHT WITH HARRIS

But while Harris holds a slight two-point edge in an average of the national surveys, Shaw noted that ""the issue profile of this election continues to favor Trump.""

Veteran political scientist and New England College president Wayne Lesperance said that ""this presidential contest is shaping up to be one of the closest in history, with the results likely to be slow-coming.""

And longtime Republican consultant Matt Gorman, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, highlighted that ""we're slated for the tightest race since 2000.""

""There are no more debates. There's going to be a vacuum of news,"" he said. ""It's integral the Trump campaign fill that vacuum with a message that puts Harris on the defensive.""

Trump, like Biden, is a well-known commodity.

But Harris, even after being in the spotlight for nearly two months, is still less well-defined.

""The more voters get to know Vice President Harris, the more they like her,"" Democratic strategist and communicator Chris Moyer argued.

""It's imperative that she continues to get in front of swing state voters, and she could afford to do more in the final weeks,"" he offered. ""She should barnstorm the key states, filling up her schedule with rallies and local interviews and off-the-record stops that produce shareable clips that bounce around social media. They've run a nearly perfect race to this point, but many voters still want to know more about who she is, what she believes, and what she will do as president.""

With one month to go, there's always the possibility of an October surprise that could rock the White House race.

The dockworkers strike earlier this week - which closed major ports - could have wreaked havoc on the nation's supply chain. It could have turned into an October surprise, but the strike was suspended after just two days.

Hurricane Helene, which tore a path of destruction through the southeast, also made an impact on the presidential contest - and there were memories of how Superstorm Sandy rocked the 2012 White House race between then-President Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney.

And the strife in the Middle East - between Israel, Iran, and Hezbollah, also threatens to upend the election.

It's important to note that while Election Day is a month away, in over two-dozen states, early in-person voting, absentee balloting, and voting by mail, are already underway."

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 76 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Trump has held six news conferences where he took questions from the media since the beginning of August, including another on Friday after meeting with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp about hurricane relief efforts.

President Biden also held a news conference in the White House press briefing room on Friday, where he joked about getting back into the 2024 race.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey last month at a star-studded campaign event. This week she taped an interview on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

MSNBC analyst Michael Steele lashed out at Democrats and the press for putting pressure on Vice President Kamala Harris to engage more with the media, arguing Harris was being unfairly treated compared to her 2024 opponent, former President Trump.

""I don't see Donald Trump doing sit-downs and press conferences with the mainstream media every week,"" Steele said during a Friday interview on MSNBC.

""So let's stop -- let's hold her to the same standard we're holding Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump is not giving you anything except a rally in which he dribbles and -- and nods off and just goes off on -- on tangents. And the press accepts that. And yet they look at her and say, 'Well, how come you're not, you know, giving us more of what we want?' Well, as soon as you get it from Donald Trump, she'll give it to you,"" the former RNC chairman continued.

Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, have sat down for at least 63 interviews since the Harris-Walz ticket was formed, compared to only 23 non-scripted interviews for the Democratic presidential ticket thus far.

DEMOCRATS WORRY ABOUT HARRIS' CAUTIOUS MEDIA APPROACH IN TIGHT 2024 RACE: 'VOTERS DESERVE BETTER'

Harris still has not held a formal press conference since replacing President Biden as the Democratic nominee, while Trump has held five since the beginning of September.

With just over a month to go until Election Day, some Democrats and media critics are warning the Harris-Walz campaign that their strategy could backfire with voters who are still uncertain about the Democratic candidate.

After the vice presidential debate last week, several media commentators argued Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, appeared unprepared because of his overall lack of media exposure on the national stage.

On MSNBC on Friday, host Chris Jansing asked Steele if Harris was being ""smart"" with her limited media approach this close to the election.

""Yes, yes, yes, a thousand times yes,"" Steele said, before dismissing these concerns.

""It's Democrats being Democrats and it's the mainstream media being the mainstream media. They want to be coddled. They want to show that they got the connection, they got the in,"" he said.

HARRIS LEADS TRUMP BY 2 IN NATIONAL POLL, BUT SHOWS VULNERABILITIES WITH NON-WHITE VOTERS

Steele argued that the vice president's campaign should not be compared to past presidential campaigns, because Harris emerged as the presidential nominee so late in the election cycle. He said she was being selective in her media appearances with the limited time left until election day.

""At the end of the day, you're talking 140 days to run a national presidential campaign. She's got to be particular with the targets. If she had an extra 400 days, everybody would get touched in the mainstream media and in the Democratic Party. This is not the Hillary campaign of 2016, this is not Joe Biden's campaign of 2020,"" he said.

""I think she's focused where she needs to be, and the Democrats need to stop acting like Democrats, get your behind on the ground, organize, turn out your vote. You need to overwhelm the ballot box on November 5, because that's the end game. And don't worry about a press conference today. You need to worry about how many voters you got turning out on November 5,"" he continued.

Harris campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz defended the campaign's media strategy in a statement to NBC News Friday.

""Our task for the final stretch of this campaign is ensuring that [Harris'] winning vision reaches the undecided voters who will decide this election in places and ways that will actually reach them. That may look different in today's evolving media environment than prior campaigns, but coupled with campaign events, aggressive organizing and a historic paid media campaign, it's a winning approach,"" Munoz said.

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits, a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station and an interview with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle."

President Joe Biden held the floor for an impromptu Q&A session Friday afternoon during the White House press briefing, where he claimed Vice President Kamala Harris is ""in constant contact."" His comments may not come across as music to the Harris campaign's ears.

In the president's surprise appearance, he remarked on the port strike, the latest jobs numbers, and briefly on Hurricane Helene. No reporters asked about the administration's response to the storm, but one asked Biden to assess whether Harris has been deeply involved in policy.

""Well, she's, I'm in constant contact with her. She's aware we all, we're singing from the same song sheet. We, she helped pass all the laws that are being employed,"" said Biden.

""Now, she was a major player in everything we've done, including passage of legislation which we were told we could never pass. And so she's been, and her, her staff is interlocked with mine in terms of all the things we're doing,"" Biden continued.

The president strongly linked Vice President Harris to the Biden administration's record over the past 3 ½ years, despite the Harris campaign's attempts to distance her from everything from ""Bidenomics"" to inflation to the border crisis, since Biden announced he was ending his reelection campaign, and Harris assumed the mantle of nominee.

Harris recently changed the Biden fiscal year 2025 plan from a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% on a salary of $1M or more to her own 28%, for example. As illegal migration across the border surged to historic levels, Harris has also insisted she was never in charge of Biden's border policy, despite Biden personally handing her the reins at the White House in March 2021.

Axios reported that Harris would begin creating some daylight between herself and Biden in August in order to defeat Trump, as inflation raged, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East heated up, the border crisis continued, crime lingered as a concern, and other factors, including Harris' own weak approval rating, weighed her campaign down. Other outlets and pundits on the left soon followed suit.

But Biden has reportedly bristled about his vice president distancing herself from him behind the scenes. He has also hinted that he believes he could have won the election had he not dropped out.

During an appearance on The View last week, Biden said, ""I never fully believed the assertions that somehow there was this overwhelming reluctance to my running again.

He also began his first White House briefing appearance of his presidency at the same Harris was taking the stage at a campaign event, raising questions over whether it was a communications issue between him and the campaign, or he was trying to upstage her.

Biden sparked questions on the topic before, on the anniversary of September 11, by wearing a Trump hat momentarily. The White House referred it to as a ""unity gesture"" - after Biden spent years casting Trump as a ""threat to democracy.""

The Harris campaign has further distanced itself from the Biden administration by mentioning him less and less often as the election nears. During Tuesday's Vice Presidential Debate, Harris' running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, only referred to the sitting president by referencing the ""Biden-Harris administration.""

A Rolling Stone reporter argued Friday that former President Trump wishes he could have ""death squads"" of police to shoot criminals and pile their bodies in the streets.

MSNBC host Jonathan Lemire interviewed Asawin Suebsaeng about a piece he wrote with fellow Rolling Stone senior politics reporter Tim Dickinson headlined, ""'American Death Squads': Inside Trump's Push to Make Police More Violent.""

Trump spoke about crime at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, this past Sunday, suggesting that a brief, decisive period of law enforcement could drastically reduce crime in America.

""One rough hour -- and I mean real rough -- the word will get out and it will end immediately, you know? It will end immediately,"" Trump said.

""So it wasn't just that Trump saw the film 'The Purge' on his flight there heading to that rally, there's some teeth to this proposal,"" Lemire said as he spoke to Suebsaeng about his piece. ""Tell us what you found.""

The Rolling Stone reporter said that this statement from Trump was ""definitely not a rhetorical one-off thing,"" and that ""he and his chief ideological lieutenants have shown over the years, including during his administration, including during this current campaign, that they want to back up with the full force of the Department of Justice, the executive branch, and the federal government.""

Suebsaeng claimed that according to insiders from the Trump White House, the former president had outbursts demanding crackdowns on criminals.

""During his presidency, there would be multiple times where, according to our sources, he would be doing things like banging his fist on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office and demanding that, 'Why aren't the police going around shooting all kinds of street criminals and drug dealers and piling up their bodies on American streets, so it can send a very grim message to gangs and all kinds of other suspected criminals in America?'"" the reporter claimed.

""He did this so often and so garrulously that there were some administration officials who referred to it to us as his 'American death squads' idea, which was something highly influenced by his admiration of what Rodrigo Duterte did in the Philippines,"" he added.

Suebsaeng then claimed that in late 2020, Trump ""toyed with the idea of pulling federal funding from different states and cities that were not sufficiently 'pro-cop' enough for his liking, or didn't let the police get away with enough degrees of abusive behavior or even alleged racial bias. He'd threaten to pull federal funding if they didn't do those things to his liking.""

He claimed further that Trump ""has talked to people recently about using pardon powers to excuse different officers, where people have been federally charged with things.""

""There's all kinds of things that his second administration would be planning with the Department of Justice, with the power of the executive branch, to try to make police in this country as cartoonishly violent as men like Donald Trump would like them to be,"" the Rolling Stone reporter said.

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung responded to Fox News Digital, ""President Trump has always been the law and order president and he continues to reiterate the importance of enforcing existing laws. Otherwise it's all-out anarchy, which is what Kamala Harris has created in some of these communities across America, especially during her time as California attorney general when she emboldened criminals. Now she has allowed criminals and terrorists cross the border unchecked, wreaking havoc throughout communities."""
"Harris campaign is in 'danger zone' as Americans worry about country's direction, says CNN data guru",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-campaign-danger-zone-americans-worry-countrys-direction,2024-10-04T22:06:56Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten noted on Friday that it would be unprecedented for Vice President Kamala Harris, representing the incumbent Democratic Party, to win the presidency considering so few Americans believe the country is on the ""right track,"" according to recent polling.

Enten pointed to polling showing that only 28% of Americans currently think America is on the right track and noted that this is close to the average rating when the party in power loses major elections.

""You're very much in the danger zone when we're looking at that right track, wrong direction number, that's where Democrats are right now,"" the data reporter declared.

CNN DATA GURU SAYS HARRIS STRUGGLING WITH 'UNDERPERFORMANCE' FROM YOUNG VOTERS AMID TAYLOR SWIFT ENDORSEMENT

Enten explained the predicament, noting both the historical average percentage of Americans who believe the country is on the right track when the incumbent party loses an election - 25% - and the average percentage in the same category when that party retains power via an election, which he revealed was 42%.

He spelled out to viewers that the current 28% right track number is much closer to the rate that is present when the incumbent loses.

Pointing to the numbers on screen, Enten said, ""Look at that. It's just 25%. That looks a heck of a lot like that 28%, right, that currently think the country's on the right track.""

He continued, ""When the White House party wins - i.e. Kamala Harris' party, the Democrats - 42% on average think that the country is on the right track. This 25% looks a lot more like this 28%. It doesn't look anything like this 42%.""

Summarizing the data, he declared, ""This to me is a bad sign for Kamala Harris' campaign. The bottom line is it looks a lot more like a loser than it does like a winner when it comes to the country being on the right track.""

CNN anchor John Berman asked if it was possible that the Democratic Party could win with these numbers, to which Enten cited the average ""right track"" rate during every election since 1980 in which the incumbent won.

His chart revealed that the lowest rate of Americans thinking the country was on the right track when an incumbent won in the modern era was in 1996, when 39% of voters thought the nation was moving in the right direction.

The other rates were at 41% or higher when incumbents won since 1980, the highest being 47% of the country thought it was on the right track when former President Ronald Reagan won re-election in 1984 by a landslide.

""There is no historical precedent for the White House party winning another term in the White House when just 28% of the country thinks that we're on the right track,"" he said, adding, ""John, simply put, it would be historically unprecedented.""

At Berman's urging, Enten mentioned a small hope for Democrats that the latest midterm elections could represent the country is in a new era in this regard, showing numbers revealing that the Democratic Party had a successful 2022 midterms even though only 26% thought the country was on the right track at the time.

""Maybe we've entered a new political environment where Donald Trump is so unpopular that these historical norms, these historical measures that we look at don't actually mean what we think anymore,"" he stated.

""I'll tell you this much, Kamala Harris better hope that's the case, because otherwise this right track, wrong direction situation will not work out in their favor."""
White House reporters ask zero questions about Hurricane Helene in surprise opportunity to press Biden,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/white-house-reporters-ask-zero-questions-about-hurricane-helene-surprise-opportunity-press-biden,2024-10-04T21:10:00Z,"President Biden touted the September jobs report and said that he may need to ask Congress for more money for Hurricane Helene disaster relief, Friday, Oct. 4, 2024, during a surprise White House press briefing appearance.

Reporters had a unique opportunity to question President Biden when he made a surprise appearance at the White House press briefing on Friday, but didn't ask about the historic disaster unfolding in the Southeast in the wake of Hurricane Helene.

It was the first time that Biden appeared at a White House press briefing since taking office. The president spoke briefly about the suspended port workers strike and Friday's positive jobs numbers, and he announced that he may request additional money from Congress to fund Hurricane Helene relief efforts. But there was no follow-up from the press on hurricane relief.

After thanking the president for his presence, the first reporter asked about Republicans casting doubt on his economic numbers, saying, ""Florida Sen. Marco Rubio described today's jobs report as having fake numbers. What do you make of that? And how worried are you that many Americans are hearing that the jobs numbers aren't real?""

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

The crisis in the Middle East was the biggest topic, with questions about Biden's comments about strikes on Iranian oil facilities, Israeli plans to retaliate, possible U.S. sanctions, and worries about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu trying to influence the U.S. election.

Election security and the peaceful transfer of power were also top of mind for reporters.

""The election is a month away. One, I'd like to know how you're feeling about how this election is going. And then also, do you have confidence that it will be a free and fair election and that it will be peaceful?"" one reporter asked. ""Are you making any preparations, getting security briefings related to domestic security?""

The only mention of Hurricane Helene, with a death toll topping 230, was in a question about Vice President Kamala Harris' role in the administration.

""There have obviously been a number of crises that the country has been facing over the past several days with the hurricane, with the port strike, with the situation in the Middle East. Can you talk about how your vice president, who is running for the presidency, has worked on these crises and what role she has played over the past several days?"" a reporter asked.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

The Biden-Harris administration has come under fire from former President Trump for the federal response to the devastation left by Helene, already one of the deadliest hurricanes this century.

The White House has pushed back hard against these criticisms, emphasizing that Biden has coordinated the federal response, including approving emergency declarations and deploying 1,000 active-duty soldiers to support search-and-rescue efforts. More than 4,800 personnel from FEMA and other agencies have been deployed to North Carolina and neighboring states impacted by Helene. Additionally, FEMA has shipped over 8.5 million meals, more than 7 million liters of water, 150 generators and over 220,000 tarps to aid response efforts, according to the White House.

As of Friday, the federal government has provided more than $45 million in Individual assistance to survivors affected by the storm, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, including in the form of one-time $750 payments from FEMA to qualified applicants in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.

Fox News Politics Newsletter: Harris' Heavy Hitter,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-politics-newsletter-harris-heavy-hitter,2024-10-04T21:01:11Z,"Welcome to the Fox News Politics newsletter, featuring the latest political news from Washington, D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail.

Former President Obama is preparing to hit the campaign trail next week for Vice President Harris, focusing on key battleground states in the lead up to Election Day, according to a senior campaign official with anonymity to discuss the matter.

Obama, who served back-to-back terms as president from 2009 through 2017, will kick off his drive in the Pittsburgh area of Pennsylvania on Thursday, a state which remains one of the tightest contests in the nation and which could tip the scales for either candidate.

A Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters last week found Harris narrowly ahead of Trump by 2 points (50-48%) among registered voters, while the race is tied at 49% each among likely voters. President Biden won the state by more than 80,000 votes in 2020.

President Obama's Senior Advisor Eric Schultz tells Fox News that the 44th president is determined to help Harris and other Democrats get elected.

""President Obama believes the stakes of this election could not be more consequential and that is why he is doing everything he can to help elect Vice President Harris, Governor Walz and Democrats across the country,"" Schultz said. ...Read More

""The View"" co-host Joy Behar urged Republican voters to put aside their party affiliation and vote for the Democratic Party just this one time to get rid of former President Trump.

Behar made the appeal during a conversation about former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney recently endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris' candidacy, asking other Republicans to join her in voting against Trump this election cycle.

""Just do it this one time. Do it this one time. Vote for the Democrat to save the country,"" she said.

WORKING CLASS WILL COME HOME TO HARRIS, RALLYGOERS IN POSTINDUSTRIAL PENNSYLVANIA SAY

Prior to Behar's appeal, ""The View"" panel discussed the individual Republicans, including co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin and Cheney, who are working to stop Trump's second term. Griffin, a former Trump aide, brought up her upcoming ""fireside chat"" she's doing in Pennsylvania alongside Cheney and former Trump staffers Cassidy Hutchinson and Sarah Matthews next week.

""I've never voted for a Democrat in my life,"" Griffin said. ""This man is so wholly unfit for office. And so, next week I'm traveling to battleground Pennsylvania with Liz Cheney and my friend Sarah Matthews and Cassidy Hutchison. And we're there with a nonpartisan group to talk about the threat that Donald Trump poses and why he should not be back in the White House.""

Griffin's comments prompted cheers from the audience and a wider conversation about how it's significant that conservatives like Cheney are aligning themselves with the Democratic Party this election cycle.

Co-host Sunny Hostin said, ""I certainly have been a Liz Cheney critic because, you know, she voted with Trump 93% of the time. But I have had a change of heart when it came to this, when I saw this, because I think it's brilliant that Kamala Harris is willing to have other voices in the room. I think it says a lot about the type of president that she would be.""

She then brought up how Harris pledged to have a Republican in her cabinet as president, which prompted the panel to wonder if that cabinet member could be Cheney.

Later, the topic of bipartisanship led to co-host Ana Navarro reminiscing about her own switch to voting Democrat after voting Republican her whole life. ""So I voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. It was the first time I voted for a Democrat and it was a very difficult thing to do, because when politics has been such a part of your profession, of your social circle, of your family life, it really is a very hard thing to do.""

""So I want us to recognize just how hard what she did is and Liz Cheney has been paying a price for standing on principle since January 6,"" Navarro declared."
Trump national security advisors mock Biden's warnings to Israel to stick to 'proportional' Iran response,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-israel-response-iran-trump,2024-10-04T19:26:57Z,"Fox News senior strategic analyst Jack Keane joined 'Fox & Friends'

A ""painful"" Israeli response weighs over the heads of the Iranian regime after their ballistic missile attacks on Tel Aviv on Tuesday.

President Joe Biden has insisted that an angry Israel should not strike Iran's nuclear sites - and should make sure its response is measured - proportional.

""Iran launched a war into Israel,"" said former deputy director of national intelligence Kash Patel.

""So to say that the Israelis who are defending themselves and our hostages shouldn't attack sites in Iran that could kill them - especially when you're the one who gave Iran $7 billion as a commander in chief and then allowed them to acquire nuclear materials - is wildly political.""

On Thursday, he revealed that he was ""discussing"" recommending Israel target Iran's energy facilities.

""That put the oil markets into a tailspin, even if we are talking to them about it. It's not something you muse about publicly,"" said former Trump deputy national security advisor Victoria Coates.

""If you've made a decision, and you have something to announce, fine. You want to level with the American people as much as you can. These random comments are really damaging and confusing to the Iranians, because . . . they don't have any guidelines or guardrails about what might be coming and so they might do something weird.""

IRAN'S AYATOLLAH KHAMEINI DEFENDS MISSILE ATTACKS ON ISRAEL

Israel's counterattack could come at any moment. ""We will act. Iran will soon feel the consequences of their actions. The response will be painful,"" Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters.

Rather than its longtime goal of helping to negotiate a ceasefire, the Biden administration has now shifted its priority to containment - helping the region avoid all-out war between its two hegemonic superpowers.

""This is the 1930s all over again. G7 leaders - led by President Biden - are urging Israel to have a proportional and limited response against the Iranian regime,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital.

""The idea of telling Israel what targets to strike ignores reality,"" he went on. ""Would a proportional response be launching 200 ballistic missiles from Israel into Iran, mimicking what the Iranians did to Israel?""

Former President Donald Trump has not said how Israel should respond to the attacks - which he insists never would have happened under his watch.

Striking Iran's nuclear facilities risks provoking all-out war on yet another front for Israel in the eyes of the Biden administration. The Trump team is caught between an anti-war mindset and a penchant for supporting Israel without conditions. It's unclear whether they still believe the two can exist in harmony.

Proportionality is ""clearly not what Israel is doing,"" according to Coates.

""It really seems to me that after the Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu] left Washington in July, after that visit, some factor, or combination of factors, really changed his calculus,"" she said.

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

""He appears to have gotten home with the attitude of, 'I want to get everything I can get done before the election.' He's not really listening to the White House at all, which is unfortunate.""

After Iranian plots to assassinate him and the hacking of his campaign, Trump did say that if he were president, he would tell Iran, ""I'm going to blow you to smithereens"" if they harm any U.S. political figures.

On Tuesday, Trump was asked whether he wished he had responded more forcefully after Iran fired dozens of missiles at U.S. forces stationed in Iraq in 2020, leaving many with traumatic brain injuries.

""So, first of all, 'injured.' What does 'injured' mean? 'Injured' means -- you mean, because they had a headache? Because the bombs never hit the fort,"" Trump said.

""So just so you understand, there was nobody ever tougher on Iraq,"" Trump continued, saying 'Iraq' instead of 'Iran.' ""When you say not tough, they had no money. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. And when we hit them, they hit us. And they called us, and they said, 'We're going to shoot at your fort, but we're not going to hit it.'""

Defense officials have said more than 100 suffered traumatic brain injuries after the January 2020 attack.

That attack came after Trump ordered the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani due to an uncovered Iranian plot to kill American diplomats and service members.

Trump vowed to hit 52 Iranian sites ""very hard"" if Iran were to carry out the plot, representing the 52 Americans held hostage in Iran for 444 days after being seized at the U.S. embassy in Tehran in November 1979.

Still, in January, Iran lobbed attacks on two Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops, including the Ain al-Assad military base, and a second facility near Erbil airport.

In March, three U.S.-led coalition forces were killed when multiple rockets hit Taji military base.

Trump, who withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, has insisted to reporters this week that ""nobody [was] ever tougher on Iran"" than he was.

'Look at the World today -- Look at the missiles flying right now in the Middle East, look at what's happening with Russia/Ukraine, look at Inflation destroying the World. NONE OF THIS HAPPENED WHILE I WAS PRESIDENT!' he wrote on Truth Social.

Alexander Vindman, the former Trump National Security Council Director for European Affairs for the United States, claimed that the former president was ""fearful"" of escalation with Iran.

""Iran struck first and early, during Trump's presidency, attacking US troops. Trump consistently recoiled in fear inviting further attacks,"" he wrote on X.

""Fact check: In 2020, Iran fired ballistic missiles at U.S. forces in retaliation for the Soleimani assassination. 110 U.S. service members sustained traumatic brain injuries. Many administration officials remain on an Iranian hit list today,"" former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.

But Patel argued the Biden administration's lifting of sanctions on Iran -- and the Obama administration's 2015 nuclear deal -- is what led to the attacks in the first place.

""The JCPOA, which was called the 'Iran nuclear deal' for a reason. It was never intended to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon. It literally gave them one on a timeline,"" he said.

""Now I believe they have one, because for four years they haven't stopped them or slowed them down. They've only been successful in politicizing national security."""

President Biden entered the White House briefing room on Friday to audible gasps from reporters as he unexpectedly took the podium and fielded questions.

It was the first time that Biden, 81, made an appearance during a White House press briefing since he assumed office in 2021. The president spoke briefly about the averted port workers strike, Friday's positive jobs numbers and announced that he may request additional money from Congress to fund Hurricane Helene relief efforts.

""We're going to have to deal with unforeseen cost what this hurricane is going to cost. It's going to cost a lot of money and I'm probably going to have to ask the Congress before we leave for more money to deal with some of those problems,"" Biden said.

The Biden-Harris administration has come under fire from former President Trump for a purportedly inadequate response to the devastation left by Helene. The death toll in southeastern states hit hardest by the storm has risen past 215, with more than 100 dead in western North Carolina alone.

Biden's surprise in-person appearance in the White House briefing room comes after an Axios report highlighted his absence from public view in the final months of his presidency.

Axios reported Thursday that Biden had not scheduled a public event in 43 of the 75 days since he dropped out of the 2024 presidential election. He has participated in just one campaign event with Vice President Kamala Harris, who succeeded him as the Democratic nominee.

Critics, including many Republicans, have questioned whether Biden is able to handle the pressures of the presidency at his advanced age, noting that most of his public appearances are scheduled between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. The president has also only given two interviews since July 21.

White House spokesman Andrew Bates waved off criticism of Biden's public schedule as part of the White House's media strategy in a statement to Axios.

""Being commander-in-chief is about far more than public events, which are scheduled at strategic times to reach the most Americans possible, like before 20 million Americans watch the national evening news,"" Bates told the outlet.

He added the president ""works around the clock, long before and after these times, as the historic results he continues to achieve weekly for the American people demonstrate."""
Biden admin won't extend parole for Venezuelan migrants in US via controversial flight program: report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-wont-extend-parole-venezuelan-migrants-us-via-controversial-flight-program-report,2024-10-04T19:12:32Z,"Economist Steve Moore comments on the border crisis and illegal immigration on 'Fox Report.'

The Biden administration has reportedly decided against extending parole for tens of thousands of Venezuelan migrants who came to the U.S. through a controversial Biden-era travel program that was temporarily halted due to discoveries of fraud in the program earlier this year.

Officials have decided not to extend parole for Venezuelan nationals who came into the U.S. via the parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans (CHNV), according to a CBS News report.

The program was first implemented for Venezuelans in October 2022 and extended to the other nationalities in January 2023. It allows migrants to use the CBP One app to enter the U.S. on temporary parole and receive a work permit if they pass background checks and have a sponsor.

NEW POLL REVEALS TRUMP HAS SIGNIFICANT LEAD ON IMMIGRATION, BORDER SECURITY IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE

Through the end of August 2024, nearly 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans arrived lawfully on commercial flights and were granted parole under these processes, nearly 117,000 Venezuelans.

The program has received furious opposition from Republicans, some of whom have described the administration as running migrant flights, but under this program, migrants must organize their own travel.

However, the program was paused briefly in August when an internal report unearthed large amounts of fraud in applications of those sponsoring the program. It later unfroze the program after installing what it said were additional vetting and protections against fraud.

BIDEN ADMIN FREEZES CONTROVERSIAL MIGRANT FLIGHT PROGRAM AFTER FRAUD REVELATIONS

It was expected that the administration would extend the parole status, as it has done with other parole populations, but CBS reported that DHS has decided against it, and Venezuelans would be told to either apply for another immigration status or leave the country -- although Venezuela is currently not accepting deportations from the U.S. It is also unclear if the administration intends to stop bringing in new migrants via the program. DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

If they arrived before July 2023, they may be eligible for Temporary Protected Status, which the Biden administration redesignated and extended for Venezuelans last year.

The status of the other three nationalities will begin to expire in January next year if the administration makes a similar decision not to extend their parole status.

The move will likely infuriate immigration activists, who have cried foul as the administration has moved away from more liberal policies as the election approaches. The administration threw its weight behind a bipartisan border security bill this year that would have allowed for a limit to be placed on asylum entries and given additional funding to border agencies.

DHS DOCS REVEAL WHERE PAROLED MIGRANTS UNDER CONTROVERSIAL BIDEN FLIGHT PROGRAM ARE LANDING

When that bill failed to pass, President Biden signed an order limiting asylum entries in June, which was followed by a sharp drop in arrivals at the border by more than 50%, leading to numbers lower than anything during the current administration.

The administration has also touted an increase in removals. Biden followed that up with a ""parole in place"" scheme for illegal immigrant spouses of U.S. citizens. But in the last week, he announced new measures to prevent that limit on arrivals at the border from being lifted.

It comes as Vice President Harris battles with former President Donald Trump over who is the tougher candidate on border security. Harris has accused Trump of failing to back the border security bill for political reasons, while Trump has accused Harris of being responsible for the crisis at the border.

"Taiwanese people ready to fight as China ramps up aggression, ambassador says",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/taiwanese-people-ready-fight-china-ramps-up-aggression-ambassador-says,2024-10-04T19:08:40Z,"Fox News' Aishah Hasnie speaks exclusively with Taiwan Amb. Alexander Yui on the impact of the U.S. election.

Taiwan's top official in the U.S. is warning that China has ramped up its aggression toward the island, and that its people are ready to fight.

""Yes, of course,"" Alexander Yui, the Taiwanese representative to the U.S., told Fox News' Aishah Hasnie when asked whether the island's residents were willing to meet the moment, if China were to invade. ""We've seen Ukraine.""

Taiwan has been intensely watching the conflict in Eastern Europe as Kyiv's forces have battled a Russian invasion for more than two years.

Yui said he hoped to not need help from U.S. troops, which Ukraine also does not have, but suggested they would be eagerly accepted if offered.

""If your house is under fire, and they respond to help you with a bucket of water, would you say no?"" Yui posed.

The diplomat said Chinese President Xi Jinping has escalated regional tensions since former President Donald Trump left office, but he stopped short of blaming the Biden administration for emboldening China.

""XI Jinping has been emboldened because he wants to realize what he calls his China dream,"" Yui said. ""It's not about which administration is in the United States . . . but rather, what are the thoughts of Xi Jinping?""

Taiwan's ministry of defense tracked eight Chinese military aircraft and two naval ships near the island earlier this week. The defense ministry said four of the eight planes crossed the median line dividing China and Taiwan's territory in the Taiwan Strait - though Beijing, which claims ownership of Taiwan, does not recognize the geographic delineation.

A week prior, on Sept. 25, Taiwan's defense ministry said it had detected 43 Chinese military aircraft in a 24-hour period, with 34 having crossed the median line. The next day saw 41 Chinese military planes detected near Taiwan.

Asked if he had a message for Americans about Taiwan ahead of Election Day, Yui said it was a ""peace-loving nation.""

My friend Melania Trump is finally telling her story. Let's take a moment to hear her out,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/my-friend-melania-trump-finally-telling-her-story-lets-take-moment-hear-her-out,2024-10-04T19:04:01Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

After two decades of friendship, and as someone who had the honor to serve on Mrs. Trump's White House team for a time, I am excited that the former first lady is finally telling her story in her forthcoming book, ""Melania."" For this reason, I can no longer remain silent as many self-proclaimed ""experts"" continue to opine on her thoughts, her statements and her actions -- especially when many of them have obvious malice in their hearts and money on their minds.

The hate-Trump media industrial complex is largely a money-making endeavor attracting many longing to remain relevant, become famous, advance personal agendas, or cash in while they can.

Mrs. Trump's response to all of this -- she ignores all but the most egregious attacks -- is not surprising to those who truly know her as a woman of tremendous strength, grace and resilience, a loving and devoted mother, wife, daughter and friend.

MELANIA TRUMP OPENS UP ON RELATIONSHIP WITH HUSBAND, WHAT PREPARED HER TO BECOME FIRST LADY

Their vitriol is only likely to reach a more fevered pitch in coming days, ahead of the Oct. 8 release of Mrs. Trump's memoir, ""Melania."" Yet I remain hopeful that, with the book's publication, the public will finally have a chance to learn her story, firsthand, and come to understand the remarkable woman I am so fortunate to call my friend.

In my role as one of Mrs. Trump's advisers in the White House, I was in many of the rooms and witnessed many of the moments that have since been drastically recast in books, tweets and interviews by former staffers -- and I am aghast at the disparity between the truth I witnessed and the skewed narrative that is widely promoted.

Consider the ongoing rants of one of her former staffers, and self-proclaimed close friend, who has since worked indefatigably to promote herself while bashing Melania. After her contract with the White House was terminated, (full disclosure: my contract with the White House was also terminated at the same time) she wrote a one-sided book about her former boss. She admitted to secretly taping personal phone calls with Mrs. Trump, who was first lady at the time. An unprecedented breach of trust and civility if not ethics.

MELANIA TRUMP ON WHY THE 2024 ELECTION IS DIFFERENT: 'WE ARE DEALING WITH MUCH MORE DANGER'

Further, after leaving the White House, she began her campaign to criticize Mrs. Trump at every turn, apparently not only to sell her book but also to settle imagined personal scores. Like other former Trumpians, she apparently was positioning herself to be the go-to expert about a woman to whom she has not spoken now in more than seven years.

Examine her ongoing hateful tweets, such as opining about why Melania was not on the campaign trail with her husband last fall. When Mrs. Trump told reporters to ""Stay tuned"" about her plans to campaign, this former staffer predictably chimed in with a supposedly all-knowing tweet: ""Let me interpret this for you: DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATHE! [sic]""

How, exactly, would she know that -- or anything else about the former first lady? She was clearly so far out of the loop that she was unaware that Mrs. Trump was caring for her dying mother at the time. So much for expertise.

MELANIA TRUMP OPENS UP AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS ON HER HUSBAND: SURVIVING BOTH WERE 'REALLY MIRACLES'

Then there is Mrs. Trump's onetime White House press secretary, who also appears to be competing to become the Left's Melania expert. This, after writing a self-aggrandizing book that attacked her former boss while auditioning for the never-Trump ""conservative"" seat on ABC's ""The View.""

This former ""insider"" is the same person who, embarrassingly, could not correctly explain to reporters in 2018 why the first lady wore a now-famous Zara designer jacket with its bold logo -- ""I Really Don't Care, Do U?"" -- on a flight to visit migrant children detained at the Texas border. This press secretary told reporters: ""It's just a jacket. There was no hidden message.""

How did she not know that the first lady was intentionally signaling to her critics with that jacket and not referring to the children? And if she had no understanding of Mrs. Trump then, while working for her, how can she possibly be considered an expert on her now when she has had no access to Mrs. Trump in years?

It took the former first lady herself to clear up the confusion and repair the damage. Melania told an ABC News interviewer that the jacket was ""kind of a message, yes,"" but one directed at her critics: ""I want to show them that I don't care. You could criticize whatever you want to say, but it will not stop me to do what I feel is right.""

Sadly, we have rarely seen any positive reporting on Melania's achievements because Mrs. Trump has seldom been recognized or credited for the important initiatives she undertook and supported during her four years as First Lady and in the years since.

As first lady, she worked to focus attention on the opioid crisis and its toll on families when visiting Lily's Place, a treatment center in Huntington, W.Va. She championed ""Be Best,"" her campaign which aimed at building children's wellness and emotional intelligence in education which included her work against cyber-bullying in schools.

Since leaving the White House, she has created ""Fostering the Future,"" to raise college scholarship funding for former foster children. Since its inception, ""Fostering the Future"" has given out scholarships to many students. You have probably heard little about it.

TRUMP SPEAKS WITH ELON MUSK ABOUT MAKING STARLINK AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE POST-HURRICANE HELENE

Musk, a celebrity business magnate who has endorsed the Republican presidential hopeful during the 2024 election cycle, is slated to attend a Trump campaign rally on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, where the former president was nearly assassinated in July.

""I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,"" Musk tweeted in July on the heels of the shocking attempt on the prominent politician's life.

In a press release last week, the Trump campaign noted, ""President Donald J. Trump will return to Butler, Pennsylvania to hold a rally on the very same ground where he came within a quarter of an inch of losing his life less than three months ago.""

In addition to backing Trump, Musk has been a vociferous critic of the Democratic Party.

In a post last month he asserted, ""The reason the Democratic Party is so soft on criminals is that criminals vote overwhelmingly Democrat - they don't want to offend their customers!"" Musk continued, claiming that the ""Democrat Party is literally the party of criminals.""

Democrats are warning Vice President Kamala Harris that she needs to ramp up her engagement with voters and the media or it could cost her the election.

Harris is neck-and-neck with former President Trump in the 2024 race, according to national polls. While Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, have stepped up their interviews in recent weeks, she has also faced criticism from media critics for being evasive, even in interviews with friendly liberal outlets like MSNBC.

""Ms. Harris responded to the fairly basic and predictable questions with roundabout responses that did not provide a substantive answer,"" The New York Times reported after Harris' interview with MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle last month.

According to a Friday report from NBC News, some Democrats are worried the Harris campaign's media strategy won't help win over undecided voters who have yet to warm up to the Democratic presidential candidate.

75 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS YET TO DO FORMAL PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE EMERGING AS DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

""They're trying to keep her away,"" Steve Shurtleff, former Democratic speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, told NBC News of the Harris campaign. ""It's like seeing your favorite Hollywood actor, and then they're on a talk show and they can't even speak.""

""The President of the United States has to be able to be on their toes all the time and answer questions,"" he continued. ""It's so obvious she's been avoiding the one-on-one interviews, and the voters deserve better.""

Other Democrats in the report said that the Harris campaign's approach of avoiding the media was a risky strategy in such a tight race.

""The campaign is taking a chance that they can run out the clock and Trump's weaknesses will be enough to win,"" Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist told NBC. ""But the danger in that is if you don't define your own candidacy well enough, people will start defining it themselves.""

HARRIS LEADS TRUMP BY 2 IN NATIONAL POLL, BUT SHOWS VULNERABILITIES WITH NON-WHITE VOTERS

""It's been a mistake to shield Walz and Harris from interviews,"" a Democratic lawmaker also told NBC. ""It's like playing basketball -- if you don't play for weeks, you're not going to get it into a game and do well. You've got to be on the court...I would have them out there very extensively.""

Harris campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement to NBC, ""Our task for the final stretch of this campaign is ensuring that [Harris'] winning vision reaches the undecided voters who will decide this election in places and ways that will actually reach them. That may look different in today's evolving media environment than prior campaigns, but coupled with campaign events, aggressive organizing and a historic paid media campaign, it's a winning approach.""

It's uncertain if this strategy will convince undecided voters to support Harris.

According to the latest Fox News poll of voters in Pennsylvania, Harris retains a narrow edge over Trump among registered voters and the race is tied among likely voters in the battleground state.

"Trump can win on these 3 key issues, Michigan voters tell Fox",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-can-win-three-key-issues-michigan-voters-tell-fox,2024-10-04T17:40:00Z,"Trump supporters in Saginaw, Michigan, told Fox News Digital the top issues Trump should hit as he seeks to win the critical swing state.

Michigan voters attending former President Donald Trump's Saginaw rally Thursday told Fox News Digital that the former president needs to focus on the economy to win the critical swing state, particularly job creation and curbing inflation.

""Opening up the pipelines to get the jobs back,"" one voter who attended Trump's rally on the campus of Saginaw Valley State University said when asked which issue the former president needs to focus on to win Michigan.

The comments come as Trump made yet another visit to the crucial swing state of Michigan, a state that could play a decisive role in determining who wins November's election. It also marked the second time the former president visited mid-Michigan in just a few weeks, a blue collar area of the state where the campaign believes it can make inroads with voters in what promises to be a close race.

TRUMP'S 2ND TERM FOREIGN POLICY LIKELY TO FOCUS ON 'STRENGTH' AND 'DETERRENCE': EXPERT

Vice President Kamala Harris is set to visit the same area of the state Friday, signifying the importance of Michigan as the clock nears the end of a dramatic election season.

Polls show Michigan as a toss up as of Wednesday, with the Real Clear Politics Polling average giving Harris a thin lead of just 0.7 points in the state. However, polls also showed Trump trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Biden in Michigan by 5.3 and 5.7 points respectively, numbers that turned out much more favorable to Trump on election day.

Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016 before dropping it to Biden in another close race in 2020, but voters in mid-Michigan believe Trump's focus on the economy should help put him over the top in 2024.

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

""Bring inflation down and safety and security in the state of Michigan,"" one voter told Fox News Digital.

""Illegal border crossings and the economy,"" another voter said. ""Keeping jobs in America, lowering inflation.""

However, other voters signaled that Trump could win on a range of issues, including national security and reducing crime in inner cities.

""Our national security does come first. But if the people at home, if they can't make ends meet, they're living in misery, that's just as important,"" a voter told Fox News Digital. ""Being truthful to the American people, which he has been.""

""Focusing on the inner cities. Putting together ways to decrease the violence,"" another voter said.

Meanwhile, one voter who said she was at the rally to support Trump said that the former president could lead the charge in helping Michigan residents see the issue of abortion differently.

""I think one of the bigger things to look at has been abortion... Michigan has been one of the stronger states in supporting that,"" the voter told Fox News Digital. ""He can do a very good job in getting us to just see the value of life."""

Taiwan's de facto U.S. ambassador is warning that China, Iran and Russia are forming an ""alliance"" that the rest of the world should be ready for.

It comes days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the three autocratic countries were working together but not an ""axis,"" as they have so often recently been called.

""They're working together, that's for sure, whether that's an axis or an alliance"" Alexander Yui, Taiwan's representative to the U.S., told Fox News this week.

""And as you know, it's up to anyone to define it. But there were certainly there are symptoms, signs that they're working together.""

BIDEN ADDRESSES UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR LAST TIME AS DICTATORS, DESPOTS COME TO NEW YORK

During the interview, Yui also suggested that Taiwan's government was in touch with both Vice President Harris and former President Trump's circles to be prepared for whatever comes next in U.S. relations.

""The whole world is watching, and I'm sure the diplomatic community here in Washington, D.C., is also watching closely and [trying] to reach out to both candidates or to the people around the candidates,"" Yui said.

Blinken penned an op-ed in Foreign Affairs Magazine on Oct. 1 that said world powers were in competition to set the stage for a ""new age"" of international relations.

""A small number of countries -- principally Russia, with the partnership of Iran and North Korea, as well as China -- are determined to alter the foundational principles of the international system. While their forms of governance, ideologies, interests, and capabilities differ, these revisionist powers all want to entrench autocratic rule at home and assert spheres of influence abroad,"" the Biden administration official wrote.

""While these countries are not an axis, and the administration has been clear that it does not seek bloc confrontation, choices these revisionist powers are making mean we need to act decisively to prevent that outcome.""

Melania Trump's pro-choice stand isn't that different from other Republican first ladies,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trumps-pro-choice-stand-isnt-different-from-other-republican-first-ladies,2024-10-04T17:11:57Z,"Former first lady Melania Trump opens up about her life before, during and after the White House in a sit-down interview on 'Fox & Friends.'

Melania Trump is not the only first lady to express pro-choice views. She joins several former Republican first ladies who have shared similar perspectives, often in their memoirs, despite this stance historically contrasting with the GOP platform.

Other spouses of Republican presidents, such as Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush, have been recorded either during or after their husbands' tenure in office expressing pro-choice views.

""I feel very strongly that it was the best thing in the world when the Supreme Court voted to legalize abortion and, in my words, bring it out of the backwoods and put it in the hospital where it belongs,"" Betty Ford said in a CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" interview in 1975, two years after Roe v. Wade was handed down.

MELANIA TRUMP'S ABORTION VIEWS IN NEW MEMOIR SPUR OUTRAGE FROM PRO-LIFERS: 'SHE IS WRONG'

Following Ford's comments on premarital sex, marijuana and abortion during the CBS interview, then-President Gerald Ford reportedly joked that she had cost him votes.

As a more conservative first lady, Nancy Reagan avoided taking a public stance against abortion that would put her at odds with former President Ronald Reagan. However, she later revealed her personal position on the issue.

""I'm against abortion, I don't believe in abortion,"" Reagan said at George Washington University in 1994, five years after her husband left the Oval Office. ""On the other hand, I believe in a woman's choice. So, it puts me somewhere in the middle, but I don't know what you'd call that.""

Barbara Bush, former President George H. W. Bush's wife, was more reserved in her public statements about abortion and was at odds with her husband's anti-abortion stance. While she was not as outspoken as Betty Ford, she wrote in her 1994 memoir, ""I hate abortions, but I just could not make that choice for someone else.""

Former first lady Laura Bush, wife of former President George W. Bush and daughter-in-law to Barbara Bush, also differed with the former Presidents Bush on abortion.

""I think it's important that it remain legal, because I think it's important for people for medical reasons and other reasons,"" she said in an interview with Larry King Live in 2010.

Pat Nixon, then-President Richard Nixon's wife, told reporters during a 1972 press conference - as Roe v. Wade arguments were being considered by the Supreme Court - that she supported the right to choose an abortion, but opposed ""wholesale abortion on demand.""

Trump, wife of Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump, wrote the memoir entitled ""Melania"" that is scheduled to come out on Oct. 8, per the Amazon release date. In the book, according to a preview by The Guardian, she expresses a viewpoint closely aligned with that of former first ladies before her.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Trump reportedly wrote.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

The former first lady drew criticism from pro-life advocates on social media after the excerpts were published just a month away from Election Day. This year, the Republican Party's official platform also softened its language on abortion, as former President Trump also said he would not support a federal abortion ban."
CNN legal analyst says Special Counsel Jack Smith bent rules to get 'cheap shot' in on Trump before election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-legal-analyst-says-special-counsel-jack-smith-bent-rules-get-cheap-shot-trump-before-election,2024-10-04T17:01:18Z,"Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett on a judge unsealing a key filing in Special Counsel Jack Smith's election case against former President Trump.

Special counsel Jack Smith ""bent ordinary procedure"" to kneecap former President Trump after he failed to try the candidate before the November election, a legal analyst argued in a piece for New York Magazine.

In Thursday's ""Jack Smith's October Cheap Shot"" essay, CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig analyzed Smith's decision to drop a 165-page federal court filing related to the issue of Trump's immunity from prosecution.

According to Honig, Smith successfully received permission from Judge Tanya Chutkan to file a 180-page long brief -- four times the normal maximum.

Honig noted that Chutkan now claims she does not care about the upcoming election despite earlier efforts to expedite Trump's immunity and get it in before November 5. After redacting several names, she complied with Smith's request and made the rest of the brief public.

5 KEY DETAILS IN SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH'S TRUMP ELECTION CASE FILING

""The larger, if less obvious, headline is that Smith has essentially abandoned any pretense; he'll bend any rule, switch up on any practice -- so long as he gets to chip away at Trump's electoral prospects. At this point, there's simply no defending Smith's conduct on any sort of principled or institutional basis,"" Honig wrote.

He added that Smith's ""unprincipled, norm-breaking practice"" is neither a response nor an excuse to suggestions that voters should have the utmost information about presidential candidates before they cast their ballot.

In standard criminal procedure and under federal rules, a prosecutor first files an indictment, the defense makes a motion and then the prosecution responds to said motions. However, Honig said Smith turned these rules ""on their head"" when he asked Chutkan to file without a pending defense motion.

""Trump's team objected, and the judge acknowledged that Smith's request to file first was 'procedurally irregular' -- moments before she ruled in Smith's favor, as she's done at virtually every consequential turn,"" Honig continued.

PROSECUTORS REQUEST INDEFINITE DELAY IN TRIAL FOR TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT RYAN ROUTH

He stressed that Smith's proactive filing is ""prejudicial"" to Trump in the legal and political sense, but also ironic because Smith previously complained that Trump's words might taint the jury pool for the case.

Now, Smith is using grand-jury testimony, which often remains hidden at this stage of a case, and has drafted a massive document that ""contains all manner of damaging statements about a criminal defendant, made outside of a trial setting and without being subjected to the rules of evidence or cross-examination.""

In his words, ""If prosecutors bend their principles depending on the identity of their prey, then they've got no principles at all.""

In the unsealed filing, Smith told the court that Trump is not immune from the remaining allegations against him and laid out his case for why Trump ""must stand trial for his private crimes.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the Justice Department for comment.

Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges brought against him by Smith."

A Florida restaurant owner struggling to keep doors open in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic received a surprise message of support from former President Trump.

But it's fallen prey to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden's economy,"" Trump told owner Harry MacArthur in a pre-recorded message Friday on ""Fox & Friends.""

""We have to keep the good ones open, especially when it comes to Florida. Florida is a very, very special place, and that's a very, very great restaurant. So Harry and the Natives, keep it going. We love it. And you're going to be around for a long time.""

'ECONOMY WAY BETTER UNDER TRUMP': BLACK VOTERS SHARE IF THEY WERE BETTER OFF 4 YEARS AGO

Co-host Steve Doocy hosted Friday's show from the packed restaurant in Hobe Sound after MacArthur wrote on Facebook he would have to shut down unless something changed by October 12.

The community, however, rallied behind MacArthur by supporting a GoFundMe set up by his son, Wyatt.

MacArthur called the response from Trump and the community ""overwhelming.""

""Turns out everybody cares,"" he said.

The restaurant has been in MacArthur's family for 72 years. Although the business was originally run by his parents, MacArthur reopened the business as Harry and the Natives after his father died in the 1980s.

MacArthur's business was close to bankruptcy in 2021, but after a ""Breakfast with Friends"" segment, the business was able to hold on. But the financial struggle was not over.

Trump teams up with former GOP nemesis to survey storm damage in key battleground state,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-teams-up-former-gop-nemesis-survey-storm-damage-key-battleground-state,2024-10-04T15:58:43Z,"Army veteran Sara Snide joins 'America's Newsroom' to highlight the problems facing Americans in areas battered by Hurricane Helene as grocery prices skyrocket.

Former President Trump and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp will appear together on Friday for the first time in four years as they receive a briefing on recovery and relief efforts one week after Hurricane Helene tore a path of destruction after slamming into the southeast United States.

The former president and the popular two-term conservative Georgia governor are scheduled to be briefed on storm damage and to ""deliver remarks to the press"" as they team up during a visit to Evans, a town in the northeast portion of the state.

The event is not being described as a campaign stop.

For Trump, it's his second trip this week to Georgia, following a visit on Monday in Valdosta. The state, along with North and South Carolina, and Tennessee, took direct hits from the powerful storm. The death toll from Hurricane Helene now stands at over 220, with hundreds still missing, more than 800,000 people in seven states still without power or running water, and damage estimated in the billions.

TRUMP CLAIMS BIDEN, HARRIS, STORM RESPONSE IS INCOMPETENT

With Trump locked in a margin-of-error presidential race with Vice President Kamala Harris, and Georgia and North Carolina crucial battleground states, Trump has repeatedly slammed President Biden and Harris over their handing of the federal response to the storm.

""It is going down as the WORST & MOST INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED 'STORM,' AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, EVER SEEN BEFORE,"" Trump claimed in a social media post on Thursday, as Biden spent a second straight day in the southeast surveying storm damage.

And Harris stopped in Georgia on Wednesday for storm briefings and to meet with local officials and victims of the storm, as she canceled a campaign swing in another key electoral state, Pennsylvania.

The vice president heads to North Carolina on Saturday to survey damage and get briefed on federal, state and local efforts.

When Trump visited Valdosta on Monday, he wasn't joined by Kemp, who was surveying storm damage in other parts of Georgia.

For two years after his 2020 election defeat to President Biden, which included a razor-thin loss in Georgia, Trump attacked Kemp for failing to overturn the election results in his state.

Trump urged, and then supported, a 2022 GOP gubernatorial primary challenge against Kemp by former Sen. David Perdue.

The former president toned down his criticism of the governor after Kemp crushed Perdue to easily win renomination on his way to re-election.

KEMP SAYS THERE'S NO PATH TO 270 FOR TRUMP WITHOUT GEORGIA

But in August, Trump went on a 10-minute tirade against Kemp at a rally in Atlanta just blocks from the Georgia State Capitol. He blamed the governor not only for failing to overturn the 2020 vote count but also for not stopping a county prosecutor from indicting the former president for his attempts to reverse the results.

""He's a bad guy. He's a disloyal guy. And he's a very average governor,"" Trump said. ""Little Brian. Little Brian Kemp. Bad guy.""

But just a couple of weeks later, in a major about face for Trump, the former president praised Kemp in a social media post ""for all of your help and support in Georgia, where a win is so important to the success of our Party and, most importantly, our Country.""

""I look forward to working with you, your team, and all of my friends in Georgia to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" the Republican presidential nominee added.

Trump's change of heart came amid a margin-of-error presidential race in Georgia.

The Peach State is one of seven key battlegrounds whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and are likely to determine whether Harris or Trump succeeds the president in the White House.

Republican strategists agree that to recapture Georgia, Trump will need assistance from Kemp's well-oiled and funded political machine to turn out GOP voters.

Kemp emphasized in an exclusive national interview with Fox News Digital in August that ""there's no path for former President Trump to win or any Republican . . . to get to 270 [electoral votes] without Georgia.""

The governor said his state ""should be one that we win if we have all the mechanics that we need. And I'm working hard to help provide those in a lot of ways and turn the Republican vote out.""

""It's my belief that we cannot afford four more years of [President] Joe Biden and Kamala Harris or Kamala Harris and [Minnesota Gov.] Tim Walz, which I think would probably be worse than even Biden and Harris were,"" Kemp said.

Kemp also told Fox News at the time that Trump's tirade from early August ""was a small distraction that's in the past"" and emphasized that Republicans ""need to stay focused on the future. . . . We need to be telling people why they should vote for us, what we're going to do to make things better than they are right now. And there's a host of issues that I think you could contrast Kamala Harris and her record."""
'It makes no sense': Jordan says FBI stonewalling requests for briefing on Iran hack of Trump campaign,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/it-makes-no-sense-jordan-says-fbi-stonewalling-requests-briefing-iran-hack-trump-campaign,2024-10-04T15:36:44Z,"EXCLUSIVE: The FBI is refusing to give the House Judiciary Committee a briefing on Iran's hack of the Trump campaign and other key issues, Chairman Jim Jordan told Fox News Digital, saying that the American people deserve to have the information before Election Day.

Jordan, R-Ohio, spoke exclusively with Fox News Digital and said that he and his committee have been seeking a briefing in an unclassified setting to obtain information relating to Iran's hack of the Trump campaign, and whether the former president and his team had been given a defensive briefing on the matter.

The FBI has told Fox News Digital that it is committed to working with the committee but did not say if or when officials would brief Jordan.

""This hacking of the Trump campaign by Iran -- it looks like there was a dossier on JD Vance -- that dossier winds up at the Harris campaign, and somehow, it happens to wind up in the press,"" Jordan said. ""There are lots of questions, like when did you find out about this? How did you find out about this? Did you give Trump a defensive briefing? Who was the person in the Harris campaign who got the information? How did they get the information? When did they tell you they had the information? How did it then get to the press?""

HOUSE JUDICIARY INVESTIGATING DOJ FOR RELEASE OF ROUTH MANIFESTO OFFERING $150K TRUMP BOUNTY

Jordan said, ""Those are just questions off the top of my head.""

""It makes no sense, because we know if everything were reversed and the Iranians hacked the Harris campaign and there was a dossier on Tim Walz that winded up in the Trump campaign and then in the press, we know that they would all be going crazy,"" Jordan said. ""There would probably already be a special counsel.""

Jordan also pointed to the fact that the hack was taken by an adversarial nation -- Iran.

""This is the same country that says they are trying to assassinate President Trump. This is the same country who is the chief sponsor of terrorism. This is the same country that wants to assassinate [Israeli] Prime Minister Netanyahu. And this is the same country who just sent rockets to our best ally -- ballistic missiles to our best ally -- the State of Israel,"" Jordan said. ""And we want to be briefed on this hacking, and they won't do it.""

The Trump campaign said that the documents had been obtained ""illegally from sources hostile to the United States,"" who ""intended to interfere in the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process.""

IRAN IS 'INCREASINGLY AGGRESSIVE' IN ITS OPERATIONS TO TARGET US PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS: INTEL COMMUNITY

The hack by Iran came ""after recent reports of an Iranian plot to assassinate President Trump around the same time as the Butler, PA tragedy.""

The documents were sent to Politico and included a 271-page ""dossier"" that the Trump campaign had put together on his eventual running mate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, that dated back to February, the outlet said.

It included Vance's past stances on issues, statements and previous criticisms of Trump in a section called ""POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES.""

Meanwhile, Jordan also said his committee has other questions relating to Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, including why the Justice Department released the ""bounty letter"" from the second attempted assassin, Ryan Routh, who offered $150,000 to someone who could ""complete the job"" against Trump if he were to fail.

The DOJ, in a court filing last month, released Routh's letter as evidence in a detention memo by the Justice Department in an effort to ensure Routh's detention.

DOJ INSPECTOR GENERAL DOES NOT DENY FBI INFORMANTS WERE AMONG JAN 6 CROWD

Jordan also told Fox News Digital he wants information from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who testified last week that he would include in his highly anticipated report on Jan. 6, 2021 details about confidential human sources from the FBI and whether they had been embedded in the mob during the Capitol riot.

During the hearing last week, Horowitz was asked whether he would ""expose that there were confidential human sources at the Capitol"" on Jan. 6, and ""how many went into the Capitol?""

Horowitz replied, ""I'll have that information in the report.""

Horowitz, though, indicated his report would not be made public until after Election Day.

""Well, for goodness' sake, it's been four years,"" Jordan said. ""Why not give us that information now, right?""

But Jordan said that ""the FBI will not sit down with the committee.""

Jordan stressed that the House Judiciary Committee is ""the authorizing committee for the Justice Department.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS WERE HACKED, INCLUDING VANCE 'DOSSIER,' BY FOREIGN SOURCES

""They will not sit down and talk with our committee, and it's ridiculous,"" Jordan said. ""This is important information for the American people to know before a consequential election.""

Fox News Digital has learned that representatives for the House Judiciary Committee began requesting the briefing during a phone call on Sept. 24 with the FBI. The committee then had two phone calls on Sept. 25 with the FBI requesting a briefing, a call with the Justice Department on Oct. 1 requesting a briefing, and two calls with the FBI on Oct. 1 requesting a briefing.

A source said representatives of the committee also left a voicemail for the FBI on Oct. 1 requesting a briefing and had a call with the FBI again on Oct. 2.

An FBI spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the bureau ""has continually demonstrated its commitment to working with the Committee to accommodate its requests, and we have provided numerous documents and briefings.""

""The FBI recognizes the importance of congressional oversight and remains committed to cooperating with the Committee in good faith,"" the FBI spokesperson said.

But that cooperation has not met Jordan's requests, the chairman said, and warned that all options are on the table.

""We have done more than 100 subpoenas this Congress, so every option is on the table for us to try to get the information that we believe the American people are entitled to have before making a decision, as I said, in an election that is so consequential,"" Jordan told Fox News Digital.

""We've got important questions about important issues that impact our country and one of the major candidates for political office,"" he said. ""Give us the briefing, for goodness' sake. Answer our questions."""
"'Lies throughout': Trump-backed challenger, longtime Dem senator face off in heated battleground debate",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lies-throughout-trump-backed-challenger-longtime-dem-senator-face-off-heated-battleground-debate,2024-10-04T14:14:11Z,"Lackawanna County, Pa., has emerged as a key battleground county this election cycle, with voters on the streets of Scranton speaking with Fox News Digital about their top issues.

Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick squared off in their first debate Thursday evening, less than five weeks ahead of what is expected to be one of the most closely watched races this election cycle.

Casey and McCormick took the debate stage Thursday at 8 p.m. in Harrisburg, where the two traded barbs over issues such as the economy and inflation, immigration, abortion. The race, which is rated as ""leans Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report, is expected to be one of the tightest Senate races across the country, with Casey himself acknowledging earlier this year that it will be a ""close, tough race.""

Casey has long been a Pennsylvania Democratic stalwart, first winning his election to the U.S. Senate in 2007. The Casey name also has deep roots in the state, with Bob Casey Sr., the senator's father, serving as the Keystone State's governor from 1987 to 1995, following years of serving in various other elected roles.

McCormick is an Army combat veteran and former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, who served as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security as well as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under former President George W. Bush's administration. Former President Donald Trump endorsed McCormick in April, lauding him as a ""a good man"" who ""wants to run a good ship.""

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY

The Senate race comes as the federal election spotlights Pennsylvania once again as a key battleground state that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential election. Former President Donald Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while President Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.

As the pair squared off for the first of two debates ahead of Nov. 5, Fox News Digital compiled the top five moments of Thursday's event.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

Casey and McCormick both weighed in on the federal election, including Casey lauding Harris following his staunch support of Biden before the president ultimately dropped out of the 2024 race as concerns about his mental acuity and age mounted over the summer.

""From your perspective, who is the better candidate for Pennsylvania? Biden or Harris?"" moderator and ABC27 anchor Dennis Owens asked Casey.

""I think Vice President Harris, who's running a strong campaign, I think she'll carry Pennsylvania. It's going to be very close, just like the Senate race will be close. But she's running a strong campaign. But the people of our state have to make two basic decisions - in addition to other statewide races. They have decided in the presidential race, and they have to decide our race, and this race is very clear,"" Casey responded.

When asked whether he believes Biden or Harris would be a better president for Pennsylvania voters, Casey brushed off delivering a direct answer.

""Oh, I don't know, Dennis. I mean, we'll never know the answer to that, but the voters are gonna make a decision,"" he said.

McCormick, on the other hand, was asked if he could offer one example where he does not agree with Trump after slamming Casey during the debate for overwhelmingly voting with Biden over the last three and a half years.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

""[Trump] recently said that he wanted to get rid of the ban on SALT taxes, which Sen. Casey supported, too"" McCormick responded. ""Listen, that's a that's a tax break for millionaires in New York and California at the expense of PA taxpayers. So I wouldn't support that.""

""But listen, Senator Casey stood next to Joe Biden when he could hardly finish a sentence. We saw this on the debate stage, he said 'he's ready to go,'"" McCormick continued, referring to Casey's support of Biden remaining in the presidential race until Biden ultimately dropped out. ""Then Sen. Casey said, 'Kamala Harris is great. You're going to love her when you get to know her.' This is a woman who, in the last few years, says she wanted to ban fracking, legalize illegal immigration, give them federal benefits, take away our guns, defund the police. This is her position, so she's flip-flopped on everything, and Bob Casey standing there by her.""

Both candidates accused the other of ""lies"" throughout the debate, including McCormick touting a new website called CaseyLies.com, and Casey accusing McCormick of misrepresenting himself as a Pennsylvanian.

""For your viewers tonight, I have a website that's been established today, it's just been launched, CaseyLies.com. You can go and see the actual facts by third-party sources of all the things he's saying. There will be lies throughout. But you should ask yourself, 'Why is a senator with an 18-year track record, who should be able to run on his record, running his entire campaign with a negative set of attacks on me, most of them lies?'"" McCormick said towards the start of the debate.

McCormick claimed that Casey often launched ""lies"" at him during the debate because he ""doesn't have a track record"" in the Senate to run on.

Casey shot back during the debate that McCormick has misrepresented himself as a full-fledged Pennsylvanian.

""We've heard a couple of times tonight about telling lies, but probably the biggest lie told in this whole election, that probably most Pennsylvanians have never heard a bigger lie, was the lie when my opponent said he lived in Pennsylvania, when he was living in Connecticut. The Associated Press on August the 14th, 2023, did a story that proved that he was living in Connecticut,"" Casey said.

McCormick defended that he was born in Pennsylvania and has spent ""the majority of my life"" there, but also lived in Connecticut for years when he served as CEO of Bridgewater Associates.

PENNSYLVANIA SURVEY FINDS HARRIS LEADING TRUMP NARROWLY, IDENTIFIES HER 'BIGGEST WEAKNESS,' POLLSTER SAYS

The economy is among the top concerns for voters in Pennsylvania, as well as the nation at large, with both candidates outlining how they would tackle spiraling inflation if re-elected or elected to the Senate, and what they believe is behind the rise in consumers' costs.

""Prices are too high, especially when you go to the grocery store to buy food or household items, items that people need every week, or at least every other week. And these big conglomerates, these big corporations, rig those prices and jack them up to levels we've never seen, all while they're getting record profits,"" Casey said, while defending his efforts targeting corporations he has accused of ""greedflation.""

So-called greedflation is understood as corporations allegedly exploiting inflation woes by increasing prices on consumers to produce greater profits.

""We can take it on by passing a price gouging bill to go after those companies, hold them accountable,"" Casey said.

The Democratic senator also addressed his campaign against ""shrinkflation,"" which he explained as corporations shrinking products for consumers while not lowering prices.

""We did a report on shrinkflation, which covered a lot of companies around the country. And if that's happening with regard to a Pennsylvania company or any other company around the country, they should be held accountable. When they take a product, shrink the contents of the product, or what's in a bag, and don't shrink the price, that's deceptive. That's ripping people off,"" he said, adding that such companies should be held legally accountable.

McCormick shot back that higher costs on Americans in recent years is due to ""out of control spending"" at the hands of Casey and other Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and President Biden.

""When you've spent your entire life in public service, elected office, 30 years, you're like a hammer looking for a nail. The cause of inflation is the policies, the out-of-control spending of Biden, Harris and Casey. Bob Casey voted 100% of the time for that $5 trillion of new spending. The experts at the time, Larry Summers, the San Francisco Fed, said this would create inflation,"" McCormick said.

""Bob Casey doesn't understand how the economy works. That's why he's trying to do all this economic voodoo stuff with price controls,"" he later charged.

Casey and McCormick were both grilled about their current abortion stances during the debate, as abortion once again sits atop many voters' list of election concerns following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Casey positioned himself as a pro-life Democrat earlier in his career, but he voted to codify abortion protections nationwide following the overturning of Roe.

""In 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned a 49-year right, it overturned Roe v. Wade, I think everyone had to make a decision, including senators. I made a decision to support the Women's Health Protection Act. I don't support Republican efforts to ban abortion across the country,"" Casey said.

BATTLEGROUND STATE DEM DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM DEFUND MOVEMENT, BUT POLITICAL RECORD SHOWS DIFFERENT STORY

McCormick was questioned about his remarks in 2022 that he supports rare exceptions for abortion, such as when the health of the mother is at risk, and has since said that he supports additional exceptions for abortion.

""This is an extremely polarizing issue. As you know, I have six daughters, so this is something we spend time talking about. I believe this should be a state's right. I believe states should decide. Pennsylvania has had a law. It's been supported by Democrats and Republicans, like was signed into law by the Senator's father, Governor Casey. I support the three exceptions. I would not favor an abortion ban of any kind,"" McCormick responded.

Casey recently came under fire from a Pennsylvania sheriff who slammed the Democratic senator's border policies for the influx of fentanyl into the U.S., which the dad said had led to his son's death.

""We can't bring back the people we've lost. But we can get rid of the weak politicians like Bob Casey who let it happen,"" Blair County Sheriff Jim Ott said in a recent McCormick campaign ad.

Casey was asked about the sheriff's remarks during his debate Thursday.

""Mr. Casey, the Blair County Sheriff, blames you for the fentanyl death of his son, saying you have not done enough to secure the border. What is your response to that,"" Owens asked.

""I met so many families across the state, and whether it's a sheriff in Blair County or a mom in Allegheny County, Janet that I met, who talked about her daughter, Brianna, this is an awful, awful tragedy for those families. That's why we need to invest in the strategies that we know work. [McCormick] won't do that, because he's weak in the face of the political pressure from his own party. . . . We can solve this problem by investing in the technology, hiring thousands more Border Patrol, so we can inspect every single vehicle coming across the border,"" he said.

Amid the immigration debate, McCormick blamed the Biden-Harris administration and Casey for the immigration crisis at the southern border.

""The border crisis is the direct result of the weakness of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Bob Casey supported them every second. What chutzpah to run an ad on how tough he is on the border, when he voted against funding for the Border Patrol. He ran an ad in front of the wall that he voted against. He voted for sanctuary cities, he voted for federal benefits for illegal immigrants. And the fentanyl crisis that's come across our border is the direct result of the weakness of Bob Casey not standing up to these terrible cartels,"" McCormick argued.

The pair have agreed to another debate, next taking the same stage in Philadelphia on Oct. 15."

Elon Musk says he will ""be there to support"" Donald Trump on Saturday when the former president returns to Butler, Pennsylvania to hold a rally at the site where the first assassination attempt against him unfolded earlier this year.

The Republican presidential nominee is slated to speak on Oct. 5 at the Butler Farm Show fairgrounds in the suburb north of Pittsburgh.

""I will be there to support!"" Musk wrote on X late Thursday in response to an image Trump shared promoting the upcoming event.

""Butler on Saturday - historic!"" Trump wrote on X alongside an image of him raising his fist that was taken on July 13, moments after he had been shot.

OBAMA TO CAMPAIGN FOR HARRIS IN PENNSYLVANIA, OTHER KEY STATES

Musk had said following that rally that ""I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.""

Trump's campaign said last week that ""President Donald J. Trump will return to Butler, Pennsylvania, to hold a rally on the very same ground where he came within a quarter of an inch of losing his life less than three months ago.""

During a rally last Wednesday in North Carolina, Trump said that he wanted to return to the venue in Butler to ""finish our speech.""

""As you know, there have been two assassination attempts on my life that we know of... and the first case in Butler, Pennsylvania, great place, and we're going back to Butler,"" he said. ""We're going to go back and finish our speech.""

HARRIS LEADS TRUMP BY 2 IN NATIONAL POLL, BUT SHOWS VULNERABILITIES WITH NON-WHITE VOTERS

Trump's campaign said that the former president would honor those lost in the assassination attempt during the rally.

Corey Comperatore, 50, was a firefighter and a father of two daughters. He ""historically sacrificed his life to shield his wife and daughters"" during the assassination attempt against Trump, the campaign said.

Trump will also recognize the two other Americans who were wounded by the shooter, David Dutch and James Copenhaver.

""He will express his deep gratitude to law enforcement and first responders and thank the entire community for their outpouring of love and support in the wake of the attack,"" the campaign said.

Former President Donald Trump let loose on former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney following her endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris.

Citing her historic defeat by a 2-to-1 margin in 2022 -- and the controversial leadership of her father, Vice President Dick Cheney, during the U.S. invasion of the Middle East -- Trump called the former Wyoming Republican a ""low IQ war hawk.""

""Liz Cheney lost her Congressional Seat by the largest margin in the history of Congress for a sitting Representative. The people of Wyoming are really smart!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

KAMALA HARRIS TEAMS UP WITH LIZ CHENEY IN BIRTHPLACE OF REPUBLICAN PARTY

He continued, ""She is a low IQ War Hawk that, as a member of the J6 Unselect Committee of Political Hacks and Thugs, ILLEGALLY DESTROYED & DELETED all documents, information, and evidence.""

Cheney, a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP, in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 riot on the U.S. Capitol vowed to do everything she can to prevent Trump from returning to power.

The former representative campaigned for Harris in battleground Wisconsin on Thursday -- pushing a message of unity against their mutual enemy's campaign to return to the Oval Office.

The campaign event took place in Ripon, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

""I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the Wisconsin audience as she formally endorsed the Democrat presidential nominee. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

Cheney, who has been vocal in emphasizing the importance of defending the nation's democratic process and of putting country before party, was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the riot at the Capitol.

Trump's social media remarks lumped together Liz Cheney and her former vice president father -- who has also endorsed Harris -- writing them off as ""two fools"" who are ""suffering gravely from Trump Derangement Syndrome.""

""Her father, Dick, was a leader of our ridiculous journey into the Middle East, where Trillions of Dollars were spent, millions of people were killed - and for what? NOTHING!

Cheney on Thursday warned that ""our republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before: a former president who attempted to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our republic.""

She argued that Trump ""can never be trusted with power again"" and emphasized that ""in this election, putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration, it is our duty.""

""What January 6 shows us is there is not an ounce, not an ounce, of compassion in Donald Trump. He is petty. He is vindictive. He is cruel. And Donald Trump is not fit to lead this good and great nation,"" Cheney said.

Former Trump staffer and ""The View"" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin will join former GOP lawmaker Liz Cheney and other anti-Trump Republicans for an event in Pennsylvania next week warning of the dangers of re-electing former President Donald Trump.

Former Trump administration staffer Cassidy Hutchison - who testified against her former boss in the Jan. 6 Committee hearings - as well as Trump's former deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews will be part of the event that is meant to help deliver the swing state to Vice President Kamala Harris in November.

The panel will ""offer a warning about the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy and the rule of law,"" a source connected to the event recently told CNN.

The aim of the chat is to convince voters of ""the need for independents, moderates, and Republicans to stop him from getting back in office,"" the source added.

The women-led program will be hosted by liberal super-PAC Democracy First in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania on Oct. 9, and is reportedly the first of many that will feature the four women speaking to voters in multiple battleground states.

Cheney, Hutchison, and Matthews have endorsed Harris for president. Griffin has not, though the media personality is a staunch critic of Trump on ""The View"" and in her role as a CNN political commentator.

The event comes as Trump and Harris are neck and neck in battleground states, with the race being especially close in Pennsylvania.

""Both candidates have a little way to go to consolidate their bases and whoever does a better job there could determine who wins the state.""

According to the survey, the economy is the top issue for Pennsylvanians, with 71% of voters having a negative view of it. Trump has a six-point advantage over Harris on the issue, while she is viewed far more favorably on abortion.

"Kim Kardashian calls on Menendez brothers to be freed, citing sexual abuse claims: 'Not monsters'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kim-kardashian-calls-menendez-brothers-freed-citing-sexual-abuse-claims-not-monsters,2024-10-04T13:50:18Z,"Lyle Menendez, who along with his brother Erik infamously massacred their parents in a Los Angeles home in 1989, is appealing his sentence of life without parole and could go free under new California law. (Courtesy: CrimeCon)

Kim Kardashian believes the Menendez brothers should be freed from prison.

The reality star is the latest person to weigh in on the controversial pair of convicted murderers.

Prosecutors in Los Angeles are reviewing new evidence to determine whether the siblings should be serving life sentences for killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion more than 35 years ago, the city's district attorney said on Thursday.

The case is being highlighted in a new Netflix scripted series and an upcoming documentary.

""You think you know the story of Lyle and Erik Menendez,"" Kardashian wrote in her opinion essay for NBC News published on Thursday. ""I certainly thought I did.""

""In 1989, the brothers, aged 21 and 18, respectively, viciously shot and killed their parents in their Beverly Hills home,"" she wrote. ""In 1996, after two trials, they were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. As is often the case, this story is much more complex than it appears on the surface.""

Kardashian is a prison reform advocate who previously worked with the Trump White House to reduce sentences for several convicts found guilty of non-violent offenses. She also spoke at the White House earlier this year about criminal justice.

The mother of four centered the argument in her essay mainly on the brothers' claims that they were emotionally, physically and sexually abused by their parents and feared for their lives.

MENENDEZ BROTHER, WHO GUNNED DOWN PARENTS, SLAMS NEW SHOW FOR 'DISHONEST PORTRAYAL'

""Following years of abuse and a real fear for their lives, Erik and Lyle chose what they thought at the time was their only way out -- an unimaginable way to escape their living nightmare,"" Kardashian wrote.

She said that after the jury was deadlocked in their first trial, the judge decided many of their abuse claims were inadmissible in the second trial.

""Their only way out of prison now is death,"" Kardashian said, writing that their first televised trial became ""entertainment for the nation,"" and that they were portrayed as ""monsters and sensationalized eye candy"" by the media, ""two arrogant, rich kids from Beverly Hills who killed their parents out of greed.""

""There was no room for empathy, let alone sympathy,"" she noted.

""Following years of abuse and a real fear for their lives, Erik and Lyle chose what they thought at the time was their only way out -- an unimaginable way to escape their living nightmare.""

-- Kim Kardashian

DO MENENDEZ BROTHERS STAND A CHANCE AT FREEDOM?

""Erik and Lyle had no chance of a fair trial against this backdrop,"" the 43-year-old claimed, adding that there was a stigma on male victims of sexual abuse at the time.

""Can anyone honestly deny that the justice system would have treated the Menendez sisters more leniently?"" she postulated, adding, ""Many people believe the crimes the brothers committed are unforgivable -- but what about the decades of alleged abuse they suffered as children?""

FOX NATION SPECIAL: 'MENENDEZ BROTHERS: VICTIMS OR VILLAINS

She said she had recently spent time with the brothers, who she said have ""exemplary disciplinary records"" in prison.

They ""are not monsters. They are kind, intelligent, and honest men,"" she argued.

Kardashian also said that one of the prison wardens told her he would be comfortable having the brothers as neighbors.

While Kardashian called the murders of their parents ""inexcusable,"" she said the brothers were treated more like ""serial killers"" than two men who had ""endured years of sexual abuse by the very people they loved and trusted.""

She added, ""I don't believe that spending their entire natural lives incarcerated was the right punishment for this complex case. Had this crime been committed and trialed today, I believe the outcome would have been dramatically different.

""I also strongly believe that they were denied a fair second trial and that the exclusion of crucial abuse evidence denied Erik and Lyle the opportunity to fully present their case, further undermining the fairness of their conviction.""

However, not everyone agrees with Kardashian's assessment.

""If they were brought to trial again today, they would be found guilty,"" Clark Fogg, a retired senior forensic specialist with the Beverly Hills Police Department who investigated the murders, told Fox News Digital this week.

Fogg believes the brothers' motive for the murders had to do with ""greed and money.""

""Why did they even have to kill their mom in the first place?"" Fogg said. ""If you killed Mr. Menendez separately from her, she would end up getting the inheritance, right? So they had to eliminate both of them in order to have the inheritance.""

Fogg investigated the Menendez brothers' case in 1989. He took photos and preserved evidence at the crime scene, attended the autopsies and took the stand during both trials.

When speaking with Fox News Digital, he painted a horrific picture of the crime scene.

""One of the detectives had to actually hold a golf umbrella over my head as I was taking photos because, every so often, things would be falling from the ceiling,"" Fogg said.

""It comes down to one thing. The reason why they're in jail is that they killed their mother and father brutally, not poison them, but shotgun them to death to a point that they were all over the ceiling. ... That's how brutally they were murdered.""

Fogg said it appeared their mother was trying to escape when she was killed because there was blood on the soles of her shoes.

Former President Obama is preparing to hit the campaign trail next week for Vice President Harris, focusing on key battleground states in the lead up to Election Day, according to a senior campaign official with anonymity to discuss the matter.

Obama, who served back-to-back terms as president from 2009 through 2017, will kick off his drive in the Pittsburgh area of Pennsylvania on Thursday, a state which remains one of the tightest contests in the nation and which could tip the scales for either candidate.

A Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters last week found Harris narrowly ahead of Trump by 2 points (50-48%) among registered voters, while the race is tied at 49% each among likely voters. President Biden won the state by more than 80,000 votes in 2020.

'GOING TO BE A CLOSE ONE:' DETROITERS REVEAL IF THE CITY IS LEANING TOWARDS HARRIS OR TRUMP

Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama officially endorsed Harris for president in July, five days after President Biden ended his 2024 re-election in a blockbuster announcement.

The 44th president then stumped for Harris at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, saying she ""is ready for the job.""

""It's up to all of us to fight for the America we believe in,"" Obama said. ""And make no mistake: It will be a fight.""

""This is a person who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice and a champion. Kamala wasn't born into privilege. She had to work for what she's got, and she actually cares about what other people are going through.""

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP IS MAKING GAINS WITH YOUNGER VOTERS

Harris and Obama's friendship goes back 20 years to when they met on the campaign trail while he was running for Senate in Illinois, the senior campaign official says. Harris was an early supporter of his 2008 presidential campaign and even knocked doors for him in Iowa ahead of the caucus, per the official.

Last month, Former President Obama headlined a fundraiser for Harris that raised $4 million, per The Washington Post. His fundraising efforts so far on her behalf -- fundraising content and events that feature him -- have raised $76 million, per the outlet.

Harris' campaign is headed by Jen O'Malley Dillon Harris, a veteran of Obama's two campaigns who also managed President Biden's 2020 campaign and built his 2024 operation from the White House.

Other former Obama advisers on the Harris team, include David Plouffe, who was manager of Obama's presidential campaign in 2008 and a senior aide during his 2012 re-election victory.

Tim Walz in November for ""one of the most consequential elections in our nation's history.""

""Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually, and emotionally divided as it does then at this moment. It doesn't have to be this way,"" Springsteen said in an Instagram video Thursday. ""The common values, the shared stories that make us a great and united nation are waiting to be rediscovered and retold once again. Now that will take time, hard work, intelligence, faith and women and men with the national good, guiding their hearts.""

The ""Born in the USA"" singer attacked former President Trump as ""the most dangerous candidate for President in my lifetime"" with a ""disdain for the sanctity of our constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law, and the sanctity of the peaceful transfer of power.""

""On the other hand, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are committed to a vision of this country that respects and includes everyone regardless of class, religion, race, your political point of view or sexual identity, and they want to grow our economy in a way that benefits all, not just the few like me on top. That's the vision of America I've been consistently writing about for 55 years now,"" Springsteen said.

Springsteen acknowledged ""everybody sees things different"" and that he respects other choices but stood by his.

""That's why come November 5th, I'll be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,"" he closed.

He joined several other singers such as Taylor Swift who have publicly supported Harris ahead of the November election.

Springsteen has been openly supportive of Democratic candidates in the past and frequently attacked Trump.

In 2020, he said, ""I believe that our current president is a threat to our democracy. He simply makes any kind of reform that much harder. I don't know if our democracy could stand another four years of his custodianship.""

Springsteen later provided a voiceover as well as his song ""My Hometown"" for a pro-Joe Biden ad.

""We are rudderless and joyless. We have lost the cultural aspects of society that make America great. We have lost our mojo, our fun, our happiness, our cheering on of others,"" Springsteen said in the 2020 ad. ""The shared experience of humanity that makes it all worth it. The challenges and the triumph that we shared and celebrated. The unique can-do spirit that America has always been known for. We are lost. We've lost so much in so short a time.

6 ways Iran could strike US in the Mideast or here at home,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/6-ways-iran-could-strike-us-mideast-here-home,2024-10-04T11:10:07Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Iran's terror goons are in crisis mode right now. Having seen their missile attack on Israel fail yet again due to Israel's powerful defenses, Iran is now expecting an Israeli counterstrike.

""There will be severe consequences for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday, October 1. All the G7 nations agree Israel has the right to strike back, President Joe Biden added Wednesday.

Iran wants blood. But they are running out of options. More than 40,000 U.S. forces were already deployed to U.S. Central Command in the Middle East, in locations from Syria to the Red Sea. Three more squadrons of F-15Es, F-16s and A-10s are on the way to U.S. Central Command, joining stealth F-22s, F-35s and others already in the region.

TRUMP SAYS IRANIAN PRESIDENT BEING GUARDED AT UN WHILE PLOTTING ASSASSINATION 'A STRANGE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES'

The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln is launching jets day and night and the USS Wasp, with a Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard, is in the eastern Mediterranean. The submarine USS Georgia, carrying 154 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles, is nearby too, along with a bevy of U.S. Navy destroyers.

Make no mistake. This is enough firepower to hit many types of Iranian targets. Guarantee you, Iran's military units are scrambling to prepare. While being very, very careful about using cellphones.

Whatever action comes will aim to weaken and contain Iran. Iran's proxies Hamas and Hezbollah have been mauled. But this conflict won't be over as long as the ayatollah holds power over Iran's people. That gang has been in the ideology and terror business for almost 50 years and won't go quietly.

Look for desperate Iran to consider six moves - including two here in the USA.

Already in massive violation of the United Nations inspection regime, Iran proclaimed in July they would install more than 1,400 centrifuges at the underground Fordow facility. ""Iran has managed to reach a point where it can not only produce nuclear weapons on-demand but produce large quantities of WGU [weapons-grade uranium] quickly in a very hard-to-destroy enrichment plant,"" expert David Albright noted. The best case is that Iran's new president wants more enriched uranium as a bargaining chip. The worst case is rapid production of three to five nuclear warheads.

Many of the recent deployments directed by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin are beefing up security against direct attacks from Iran, like the January 2020 ballistic missile attack on U.S. personnel at a base in Iraq. U.S. outposts will be on guard against attempted strikes by Iran-backed militia.

The Houthis, supplied by Iran, will continue to menace Red Sea shipping. Iran has also been working a deal for Russia to supply upgraded P-800 ""Oniks"" anti-ship missiles to the Houthis.

Even after tactical failures on Apr. 13 and Oct. 1, more missile attacks from Iran remain a concern. Fortunately, U.S. Navy destroyers USS Cole and USS Bulkeley fired interceptors from the eastern Mediterranean against Iran's attack. This is sweet vengeance for the USS Cole, nearly sunk by al Qaeda terrorists in Yemen in 2000, with the loss of 17 sailors killed and 37 wounded.

Beyond this, U.S. Central Command is massing a powerful defensive and offensive force starting to serve a new deterrent role. Should Iran field nuclear weapons, this is the type of force array that will be necessary to deter their attacks. Iran's leaders must get the message that any nuclear-armed missiles they may build in the future won't get through.

Two more threats from Iran could aim directly at the U.S.

The FBI says threat indicators are spiking. In early September, the FBI warned Iran is targeting hospitals and healthcare in the US. Don't forget Iran almost opened the Bowman Avenue Dam in Rye, New York back in 2013; by chance, the sluice gate was offline for maintenance. A 2023 bulletin from Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps group ""CyberAv3ngers"" is still targeting wastewater management systems. Who knows what cyber tricks Iran may have learned from Russia.

The Director of National Intelligence has briefed former President and Republican nominee Donald J. Trump on ""real and specific threats"" to assassinate him. ""I am surrounded by more men, guns, and weapons than I have ever seen before,"" Trump posted on Truth Social last week. Sadly, violence against American leaders fits Iran's playbook.

Be assured the U.S. and allies are prepared to counter every one of these options.

Whatever violence Iran unleashes next, remember China is also to blame. China buys almost 90% of Iran's oil in what the Atlantic Council dubbed ""the axis of evasion"" and China's support is enabling Iran's lethal mayhem."

The International Association of Fire Fighters' (IAFF) decision not to endorse a candidate this year was seen as ""another blow"" to the Harris campaign's bid to retain working class voters.

""Today, the IAFF Executive Board, by a margin of 1.2%, voted to not endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential election,"" a statement from the IAFF read Thursday.

The IAFF added, ""The IAFF Executive Board determined that we are better able to advocate for our members and make progress on the issues that matter to them if we, as a union, are standing shoulder-to-shoulder. This decision, which we took seriously, is the best way to preserve and strengthen our unity.""

Because the union had endorsed President Biden in 2020, this was seen by many as a win for Trump and a failure for Harris.

KAMALA HARRIS CONFRONTED ON NOT EARNING TEAMSTERS ENDORSEMENT: 'WHAT WAS THEIR REASONING?'

""Translation... The IAFF firefighters endorse Trump!"" New Hampshire state Rep. Fred Doucette exclaimed.

GRV Strategies founder Garrett Ventry wrote, ""Another blow to Harris. She failed to get the Teamsters endorsement as well. The Biden 2020 [coalition] is falling apart for her.""

""Kamala loses the unions, gains the Cheneys. It's like she's trying to hemorrhage working and middle class voters,"" Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller joked.

Politico senior political columnist Jonathan Martin wrote, ""Building trades adjacent...Just adds pressure on Kamala to build on Biden's college+ support.""

""Similar to the Teamsters non-endorsement. This is another huge win for Trump!"" Townhall.com columnist Dustin Grage commented.

NBC News senior national political reporter Henry J. Gomez reported, ""Significant non-endorsement here, given how huge IAFF was for Biden four years ago. Tim Walz spoke at their convention last month -- and so did Republican VP nominee JD Vance.""

""CRUSHING DEFEAT FOR CROOKED LYIN' KAMALA HARRIS! When is the last time that NEITHER the Teamsters nor the IAFF endorsed the Democrat nominee???"" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller asked.

The IAFF has primarily supported Democratic presidential candidates in the past and was the first major union to endorse Biden in 2019. Prior to this year, the IAFF had only withheld their endorsement in 2016, when it did not commit to supporting either Hillary Clinton or Trump.

This announcement came weeks after the Teamsters, another major union, declined to support a 2024 presidential candidate. It was the first time the union had not endorsed a candidate since 1996 after largely supporting Democrats.

Despite not backing a candidate, a Teamsters poll found that nearly 60% of union members supported Trump."

""I think it's time for history to be made,"" Mandela said.

""I just think that it's going to be a woman president,"" he added.

A new poll released by the New York Times and Siena College found Harris had 48% support in Michigan and Trump had 47%.

Hillary Clinton narrowly lost Michigan to Trump in 2016 despite consistently leading in the polls there, making her the first Democrat to lose the state since Michael Dukakis in 1988. Joe Biden won the state in 2020.

The Trump and Harris campaigns have prioritized Blue Wall states in campaign stops throughout the summer. Trump's 2016 victory was powered by his surprise wins in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which all had lengthy Democratic winning streaks until then. The winners of the past four elections have won the three states.

Michigan residents also weighed in on which presidential candidate they think would be a stronger leader.

"New poll reveals Trump has significant lead on immigration, border security in key battleground state",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-poll-reveals-trump-significant-lead-immigration-border-security-key-battleground-state,2024-10-04T08:09:41Z,"Economist Steve Moore comments on the border crisis and illegal immigration on 'Fox Report.'

Former President Donald Trump holds a firm lead in a key state over Vice President Kamala Harris on the question of how to handle immigration -- as the border crisis remains a top issue for voters.

A new poll released this week from Marquette Law School finds Harris leading Trump overall in Wisconsin by 52-48%.

But when it comes to immigration and border security, Trump dominates. Of voters, 49% favor Trump while just 37% favor Harris, with 8% saying they'd be about the same, and 6% saying neither are good on the issue.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

Trump holds a similar 12 point lead on handling the war between Israel-Hamas, while Harris has an 11 point gap on handling Medicare & Social Security and a 17 point lead on abortion.

Of the issues polled, immigration was near the top of the issues, with 15% of voters saying it was their most important issue, the same number who said abortion, and only behind the economy -- which was top issue for 37% of voters.

The poll is the latest indicator that Harris still has a fair way to go in convincing some voters that she is the better candidate on a topic that has dominated the headlines and remains a top issue for voters. Wisconsin, along with states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona could be election deciders in the election on Nov 5.

Harris was put in charge of handling root causes of migration to the southern border in early 2021 as border numbers began to skyrocket. She was eventually dubbed the ""border czar"" by media outlets and critics -- although the White House rejected that title.

HARRIS SHIFTS KEY POSITIONS ON BORDER, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AS CAMPAIGN PROMISES 'PRAGMATIC' APPROACH

Republicans have hammered Harris on the border, saying it was the rolling back of Trump-era policies that led to the record numbers at the border. They have also pointed to her embrace of left-wing positions in her 2019 presidential bid. Since then, her campaign says her views have been shaped by the current administration, including on decriminalizing illegal crossings and closing immigration detention centers.

""Harris can never be forgiven for her erasing our border, and she must never be allowed to become president of the United States,"" Trump said in Wisconsin on Sunday.

Harris has sought to present herself as better situated to handle the border. Her campaign has noted a recent drop in border encounters since President Biden signed a presidential proclamation in June limiting asylum entries. She has also thrown her support behind a bipartisan border security bill that would place similar limits on asylum and provide additional funding and detention beds.

Conservatives said that the bill would enshrine high border numbers, but Harris accused Trump of blocking the bill for political purposes. She did so again on a trip to the southern border in Arizona last week.

Harris campaigned in battleground Wisconsin with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP who, in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, has vowed to do everything she can to prevent Trump from returning to power.

""I have never voted for a Democrat but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the audience, as she formally endorsed the Democratic presidential nominee. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

Harris praised Cheney as a leader who ""puts country above party and above self - a true patriot.""

WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS WHO ADVISED REAGAN AND BUSH BACK HARRIS OVER TRUMP

The campaign event took place in Ripon, Wisconsin, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

The younger Cheney was once rising in the ranks of House Republican leadership.

But she was the most high-profile of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-president Trump in early 2021 on a charge of inciting the deadly Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol, which was waged by right-wing extremists and other Trump supporters who aimed to disrupt congressional certification of President Biden's Electoral College victory in the 2020 election.

TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE IN THE 2024 FUNDRAISING FIGHT WITH HARRIS

The conservative lawmaker and defense hawk immediately came under verbal attack from Trump and his allies, and was eventually ousted from her number-three House GOP leadership position.

Cheney, who has been vocal in emphasizing the importance of defending the nation's democratic process and of putting country before party, was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the riot at the Capitol.

In 2022, she was ousted in the GOP congressional primary in Wyoming by a candidate that was backed by Trump.

At a speaking event in early September at Duke University in swing state North Carolina, Cheney announced that she would be voting for Harris in the presidential election. Cheney's father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, also endorsed Harris.

Cheney on Thursday warned that ""our republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before. A former president who attempted to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our republic.

She argued that Trump ""can never be trusted with power again"" and emphasized that ""in this election, putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration, it is our duty.""

""What Jan. 6 shows us is there is not an ounce, not an ounce, of compassion in Donald Trump. He is petty. He is vindictive. He is cruel. And Donald Trump is not fit to lead this good and great nation,"" Cheney claimed.

WHAT THE LATEST POLL IN BATTLEGROUND WISCONSIN SHOWS

Harris, speaking after Cheney, highlighted that ""anyone who recklessly tramples on our democratic values as Donald Trump has, anyone who has actively and violently obstructed the will of the people and the peaceful transfer of power, as Donald Trump has....must never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States.""

And Harris emphasized that ""I take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans.

Cheney was not always a fan of Harris.

The Trump campaign on Thursday repeatedly pointed to a social media post by Cheney during the 2000 election where she argued that ""@KamalaHarris has a more liberal voting record than Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Her radical leftist views-raising taxes, banning gun sales, taxpayer $ for abortion & illegal immigrant health care, eliminating private health insurance-would be devastating for America.""

Trump, speaking with Fox News' Bill Melugin during a rally in Michigan on Thursday, said that Cheney was ""terrible"" and ""a stupid warhawk. All she wants to do is shoot missiles at people.""

On Cheney's backing of Harris, Trump argued ""I think they hurt each other. I think they're so bad, both of them.""

The Cheneys are part of a growing list of prominent Republicans who are supporting Harris.

Two other high-profile anti-Trump Republicans -- former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan - had speaking roles at the Democratic National Convention, which was held six weeks ago in Chicago.

And Harris is backed by more than 200 alumni who served in both Bush administrations or worked for the late Sen. John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2008 and 2012 GOP presidential nominee. She's also supported by more than 100 Republican former national security officials and other prominent Republicans.

Ripon is not the only town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP. Exeter, New Hampshire also has some bragging rites, as it was the site of meetings in 1853 - a year ahead of the Ripon gatherings - by disenchanted political leaders who discussed the formation of a new party of Republicans.

But officials in Ripon said the group in Exeter never actually formed a political organization, or chose officials, as they did in Wisconsin.

Wisconsin is one of seven crucial battleground states with razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 White House victory and are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.

With less than five weeks until Election Day in November, Harris and Trump are locked in a margin-of-error race in the key swing states.

While Trump retains vast sway over the GOP, even a small sliver of Republicans supporting Harris could make an important impact in what will likely be a race within the margins in the battleground states."

James Carville harshly criticized the Harris-Walz campaign for not doing more to combat the claim by vice presidential hopeful JD Vance that former President Donald Trump ""saved Obamacare"" during Tuesday night's debate.

The Democratic strategist unloaded on the Harris/Walz campaign for what he believes to be an ineffective response to Vance's comments that Trump ""salvaged"" the Affordable Care Act (ACA) while he was president.

""Why isn't Harris herself out today talking about that,"" Carville seethed on the Politics War Room podcast. ""Get off your a--. Move, move, move!""

Carville noted that health care is a huge issue and the ACA is ""a law that is important to people.""

JAMES CARVILLE PREDICTS ELECTION 'PLOT TWIST' AHEAD OF NOVEMBER: 'SPRINT TO THE FINISH'

He also called Vance's claim ""an out and out lie,"" repeatedly asking why Harris herself wasn't out in the media talking about it.

""What the f--- are y'all doing in the Harris campaign, get her out there now, now!"" he said. ""They ought to have Obama and Nancy Pelosi and they ought to do a Zoom call with the national media. I mean kick the crap out of this now, use everything.""

""[Trump] did everything in his power to destroy it and this is not an issue that people don't care about,"" Carville said. ""It's not a nitpicking thing and I got to tell you, the White House response and I think by and large, to a large extent, the press response is not at all measured to the gravity of this lie, of the importance of this.

""Why haven't they just gone crazy over Vance saying that Donald Trump saved Obamacare?"" Carville said. ""That's pants-on-fire, 5-star 20 Pinocchio B.S. and it's a great issue for us.""

Firefighters union will not endorse Harris or Trump for president,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/firefighters-union-not-endorse-harris-trump-president,2024-10-04T00:02:13Z,"Residents of Detroit revealed to Fox News Digital their choice for the November election and who they believe is the better leader.

The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) on Thursday said it would remain neutral in this year's presidential race, electing not to endorse a candidate, becoming the second major union to do so in recent weeks.

The union's executive board backed President Biden's 2020 White House bid. In a statement, IAFF President Edward Kelly said the union membership voted by a margin of 1.2 percentage points not to endorse either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Trump.

""Over the past year, the IAFF took unprecedented steps to hear our members' views on the candidates and the policy issues that matter most to them,"" Kelly said of the decision.

""As we have over our 106-year history, the IAFF will continue its work to improve the lives of firefighters and their families,"" he added. ""The IAFF Executive Board determined that we are better able to advocate for our members and make progress on the issues that matter to them if we, as a union, are standing shoulder-to-shoulder. This decision, which we took very seriously, is the best way to preserve and strengthen our unity.""

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Harris and Trump campaigns.

The decision by the IAFF came weeks after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters announced it would not endorse a candidate either.

WHY HARRIS CHARGED TRUMP'S 'ONE OF THE BIGGEST LOSERS'

The Teamsters posted the results of internal polling on the 2024 candidates, showing that the union's members favored Trump by 59.6% over Harris, who received 34% in an online survey. In a phone survey, Teamsters favored Trump over Harris, 58% to 31%.

Trump attorneys argue Jack Smith's obstruction charges be dismissed citing Supreme Court's 'Fischer' decision,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-attorneys-argue-jack-smiths-obstruction-charges-dismissed-citing-supreme-courts-fischer-decision,2024-10-03T23:12:22Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Trump attorneys filed a memo Thursday in support of their motion to dismiss all charges brought against the former president by Special Counsel Jack Smith, discussing the Supreme Court's recent decision in Fischer v. United States, which they believe further supports their argument to dismiss the obstruction charges.

The filing Thursday comes as Trump attorneys are using two blockbuster Supreme Court decisions -- United States v. Trump, which dealt with presidential immunity, and United States v. Fischer, which dealt with obstruction -- to attack the legal theories pressed by Special Counsel Jack Smith.

JUDGE UNSEALS KEY FILING IN SPECIAL COUNSEL'S ELECTION CASE AGAINST TRUMP

Trump attorneys filed a motion to dismiss all charges brought against the former president by Smith last year, but the case was stayed. The filing Thursday is a reply brief to their motion seeking dismissal of all charges.

Trump attorneys in their brief on Thursday said Smith's superseding indictment against the former president, which was filed after the Supreme Court ruled that presidents and former presidents had immunity from official acts, ""seeks to assign blame for events President Trump did not control and took action to protect against.""

""The Special Counsel blatantly ignores the fact that federal prosecutors have taken the opposite position in this District,"" the filing states. ""It is apparently of no consequence, to the Office and those who support their efforts, that former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was caught on a previously undisclosed video accepting 'responsibility' for the events at the Capitol.""

Trump attorneys also argue that General Mark Milley acknowledged, ""long before charges were brought in this case"" that Trump ""had instructed the Defense Department on January 3, 2021 to 'make sure that you have sufficient National Guard or Soldiers to make sure it is a safe event.""

TRUMP BLASTS DOJ FOR 'ELECTION INTERFERENCE,' CALLS JACK SMITH CASE A 'SCAM' AFTER JUDGE UNSEALS KEY FILING

Trump was charged with count 1: conspiracy to defraud the United States; count 2: conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; count 3: obstruction of an attempt to obstruct an official proceeding; and count 4: conspiracy against rights.

Trump attorneys, though, stressed that Smith and federal prosecutors ""cannot ignore or hide from"" new precedent from the Supreme Court's decision in Fischer v. United States, saying it is ""another key application of the rule of law to reject lawfare overreach targeting President Trump.""

""Fischer requires the dismissal of Counts Two and Three of the Superseding Indictment, and its logic fatally undermines Counts One and Four as well,"" the filing states.

U.S. v. Fischer stems from a lawsuit filed by Joseph Fischer -- one of more than 300 people charged by the Justice Department with ""obstruction of an official proceeding"" in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. His lawyers argued that the federal statute should not apply, and that it had only ever been applied to evidence-tampering cases.

The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in favor of a participant in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot who challenged his conviction for a federal ""obstruction"" crime.

In a 6-3 decision, the high court held to a narrower interpretation of a federal statute that imposes criminal liability on anyone who corruptly ""alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding.""

The ruling reverses a lower court decision, which the high court said swept too broadly into areas like peaceful but disruptive conduct, and returns the case to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, who will have the opportunity to reassess the case with Friday's ruling in mind.

SUPREME COURT RULES IN FAVOR OF JAN. 6 CAPITOL RIOT PARTICIPANT WHO CHALLENGED OBSTRUCTION CONVICTION

""Under Fischer, the Office [of Special Counsel] may not use the statute as a catchall provision to criminalize otherwise-lawful activities selectively mischaracterized as obstructive by those with opposing political views,"" the filing states, noting that the Fischer decision ""requires proof of evidence impairment coupled with corrupt intent.""

""Once stripped of President Trump's official acts subject to immunity and protected First Amendment political advocacy, the Superseding Indictment lacks sufficient factual allegations to support either element as required by Counts Two and Three,"" Trump attorneys argue. ""President Trump expressed sincere and valid concerns about the integrity of the 2020 election pursuant to his authority as the Chief Executive.""

Trump attorneys said Trump was ""part of open, public discussion regarding use of contingent slates of electors in a manner consistent with historical practice and contemplated by the then-existing version of the Electoral Count Act.""

""The congressional record from January 6 reflects lawful debates on certificate objections contemplated by the ECA, as well as acknowledgment of the historical precedent for the contingent slates,"" they argued. ""There is no precedent for a criminal prosecution based on such a record.""

Trump attorneys said Smith's office ""cannot establish the required nexus between alleged obstruction and any 'evidence' used in the certification proceeding, or that anyone acted with corrupt intent.""

TRUMP TRIAL STEMMING FROM JACK SMITH'S PROBE DELAYED PAST ELECTION DAY

Trump attorneys also said the Fischer decision ""forecloses the Office's efforts to rely on events at the Capitol on January 6 to support charges."" They said the ""superseding indictment does not sufficiently allege that President Trump impaired, or intended to impair, the integrity or availability of any document or other object used in any official proceeding.""

Meanwhile, when the Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts, Smith was then required to file another indictment against Trump, revising the charges in an effort to navigate the Supreme Court ruling. The new indictment kept the prior criminal charges but narrowed and reframed allegations against Trump after the high court's ruling that gave broad immunity to former presidents.

Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges in the new indictment as well.

Last month, Chutkan said she would not hold the trial for Trump on charges stemming from Smith's Jan. 6 investigation until after the 2024 presidential election. She set deadlines for replies and paperwork from federal prosecutors and Trump's legal team for Nov. 7 -- after Election Day."

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., tells ""One Nation"" that security failures regarding former President Trump are a ""scandal of the highest order.""

More than 400 national security and foreign policy officials, ex-Cabinet members, retired military officers and Gold Star families endorsed former President Trump on Thursday.

In an open letter organized by former National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien and former NSC Chief of Staff Alex Gray, the signatories condemn the ""repeated failures"" of the Biden-Harris administration's foreign policy and urged Americans to re-elect Trump.

""From a world at peace under President Trump, we are closer to a third world war than ever before under the Biden-Harris Administration,"" the letter states. ""With multiple escalating wars around the world, an open border that allows terrorists to flood into the American homeland, and malign actors like China operating unabated, U.S. national security has been profoundly damaged by the failed policies of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.""

The endorsement was signed by several prominent officials from the Trump administration, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Attorney General Bill Barr, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and former 2024 Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, and many more.

TRUMP'S 2ND TERM FOREIGN POLICY LIKELY TO FOCUS ON 'STRENGTH' AND 'DETERRENCE': EXPERT

Eleven family members of the 13 American troops killed at Abbey Gate at Kabul's airport during the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan also signed the letter, which praised Trump's foreign policy record in contrast to Biden's controversial actions.

""When President Trump took office, the war in Afghanistan had dragged on for almost 16 years. By February 2020, a peace agreement was reached, ensuring no American soldier was killed in combat until the end of the Trump Administration. This agreement held strong because the Taliban understood President Trump's resolve and U.S. forces were prepared to ensure their compliance,"" the letter reads.

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

""The botched withdrawal from Afghanistan under the Biden-Harris Administration in 2021, led to the unnecessary deaths of thirteen brave American troops at Abbey Gate and left untold billions of dollars of high grade military equipment to the Taliban, making it the most well-armed terror organization in the world.""

Additionally, 40 retired U.S. ambassadors, 75 retired senior military officers and several hundred officials from previous Republican administrations signed the letter, praising Trump's diplomatic efforts on cease-fire agreements between Turkey and Kurdish fighters in Syria and the Abraham Accords. The letter refers to Trump as a ""peacemaker.""

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

""Securing peace is in the greatest tradition of American foreign policy and the Judeo-Christian principles upon which our nation was founded,"" the letter continues before quoting from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew. ""Jesus said, 'blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be sons of God.' (Matthew 5:9) Such is the legacy of the Trump Administration.""

Writing on X, O'Brien said he was ""honored"" to join his colleagues from the Trump administration in ""supporting a return to a 'peace through strength' foreign policy under President Trump.""

Another signatory, Dr. Jerry Hendrix, former director of the Secretary of the Navy's Advisory Panel, said it ""wasn't a hard decision"" to attach his name to the letter.

""Trump had 1 of the more successful foreign policy presidencies since the Cold War,"" Hendrix wrote on X. ""He ended sequestration. He invested in the Navy. The Biden-Harris admin has been one foreign policy debacle after another.""

Tim Walz attempts to clarify remarks he made about being in Tiananmen Square during the 1989 pro-democracy protests during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., has been called out so many times for false claims, one news outlet warned it may unravel his public image.

CBS debate moderators confronted the governor during his vice presidential debate with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Tuesday regarding Walz's claim that he had been in Hong Kong in May 1989 during the Tiananmen Square protests, when he actually traveled to Asia in August, a few months later.

Politico observed this is part of a history of factual inaccuracies Walz has told about his past, in an article headlined, ""Tim Walz has a tendency to misspeak. It may haunt the campaign.""

""Since being tapped as Kamala Harris' running mate, the folksy, plain-speaking Minnesota governor has had to explain a growing number of inaccurate statements -- and at times embellishments -- about his past,"" Politico's Meredith Lee Hill and Mia McCarthy wrote. ""They range from comments about his military service to his visit to Hong Kong more than three decades ago to clarifying that his family didn't specifically use in vitro fertilization.""

BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT TELLS DR. PHIL HE SAW 'PANIC' ON WALZ'S FACE DURING KEY DEBATE MOMENT

""It's unclear whether Walz's verbal errors will undercut his credibility with voters. But the need to continually clean up those claims could politically hurt Walz and Harris, who are locked in a tight race with Donald Trump and JD Vance,"" the reporters added.

""And in some cases, key members of Harris' circle weren't aware of some of the inaccurate statements until they became public despite the vetting process, according to four people familiar with the conversations who were granted anonymity to discuss the matter.""

The writers said, ""Walz's misstatements could contradict the image that the campaign has painted of him as an upstanding, everyday Midwest guy.""

During the debate, Walz responded to a question about his Tiananmen Square claim by speaking about how he ""grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies 'til the streetlights come on,"" then described joining the National Guard and becoming a teacher. He glossed over his trips to China but acknowledged, ""I've not been perfect, I'm a knucklehead at times.""

When confronted again by one of the moderators for not answering the question, he conceded he ""misspoke"" about the Tiananmen timeline.

The day after the debate, Walz told reporters during a campaign stop in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, ""Yeah, look, I have my dates wrong. I was in Hong Kong in China in 1989... I speak like everybody else speaks. I need to be clearer.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

A spokesperson for the campaign defended Walz's record to Politico, noting he ""cares deeply about democracy.""

""As the governor has said, he sometimes misspeaks. He speaks like a normal person and speaks passionately about issues he cares deeply about, including democracy and stopping gun violence in our school,"" the Harris-Walz campaign said, adding former President Trump and Vance ""repeatedly lie and mislead about their plan to ban abortion nationwide"" and other topics."

U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia Tanya Chutkan unsealed Smith's 165-page filing, in which Smith argues that Trump is not immune from prosecution for his alleged criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results. Smith submitted the document after the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts.

""Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one,"" Smith wrote. ""Working with a team of private co-conspirators, the defendant acted as a candidate when he pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt, through fraud and deceit, the government function by which votes are collected and counted -- a function in which the defendant, as President, had no official role."" ...Read more

Melania Trump's abortion views in new memoir spur outrage from pro-lifers: 'She is wrong',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trumps-abortion-views-new-memoir-spur-outrage-from-pro-lifers-she-wrong,2024-10-03T20:43:32Z,"Former first lady Melania Trump opens up about her life before, during and after the White House in a sit-down interview on 'Fox & Friends.'

Former first lady Melania Trump is drawing heat from pro-life advocates over an excerpt in her memoir where she suggests a woman's right to choose an abortion is a ""fundamental right of individual liberty,"" according to a report Wednesday.

Melania Trump wife of Republican presidential candidate and former President Trump, wrote the memoir entitled ""Melania"" that is scheduled to come out on Oct. 8, per the Amazon release date. In the book, according to a preview by The Guardian, Melania expresses a viewpoint that has historically been at odds with the Republican Party's platform.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Melania reportedly wrote.

TRUMP RISKS LOSING SOME PRO-LIFE VOTERS UNLESS HE CHANGES 'HIS TUNE' ON ABORTION, ACTIVIST WARNS

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

The excerpts quickly drew the ire of pro-life advocates who have already been disgruntled by some of Trump's seemingly ambiguous comments regarding abortion.

""Melania Trump's support of abortion is anti-feminist and clearly outside the teaching of our Catholic faith. She is wrong,"" wrote Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America advocacy group.

PRO-LIFERS BLAST TRUMP 'BETRAYAL' WITH SHIFTING ABORTION STANCE, ANSWER ON FLORIDA AMENDMENT 4

Lila Rose, founder of leading pro-life advocacy group Live Action, also responded to a promotional video Melania posted for her memoir in which she states, ""Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard... what does my body my choice really mean?""

""Who is this Melania Trump, or Kamala Harris? Functionally the same exact position on abortion,"" Rose wrote on X.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

President of pro-life advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, wrote on X: ""The women of America are capable of great strength and creativity. They are naturally inclined to speak for those who are powerless. Abortion is not the source of their freedom and liberation.""

In August, Trump sparked confusion among pro-life supporters about where he stood on an amendment that would upend Florida's ban on abortions after six weeks' gestation. Trump, after saying ""I think the six-week is too short, there has to be more time,"" to an NBC reporter when asked how he would vote, later walked it back and said he would vote against the amendment.

Other spouses of Republican presidents, such as Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush, have been recorded either during or after their husbands' tenure in office expressing pro-choice views.

Judge rules that Biden admin violated environmental law in halt of border wall construction,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-rules-biden-admin-violated-environmental-law-halt-border-wall-construction,2024-10-03T20:08:04Z,"National Border Patrol Council VP Art Del Cueto and co-founder of Speak Georgia Inc., Janelle King react to VP Harris' border trip in three years and compare border policy of Trump versus Harris.

A federal judge ruled in favor of a southern border rancher who had argued that the Biden administration had violated environmental law in it's ""haste to reverse its predecessor's border policies"" in 2021.

An Arizona rancher, Steven Smith, was part of the lawsuit, Massachusetts Coalition for Immigration Reform et al. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, challenging the Biden administration. The suit claimed that the Department of Homeland Security had failed to conduct a mandatory review required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) before halting border wall construction, a key Trump-era project.

Under NEPA, a federal agency must conduct an Environmental Assessment to determine whether a federal action has the potential to cause significant effects on the human environment, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

After a two-day bench trial, Judge Trevor McFadden of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a ruling on Friday that Smith ""suffered concrete and particularized injuries"" as a result of DHS not meeting the requirements of NEPA.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH 'TERRORISM TIES' WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLOIT BORDER, HOMELAND SECURITY REPORT WARNS

The Trump-appointed judge also concluded that the actions taken by DHS, such as ending the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, resulted in indirect effects relating to population growth.

Smith testified that migrant activity on his ranch had ""dramatically increased"" after President Joe Biden was elected, and that he had begun seeing illegal immigrants on his property multiple times a month and finds trash on a daily basis.

Smith claimed that the trash left by the migrants has had negative impacts on the environment, as well as on his own cattle, which were eating the litter.

The rancher also testified that water for cattle and other wildlife was a very scarce resource and that migrants were taking it from a trough on his land. According to court documents: ""While this may aid thirsty trespassers, it causes Smith to lose 'thousands and thousands of gallons of water,' which 'can take [him] days and days and days to regain.""

The judge ruled that Smith, a Cochise County resident, ""suffered tangible harms"" caused by the migrant crisis and is entitled to relief after illegal immigrants ""trespassed onto his land, stole his water, and trashed his property.""

""At trial, Smith proved as a matter of fact that his harms traced to migrants who reacted predictably to DHS's decisions,"" the ruling reads."

Tuesday night's vice-presidential debate offered a refreshing change from the combative tone that has plagued our political discourse over the past eight years.

For many viewers, it was a relief to witness a civil exchange between two candidates who, surprisingly, seemed to respect one another. Sen. JD Vance showcased his skills as both an orator and debater, garnering a more favorable opinion from many voters.

On the other hand, Gov. Tim Walz, while appearing somewhat nervous and lackluster, managed to connect with viewers through his likability and relatability. The unfortunate reality, however, is that neither candidate did enough to change any votes.

VANCE VS. WALZ DEBATE LEAVES AMERICANS WITH THIS BIG TAKEAWAY

So, what can we take away from this debate?

Despite various pundits highlighting the strengths of the two vice presidential candidates, Tuesday night's debate ultimately had little impact on undecided voters. While Walz's performance had its successes, his nervous start and notable gaffes left much to be desired. In the end, both candidates offered a little something for everyone -- but for those still weighing their options, there were no compelling reasons to change their minds.

As we approach the final stretch of the presidential election, the challenge for both candidates and their running mates is clear: how can they win over undecided voters in just 33 days? The answer lies in two crucial areas:

Given the current economic climate, this task may be easier for former President Donald Trump, especially in light of the anticipated repercussions from the port strike and escalating energy prices due to turmoil in the Middle East.

That there is a leader in office who has their backs. Voters are understandably anxious about the future, and both candidates have already tapped into this concern -- Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz highlighting the threats to democracy and Trump and Vance focused on the difficulties we face with the economy and immigration.

In turbulent times marked by international conflicts, rising prices, and the aftermath of natural disasters, that message of hope and stability is not just important; it is essential.

As the clock ticks down to Election Day, the ability to inspire confidence and reassure voters will determine the next leader of this nation."
'The View' co-host Joy Behar accuses Melania Trump of lying about her abortion stance: 'It's a big scam',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/the-view-co-host-joy-behar-accuses-melania-trump-lying-about-her-abortion-stance-its-big-scam,2024-10-03T19:50:17Z,"""The View"" co-host Joy Behar said Thursday that former first lady Melania Trump was lying about her abortion stance, which she revealed in her memoir, and said it was a ""scam"" to appease voters.

""Sixty-two percent of Americans oppose overthrowing Roe v. Wade, 62%, the Republican Party knows this. I think they put her up to this. I think it's a big scam. They put her out there, you know, as the face of, like, the American population that wants to have abortion rights,"" Behar claimed.

Melania reveals in her new memoir that she is pro-choice, according to reports. The former first lady doubled down on what she wrote in a video posted to social media on Thursday and said, ""Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth. Individual freedom. What does my body my choice really mean?""

""I think that this is just a big lie,"" Behar said. ""I don't buy it.""

MELANIA TRUMP TO RELEASE FIRST MEMOIR, WILL REVEAL STORIES AND PHOTOS 'NEVER BEFORE SHARED WITH THE PUBLIC'

The other co-hosts also had their theories about the former first lady's stance, given that former President Trump expressed support for the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin agreed that it was a ""strategic"" move.

""I think she hates him. Okay, so we can all agree that. That's a given. I also think that she wants to take him out. She does not want to be the first lady anymore. She doesn't want to be the first lady. She destroyed the Rose Garden. Who hates Christmas? Melania Trump hates Christmas. She doesn't want to decorate for Christmas. She doesn't want anything to do with him. She doesn't want to sleep in the same room with him. She can't tolerate him,"" Hostin suggested.

The audience applauded Hostin after she claimed that Melania wanted to take out her husband.

Whoopi Goldberg chimed in to say ""allegedly"" following Hostin's statements.

""I really think that this is her way of undercutting his bid for the presidency because then she doesn't have to deal with him anymore,"" the host added. ""I think that she wants to take him out and she's doing a pretty damn good job with that.""

The former first lady wrote in her memoir that a woman's fundamental right of ""individual liberty"" grants her the right to have an abortion if she wishes.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Melania wrote, according to reports.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life,"" she continued.

The office of Melania Trump did not respond to a request for comment."
Emhoff denies report he slapped ex-girlfriend outside ritzy overseas movie event,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/emhoff-denies-report-he-slapped-ex-girlfriend-outside-ritzy-overseas-movie-event,2024-10-03T19:27:11Z,"MSNBC host Jen Psaki asked Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff about redefining the view of masculinity by openly supporting his wife Vice President Kamala Harris.

Second gentleman Doug Emhoff denied the veracity of a Daily Mail report in which three unnamed sources accused him of having slapped a former girlfriend during a 2012 trip to the Cannes Film Festival.

Fox News Digital has not been able to independently confirm the allegations.

""This report is untrue,"" an unnamed representative for Vice President Kamala Harris' husband told news outlet Semafor. ""Any suggestion that he would or has ever hit a woman is false.""

The Daily Mail's exclusive story on Tuesday quoted a trio of unidentified sources who claim Emhoff slapped his then-girlfriend while the couple waited in a valet line following an event in Nice, France, in 2012. The alleged altercation was purportedly sparked when the woman - identified only by the pseudonym ""Jane"" and described as a successful New York attorney - flirted with a valet, according to the article.

The Harris campaign, the Office of the Vice President and a representative for Emhoff's ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, did not comment despite repeated requests from Fox News.

Several media outlets, including Semafor, noted they had been unable to match the Daily Mail's reporting and legacy media companies such as the New York Times have yet to report on the claims.

The Daily Mail's article hinged on the recollections of three people described as being Jane's friends. The outlet said its sources requested anonymity due to fear of retaliation from Emhoff. The three friends reportedly provided the outlet with a photo of the pair when they were still a couple, as well as itineraries and correspondence between Emhoff and Jane to substantiate that they made the trip to France in May 2012.

'HE IMPREGNATED HIS KID'S NANNY': PSAKI RIPPED AFTER CLAIMING EMHOFF 'RESHAPED' MASCULINITY

One of the sources is described by the Daily Mail as a female New York attorney who learned about the alleged incident from Jane.

""He hauled up and slapped her so hard she spun around,"" the source is quoted as saying. ""She said she was in utter shock. She was so furious, she slapped him on one side, and then on the other cheek with the other hand.""

Another friend, described by the Daily Mail as a New York businessman, told the outlet Jane called him sobbing following the alleged incident.

PROGRESSIVE WOMEN'S GROUPS SILENT ON SECOND GENTLEMAN DOUG EMHOFF'S AFFAIR

""It was very clear what she was telling me,"" that source said, according to the Daily Mail. ""She said she was with a guy, her date, she was at the Cannes Film Festival, and he hit her. She was in the car with the guy at the time.""

The male friend said he learned more details about the alleged episode after the initial phone call.

""It was something like 3 a.m. They were trying to get out of there and they both had been drinking. There was a gigantic line for taxis,"" he told the outlet. ""She went up to one of the valet guys, offered him 100 euros or whatever, to get to the head of the line. She told me she put her hand on his shoulder. Doug apparently thought that she was flirting, and came over and slapped her in the face.""

A third friend, described as a female executive, told the Daily Mail that she learned of the alleged incident in 2014, and purportedly found out new details from Jane in 2018, when Harris, then a senator from California, made headlines with her questioning of a Supreme Court nominee who had been accused of sexual assault.

""[She] is a gorgeous, strong woman and you would never expect somebody to hit her,"" the third friend told the Daily Mail. ""When he hit her she hit him back, like, 'Don't you ever do that again,'""

KAMALA HARRIS' HUSBAND DOUG EMHOFF 'RESHAPED THE PERCEPTION OF MASCULINITY': MSNBC HOST

The third Daily Mail source added: ""I asked her if he ever apologized. She said 'no,' but he commented about the hit she gave him. It was a tennis metaphor. But no apology at all.""

All three friends told the outlet that Jane hit Emhoff back after the alleged initial slap. They also claimed that Jane tried to leave the valet area after the alleged slap, but that Emhoff got into a cab with Jane.

Jane and Emhoff had been dating for about three months before the reported trip to France, according to the friends. Emhoff allegedly cut the trip short and returned to the U.S. for his daughter's birthday at the end of May, and never saw Jane again, the friends told the outlet.

Emhoff's alleged relationship with Jane unfolded after his 2008 divorce from his first wife and before his 2014 marriage to Harris.

The New York Post on Wednesday slammed Emhoff as ""Worst Gentleman"" in its cover story detailing the Daily Mail's article.

Emhoff is fresh off of a Sunday sit-down interview on MSNBC during which Jen Psaki celebrated him as having reshaped ""the perception of masculinity.""

""There is also an important, interesting part about how people have talked about your role is how your role has reshaped the perception of masculinity,"" Psaki said. ""I'm not sure you planned on that, but you are an incredibly supportive spouse. Has that been an evolution for you? Do you think that's part of the role you might play as first gentleman?""

Emhoff responded: ""It's funny. I've started to think a lot about this. I've always been like this. My dad's always been like this. To me, it's the right thing to do, support women. It is mutual with Kamala and I. We support each other, we have each other's back.""

DOUG EMHOFF'S EX-WIFE RESPONDS AFTER SECOND GENTLEMAN ADMITTED TO AFFAIR WITH NANNY

He added: ""I've said many times when we lift up women, we support women, whether it's pay equity, child care, family leave, and all of these issues in this post-Dobbs hellscape. Women should not be less than. Women should not have less rights and be treated differently. That's not the American way.""

Clips of the exchange spread like wildfire on social media as critics noted that, in August, Emhoff admitted to having an affair with his family's nanny during his first marriage years ago.

Emhoff's admission came shortly after the Daily Mail published a separate report in August claiming that he got his daughter's nanny pregnant.

The affair occurred before Emhoff's relationship with and eventual marriage to Harris.

""During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side,"" Emhoff said over the summer, acknowledging the affair, but not naming the nanny.

Emhoff and his first wife were married from 1992 to 2008 and share two adult children. Harris married Emhoff in 2014, and helped co-parent his children, who call their stepmom ""mommala.""

"Voters in critical Michigan county focused on economy, candidate character as 2024 race tightens",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/voters-critical-michigan-county-focused-economy-candidate-character-2024-race-tightens,2024-10-03T18:04:18Z,"Voters in Kent County, Michigan, a swing county in one of the most critical swing states, told Fox News Digital about the issues weighing on their mind and whom they support in the upcoming election.

Voters in Kent County, Michigan, could play a large role in determining who wins November's presidential election, but many voters in the area are still undecided about their choice.

""I think there is too much division in his country. I think people on the left and people on the right hate each other a lot and I don't think that's right,"" said one Kent County voter, who told Fox News Digital he is still undecided.

The comments come as Kent County, which includes Michigan's second-largest city of Grand Rapids and much of the surrounding area, figures to play an outsized role in November.

While Michigan is well-known as one of the seven key swing states in the upcoming election, Kent County figures to be one of the key counties. Holding over 6% of the state's population, the county has traditionally been known as a conservative haven.

TRUMP TAKES NFL, NBA TO TASK ABOUT KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM

However, that trend has started to reverse itself in recent years, starting when former President Barack Obama was able to capture the county in 2008. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, won the county during his presidential bid in 2012, while former President Donald Trump took Kent County in 2016. It went back to Democrats in 2020, when President Biden was able to capture this important part of Michigan.

This year's race promises to feature Kent County again, though some voters there remain unconvinced by the candidates.

""Something which stood out to me about Trump is that he didn't bring us into any wars,"" one undecided voter said before noting that he believed Vice President Kamala Harris' ""stance is a lot clearer on LGBTQ rights.""

Immigration stood out as an issue to some Kent County voters, with one telling Fox News Digital the issue was a matter of human rights.

""People having the rights to be in our country and the rights to health care,"" said0 the voter, who indicated he was voting for Harris.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

""Hopefully she can bring down housing costs and pretty much just inflation for young people like myself,"" he added. ""Trying to buy a house, trying to get loans and cars and things like that is very important for people of my age.""

However, another voter disagreed on the economy, arguing Trump is the right candidate to lead the country forward.

""I believe that a person who has run a company, that's been in business, can do a better job than a lifelong politician in terms of making decisions,"" the voter said.

That voter also indicated support for Trump on foreign policy, arguing he garnered the respect of world leaders.

""I think he was not afraid to stand up for what he felt is right,"" he said. ""I think other world leaders took note of that.""

Another voter, who indicated foreign policy was a key issue, disagreed.

""One candidate gets it and the other doesn't,"" the voter, who indicated support for Harris, told Fox News Digital of the reason he is voting for Harris.

""She understands the importance of our standing on the global stage, international politics, and our national security. I don't think Trump understands that,"" the voter continued.

Yet others had more trouble picking a candidate, most notably because of the divisive nature of modern politics.

""One day I'll go one way and another day I'll go another way,"" one undecided voter told Fox News Digital.

""It's hard to take her seriously, nothing sticks out about her,"" she said on Harris, while also noting that he finds it ""very hard to believe"" that someone as rich as Trump "" could care about people that don't have any money.""

The voter also deducted points from Trump because of the ""tone of his voice.""

""The name calling, I don't particularly care for that,"" the voter said."
Over 1.7M migrants who could pose national security risk arrived in US during Biden admin: report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/over-1-7-million-migrants-who-could-pose-national-security-risk-arrived-us-biden-admin-report,2024-10-03T17:49:57Z,"FIRST ON FOX: More than 1.7 million migrants have been encountered at the U.S. border and have come from countries that officials believe pose a national security threat to the United States, according to a new House report.

The report by the House Judiciary Committee says the number of ""special interest aliens"" (SIAs) came from a congressional staff briefing by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials. SIAs are those who have come from countries identified by the U.S. government as having conditions that promote or protect terrorism or potentially pose some sort of national security threat to the U.S.

In 2019, the DHS defined an SIA as ""a non-U.S. person who, based on an analysis of travel patterns, potentially poses a national security risk to the United States or its interests. Often such individuals or groups are employing travel patterns known or evaluated to possibly have a nexus to terrorism.""

HARRIS VISITS CRUCIAL BORDER STATE AS IMMIGRATION RECORD SPARKS SCRUTINY: A TIMELINE

""DHS analysis includes an examination of travel patterns, points of origin, and/or travel segments that are tied to current assessments of national and international threat environments,"" it said.

The House report says that there are currently 26 special interest countries, including Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Syria and Turkey. The agency recently removed 11 countries from the list and added 12 others, including North Korea, China and Venezuela.

The U.S. has seen numerous Chinese and Venezuelan nationals in particular, with nearly 300,000 Venezuelans encountered at the border this fiscal year so far and more than 73,000 Chinese nationals.

Border Patrol sources have previously told Fox News they have extreme concerns about people coming across from special interest countries, given they have little to no way to vet them. Unless they have committed a crime in the U.S. or are on a federal watch list, agents have no way of knowing their criminal history because their countries do not share data with the U.S., so there is nothing to match their name against when authorities run their fingerprints.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH 'TERRORISM TIES' WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLOIT BORDER, HOMELAND SECURITY REPORT WARNS

The committee said that DHS told the committee that being a national from a special interest country does not affect a migrant's admissibility into the U.S., although officials have previously stressed that all migrants are vetted using a multi-layered process that includes biographic and biometric information.

As an example of the risks that can be posed by the release of SIA migrants, the committee pointed to the case of Mohammad Kharwin, who was released into the U.S. and later on bond by an immigration judge despite potential terror ties. The DHS located and rearrested him two weeks later. DHS has since agreed to a voluntary departure of Kharwin from the U.S., and he is currently in ICE custody.

""Congress must take seriously its efforts to secure the border and stop the weakening of U.S. national security,"" the report said.

""As the case of Mohammad Kharwin exemplifies, the Biden-Harris Administration has sown chaos at America's borders and allowed potential national security and counterintelligence threats to enter the United States -- and, at least in Kharwin's case, be released into the country multiple times,"" it said.

The report found that there were around 98,000 SIA encounters in FY 21, which went up to 482,705 in FY 22, then 597,058 in FY 23 and 531,768 in FY 24 so far. Of those, most were encountered at the southern border, with 95,705 southwest border encounters of special interest aliens in fiscal year 2021; 465,664 in 2022; 566,079 in 2023; and 504,215 in 2024 so far.

The increase in SIAs has come amid an ongoing debate about the southern border and how to tackle it. The Biden administration has pointed to a sharp drop in encounters since June, which it attributes to a June presidential proclamation which limited the number of asylum entries into the U.S.

According to those numbers, encounters between ports of entry have decreased by more than 50%, and DHS has removed or returned more than 131,000 individuals to more than 140 countries, including operating more than 400 international repatriation flights.

""In that period, DHS has almost tripled the percentage of noncitizens processed for Expedited Removal, and the percentage of releases pending immigration court proceedings is down nearly half. Total removals and returns over the past year exceed removals and returns in any fiscal year since 2010 and a majority of all southwest border encounters during the past three fiscal years resulted in a removal, return, or expulsion,"" Customs and Border Protection said in a release last month.

It has also called for the passage of a bipartisan Senate bill that would increase funding to border agencies, including for detention beds, and would also place limits on migrant entries into the U.S. Conservatives have said it would codify high levels of illegal immigration.

Vice President Kamala Harris visited the border in Arizona last week and hammered former President Donald Trump for his lack of support for the bipartisan bill. However, Republicans have noted that the House passed a sweeping border security bill last year, but the Senate has yet to pass that either.

Cruise passengers go wild hiding rubber ducks on ships in viral game of hide-and-seek,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/cruise-passengers-go-wild-hiding-rubber-ducks-ships-viral-game-hide-seek,2024-10-03T17:13:07Z,"Stewart Chiron, a Miami-based cruise industry expert known as ""The Cruise Guy,"" tells Fox News Digital the reasons why cruise passengers are sailing now, more than any other time in history.

Travelers onboard cruise ships around the world are taking a new approach to souvenirs by bringing -- and leaving -- rubber ducks around boats.

The trend has people purchasing rubber ducks and hiding them in spots around cruise ships. Over the last year alone, TikTok videos garnering thousands of views show users hiding and finding ducks like it's a game.

In one Facebook group, named ""Cruising Ducks,"" which has more than 284,000 members, the trend is described as a ""cute and entertaining way to have a blast on cruises and to brighten others' days.""

HUGE RUBBER DUCK APPEARS IN MAINE HARBOR, AMUSES RESIDENTS: 'IT'S WONDERFUL'

Reports say that a young girl named Abby Davis started the Easter-egg-like idea -- and it has since taken off.

The Facebook group explains, ""Our goal is to see how far our ducks will travel and where their journey might take them. Keep or hide, you decide, but please post your ducks' travels here so everyone can enjoy.""

Members are then asked to post a photo of their rubber duck onboard a ship and to specify which cruise line they are on.

TRAVELERS REFLECT ON VIRAL 9-MONTH-LONG WORLD CRUISE THAT TOOK OVER TIKTOK

In the last month, roughly 3,500 posts have been featured on the Facebook page.

One person posted a photo of their children, writing, ""Kids came back with 20ish ducks. They loved finding them! Carnival Dream, September 21-29.""

Another person posted a photo of their 113 ducks found on the Carnival Cruise Lines Jubilee in September, saying they had five ""active hunters"" on the boat and brought over 400 to hide themselves.

TRAVEL EXPERTS REVEAL BEST TIME TO FLY BEFORE A CRUISE AND WHY

The trend has made its way to Reddit as well, with one traveler posting on the ""r/royalcaribbean"" subreddit, saying they paid for a carry on just for their rubber duckies.

Reddit users took to the comments to weigh in on the offbeat trend, with one person writing, ""I hate to be a killjoy, but there's really no reason for it. Just go on the cruise and enjoy what's already there.""

Another user explained that hiding and finding ducks on the ship was a fun activity for their kids on sea days when the boat didn't stop at ports.

""My daughter works on the Utopia of the Seas and loves finding these! When her contract finishes, she plans to hide all the ducks she has collected around the ship,"" another Reddit user commented.

Cruising Ducks also has its own line of rubber ducks that can be purchased to take onboard cruise ships.

For anywhere from $14 to $26, customers can purchase different types of themed ducks -- Dorothy, Glinda the Good Witch, ""The Godfather"" and even Donald Trump.

RIP Never Trump GOP. Vance's dominant debate is beginning of the end,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rip-never-trump-gop-vances-dominant-debate-beginning-end,2024-10-03T16:51:04Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Ever since former President Donald Trump became the GOP presidential nominee in 2016, there has been a small but loud group of so-called Republicans in the media and the halls of power who have fervently dreamed of the day when he loses his hold on the party.

Until the vice-presidential debate, these MSNBC ""conservative"" pundits and figures such as former Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. Mitt Romney could have hoped that if Trump face plants this year, the GOP will finally come back to its senses and put them back in charge.

Sen. JD Vance put that theory squarely to bed onstage in New York City.

WHY VANCE EASILY BEAT WALZ IN DEBATE, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE IN THE PROCESS

Though polling varies, by most accounts, Vance scored a win over Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (not to mention the wildly biased moderators) with his command of the issues and a surprising affability that even seemed to have Walz charmed at times.

But it was the substance, not the style of Vance's answers that should worry the Never Trump crowd. Because Vance, for maybe the first time, is a major political figure who is not Donald Trump, but who can explain and embody Trump's populism even in the loftiest forums.

The cover of Time magazine this week acknowledged this with a portrait of Vance and the words, ""The New Right,"" which is, in fact, another term for the changes that Trump has wrought in the GOP.

Trumpian populism, or the New Right, has four essential pillars erected by Trump: anti-globalism, a strong border, energy independence and taking the fight to wokeness. On all four, Vance made the case.

The Ohio senator spoke of bringing manufacturing home with smart tariffs, balancing climate change with the need for cheap fuel, aggressive deportations of illegal immigrants, and has throughout his career been a strong voice against the excesses of wokeness in areas like education and gender.

It is a stark contrast to Trump's former veep, the old guard, establishment-friendly Mike Pence, who notably, is not supporting his old boss this time around.

If Pence served as a drawbridge to traditional Republicans, Vance is like a high castle wall, protecting the core tenets of the New Right from would-be interlopers wishing to return to the days of Romney and Cheney.

In Vance, we saw a future for Trumpian populism in the absence of its creator. And it's not just JD, all of the up-and-comers on the GOP bench largely embody the substance of the New Right, if not exactly Trump's tactics.

When we look at businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis; all essentially embrace the New Right. Even former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, whose supporters Democrats have hoped to pluck, realizes that the vast majority of Republican voters want Trump's New Right policies.

Notwithstanding the fact that the GOP's turn to the populist side is now complete, we see groups like ""Republicans for Harris"" touring the country, doing Zoom calls, and they clearly have some real money behind them. What they lack is any semblance of popular support.

Today, we can see that Never Trumpism was never really about mean tweets, or womanizing, or threats to democracy. No, from the start, the stalwart Never Trumpers opposed Trump and the voters' priorities and preferred policies.

On immigration, they want compromise, not a strong border. On trade, they want big global deals, not protectionism. On energy, they seek to appease the alarmists. And when it comes to wokeness, well, they really just don't want to talk about it.

If you put aside the Never Trump movement's weird sense of entitlement and nonstop moral outrage, you can understand why they are upset. Their brand of neoliberalism, the chamber of commerce GOP of the Bushes is no more.

If Pence served as a drawbridge to traditional Republicans, Vance is like a high castle wall, protecting the core tenets of the New Right from would-be interlopers wishing to return to the days of Romney and Cheney.

On its face, it would seem that the best options for the Republicans for Harris are to simply become Democrats and try to keep the party of Jefferson and Jackson from careening into a leftist ditch. That's similar to the way they always played defense when they were in power in the GOP.

But, if they do that, they lose their value. They can no longer be used by the liberal media to pretend some large swath of conservative voters is against Trump. They become, in a word, irrelevant.

After Vance's performance against Walz, it is fair to say that irrelevance is already upon the Never Trumpers. They saw the future and it is not them. The fight is finally over."
Ohio GOP Senate candidate Moreno hits Brown on Inflation Reduction Act vote in ad that's part of $25M buy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ohio-gop-senate-candidate-moreno-hits-brown-inflation-reduction-act-vote-ad-thats-part-25m-buy,2024-10-03T16:19:51Z,"FIRST ON FOX - Ohio Republican Bernie Moreno is hitting incumbent Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown on his Inflation Reduction Act vote in a new ad that's part of a $25 million new buy ahead of Election Day.

The 30-second ad spot, which will run on television and digitally, opens with a single mother from Versailles, Ohio, saying she can't believe the current prices for groceries.

""It's a lot tougher to provide for my kids with the Democrats' inflation,"" the woman, Carla, says. ""Sherrod Brown's only made things worse. Brown supported Kamala, not us, and voted for her radical Inflation Act, and now prices are at a 40-year-high. Bernie Moreno will fight to lower prices and stop inflation. That's why I trust Bernie Moreno to help Ohio families.""

The ad, first obtained by Fox News Digital in advance of its planned roll out, also includes the message on screen: ""Sherrod Brown voted for Kamala's Inflation Act.""

It was paid for by Bernie Moreno for Senate and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

""Hardworking Ohioans are suffering under the record-high inflation created by Kamala Harris and Sherrod Brown,"" Moreno said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""While he claims to fight for Ohio, families are unable to afford basic necessities. In November, we will send him packing and get our economy back on track.""

Moreno's campaign told Fox News Digital that the ad is part of an additional $25 million in spending. It comes just 33 days before the Nov. 5 election. Early voting in Ohio starts Oct. 8.

The contest is on track to be the most expensive Senate race this cycle, with $310.4 million in spending from both campaigns as of August, according to Axios.

As of August, Moreno shelled out $158.4 million and Brown spent $152 million, Axios reported.

Brown's campaign announced Wednesday it will report raising nearly $31 million in the third quarter.

Fox News has labeled the race between Moreno and Brown as a toss-up.

Fox News Digital reached out to Brown's campaign and congressional office for comment about the new ad but did not immediately hear back.

Ohio is center stage on the presidential ticket this cycle with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, as former President Trump's vice presidential running mate. Moreno ran against Vance in the 2022 GOP Republican primary for Senate, which Vance won, and has supported the Trump-Vance bid for the White House.

In August 2023, on the one-year anniversary of President Biden signing his Inflation Reduction Act into law, Brown's campaign issued a statement championing the legislation as having included ""key priorities Brown fought for to save Ohioans money, crack down on Wall Street stock buybacks, and attract investment and good-paying jobs to Ohio.""

""The Inflation Reduction Act is already saving Ohioans money at the pharmacy counter and spurring Ohio to lead the country in manufacturing the technology of the future - and those cost savings and Ohio jobs will only grow in the coming years,"" Brown said in a statement at the time.

As of August 2024, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) in the Midwest - which includes Ohio - rose by 2.6% over the last 12 months.

As President Biden spends a second straight day surveying damage and getting briefed on recovery and relief efforts in the storm-damaged Southeast, he's once again coming under political attack from former President Trump.

As the death toll from Hurricane Helene climbs to close to 200 people, with hundreds still missing, millions still without power or running water, and damage estimated in the billions, Trump took to social media on Thursday morning to paint Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as incompetent.

""Kamala and Sleepy Joe are universally being given POOR GRADES for the way that they are handling the Hurricane, especially in North Carolina,"" Trump charged in a social media post. ""It is going down as the WORST & MOST INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED 'STORM,' AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, EVER SEEN BEFORE.""

Trump, who's locked in a margin-of-error race with Harris with less than five weeks to go until Election Day in November, has been attacking the vice president and her boss over the federal response to the powerful storm for nearly a week.

BIDEN, HARRIS, INSPECT STORM DAMAGE WITH TRIPS TO SOUTHEAST

And with two of the hardest hit states - North Carolina and Georgia - two of the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, the hurricane has become front-and-center in the White House race.

Trump this past weekend accused the president of ""sleeping"" at his beach house in Delaware as the storm blasted the Southeast.

NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS FIGHT FOR THEIR SURVIVAL

And speaking with reporters as he arrived in Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday to survey storm damage and bring relief aid, the former president charged that ""the federal government is not being responsive.""

And he falsely claimed that Biden had not spoken with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a conservative Republican.

Pushing back against the political attacks, Biden has noted that he was on the phone with federal, state and local officials throughout the weekend and returned to the nation's capital on Sunday afternoon to monitor storm rescue and relief efforts.

""We had over 1,000 federal personnel, including search and rescue teams, at the ready on the ground before it hit,"" the president said on Tuesday. ""Over the past several days, I've been in regular contact with the governors, the mayors, the county officials, and all the affected areas. That includes Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Virginia.

And Biden emphasized that his administration has sent ""every available resource that we have at our disposal to the affected region"" and pledged ""we'll be there until this work is done.""

More than half of the deaths from the storm are in North Carolina, where entire communities in the western part of the state were demolished by fast-moving waters.

As the floodwaters from the storm receded, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper lamented that, in the western part of his state, ""communities were wiped off the map.""

The president on Wednesday was in North Carolina, where he surveyed damage from a helicopter flight over the city of Ashville, one of the hardest hit areas. Biden also visited a rescue command center in the state before also stopping in neighboring South Carolina.

""My top priority is to ensure the communities devastated by this hurricane get the help and support they need as quickly as possible,"" Biden told reporters Tuesday as he spoke during a Cabinet meeting focusing on the federal response.

And the president ahead of his trip to the region green-lighted the use of up to 1,000 active duty troops to support relief efforts.

And huddled with Democratic and Republican politicians from the region on Wednesday, Biden emphasized that ""in a moment like this, we put politics aside, at least we should put it all aside. We have here - there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans - our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and as thoroughly as we can.""

Trump on Sunday attacked Harris for attending ""fundraising events with her radical left lunatic donors"" in California over the weekend. And he argued that Harris ""ought to be down in the area"" where the storm caused destruction.

On Monday during his stop in Georgia, Trump repeated the dig, saying, ""The vice president, she's out someplace campaigning looking for money.""

The White House has highlighted that the vice president over the weekend was on the phone with federal, state and local officials.

Harris said on Saturday that she and the president ""remain committed to ensuring that no community or state has to respond to this disaster alone.""

On Monday, Harris visited FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] headquarters in Washington, D.C., where she received a briefing on relief and rescue efforts.

""We will do everything in our power to help communities respond and recover,"" Harris vowed.

Harris on Wednesday traveled to Georgia to survey the impacts of the storm and receive an on-the-ground briefing and provide updates on the federal response.

""We are here for the long haul,"" Harris told residents in Augusta, Georgia. ""There's a lot of work that's going to need to happen over the coming days, weeks, and months, and the coordination that we have dedicated ourselves to will be long-lasting to get families, to get residents, to get neighborhoods back up and running.""

Harris was originally scheduled to take part Wednesday in a campaign bus swing through central Pennsylvania, another key battleground state, with her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

With the vice president headed to Georgia, Walz headlined the bus tour, which came the day after he faced off in the running mates debate against Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, the GOP vice presidential nominee.

During his Monday stop in Georgia, Trump highlighted that ""I've come to Valdosta with large semi-trucks, many of them filled with relief aid. A tanker truck filled up with gasoline, a couple of big tanker trucks filled up with gasoline, which they can't get now. And we'll be working to distribute it throughout the day.""

And a GoFundMe page set up by the Trump campaign earlier this week has raised over $4 million so far for storm victims.

""I'm committed to traveling to the impacted areas as soon as possible, but I've been told that it would be disruptive if I did it right now. We will not do that at the risk of diverting or delaying any of the response assets needed to deal with this crisis,"" Biden told reporters on Monday.

And Harris said on Tuesday, ""I plan to be on the ground as soon as possible - but as soon as possible without disrupting any emergency response operations, because that must be the highest priority and the first order of business.""

But the optics of Trump's Monday stop in Georgia may have put some political pressure on Biden and Harris.

Longtime Republican strategist David Kochel said Trump had been ""very aggressive"" with his quick trip to the storm-damaged region.

""I think he put a lot of pressure on them to try to do something,"" Kochel, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, told Fox News. ""He's out there pushing a line that they don't care - they're not doing anything and I think they're reacting to it.""

The response by elected officials to natural disasters can impact their political standing.

President George W. Bush was heavily criticized in the summer of 2005 for his initial response to Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans.

And Trump faced criticism early in his White House tenure as Puerto Rico struggled to recover from a powerful storm. The president was pilloried for throwing paper towels to the crowd as he stopped by a relief center during a storm-related visit to the island."
CBS News host says there's 'warning lights' in Georgia for Kamala Harris,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-news-host-says-theres-warning-lights-georgia-kamala-harris,2024-10-03T16:01:32Z,"CBS News host Tony Dokoupil said on Wednesday that there were some ""warning lights"" in Georgia for Vice President Kamala Harris while speaking to voters across the state.

""We heard a whole lot of Trump support,"" the CBS host said, referring to conversations he had in Forsyth County, Georgia, which he described as a ""Republican stronghold"" the Trump campaign was counting on.

Dokoupil visited three Georgia towns for the ""CBS Mornings"" segment, and noted that President Biden won the state in 2020 by a small margin, after Donald Trump won in 2016. The host added, ""There are warning lights for Kamala Harris.""

""I feel like he aligns more with America and American values than she does,"" an Atlanta voter told Dokoupil. ""I just know that once you start doing away with things like the Second Amendment and altering it to your own, what you think is sensible, it's a problem because then who's the arbiter of that?""

'THE VIEW' HOST ADMITS WALZ 'DROPPED THE BALL' DURING VP DEBATE: 'WASN'T IN FIGHTING MODE'

CBS News cited a poll that showed Trump ahead of the vice president in Georgia by two percentage points. A recent Fox News poll found that Harris leads Trump in the state by three points.

""To me, he's more for the people, the hard-working people,"" one voter said.

Another told CBS that she did like her life more when Trump was in office.

Other voters Dokoupil spoke to in Georgia felt that Harris was the clear choice in the presidential contest.

""Democrats are focused on actual issues that are of concern to Americans, and solving the systemic problems that we all face,"" a voter in Atlanta said.

""I wouldn't vote for him even if it -- if it meant another $100,000 in my pocket,"" another voter, who just moved to Georgia from California, told CBS.

The CBS News host also spoke to voters in Peach County, which voted for former President Obama twice, and for Trump once.

While some said they were undecided, one man expressed that he planned to vote for Harris and explained that he drove his neighbors, who are Republican, to the polls.

""You, Greg, a Democrat, drive a Republican to the polls, thereby putting Donald Trump over the top and making him president again. If you knew that was what you would be doing, would you still do it?"" Dokoupil asked the voter, raising a hypothetical.

""I would make sure they get to the polls because I believe in the right to vote and the responsibility to vote more than I believe in my own candidate,"" the voter responded."

Nervous Democrats in Michigan suffering 'PTSD' and 'paranoia' over 2016 as election day nears: Report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nervous-democrats-michigan-suffering-ptsd-paranoia-over-2016-election-day-nears-report,2024-10-03T13:27:18Z,"Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss his reaction to Kamala Harris reportedly losing support in Michigan and his take on key Senate races ahead of November.

Some Michigan Democrats are worried about a repeat of Hillary Clinton's loss in the state as election day nears and Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump remain neck-and-neck in the polls, according to reports.

""Smart Democrats have a healthy sense of paranoia,"" Michigan Democratic strategist Adrian Hemond told the Associated Press (AP). ""If polling is as far off as it was in 2016, we're cooked.""

A new poll released by the New York Times and Siena College found Harris had 48% support in Michigan and Trump had 47%. Clinton narrowly lost Michigan to Trump in 2016, making her the first Democrat to lose the state since Michael Dukakis in 1988.

Hemond noted that in 2016, some polls did not show how much support Trump had in Michigan.

""Anyone who's from Michigan knows that, if you believe the polling, like, I got a bridge I'm going to sell you somewhere,"" Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., and a candidate for Senate, told the AP.

""Democrats' financial resources absolutely dwarf anything that the Republicans have,"" former GOP Michigan Gov. John Engler told the outlet. ""But Trump is making stops in locations that have never had presidential visits before, and those are impactful with margins this close.""

Slotkin reportedly said during a recent virtual fundraiser that Harris was ""underwater"" in Michigan, although it's typical for candidates to stoke fears of losing among their base to drive up fundraising.

5 key details in special counsel Jack Smith's Trump election case filing,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/5-key-details-special-counsel-jack-smiths-trump-election-case-filing,2024-10-03T13:13:59Z,"Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett on a judge unsealing a key filing in Special Counsel Jack Smith's election case against former President Trump.

A federal judge on Wednesday unsealed a key filing from special counsel Jack Smith's updated election interference case against former President Donald Trump.

U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia Tanya Chutkan unsealed Smith's 165-page filing, in which Smith argues that Trump is not immune from prosecution for his alleged criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results. Smith submitted the document after the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts.

""Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one,"" Smith wrote. ""Working with a team of private co-conspirators, the defendant acted as a candidate when he pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt, through fraud and deceit, the government function by which votes are collected and counted -- a function in which the defendant, as President, had no official role.""

The Supreme Court's decision in Trump v. United States held that Smith could not prosecute Trump for the president's alleged use of the Justice Department to look into unproven claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. In response, Smith filed an updated indictment that revised the allegations against Trump to fit within the scope of the Supreme Court's decision.

JUDGE UNSEALS KEY FILING IN SPECIAL COUNSEL'S ELECTION CASE AGAINST TRUMP

In the unsealed filing, Smith told the court that Trump is not immune from the remaining allegations against him and laid out his case for why Trump ""must stand trial for his private crimes.""

Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges brought against him by Smith.

Here are five key details from the special counsel's new filing, which is partially redacted:

In the filing unsealed Wednesday, Smith outlined a ""factual proffer,"" alleging Trump ""resorted to crimes to try to stay in office"" after losing the 2020 presidential election.

""With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,"" Smith wrote.

""His efforts included lying to state officials in order to induce them to ignore true vote counts; manufacturing fraudulent electoral votes in the targeted states; attempting to enlist Vice President Michael R. Pence, in his role as President of the Senate, to obstruct Congress's certification of the election by using the defendant's fraudulent electoral votes; and when all else had failed, on January 6, 2021, directing an angry crowd of supporters to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification.""

PROSECUTORS REQUEST INDEFINITE DELAY IN TRIAL FOR TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT RYAN ROUTH

Smith claims that the ""throughline of these efforts was deceit,"" alleging Trump and co-conspirators engaged in a conspiracy to interfere with the federal government function by which the nation collects and counts election results, which is set forth in the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act (ECA); a conspiracy to obstruct the official proceeding in which Congress certifies the legitimate results of the presidential election; and a conspiracy against the rights of millions of Americans to vote and have their votes counted.""

Smith claims that several people close to Trump had told the former president his claims of election fraud were ""bulls---.""

According to Smith, in one conversation, an unnamed Trump attorney had told Trump that the campaign was ""looking into his fraud claims and had even hired external experts to do so, but could find no support for them.""

""He told the defendant that if the Campaign took these claims to court, they would get slaughtered because the claims are all 'bulls---,'"" the filing states, with Smith claiming that a lawyer discussed with Trump the investigations and ""debunkings on all major claims.""

For example, the attorney allegedly told Trump that Georgia's audit disproved claims that votes had been altered.

Smith also claims a senior campaign adviser who spoke with Trump on a ""daily basis"" and had ""informed him on multiple occasions that various fraud claims were false"" had complained that Trump was losing his election lawsuits because his lawyers could not back up false claims about the election.

""When our research and campaign legal team can't back up any of the claims made by our Elite Strike Force Legal Team, you can see why we're 0-32 on our cases,"" the campaign adviser allegedly wrote.

""I'll obviously hustle to help on all fronts, but it's tough to own any of this when it's all just conspiracy s--- beamed down from the mothership.""

The filing details several alleged interactions between Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence in the days following the election.

Smith details a Nov. 7, 2020, call between Pence and Trump in which Pence allegedly ""tried to encourage"" Trump ""as a friend"" by reminding him that he ""took a dying political party and gave it a new lease on life.""

Smith also details a private lunch between Trump and Pence on Nov. 12, 2020, when Pence allegedly gave Trump a ""face-saving option."" That option, according to the filing, was ""don't concede but recognize the process is over.""

In another private lunch between Trump and Pence on Nov. 16, 2020, Pence allegedly tried to encourage Trump to accept the results of the election and run again in 2024. Trump is alleged to have responded, ""I don't know, 2024 is so far off.""

TRUMP TRIAL STEMMING FROM JACK SMITH'S PROBE DELAYED PAST ELECTION DAY

In yet another private lunch on Dec. 21, Pence allegedly ""encouraged"" Trump ""not to look at the election 'as a loss - just an intermission.'"" Later that day in the Oval Office, Trump allegedly asked Pence for advice on what he should do. According to Smith, Pence said, ""after we have exhausted every legal process in the courts and Congress, if we still came up short, Trump should 'take a bow.'""

Additionally, Smith reveals that Trump allegedly showed little regard for Pence's safety during the Jan. 6, 2023 riot at the U.S. Capitol after it became clear that Pence would not support his attempt to stop the certification of the election.

Smith alleges that an unnamed Trump aide, ""upon receiving a phone call alerting him that Pence had been taken to a secure location... rushed to the dining room to inform the defendant [Trump] in hopes that the defendant would take action to ensure Pence's safety.""

Smith writes that instead, after the aide delivered the news, Trump ""looked at him and said only, 'So what?'""

Smith alleges that Trump at multiple times showed complete disregard for those who informed him his claims of voter fraud were false, including Republican elections officials in states where Trump had claimed the election was stolen.

""Election officials, for instance, issued press releases and other public statements to combat the disinformation that the defendant and his allies were spreading,"" Smith wrote. ""At one point long after the defendant had begun spreading false fraud claims, [REDACTED], a White House staffer traveling with the defendant, overheard him tell family members that 'it doesn't matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell.""

Smith goes on to assert that Trump and his legal team ""repeatedly changed the numbers in their baseless fraud allegations from day to day,"" and even ""made up figures from whole cloth.""

TRUMP INDICTED A SECOND TIME IN ELECTION SUBVERSION CASE BROUGHT BY SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH

The special counsel claimed Trump ""was on notice that there was no evidence of widespread election fraud in Arizona within a week of the election"" and claimed Trump also ""had early notice that his claims of election fraud in Georgia were false.""

By the time Trump spoke at his rally on Jan. 6, after Pence had refused to stop the certification of the election, Smith said the former president knew his ""last hope"" to overturn the results was ""the large and angry crowd standing in front of him.""

""So for more than an hour, the defendant delivered a speech designed to inflame his supports and motivate them to march to the Capitol. The defendant told the crowd many of the same lies he had been telling for months -- privately and publicly, including to the officials in the targeted states -- and that he knew were not true.""

Smith argues that based on a ""factbound analysis"" of Trump's conduct, the court should determine that the former president was not acting in his official capacity when he challenged the election results and is therefore not immune from prosecution.

""None of the allegations or evidence is protected by presidential immunity,"" Smith wrote, asserting Trump's ""scheme was a private one.""

""He extensively used private actors and his campaign infrastructure to attempt to overturn the election results and operated in a private capacity as a candidate for office,"" Smith claimed. ""To the limited extent that the superseding indictment and proffered evidence reflect official conduct, however, the Government can rebut the presumption of immunity because relying on that conduct in this prosecution will not pose a danger of intrusion on the authority or functions of the Executive Branch."""
"Virginia Senate debate: Clinton ex-running mate Kaine, GOP challenger Cao spar on immigration, DEI in military",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-senate-debate-clinton-ex-running-mate-kaine-gop-challenger-cao-spar-immigration-dei-military,2024-10-03T13:08:23Z,"Virginia Gov. Glen Youngkin joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the 2024 election as early voting starts in the key swing state.

U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican challenger Hung Cao clashed on the debate stage Wednesday night on a range of issues including immigration, education and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the military.

Kaine, who previously served as governor of Virginia and was Hillary Clinton's vice presidential running mate in 2016, made his case during the hourlong showdown at Norfolk State University on why he should keep his seat in the upper chamber of Congress. The only debate of the campaign focused on national issues and matters that resonate in Virginia and the coastal city of Norfolk, which is home to the country's largest Navy base.

Cao, a 25-year Navy veteran endorsed by former President Donald Trump, criticized COVID vaccine mandates for service members and the Biden-Harris administration's botched Afghanistan withdrawal when asked about the military's collective failure to recently meet recruiting goals. He also criticized DEI efforts.

""When you're using a drag queen to recruit for the Navy, that's not the people we want,"" Cao said. ""What we need is alpha males and alpha females who are going to rip out their own guts, eat them and ask for seconds. Those are the young men and women that are going to win wars.""

VIRGINIA SCHOOL BOARD TO PAY 'WRONGFULLY FIRED' TEACHER WHO REFUSED TO USE STUDENT'S PREFERRED PRONOUNS

Kaine, who is on the Senate Armed Services Committee, responded by saying that railing at DEI ""is a red herring"" and the real challenge is informing more Americans about the benefits of the military when only about 1% of the population serves in the armed forces. ""We need to do a better job of talking about the G.I. Bill and other benefits as well as the tremendous leadership training that you get in the military,"" Kaine said.

Cao, meanwhile, brought up the G.I. Bill when challenging Kaine on student loan forgiveness. The incumbent Democrat had praised the Biden administration for having forgiven ""the loans of more than a million public servants in thanks for the public service they provide, whether it's in the military, whether it's teaching, whether it's working as a frontline health professional or working for a local or state government.""

The moderator then posed a question to Cao on how the Republican candidate would ease the burden, noting that the U.S. Department of Education reports more than a million Virginians owe a collective $43 billion in federal student debt as of last October, impacting their ability to contribute to the state's economy.

""If you're struggling to pay for your school, then get a G.I. Bill,"" Cao said. ""That means go out and serve in the military. You'll get a stipend as well as tuition. We need to fix education, and we need to do it now. But here's the thing with people like Senator Kaine, you've been an officer for 30 years in various offices, in the U.S. Senate for 12. Why have you not fixed it yet?""

VIRGINIA FAA CONTRACTOR ALLEGEDLY SPIED FOR IRAN, SHARED PRIVATE INFO ON US AIRPORTS, ENERGY INDUSTRY: DOJ

Kaine responded by saying Virginia ""was named the best state for a child to be raised in the United States"" and ""the best managed state and the best state to do business"" when he was governor from 2006 to 2010.

""Oh, again, he says what he's going to do,"" Cao shot back. ""Honestly, of the 227 bills that Senator Kaine has proposed, only three of them made it through... That's a 99% failure rate.""

""Check the tape on that. That's completely wrong,"" Kaine insisted.

However, Cao retorted, ""There's two truths in the world, okay? Never walk into a target store wearing a red shirt and never go against an Asian when it comes to math. Trust me.""

""He's got a 99% failure rate,"" Cao added. ""If I just had 99% failure rate, and I defused bombs, I wouldn't be here right now.""

The moderator also pressed Cao, whose family fled Vietnam during the 1970s, on whether he supports the mass deportation of ""all undocumented immigrants.""

""When Vietnam fell, we had nowhere to go, and America had brought us in and my parents waited in line for seven years. We all did for seven years to get our citizenship. The last thing that my dad had [hung] over his bed when he passed away two years ago was his naturalization certificate. I love this country so much that I wrote a blank check - up to including my life - to defend it for 25 years in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia and other parts of the world,"" Cao said. ""Here's my thing to anybody who wants to come here, don't ask for an American dream. If you're not willing to be American laws and embrace the American culture, because I did.""

""If you come here illegally, then you need to leave, especially if you're a violent crime person,"" Cao said, citing new Immigration and Customs Enforcement data provided to lawmakers last week.

""There are 13,000 convicted murderers and 16,000 convicted rapists that came across under their watch. That's unacceptable. We need to protect Americans every single day,"" Cao said.

""If you came here illegally, you've basically screwed up the whole system,"" Cao said. ""You can't jump the line - I mean, you go to Costco and jump the line, what do you think is going to happen? You can't come here and expect the American dream if you're not willing to obey the American laws and embrace the American culture.""

""Deport anybody that's committing crimes right now,"" he added. ""That's the first thing we need. Secure the border.""

Kaine said he never supported mass amnesty but believes it would ""devastate the economy"" to deport the 10 million illegal immigrants who crossed the border during the Biden-Harris administration - a figure the moderator cited and the Democratic candidate echoed. He also slammed former President Donald Trump for asking Republicans to oppose the last congressional border deal.

""We recently negotiated a very tough border deal that would have put a lot of resources on the border to stop illegal immigration,"" Kaine said. ""President Trump asked for Republicans to oppose it, even though it was supported by the border control union.""

Another subject was Trump's proposal to place more tariffs on imported goods.

""What we need to do is not tax our industry here,"" Cao said. ""What we need to do is tax other countries bringing in goods.""

Kaine criticized Trump's proposal. ""The Trump tariffs would be a massive tax that would cause prices on all of these items that are imported to go up,"" Kaine said. ""On that, I differ strongly from my opponent.""

With Kaine's seat considered solidly Democratic, the race has not seen the kind of dead-heat polling as the national presidential contest or the high-stakes drama of other Senate races such as those in Montana and Ohio, where Democratic incumbents face tough re-election bids, according to The Associated Press.

Trump has endorsed Cao, and political scientists say his path to victory is narrow given Virginia's moderate electorate, aversion to Trump in 2020 and Kaine's salience with voters, according to the AP.

Kaine won his last race in 2018 by 16 percentage points, although he said he was preparing for a tough race this year. The most recent Republican from Virginia to hold a U.S. Senate seat was the late John Warner, a centrist with an independent streak who last won in 2002.

MSNBC host shocked as impeachment witness says Trump regained his support: 'So striking!',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-host-shocked-impeachment-witness-says-trump-regained-support-striking,2024-10-03T13:01:10Z,"MSNBC host Ari Melber shouted in disbelief after a former Trump official who testified against him in the first impeachment said he supports the former president due to 'how badly' the Biden-Harris administration has gone.

Gordon Sondland, who served as then-President Trump's ambassador to the EU and who became a star witness against him in his first impeachment, shocked an MSNBC host by saying Trump won his support once again.

MSNBC host Ari Melber spoke with three former Trump officials, including White House advisor Peter Navarro, White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews, and Sondland about topics such as how working for the Trump administration has impacted their lives or what the most important thing was that they learned about the former president. Sondland in particular was asked whether he stands by a previous disavowal of the president after the events of January 6, 2021.

""No, I don't stand by it, and I'll tell you why,"" Sondland began. ""I've now lived four years under the Biden-Harris policies and I have to say that those policies are not only becoming an existential threat to our country's way of life, but to our allies as well.""

The host loudly interrupted him and began shouting, ""I'm going to let you finish, but this is so striking. You said it was a 'no for me' after that, after January 6. And here we are right now, And you're saying it's a yes for you?""

""It is a yes, for me. It is an absolute yes for me,"" Sondland said. ""That is how badly the Biden-Harris team have prosecuted their job.""

Melber continued speaking at a loud volume during the exchange: ""But the whole point you seem to be making was that January 6th and that kind of attack on democracy is bigger than any policy-""

""I am seeing so many attacks on democracy that eclipse January 6th,"" Sondland replied, encouraging Melber to ask him what those are. Earlier in the same panel, he had voiced his concerns about a future scenario where ""if the Democrats are able to impose their desired program over the next several years, there will be massive voting irregularities.""

"Wisconsin poll shows Harris leading Trump by 4, former president ahead on key issues",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wisconsin-poll-shows-harris-leading-trump-4-former-president-ahead-key-issues,2024-10-03T11:47:44Z,"Dr. Linda Lee Tarver, a member of Black Americans for Trump, joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss former President Trump's popularity among the Black faith community in Michigan ahead of Election Day.

Vice President Kamala Harris is maintaining her lead over former President Trump in Wisconsin despite Trump leading on the key issues, according to a Wednesday poll.

The new poll from Marquette Law School finds Harris leading Trump in a 52%-48% match-up. The poll also found that voters are deeply invested in the election, with 46% of respondents saying they have stopped talking to someone about politics due to the presidential race.

Marquette conducted the survey from Sept. 18-26, polling 882 Wisconsin registered voters and 798 likely voters. The poll advertises a margin of error of 4.4%.

Despite trailing in the polls, Trump leads Harris in the top issues in the race, including border security, the economy, and handling the Israel-Hamas war.

Trump enjoys a sizable 49-37% lead over Harris on immigration. Meanwhile, 50% of Wisconsinites say he will handle the economy better than Harris, with the vice president getting just 42% support. Trump also enjoys a 45%-33% lead when it comes to Israel's conflict in the Middle East. He also has a narrow lead over Harris when it comes to foreign relations more generally.

Harris does have a lead over Trump in a number of other issues, however, namely abortion and election concerns. Roughly 53% of respondents said they trusted Harris to handle the former, compared to 36% for Trump. Another 49% said Harris would be better for ensuring a fair and accurate election, compared to Trump's 39%.

Wisconsin is among a handful of swing states that are likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. Other states like Ohio and Pennsylvania are also critical to either a Trump or Harris victory.

Pennsylvania in particular is one of the tightest contests in the nation, where Harris leads Trump in a razor-thin 49%-47% match-up, according to new data from AARP.

Stop the insanity. Our national debt now tops $35 trillion...,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/stop-insanity-national-debt-now-tops-35-trillion,2024-10-03T10:06:48Z,"They know entitlement programs feature benefit promises far exceeding their tax base, but have done nothing to make them sound. Meanwhile, both parties demand more spending increases -- despite the national debt soaring to $35 trillion, or more than $100,000 for each American, rich and poor alike. Under rosy assumptions, over $20 trillion in debt is projected to be added over the next decade.

Yet despite the foreboding outlook, the major presidential campaigns have no plan to deal with current structural deficits and are outbidding each other to make them worse. For them, the buck stops elsewhere. That may be good short-run politics, but it will only make the inevitable bill bigger and even harder for everyday Americans to pay.

TRUMP, HARRIS BLASTED FOR IGNORING EXPLODING BUDGET DEFICIT, AS ECONOMISTS PLEAD WITH BOTH TO 'GET REAL'

Some argue tax cuts are to blame for the soaring debt. But as data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office shows, revenue has remained largely stable while spending has grown significantly above prior levels.

Much of the growing debt is baked into the budgetary cake, and experts have long warned about rising costs when the Baby Boom generation retires. But growing Social Security payouts -- long ago engineered to rise faster than prices -- are only part of the problem. Soaring health spending, driven by the same demographic factors and compounded by exploding medical costs, is an even bigger challenge.

America's mountain of debt has been exacerbated by massive so-called emergency spending enacted by both parties. During the pandemic, legislation added over $5 trillion to the debt. Now the nearly $1 trillion in annual interest on the debt exceeds all federal spending on children, and defense spending, too.

Efforts to balance the budget are repeatedly dismissed. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, one of us regularly proposed and passed balanced budgets, only to see hope for such discipline overcome by a desire for ever-greater spending. Important-sounding commissions (including one dubbed the ""supercommittee"") issued detailed recommendations that were mostly ignored.

Experts produced reams of data showing nations deep in debt inevitably reach a financial crisis, even as proponents of modern monetary theory (MMT) argued no amount of spending is too great. According to MMT advocates, the federal government can always print more money.

Americans have already experienced where inaction and that illogic lead. During the pandemic, former Obama Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warned that massive new federal spending would lead to significant inflation, which is exactly what happened, with prices growing 20% since the start of the Biden-Harris administration.

The Federal Reserve's response led to the highest interest rates in two decades, helping drive the monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home up by over $1,000. Lower-income Americans spend a greater share of their income on housing, so such rising costs are just one example of why they tend to suffer most from inflation and higher interest rates.

Yet despite expressing concerns about inflation, both presidential tickets propose even bigger deficits. In fact, they seem to be in a bidding war to make them worse. Former President Donald Trump proposed exempting tip income from federal taxes, and Vice President Kamala Harris quickly followed suit. Both ignored the 10-year costs of this proposal, which stretch into hundreds of billions of dollars.

Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance suggested more than doubling today's $2,000 child tax credit to $5,000, which Harris one-upped by proposing $6,000 payments in a child's first year. Senator Vance hasn't spelled out important details of his plan, but we know most of Harris's plan comprises bigger benefit spending instead of tax relief. Both proposals would cost over $1 trillion during the next decade.

Yet despite the foreboding outlook, the major presidential campaigns have no plan to deal with current structural deficits and are outbidding each other to make them worse. For them, the buck stops elsewhere. That may be good short-run politics, but it will only make the inevitable bill bigger and even harder for everyday Americans to pay.

Neither campaign has a plan to cover the new costs. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, counting their economic effects, Trump's plans would increase deficits by $4 trillion versus Harris's $2 trillion. But that assumes Harris doesn't revive the massive spending plans she promoted as one of the most liberal members of the Senate. Her plans included a ruinously expensive Medicare-for-all proposal, along with $2,000-per-month stimulus checks for most Americans costing $21 trillion. If you believe a Harris administration wouldn't revive such proposals during the next economic crisis, you haven't paid attention to recent Washington policymaking.

While both campaigns suggest we can have higher spending and debt alongside lower prices and interest rates, recent experience suggests otherwise. So where does the buck really stop? That is, who will ultimately pay for all this?

The reality is every American will pay, especially those with modest incomes and younger Americans who will suffer the longest from higher taxes, inflation and interest rates. We should demand more from our leaders than promises of bigger giveaways, followed by empty handwringing about the soaring debt and financial pain that inevitably result.

JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Radio show host Charlamagne Tha God on Monday applauded GOP presidential nominee former President Trump's political ad that highlighted Vice President Kamala Harris' support for taxpayer-funded surgeries for trans prisoners and illegal immigrants.

""That ad [Trump] was running during the football games this weekend claiming the vice president supports funding gender transition surgeries for all prison inmates and migrants in the U.S."" Charlamagne Tha God said on Monday during the radio show he co-hosts called ""The Breakfast Club.""

""That was nuts,"" he added.

YOUNG SWING STATE VOTERS DELIVER ADVICE FOR KAMALA HARRIS

The Trump campaign aired an advertisement over the weekend attacking Harris' past support for government-funded transgender surgeries for prison inmates and migrants held in detention facilities.

The narrator in the campaign ad began by saying, ""Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners.""

""Surgery for prisoners. Every transgender inmate in the prison system will have access,"" Harris said in the ad. The ad shows Harris making those comments during an interview with the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE).

The New York Post reported her comments during the NCTE interview were made during the 2020 election cycle as the vice president was doubling down on her position on supporting transgender prisoners.

""It's hard to believe, but it's true. Even the liberal media was shocked Kamala supports tax-payer funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens,"" the narrator in the ad said.

""Kamala's for they/them. President Trump is for you,"" the narrator in the ad said.

The ad concluded with a CNBC headline reading, ""Trump: Lower taxes, bigger paychecks for workers.""

Reacting to the Trump campaign's attack ad, Charlamagne Tha God said that ""that ad was impactful"" and ""effective.""

HARRIS FINALLY ADDS POLICY PAGE TO CAMPAIGN WEBSITE, DEVOTES SEVERAL SECTIONS TO TRUMP

""I don't know if it was the backdrop of football, but when you hear the narrator say Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners. That one line ..."" he said. ""I was like, 'Hell no. I don't want my taxpayer dollars going to that.'""

He suggested Harris counter with her own ads during football games.

The vice president's position was recently resurfaced by CNN, which reported on the presidential candidates' responses in a questionnaire.

When asked by the ACLU if ""as President will you use your executive authority to ensure that transgender and nonbinary people who rely on the state for medical care -- including those in prison and immigration detention -- will have access to comprehensive treatment associated with gender transition, including all necessary surgical care?,"" Harris responded in the affirmative.

""I support policies ensuring that federal prisoners and detainees are able to obtain medically necessary care for gender transition, including surgical care, while incarcerated or detained. Transition treatment is a medical necessity, and I will direct all federal agencies responsible for providing essential medical care to deliver transition treatment,"" she wrote in the questionnaire.

The Harris campaign thas said in the past the ACLU questionnaire is ""not what she is proposing or running on.""

Many of Harris' past positions have been put in the spotlight since she ascended to the top of the ticket after President Biden withdrew from the presidential race."
"Walz's lack of media exposure hurt him in debate, commentators admit: 'Out of practice'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/walzs-lack-media-exposure-hurt-him-debate-commentators-admit-out-practice,2024-10-03T09:19:20Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Several political commentators and critics linked Gov. Tim Walz's debate performance to an overall lack of media exposure following his vice presidential debate performance against Sen. JD Vance.

""I think the lack of interviews he has done with national media, with local media, it showed,"" CNN host Dana Bash, who interviewed Walz in August alongside Vice President Kamala Harris for their first interview since Harris became the nominee, said.

Former President Trump and Vance have done at least 61 interviews since the Harris-Walz ticket was formed, compared to 23 non-scripted interviews for the Democratic presidential ticket thus far.

""I think that Walz did seem unsteady,"" ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl said after the debate. ""And frankly, what I saw is somebody who has not faced questions on a national stage since he became the Democratic nominee. He was simply out of practice. I mean, I don't know why they've done it, but they've kept him out of the limelight. They've kept him away from reporters. They haven't had him do any interviews. And he was clearly unsteady through much of that debate. In contrast, JD Vance was very smooth.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

""Hate to say it but Walz would have benefitted from doing a few Sunday morning shows, as Vance has been,"" Financial Times associate editor Edward Luce said.

Vance has done several appearances on Sunday morning news programs since joining the Trump ticket, including with CNN's Bash, NBC's Kristen Welker, ABC's Jonathan Karl, CBS' Margaret Brennan - one of the debate's moderators - and Fox News' Shannon Bream.

MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell said Wednesday that Walz was ""notably rusty"" due to his lack of media exposure, although she incorrectly said he hadn't done ""any solo interviews"" since he joined the ticket. Walz has done several local TV and radio hits and did interviews on MSNBC and ABC after the Trump-Harris debate last month, but he has done far fewer formal media sit-downs as a running mate than Vance.

Abby Phillip, a host on CNN, said the Minnesota governor was unprepared for Tuesday night's showdown.

""He didn't respond to a lot of the criticisms and attacks that Vance put on the table. He allowed some clear falsehoods to just go completely unanswered,"" Phillip added.

""It took him several sentences to get to the part of his answer, Walz's answer, where he actually responded to that,"" she said. ""I mean, I think there was a clear lack of preparation and execution here on Walz's part.""

GOP flack Matt Gorman said during an appearance on CNN on Wednesday that Vance's prep and interview experience showed through the debate.

""And when you saw with Walz, who hasn't done really many interviews, only really outside of it with Dana Bash, obviously, not having that interview prep, not having the tough questions and the ability to refine your arguments made him a little tougher to kind of pivot out of those trickier subjects,"" Gorman said.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

Politico Magazine's analysis of the debate also said Vance and Walz had different preparation strategies.

""The Democrats' campaign chose a different path for Walz, as well as his running mate -- essentially avoiding tough environments. And it showed. At times, Walz seemed unprepared either to defend himself (such as his whereabouts during the Tiananmen Square protests) or to summon the most effective lines of attack against Vance and Trump,"" the analysis read.

Walz joined MSNBC and ABC for brief appearances after his running mate's debate against Donald Trump. He's also done some interviews with smaller, local news outlets.

Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said he was surprised by the lack of media exposure Harris and Walz have had.

""I've been bewildered a little bit by the absence of both the presidential candidate and the vice presidential candidate on television since they became the nominees, because that's how people get to know you. And they haven't really spent a lot of time with either of them before now,"" Axelrod said. ""He was all over before he became the nominee when he was campaigning for vice president.""

Axelrod concluded that Walz put himself at a disadvantage.

""So I also think that it may be a little bit of a problem for Walz having not done this. Sitting with [the media] is good prep for debates. It's good batting practice for these events. Walz has not been doing it. So I do question that,"" he said, ""It's bewildering.""

The Harris-Walz campaign did not respond to a request for comment."
MORNING GLORY: The VP debate is an example of Kamala Harris's horrible judgment when it comes to picking staff,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-vp-debate-example-kamala-harriss-horrible-judgment-when-comes-picking-staff,2024-10-03T09:09:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The debate between the candidates for vice president -- GOP nominee Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz -- was dominated by Vance, and all but a handful of hardened partisan pundits agree on that conclusion.

Walz wobbled and panicked from the first question -- which everyone in the world knew would be about Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel earlier in the day. Yet Walz still fumbled his response, and it got worse from there until the CBS moderators invoked the unwritten mercy rule for left-wing moderators watching the Democrat melt and tossed Walz some softballs on J6 at the debate's close, by which time the internet was howling and laughing at the Minnesota governor.

There were three important takeaways:

NEW YORK POST CALLS OUT CBS FOR 'RIDICULOUS' FACT-CHECK OF JD VANCE: 'SHAMEFUL MOMENT'

First, Vance is a superb and calm debater and a reassuring figure on the national stage.

Second, Walz is not, and he represents the one big decision Vice President Kamala Harris has had to make since President Joe Biden dropped out. It was a terrible decision. Imagine her Cabinet and White House staff if somehow, she wins.

Third, legacy media is irretrievably broken and cannot be reclaimed from its lurch into rote leftism and extreme partisanship, or even pulled back to a minimum level of seriousness on big occasions.

Do executives at these networks -- ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC -- not see what has happened? Americans don't trust the news divisions at the legacy networks. It's as if those divisions are run by a combination of fresh-from-campus-demonstration interns and hardened partisans from the Obama years.

The CBS debate was not, however, as overtly biased against Vance as ABC's earlier debate was against Trump, but it was still very, very biased against the center-right and conservative audience. Viewers saw the question set veer quickly from a world crisis and the border crisis to get to the left's favorite issue of abortion.

With the world tuning in only hours after Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, the moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan did open with an obligatory round of questions on that crisis. But, after 10 minutes, they plowed on to a quick exchange on immigration and the Biden-Harris massive fail on the relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene's savaging of North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia in order to get to ... abortion, which had been discussed at length in the ABC debate and about which there are zero mysteries.

Three rounds of questions on abortion, really? And three rounds marked by the rote framing favored by the hard left? Predictable but still shocking.

The debate ended in a morass of childcare questions and then the obligatory ""Wasn't January 6th terrible?"" questions.

What a farce. Not one question on China's vast military build-up and its threat against Taiwan and the Philippines. Not one question on the Chinese Communist Party spies shot through our country, including the office of New York's current and past governor. Not one question on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Yes, there was a quick dash through the consequences of more than 10 million illegal immigrants flowing across the southern border under the Biden-Harris regime, but also a quick cut-off when Vance began what was an obviously embarrassing factcheck of the CBS factcheck on the ""legal status"" of the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio. ""We have a lot to get to,"" was the trigger for cutting off anything uncomfortable.

Walz was asked about his lying about his trips to China -- sort of. It was left hanging. A knuckleheaded answer for a knuckleheaded team of debate organizers. Chinese President Xi Jinping is a sort of Voldemort for the networks -- never to be named -- perhaps because ABC and CBS all have corporate ties to companies that must do business there?

Look, whatever votes were moved by the debate moved toward the GOP because Vance hammered that the costs of everything from food to gas skyrocketed under Biden-Harris, gave a quick tutorial on why construction costs have soared and thus the price of houses, and repeatedly reminded the audience of Harris's failure in her job as ""border czar,"" while also stressing the need for more domestic energy production. Tim Walz provided comic relief.

The loser wasn't just Walz though. It was also CBS, which joined ABC in a legacy media hall of shame. When we get back to debates in four years, the good news is the ""debate commission"" is already dead and that, by 2028, the idea of the big networks hosting debates unchecked by center-right moderators will be as well. The candidates will call on C-SPAN and find some fair moderators. Siri could have done a better job in our past two debates this year.

What has to be dawning in the C Suites of networks -- if they are at all self-aware -- is that their product and their talent are awful, and their audiences have already left or will soon leave. Tuesday night was just the most recent example of why."
"Kamala Harris, Liz Cheney to stump at birthplace of Republican Party",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-liz-cheney-stump-birthplace-republican-party,2024-10-03T09:09:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In an effort to win the vote of disgruntled Republicans as she battles former President Trump in the race for the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris is heading to the town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP.

A senior Harris campaign official says that the vice president on Thursday will team up in battleground Wisconsin with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP who became her party's most visible anti-Trump leader.

The campaign event will take place in Ripon, Wisconsin, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

According to her campaign, Harris plans to spotlight the significance of that moment and that place - as she makes another direct appeal to Republican voters frustrated that Trump is their party's presidential nominee - and as she reiterates her pledge to be a president for all Americans.

LIZ CHENEY WEIGHS IN ON WHOM SHE'LL BACK IN THE 2024 ELECTION

Harris is also expected to praise Cheney for her courage and patriotism in putting country over party.

Cheney, at a speaking event in early September at Duke University in swing state North Carolina, announced that she would be voting for Harris in the presidential election.

TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE IN THE 2024 FUNDRAISING FIGHT WITH HARRIS

""As a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this, and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.""

Cheney's father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, also endorsed Harris.

The younger Cheney was once rising in the ranks of House Republican leadership

But she was the most high-profile of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-president Trump in early 2021 on a charge of inciting the deadly Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol, which was waged by right-wing extremists and other Trump supporters who aimed to disrupt congressional certification of President Biden's Electoral College victory in the 2020 election.

The conservative lawmaker and defense hawk immediately came under verbal attack from Trump and his allies, and was eventually ousted from her number-three House GOP leadership position.

WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS WHO ADVISED REAGAN AND BUSH BACK HARRIS OVER TRUMP

Cheney, who has been vocal in emphasizing the importance of defending the nation's democratic process and of putting country before party, was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the riot at the Capitol.

In 2022, she was ousted in the GOP congressional primary in Wyoming to a candidate that was backed by Trump.

Cheney -- who has argued that the former president is a ""liar,"" a ""con man"" and a potential ""tyrant"" who, if elected again, would ""torch the Constitution"" -- vowed after leaving Congress that ""I will do everything I can to make sure [Trump] is never anywhere near the Oval Office again.""

The Harris campaign says that the vice president, at her event with Cheney, plans to note that while Republicans may not agree with her on every issue, she promises to uphold the Constitution, America's fundamental principles, and the rule of law.

The Cheneys are part of a growing list of prominent Republicans who are supporting Harris.

Two other high-profile anti-Trump Republicans -- former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan - had speaking roles at the Democratic National Convention, which was held six weeks ago in Chicago.

And Harris is backed by more than 200 alumni who served in both Bush administrations or worked for the late Sen. John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2008 and 2012 GOP presidential nominee. She's also supported by more than 100 Republican former national security officials and other prominent Republicans.

Ripon is not the only town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP. Exeter, New Hampshire also has some bragging rites, as it was the site of meetings in 1853 - a year ahead of the Ripon gatherings - by disenchanted political leaders who discussed the formation of a new party of Republicans.

But officials in Ripon said the group in Exeter never actually formed a political organization, or chose officials, as they did in Wisconsin.

Wisconsin is one of seven crucial battleground states with razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 White House victory and are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.

With less than five weeks until Election Day in November, Harris and Trump are locked in a margin-of-error race in the key swing states."
"Illegal immigrants with 'terrorism ties' will continue to exploit border, Homeland Security report warns",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-immigrants-terrorism-ties-exploit-border-homeland-security-warns,2024-10-03T09:05:41Z,"Angel mom Agnes Gibboney and Chicago resident Cata Truss slam the Biden-Harris administration for causing the border crisis after the White House claims ICE criminal migrant numbers are 'misrepresented.'

Illegal immigrants with ""terrorism ties"" are expected to exploit the U.S. border as the threat environment remains high, the Department of Homeland Security warned Wednesday.

The agency detailed a number of warnings in its annual Homeland Threat Assessment, which is used to inform local, state and federal agencies about public safety and security threats, saying the ""terrorism threat environment"" over the next year ""will remain high.""

""Over the next year, we expect some individuals with terrorism ties and some criminal actors will continue their efforts to exploit migration flows and the complex border security environment to enter the United States,"" the assessment states.

HARRIS HEADS TO SOUTHERN BORDER LOOKING TO FLIP SCRIPT ON IMMIGRATION CRITICISMS

""Individuals with potential terrorism connections continue to attempt to enter the Homeland at both the US-Mexico and US-Canada borders and also through the immigration system,"" it continued.

There were 172 encounters of nationals on the terror watchlist at the border between ports of entry last fiscal year and more than 560 at the ports of entry.

The report also laid out concerns about violence in response to the 2024 election cycle, which has already seen assassination attempts on former President Trump's life, as well as foreign violent extremists carrying out potential attacks in response to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.

Groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda ""maintain the enduring intent to conduct or inspire attacks in the Homeland and have leveraged the conflict in the Middle East to reaffirm this intent,"" the report said.

""Among state actors, we expect Iran to remain the primary sponsor of terrorism and continue its efforts to advance plots against individuals -- including current and former US officials -- in the United States,"" the assessment warned.

TOP HOUSE COMMITTEE SHREDS BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN ON BORDER CRISIS IN NEW REPORT: 'ASSAULT ON THE RULE OF LAW'

In addition to Iran, China and Russia have increasingly used artificial intelligence to create ""more believable"" text, video and audio to reach American audiences while hiding their origins, the report said.

The terror watchlist, called the Terrorist Screening Dataset, includes known or suspected terrorists, as well as additional individuals believed to pose a potential threat to the U.S. -- including affiliates of individuals on the watchlist.

Despite migrant encounters dipping slightly, they are still arriving in high numbers, ""complicating border and immigration security,"" according to the threat assessment.

""Migrant encounters along the US-Canada border continue to increase, with over 181,000 migrant encounters in FY 2024 through August, compared to about 170,000 encounters at the same time in FY 2023,"" the report said. ""In contrast to the US-Mexico border, many watchlist encounters along the US-Canada border occur at ports of entry, and the vast majority of these individuals have legal status in Canada.""

"Vance-Walz debate: Parkland parent, school safety expert says one candidate closer to the answer",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/vance-walz-clash-crime-america-school-safety-drawing-strong-reaction,2024-10-03T08:08:30Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A school safety expert told Fox News Digital JD Vance and Tim Walz presented two different visions on how to tackle gun violence in America during this week's vice presidential debate, but only one candidate appears to be ""much closer to the answer"" when it comes to protecting children in classrooms.

Vance argued during the debate that ""we have to increase security in our schools"" by adding more school resource officers and making doors and windows tougher to breach. Trump's running mate added that the U.S. also needs to get to the root causes of a ""mental health crisis"" that isn't the ""whole reason why we have such a bad gun violence problem, but I do think it's a big piece of it.""

Walz responded by saying, ""This idea of stigmatizing mental health -- just because you have a mental health issue doesn't mean you're violent. And I think what we end up doing is we start looking for a scapegoat. Sometimes, it just is the guns. It's just the guns. And there are things that you can do about it.""

Ryan Petty, whose daughter Alaina was one of the 17 killed during the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, in 2018, told Fox News Digital after Tuesday's debate that ""in the 6½ years that I have been working on school safety, what I've learned about how we protect our nation's schools tracks much more closely with the response JD Vance gave than anything Tim Walz said.""

TOP 5 CLASHES BETWEEN VANCE AND WALZ DURING DEBATE SHOWDOWN

""I don't even know what he means when he says, 'Sometimes it's the guns,'"" Petty said when asked about Walz's remarks. ""It has nothing to do with guns. The causes of school violence are not the freedoms that we enjoy and the rights that we have under the Second Amendment.

""The problem is much deeper and requires a more comprehensive solution, and JD Vance was much closer to the answer. We got to protect our schools. we got to increase the security there. Having more school resource officers on campus as both a deterrent and a last measure to stop an attack once it starts is exactly the blueprint we followed here to protect Florida schools after Parkland,"" he added.

During the debate, Vance said, ""We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger. And, of course, we've got to increase school resource officers because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience. So, we've got to make our schools safer. And I think we've got to have some commonsense, bipartisan solutions for how to do that.

""Another driver of the gun violence epidemic, especially that affecting our kids -- it doesn't earn as many headlines -- is the terrible gun violence problem in a lot of our big cities. And this is why we have to empower law enforcement to arrest the bad guys, put them away, and take gun offenders off the streets.""

VANCE OOZED CONFIDENCE COMPARED TO JITTERY WALZ DURING DEBATE, BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT SAYS

""We understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out,"" Walz said during the debate.

""In Minnesota, we've enacted enhanced red flag laws, enhanced background checks, and we can start to get data. But here's the problem. If we really want to solve this, we've got folks that won't allow research to be even done on gun violence.

""There are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment and the idea to have some of these weapons out there, it just doesn't make any sense.""

WATCH: WALZ ASKS, DO YOU WANT SCHOOLS HARDENED TO LOOK LIKE A FORT?

""No one's trying to scaremonger and say, 'We're taking your guns.' But I ask all of you out there, do you want your schools hardened to look like a fort?"" Walz added.

Gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety said in a statement after the debate that ""voters heard two starkly different approaches to America's gun violence crisis: JD Vance, who recently called school shootings a 'fact of life' and thinks the solution to the problem is more guns, or Tim Walz, who will work alongside Vice President Harris to make sure our kids come home safe every night.""

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

However, Gun Owners of America, a Second Amendment advocacy group, told Fox News Digital, ""Knives and hammers kill far more often than the guns Kamala and Tim want to ban.""

""Tragedy is never just the fault of an inanimate object. There is always an evil person responsible -- a criminal who would never abide by any gun laws in the first place,"" said its director of federal affairs, Aidan Johnston. ""That's why Gun Owners of America fights to protect our Second Amendment, which empowers law-abiding citizens to fight back and to protect themselves and their loved ones from becoming the next victim.""

Second Amendment Foundation Executive Director Adam Kraut added, ""The Harris-Walz campaign has made clear over and over again their intent to demonize peaceable gun owners and ban and confiscate the most popular guns in America.""

Randy Kozuch, the executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, also told Fox News Digital in a statement that ""Kamala Harris and Tim Walz make up the most anti-gun presidential ticket in modern history.""

"Thousands of noncitizens removed from voter rolls, dozens of lawmakers want answers from Garland",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/thousands-non-citizens-removed-voter-rolls-dozens-lawmakers-want-answers-garland,2024-10-03T08:08:12Z,"FIRST ON FOX: Dozens of lawmakers in the House and Senate are calling for more information from the Justice Department about efforts to stop noncitizen voting in federal elections, which they call a ""serious threat"" to election integrity, citing officials in multiple states who have identified noncitizens on their voter rolls.

A letter from 73 lawmakers, led by Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., and Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland said they were ""deeply concerned"" by reports of noncitizens registering to vote and voting in federal elections and had not received a response from an inquiry in July on the matter.

""As of today, there has been no response from you or your Department regarding the inquiry on July 12, 2024, seeking information on efforts undertaken by your Department to enforce laws prohibiting non-citizen voting. Given that the 2024 Presidential Election is in less than 34 days, your Department's inaction and refusal to provide any information regarding its efforts to promote public trust and confidence in our elections is especially alarming,"" they wrote.

Specifically, they asked how many aliens have been prosecuted under laws related to noncitizen voting, how the DOJ handles allegations of noncitizen voting or registration and the steps it takes to prevent such practices.

Noncitizens are not allowed to vote, and top Republicans, including former President Trump, have repeatedly expressed concern that noncitizens may attempt to vote in federal elections, particularly given the influx of immigrants across the southern border in recent years.

DOJ: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT STOLE US CITIZEN'S IDENTITY TO VOTE IN MULTIPLE ELECTIONS, OBTAIN AMERICAN PASSPORT

In August, Republican lawmakers pushed for the SAVE Act, which aimed to require states to obtain proof of citizenship in person when registering an individual to vote and require states to remove noncitizens from voter rolls, to be attached to a spending bill extension to avoid a government shutdown at the end of the fiscal year.

The lawmakers in the letter cited an announcement by the Virginia attorney general that it had identified 6,303 noncitizens on its voter rolls in 2022 and 2023, while Texas had removed 6,500 noncitizens from its voter rolls. Of those, 1,930 had a history of voting.

The DOJ itself announced last month that it had charged an illegal immigrant with stealing a U.S. citizen's identity to vote in multiple elections and fraudulently obtain a U.S. passport.

""Clearly, there is a non-negligible amount of voter participation by non-citizens in federal elections, which is not only a serious threat to the integrity of our elections and the democratic process they represent, but also has the potential to reduce Americans' trust and confidence in election results,"" they wrote.

ALABAMA ELECTION OFFICIAL SAYS BIDEN EXECUTIVE ORDER GIVES ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 'MECHANISM' TO REGISTER TO VOTE

Lawmakers quizzed the DOJ on information related to the issue in a July 12 request but had not received a response.

It also asks what steps the department is taking to prosecute noncitizens registered to vote in the 2024 election. Fox News Digital reached out to the DOJ for comment.

This week, the DOJ sued Alabama, alleging the state removed voters who had been issued noncitizen identification numbers from its election rolls too close to Election Day. The agency argued that officials violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which requires states to complete any changes to the voter registration lists no later than 90 days before federal elections.

"Why Vance easily beat Walz in debate, softening his image in the process",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-vance-easily-beat-walz-debate-softening-his-image-process,2024-10-03T07:12:39Z,"A panel of Republicans, Independents, and Democrats react in real-time to claims made by Trump running mate JD Vance in reference to 2020's election results during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Credit: CBS)

And there's no question that JD Vance easily won the vice presidential debate. Tim Walz did better than anticipated - perhaps those expectations were deliberately set low - but despite some strong counterpunching, he frequently stumbled.

Each man had a mission: to defend his running mate and rough up the opposing presidential candidate.

But Vance had a second goal beyond talking up Donald Trump, and that was softening his own image. He made a concerted effort to project empathy, to appear reasonable, to be open to opposing viewpoints.

VOTERS REACT TO GOV TIM WALZ DODGING TIANANMEN SQUARE QUESTION: 'I'M A KNUCKLEHEAD AT TIMES'

There is a caricature of the Ohio senator as a hard-right ideologue with little sympathy for women, as reflected by the famous childless cat ladies comment. But when the subject of abortion came up, he went out of his way to sound sympathetic to the pro-choice side:

""I know a lot of Americans don't agree with everything that I've ever said on this topic. And, you know, I grew up in a working-class family in a neighborhood where I knew a lot of young women who had unplanned pregnancies and decided to terminate those pregnancies because they feel like they didn't have any other options. And, you know, one of them is actually very dear to me. And I know she's watching tonight and I love you.

""And she told me something a couple of years ago that she felt like if she hadn't had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship. And I think that what I take from that as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party? We've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us.""

(Vance's website describes him as ""100 percent pro-life."")

Walz countered with specific stories of women who died or whose health was damaged because they lived in states that tightly restrict abortion.

The Minnesota governor hit his talking points, but regularly took a long time to get to his main argument. A question about Kamala Harris' plan to build 3 million housing units produced a detour about how Walz has only bought one home.

WATCH: VOTERS REACT IN REAL TIME TO KEY VANCE-WALZ DEBATE MOMENTS ON IMMIGRATION, DEMOCRACY, ABORTION

Walz often spoke in a clipped shorthand - the ACA, Springfield, Vance creating stories - without explaining, for instance, that he meant the false tale of Haitian migrants eating pets.

The CBS moderators, Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, edged into ABC territory by fact-checking only Vance, despite saying they would try to avoid that. After the senator referred to illegal immigrants in the Ohio town, Brennan said Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected."" That's a point Walz should have made, but didn't.

Many questions were framed from the left. ""Senator Vance,"" said Brennan, ""you oppose most gun legislation that Democrats claim would curb gun violence. You oppose red flag gun laws and legislation to ban certain semi-automatic rifles, including AR-15s.""

Walz's worst moment was one he should have anticipated, a story in the New York Times and elsewhere saying he was not in China for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests as he had claimed, but got to Hong Kong months later. The governor began with a word-salad answer about growing up in Nebraska before retreating to ""I've not been perfect. And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Pressed again, he said he had misspoken.

Vance's worst moment was about Jan. 6. O'Donnell began, ""You have said you would not have certified the last presidential election and would have asked the states to submit alternative electors that has been called unconstitutional and illegal.""

POLITICS HIJACKS HURRICANE DEVASTATION IN THE SOUTH, BIDEN CALLS TRUMP A LIAR

The senator countered that Trump ""said that on January the 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully. And on January the 20th, what happened? Joe Biden became the president. Donald Trump left the White House.""

This time Walz was ready. Trump ""lost this election and he said he did. 140 police officers were beaten at the Capitol that day, some with the American flag. Several later died.""

He turned to Vance and said: ""Did he lose the 2020 election?""

When Vance tried the ""focused on the future"" line again, Walz called that ""a damning non-answer.""

But Vance largely came off as a Bush-style compassionate conservative. He must figure that win or lose, he'll be running for president in 2028 and needed to combat all the negative coverage.

Walz looked like a man who was happy to survive his turn on the national stage. The debate would have looked very different if Harris had picked Josh Shapiro, given that she's tied with Trump in Pennsylvania.

The Harris campaign has bubble-wrapped Tim Walz, not allowing him to do a single solo interview. JD Vance is constantly doing interviews, podcasts and press conferences, the best kind of preparation for a big debate. And that, in the end, may have been the difference."

Former first lady Melania Trump said the 2024 presidential election differs from previous elections because the country is much more divided.

""We are dealing with much more danger,"" she said Wednesday on ""Hannity."" ""And especially, we see what's going on in the world and the threats that we get. And my husband, what he went through in the last few months,"" Melania continued, referring to the two attempted assassination attempts on former President Trump's life.

Would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks fired several shots at the GOP presidential nominee during his Butler, Pa., rally in July before he was shot and killed by a counter sniper.

TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: WHISTLEBLOWERS CLAIM THEY WERE 'WOEFULLY UNPREPARED' TO PROVIDE SECURITY

A few months later, Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old from Hawaii, was spotted by a Secret Service advance agent poking a rifle out of the tree line near Trump's West Palm Beach golf course. He's since been charged with the attempted assassination of a presidential candidate, among a slew of other charges.

Melania told Fox News host Sean Hannity that people need to learn to listen to each other again and respect differences of opinion.

""I think we need to have - we have different perspectives, we have different beliefs. We need to respect our freedom of speech and of our individuality. I think it's very important that ideas are heard, that we have very, very straightforward communications, and we share the idea with debate,"" the former first lady said.

""Because I think with that, we could have innovation and success in this country. I feel it's a troubling trade in this country that we are canceling people that don't agree on certain issues.""

Melania admitted the election cycle is a long and grueling process, particularly in the weeks and days leading up to November, but she's ""in it"" and tries to ""enjoy it"" as much as she can.

""You need to be very focused and take it day by day. Some surprises come as well, so it is very important that you prepare for those surprises,"" she said, adding her calmness is what gets her through Election Day itself.

""That's maybe my personality. And because I know on Election Day, it's all in the people's hands. People decide what they want for this country, and it will be again this year on November 5th.""

'Outnumbered' panel discusses concerns with DOJ releasing Ryan Routh's letter to the public.

Federal prosecutors requested an indefinite delay Wednesday in scheduling the trial for Ryan Routh, the suspect in the second assassination attempt on former President Trump, citing an enormous amount of evidence gathered since his arrest.

In a filing on Wednesday, prosecutors asked Florida District Judge Aileen Cannon to officially designate Routh's case as ""complex.""

Prosecutors revealed the scope of the investigation, which spanned multiple states, involved hundreds of interviews and included hundreds of digital media for review.

""The government has worked diligently since September 15 to investigate the incident. Over the past two weeks, the United States has interviewed hundreds of witnesses,"" the filing said. ""It has also executed 13 search warrants in Florida, Hawaii, and North Carolina, and seized hundreds of items of evidence, including multiple electronic devices.

FEDERAL PROSECUTORS FORMALLY CHARGE SUSPECT RYAN ROUTH WITH ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF TRUMP

Investigators claimed that they have more than 100 outstanding subpoena returns that are still pending, and they estimate that they have ""thousands of videos to review"" from the large volume of electronic devices seized.

TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT WROTE CHILLING LETTER MONTHS BEFORE GOLF COURSE PLOT

""All videos, still images, text files, and audio files constitute approximately 4,000 terabytes (4 million gigabytes) of digital review to complete,"" the filing said.

The filing noted that the FBI is continuing to conduct forensic tests on evidence, including ballistic testing, and fingerprint and DNA comparisons, saying that the evidence would likely include them preparing several expert witnesses to testify.

Due to the sheer amount of evidence collected, prosecutors asked Cannon for the trial to be delayed indefinitely to allow adequate time for parties to review the discovery and determine which motions need to be filed.

FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT ROUTH NOT TO BE RELEASED

The government also requested that the motion deadlines, calendar call, and trial date set be delayed indefinitely. According to the filing, Routh's defense attorneys did not oppose prosecutors' request to delay the trial date.

Routh is facing attempted assassination charges. He was previously charged federally with possessing a gun with a scratched-out number and with possessing a gun illegally as a felon. He was ordered by a federal judge to remain in custody.

On September 15, Routh allegedly hid in the bushes outside Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach with a rifle as Trump was playing.

Authorities said a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of the gun sticking out and immediately opened fire. Routh allegedly took off, but was arrested a short time later."

Tim Walz was supposed to be a normal Midwestern White guy and said this ...

... What? Kamala's right-hand man told 40 million people he has become friends with school shooters, but he wasn't finished. ...

...

Kamala hired a knucklehead who's friends with school shooters to be a heartbeat away from the presidency? You can call that coup insurance. The assistant coach fumbled the ball twice in the first half and never recovered.

The Democrats wanted an attack dog, and they got a bald basset hound nodding along to everything Vance said. Walz kept agreeing that American workers needed to be protected against cartels and Big Pharma. Good. And instead of appreciating American unity, the media said, ""C'mon, coach, just play the race card.""

Civility was a mistake. That's what the Democrats are saying. Walz was Minnesota nice instead of Minnesota nasty. He must not have gotten the memo. You can't be civil to a dictator.

Former President Trump blasted the Justice Department Wednesday for having ""disobeyed their own rule in favor of complete and total election interference"" after a key filing from Special Counsel Jack Smith's election case against him was unsealed with just weeks before Americans cast their ballots.

U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Tanya Chutkan unsealed Smith's 165-page filing Wednesday afternoon. The filing lays out his case and the alleged evidence he intends to use in an eventual trial against Trump.

Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges brought by Smith.

JUDGE UNSEALS KEY FILING IN SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH'S ELECTION CASE

But Trump blasted the Justice Department Wednesday evening.

""For 60 days prior to an election, the Department of Injustice is supposed to do absolutely nothing that would taint or interfere with a case,"" Trump posted in all capital letters to his Truth Social. ""They disobeyed their own rule in favor of complete and total election interference.""

""I did nothing wrong, they did!"" he continued.

DOJ practice during an election year has often been to hold off on major actions in cases that could impact elections during the 60 days leading up to Election Day, an unwritten policy commonly referred to as the ""60-day rule."" The ""rule,"" which is really more of a tradition because it is not an actual rule, has been cited many times in recent years.

""The case is a scam, just like all of the others, including the documents case, which was dismissed!""

Trump was pointing to the other case Smith brought against him related to classified records. The case was tossed out by a federal judge in Florida who ruled that Smith was unlawfully appointed as special counsel.

The former president further blasted Democrats, saying they are ""weaponizing the Justice Department against me because they I know I am WINNING, and they are desperate to prop up their failing candidate, Kamala Harris.""

Trump said the unsealing of the Smith filing, which he called the ""latest 'hit job,'"" happened because his running mate, Sen. JD Vance ""humiliated"" Harris' running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate.

Trump said the Justice Department ""has become nothing more than an extension of Joe's, and now Kamala's, campaign.""

TRUMP TRIAL STEMMING FROM JACK SMITH'S PROBE DELAYED PAST ELECTION DAY

""This is egregious PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT, and should not have been released right before the Election,"" Trump said. ""The Democrat Party is turning America into a Third World Country that tries to censor, harass, and intimidate their Political Opponents. What they have done to our Justice System is one of the Great, All Time, Tragedies.""

The former president added that the Democrat Party ""is guilty of the Worst Election Interference in American History.""

""They are trying to DESTROY OUR DEMOCRACY, allowing millions of people to enter our Country illegally. They are determined to stop us from winning back the White House, sealing the Border, and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BUT THEY WILL FAIL, AND WE WILL SAVE OUR NATION!"" Trump posted.

Trump also blasted Smith as ""deranged,"" and said that he, the ""Harris-Biden DOJ, and Washington, D.C. based Radical Left Democrats, are ""HELL BENT on continuing to Weaponize the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power.""

""'TRUMP' is dominating the Election cycle, leading in the Polls, and the Radical Democrats throughout the Deep State are totally 'freaking out.' This entire case is a Partisan, Unconstitutional, Witch Hunt, that should be dismissed, entirely, just like the Florida case was dismissed!"" Trump said.

Trump's comments came in response to Smith's newly-unsealed filing, in which he alleges Trump ""resorted to crimes to try to stay in office"" after losing the 2020 presidential election.

""With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,"" Smith wrote.

""His efforts included lying to state officials in order to induce them to ignore true vote counts; manufacturing fraudulent electoral votes in the targeted states; attempting to enlist Vice President Michael R. Pence, in his role as President of the Senate, to obstruct Congress's certification of the election by using the defendant's fraudulent electoral votes; and when all else had failed, on January 6, 2021, directing an angry crowd of supporters to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification.""

Smith claims that the ""throughline of these efforts was deceit,"" claiming Trump and co-conspirators engaged in a conspiracy to interfere with the federal government function by which the nation collects and counts election results, which is set forth in the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act (ECA); a conspiracy to obstruct the official proceeding in which Congress certifies the legitimate results of the presidential election; and a conspiracy against the rights of millions of Americans to vote and have their votes counted.""

The Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts.

TRUMP INDICTED A SECOND TIME IN ELECTION SUBVERSION CASE BROUGHT BY SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH

Smith was then required to file another indictment against Trump, revising the charges in an effort to navigate the Supreme Court ruling. The new indictment kept the prior criminal charges but narrowed and reframed allegations against Trump after the high court's ruling that gave broad immunity to former presidents.

Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges in the new indictment as well.

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital the release of the ""falsehood-ridden, unconstitutional J6 brief immediately following Tim Walz's disastrous debate performance is another obvious attempt by the Harris-Biden regime to undermine American Democracy and interfere in this election.""

""Deranged Jack Smith and Washington DC Radical Democrats are hell-bent on weaponizing the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power,"" Cheung said. ""President Trump is dominating, and the Radical Democrats throughout the Deep State are freaking out.

""This entire case is a partisan, Unconstitutional Witch Hunt that should be dismissed entirely, together with ALL of the remaining Democrat hoaxes.""

Walz explains 'friends with shooters' gaffe from the VP debate with Vance,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vance-walz-hit-campaign-trail-battleground-states-hours-after-vp-debate,2024-10-02T22:58:57Z,"YORK, Pa. -- The day after their vice presidential debate in New York City, Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota jumped back on the campaign trail with stops in two crucial battleground states.

As he arrived at the airport near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Wednesday, Walz pointed toward his debate hours earlier with Vance and told reporters, ""New York City was a little crazy last night.""

Most pundits said Vance was the more polished of the two candidates on the vice presidential debate stage Tuesday night, although flash polls indicated debate watchers were mostly divided on which running mate was victorious.

An accidental response by Walz during the debate quickly went viral, as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate mistakenly said he had ""become friends with school shooters.""

2024 CASH DASH: TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE AS HE TRIES TO CLOSE GAP WITH HARRIS

The mishap occurred when Walz was asked about changing positions on banning assault weapons, which he previously opposed but now supports.

""I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it,"" Walz said.

Asked to clarify his debate gaffe, Walz said Wednesday, ""I'm super passionate about this. The question came up about the school shooting. We're talking about everything except school shootings. And I sat as a member of Congress with the Sandy Hook parents, and it was a profound movement.

""David Hogg [a leading gun control activist and school shooting survivor] is a good friend of mine.""

VANCE, WALZ, SPAR OVER ISSUES AT VP DEBATE SHOWDOWN

Walz acknowledged ""I need to be more specific on that. But I am passionate about this.""

Vance, speaking at a rally in Auburn Hills, Michigan, said he didn't hear Walz's comment until he was told about it during a conversation with his running mate, former President Trump, after the debate.

""He said that Tim Walz said that he was friends with school shooters twice,"" Vance said, referencing his conversation with Trump. ""And that's something I actually didn't notice that Tim Walz had said that on the debate stage.

""I said, 'Did he really say that, sir?' And he [Trump] said, 'I'm telling you, man, go and watch the clips.'

HARRIS, BIDEN, HEAD TO STORM-RAVAGED SOUTHEAST IN WAKE OF TRUMP TRIP

""And I said that was probably only the third or fourth-dumbest comment Tim Walz made that night.""

The debate moderators also confronted Walz on his claim to have been in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, China.

Walz admitted he traveled to Asia in August 1989, several months after the April 15 massacre, adding he can be ""a knucklehead at times.""

The governor on Wednesday reiterated that he had his ""dates wrong.""

Trump, in an interview Wednesday with Fox News' Brooke Singman, called his running mate's performance ""fantastic"" and that it had ""reconfirmed my choice.""

The former president also argued that Walz had ""embarrassed himself"" during the debate.

Another major moment in the debate came near the end, when Vance wouldn't say that President Biden won the 2020 election over Trump. The former president for four years has repeatedly made unproven claims that the election was rigged and rampant with voter fraud.

Walz, on Wednesday, once again emphasized that ""it is disqualifying to not acknowledge that the 2020 election was won by Joe Biden. It's as simple as that.""

An hour later, speaking to a large crowd at a rally at the York Fairgrounds, Walz charged that ""you can't rewrite history. And trying to mislead us about Donald Trump's record. That's gaslighting.""

Vance, asked about his avoidance of answering the 2020 election question during the debate, reiterated his charge on Wednesday that ""the simple reason"" is that ""the media is obsessed with talking about the election of four years ago. I'm focused on the election of 33 days from now because I want to throw Kamala Harris out of office and get back to commonsense, economic policies.""

Walz arrived at his rally in York to cheers as he pulled into the York Exposition Center riding his campaign bus.

But York is Trump country. The former president won York County by roughly 25 points over Biden in 2020.

Walz's Pennsylvania swing through Harrisburg, York and Reading kicked off what the Harris campaign described as a more aggressive post-debate travel and voter engagement blitz by the governor, with stops in two other battleground states -- Arizona and Nevada -- and a fundraising blitz in Ohio, California and Washington

And the campaign noted that Walz would participate in more media interviews. Vance has done dozens of interviews and repeatedly fielded questions from reporters on the campaign trail since Trump named the senator as his running mate 2½ months ago.

Vance made the first of his two stops in Michigan in Auburn Hills, at Visioneering, an automotive industry tool supplier.

Auburn Hills is in Oakland County, which has swung heavily toward the Democrats in recent election cycles. Biden carried the county by roughly 14 points over Trump four years ago.

Michigan and Pennsylvania are two of seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Trump or Harris win the 2024 presidential election.

ABC reporter grumbles that it took '90 minutes' in the VP debate before a January 6 question,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-reporter-grumbles-took-90-minutes-vp-debate-before-january-6-question,2024-10-02T22:16:10Z,"ABC News chief Washington correspondent Jonathan Karl said it was ""striking"" that it took 90 minutes for the vice presidential candidates to discuss the Jan. 6 Capitol protests Tuesday night.

It was ""striking"" to ABC News chief Washington correspondent Jonathan Karl that it took 90 minutes into the vice presidential debate before there was a question on Jan. 6.

Karl, along with ABC News White House correspondent Mary Bruce, discussed the aftermath of the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate between Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday. Bruce reported the Harris campaign was already attempting to capitalize on the candidates' comments regarding the Jan. 6 Capitol protests and the 2020 election.

""Yeah, 90 minutes in, they feel that that was the moment that defined this debate. That exchange on January 6, defending the Constitution, In fact, this morning they are rushing to get out an ad on that exchange what Walz called Vance's 'damning non-answer,'"" Bruce said.

Karl expressed his frustration that it took so long to get to the question, considering ""this is not a normal election.""

'THE VIEW' HOST ADMITS WALZ 'DROPPED THE BALL' DURING VP DEBATE: 'WASN'T IN FIGHTING MODE'

""What was striking to me is that you had 90 minutes into this debate before you hit the fact that this is not a normal election, that Donald Trump tried to overturn the last election. And in that last answer, what you saw is JD Vance saying he wouldn't do what Mike Pence did. He wouldn't stand up to Donald Trump if he tried to do it again. He would help him, and he would have helped him last time overturn an American democratic election,"" Karl said.

He added, ""You finally got to that at the end. But, for the first 90 minutes or so, this looked like it is simply a campaign about policy differences. And it's really not, George. It is more than that.""

""It is. It is absolutely stunning, the only time in American history it has ever happened,"" host George Stephanopoulos responded.

During the debate, Walz confronted Vance over his stance on the results of the 2020 election.

""This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen, and it manifested itself because of Donald Trump's inability to say - he is still saying he didn't lose the election,"" Walz said. ""Did he lose the 2020 election?""

""Tim, I'm focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 COVID situation?"" Vance responded.

Walz called it a ""damning non-answer.""

According to the Fox News Debate Dial, the dials for independents and Democratic voters dropped significantly at Vance's answer on whether former President Trump lost the 2020 election, with independents seeing the sharpest decline.

However, many viewers and even New York Times columnists have said they believed Vance ultimately won the debate Tuesday night."

Trump ups his ante with September fundraising haul,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-ups-his-ante-september-fundraising-haul,2024-10-02T20:25:46Z,"Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley expressed confidence to Fox News Digital about having resources to get GOP message to voters.

Former President Trump's campaign said on Wednesday that they hauled in over $160 million in fundraising in September, in figures shared with Fox News.

The haul by the former president's campaign is up from the roughly $130 million that Trump's various fundraising committees brought in during the month of August.

Trump faces a large fundraising deficit to Vice President Kamala Harris, with just under five weeks to go until Election Day in November.

FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AIMS TO FLIP THE SCRIPT ON THE CASH DASH

The Harris campaign announced last month that it raked in a staggering $361 million in August, nearly triple Trump's fundraising.

The Harris campaign has yet to report its September fundraising figures.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS SHOW IN THE 2024 ELECTION

The Trump campaign, in revealing its fundraising numbers, said that it had $283.1 million cash-on-hand as of the end of September. That's down slightly from the $295 million it had in its coffers a month earlier.

The Harris campaign, in its announcement last month, reported $404 million cash-on-hand.

Trump's team, in releasing their latest figures, showcased their small-dollar grassroots fundraising, saying the average donation they received was $60 and that 96% of their contributions were less than $200.

The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee enjoyed a fundraising lead over Trump and the Republican National Committee earlier this year. But Trump and the RNC topped Biden and the DNC by $331 million to $264 million during the second quarter of 2024 fundraising.

Biden enjoyed a brief fundraising surge after his disastrous performance in his late June debate with Trump as donors briefly shelled out big bucks in a sign of support for the 81-year-old president.

But Biden's halting and shaky debate delivery also instantly fueled questions about his physical and mental ability to serve another four years in the White House and spurred a rising chorus of calls from within his own party for the president to end his bid for a second term. The brief surge in fundraising didn't last and, by early July, began to significantly slow down.

Biden bowed out of the 2024 race July 21, and the party quickly consolidated around Harris, who instantly saw her fundraising soar, spurred by small-dollar donations.

When asked about the fundraising deficit, Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley told Fox News Digital last month that ""the Democrats have a ton of money. The Democrats always have a ton of money.""

However, he emphasized that ""we absolutely have the resources that we need to get our message out to all the voters that we're talking to and feel very comfortable that we're going to be able to see this campaign through, and we're going to win on November 5.""

Fundraising, along with polling, is a key metric in campaign politics and a measure of a candidate's popularity and their campaign's strength. The money raised can be used - among other things - to hire staff, expand grassroots outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts, pay to produce and run ads on TV, radio, digital and mailers, and for candidate travel."

Despite calls from both sides of the aisle to lower the political temperature following the two assassination attempts against former President Trump, MSNBC host Joy Reid recently claimed that Democratic voters want someone to give him a ""knuckle sandwich.""

Reid employed the violent imagery during MSNBC's vice presidential debate coverage on Tuesday night, telling a network panel that the Democratic base really want someone to engage in a ""fistfight"" with the former president.

""Democrats want to see someone get up there and give a knuckle sandwich to Donald Trump,"" Reid said to the panel, which included fellow MSNBC anchors Nicolle Wallace, Lawrence O'Donnell, Rachel Maddow and others.

A VISIBLY SHAKY WALZ SAYS THE WORLD NEEDS 'STEADY LEADERSHIP'

Reid began her point by stating that Gov. Walz's, D-Minn., vice presidential debate performance seemed tailored to a ""small, narrow group"" of swing voters, who want ""more substance"" from candidates.

""Tim Walz was very detailed and he spoke the way a governor speaks about really specific issues like gun violence, like health care. He was substantive and knowledgeable, so if you are that person who the thing that is keeping you on the fence is you need more details, he gave you more details.""

She continued, explaining that the base of the party prefers to see a brawl between the two candidates, and their preferred leader taking it directly to Trump with heavy blows.

""No. 2, I don't think that small narrow group of people wanted to see a fist fight. And so, I think that the people who want the fist fight are the base of the Democratic Party.""

Reid noted that it isn't the Democratic base that ""needs this debate,"" but those swing voters who do. She argued that Walz delivered in connecting to these people.

""I think the reason that Tim Walz was effective in the way he did it - he wasn't angry, he was disappointed. And that's actually in some ways stronger,"" she said, elsewhere adding, ""Tim Walz gave you that specificity that I think is going to get those people to feel more comfortable"" voting for the Democratic ticket.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Several X users blasted Reid for using the violent imagery against Trump only weeks after he was nearly killed by a second would-be assassin at his golf course in Florida.

Popular conservative account Libs of TikTok criticized the host, stating, ""2 ass*ss*nation attempts and Iran plotting to try to get Trump and Democrats are still calling for violence.""

Conservative commentator Paul Szypula chimed in, stating, ""Joy Reid is an angry person filled with hate. She needs help.""

""Steve Bannon's War Room"" co-host Natalie Winters remarked, ""Wow, @JoyAnnReid just said the quiet part out loud. Democrats want a 'fist fight' and someone to 'give a knuckle sandwich to Trump.'""

The Post Millennial editor-in-chief Libby Emmons commented, ""This is a call for political violence.""

Heavy metal singer and conservative commentator Phil Labonte added, ""there have been two attempts on Donald Trump's life in the past three months."""
NEWT GINGRICH: At VP debate a star is born and Trump is vindicated,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/newt-gingrich-vp-debate-star-born-trump-vindicated,2024-10-02T18:42:02Z,"'Fox News @ Night' panelists Michael LaRosa, Erin Perrine, Lauren Wright, Jennifer Sey, Julie Hamill and Elisha Krauss share their takeaways from the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

The vice presidential debate on Tuesday night was staggeringly one-sided.

Sen. JD Vance was poised, calm, friendly, likable, and in control of the facts and himself.

By contrast, Gov. Tim Walz began the debate so nervous it was painful to watch. Then he made a series of mistakes which were cumulatively disqualifying. It was hard to believe he is on a national ticket.

VANCE VS. WALZ DEBATE: TOP TAKEAWAYS FROM VP CANDIDATES' FACE-OFF

Callista and I went to bed on Tuesday night convinced that Sen. Vance had won a substantial triumph. In that victory, he also vindicated President Donald J. Trump's gamble in selecting a running mate so early in his career. At 40, with only two years in the U.S. Senate, Vance is only a few months older than Richard Nixon when President Dwight Eisenhower picked him to be the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1952. Nixon would remain a major part of the political scene for 42 years. That would give Sen. Vance a potential role in American government and politics until 2066.

When I got up on Wednesday morning, virtually all the commentaries validated the sense that the debate was something extraordinary.

This new reality was best summarized by Mark Halperin in the Wide World of News newsletter:

""1. One can pretend, as most of the Dominant Media does, that Tim Walz was not 'clobbered' by JD Vance, but, as honest Joe Klein (fully credentialed as second-to-none in contempt for Donald Trump and Vance) told the world, Walz was indeed clobbered, so badly that it 'wasn't as bad as Biden's debilitated performance in June, but it was close.' Remember: Biden's perf[romance] was so bad it ended his candidacy and career.""

Pollster Frank Luntz tweeted that his focus group voted 12 to 2 that Vance had won.

Glenn Greenwald posted on X: ""The most bizarre part of that debate was how Tim Walz repeatedly and flagrantly undercut Dems' core attack on Trump/Vance: that they're ""weird,"" freakish dangers wildly out of the mainstream.

""Everything Walz said treated Vance as a totally normal, reasonable, likable colleague.""

New York Times columnist Ross Douthat posted: ""I would rate that the most successful Republican debate performance of this century, eclipsing Romney in the first debate with Obama in 2012.""

Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume had no regard for the performances of moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, saying they were ""obnoxious"" and made the debate a three-on-one proposition against Vance.

These were just a few. The Trump-Vance campaign collected no fewer than 22 journalists and public figures who agreed that Vance trounced Walz.

Donald Trump Jr. was the third big winner in this debate. He had strongly backed Sen. Vance as a running mate and worked to get his father to pick him. That choice certainly seemed to work out brilliantly.

As Caitlin Doornbos in the NY Post wrote, Gov. Walz's problems started at the beginning.

""Tim Walz got one chance to make a first impression at Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, and blew it before his opponent, JD Vance, even got the chance to speak.""

His nerves clearly kept him from meeting the challenge.

Finally, Gov. Walz said a couple of things that were just weird.

In a clear moment of confusion, he said he'd become ""friends with school shooters."" When asked why he had lied about being at Tiananmen Square during the 1989 suppression and killing of students demonstrating for democracy, Walz ultimately called himself a ""knucklehead"" for simply saying something that was false.

Being the ""knucklehead candidate"" is not a good way to campaign for the last five weeks before the election.

After last night, Sen. Vance is a huge national figure among Republicans and conservatives. He will have much more impact campaigning than he did before the debate.

After Tuesday night, Gov. Walz will be seen by most Americans as someone who is clearly not ready to be president or vice president.

Vice President Kamala Harris's comment that she was exhausted and sleepless when she picked him will now look like a first step toward minimizing his role - and her ability to make decisions under pressure.

Harris dodges answering whether athletes should stand during national anthem in unearthed interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-dodges-answering-whether-athletes-should-stand-during-national-anthem-unearthed-interview,2024-10-02T18:10:54Z,"FOX News contributor Joe Concha responds to a Harvard board's unanimous vote to keep President Claudine Gay following her antisemitism testimony and controversy over LeBron James sitting during the national anthem to avoid being a 'distraction.'

Vice President Kamala Harris sidestepped answering directly whether she believes athletes should stand for the national anthem during an unearthed 2016 interview, instead delivering a rambling response that is currently receiving backlash on social media ahead of the general election.

While serving as attorney general of California, Harris joined PBS reporter David Nazar to discuss her Senate run and campaign platforms on issues such as criminal justice reform, the Black Lives Matter movement and the economy in California. During the discussion, Nazar pressed Harris if she believes athletes should stand for the national anthem.

""Should folks stand for the national anthem?"" Nazar asked in the interview, which was published in October 2016.

Harris' response focused on Americans' rights protected in the Constitution, and did not include a direct answer on whether athletes should stand for ""The Star-Spangled Banner.""

""We are all, and should be, treated as equals. We articulated those principles in our Constitution. And part of what we decided is what makes a fair and just and noble society in a democracy, a true democracy, is freedom of religion, freedom, right, of association, freedom to organize, First Amendment,"" she responded.

""So, that is part of who we are as a country, and I will defend it to the core, which is that we give people, certain choices in this country.""

PRO ATHLETES WHO STOOD FOR NATIONAL ANTHEM AMID FEVER PITCH TO SUPPORT SOCIAL JUSTICE INITIATIVES

In 2016, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick became the first NFL player to kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism. The form of protest, which began in Harris' backyard of San Francisco, soon spread to other sports leagues and athletes.

Athletes such as Megan Rapinoe knelt for the anthem ahead of soccer games in 2016, while Bruce Maxwell became the first Major League Baseball athlete to kneel during the national anthem in 2017.

TRUMP TAKES NFL, NBA TO TASK ABOUT KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM

The form of protest hit a fever pitch in 2020 following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis during an interaction with police. Scores of athletes knelt ahead of games that year during the anthem, while the NBA unveiled a court painted with ""Black Lives Matter"" amid social justice protests that year, and some Olympians took a knee during the Tokyo Games.

The protests were slammed by conservatives in the U.S., including former President Trump, who ripped the athletes for politicizing games.

TRUMP GIVES TWO-WORD RESPONSE IN REACTION TO NFL PLAYERS KNEELING BEFORE THANKSGIVING DAY GAME

""I think it's been horrible for basketball. Look at the basketball ratings. They're down to very low numbers. People are angry about it. They don't realize.... They have enough politics with guys like me. They don't need more as they're driving down... going up for the shot. They don't need it. There's a nastiness about the NBA about the way it was done too. So I think the NBA is in trouble. It's in big trouble. Bigger trouble than they understand,"" Trump said in 2020.

Trump also posted to X, then Twitter, that kneeling for the national anthem is ""a sign of great disrespect for our Country and our Flag,"" saying the ""game is over"" for him when he spots an athlete kneeling.

Harris' unearthed interview was criticized on social media this week, with OutKick founder Clay Travis saying Harris delivered a ""long jumble of nothingness.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment on the 2016 interview, but did not immediately receive a response.

Harris defended athletes who knelt during the anthem in 2017, after she was elected senator, saying they should not be ""threatened or bullied"" for the protest.

""Let's speak the truth that when Americans demand recognition that their lives matter, or kneel to call attention to injustice, that that is an expression of free speech, protected by our Constitution, and they should not be threatened or bullied,"" Harris said during an event in Atlanta, the Hill reported at the time.

""Sen. JD Vance clearly knew his challenge was to deal with the likability factor. The fact that in our poll, he's the second most disliked running mate in history. So I was getting texts from Democrats panicked, quite frankly, who were saying, 'Wow, he's really moderating himself on these issues. He's the most likable he's ever been,'"" the ""Meet the Press"" host said.

Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, faced off against Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday, at their first and likely only debate before the November election. Media critics later called the debate in Vance's favor, saying Walz appeared ""unsteady"" and ""nervous"" compared to Vance's ""smooth"" demeanor.

REACTIONS ROLL IN FOR VP DEBATE AS CRITICS GIVE VANCE A WIN OVER WALZ

However, Welker noted that Democrats saw a weakness in Vance dodging a question from Walz about whether he agreed with former President Trump's denials that he lost the 2020 election.

""Yet, that moment at the end where Gov. Walz pressed him on whether he accepts whether former President Trump lost the election and he said, 'Let's focus on the future' -- they are going to try to make that into a flash point,"" Welker said.

""They're already in the process of turning that into an ad. They believe that is going to be a way to really try to appeal to that very small sliver that is still undecided, but moderate, independent, suburban voters,"" she continued.

Voters in a Fox News focus group showed mixed reactions to that exchange in the debate.

Republicans on the Fox News Debate Dial had been unimpressed with Walz's line of questioning and the dial went down, with the approval staying generally the same with Vance's answers, but the dials for independents and Democrats took a sharp dive as Vance brushed off the question. It dove the sharpest among independents.

Liberal media pundits repeatedly played and discussed the clip in the debate's aftermath, saying it was one of Walz's strongest moments in a night that Vance otherwise controlled.

Several media pundits still agreed that Vance won the overall debate.

""Vance is going home tonight with Walz's wallet. Vance didn't even have to snatch it, Walz just handed it over, along with a bunch of unearned compliments to Vance's fine character,"" The Atlantic's David Frum posted on X.

""I would rate that the most successful Republican debate performance of this century, eclipsing Romney in the first debate with Obama in 2012,"" New York Times columnist Ross Douthat said.

Voters in swing state Michigan praised Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance for his debate performance against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

""I thought it went really well. I thought [Vance] did really well. He held his own. He told the truth,"" a voter wearing a MAGA hat told ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Lawrence Jones, Wednesday.

Jones visited Steak 'N Egger restaurant in Muskegon after Tuesday night's CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, where many watchers gave Vance the advantage over Walz.

""[Walz] did terrible in many respects, but he is just honest and truthful also. He doesn't know what he's talking about and he kind of admitted it,"" one voter said.

Another voter said Walz appeared ""too nervous.""

""[Walz is] phony. He's too plastic. He doesn't know the topics like Vance.""

A few voters at the diner, however, defended Walz's performance and argued the Democrat won the pair's only debate showdown.

""[Walz is] very articulate. He knows his facts,"" one woman said. ""JD Vance totally switched the script last night. He told untruths. He flipped the switch. He lied throughout the whole entire debate last night. What he said was untrue - his stance on abortion, his stance on housing, his stance on the finance - everything was was not true.""

The woman conceded that Vance's ""experience on public stages"" may have impacted the number of voters and pundits giving the senator the win.

Tuesday's debate covered a variety of subjects ranging from immigration to climate change to abortion as the two lesser known politicians sought to make their introductions to American voters before Election Day.

One Michigan voter said she is voting for Vice President Kamala Harris because she likes the idea that ""we get to vote every four years instead of, 'if you vote me in, you won't ever have to vote again.'""

Another woman voiced her support for Trump ""because he's for America, and he's for me. And he's for the unborn child.""

""If you are for the person who cannot defend themselves, then you are for the rest of us,"" she said. ""And if you don't care about those that are not able to defend themselves, you certainly aren't going to be in charge of us or care for us.""

The frequent MSNBC guest also weighed in on criticisms that the debate was boring, which he said will be a ""referendum"" on what people want going forward.

""I think the big theme of this thing was that it was very congenial, and it was not a blood sport,"" he said. ""It was not UFC. It was more like boxing. And if the American public -- your intuition says, well, the American public is ready for that, they want that, but then I kind of said to myself, is there this sick, twisted thing that people are addicted to the sick entertainment value of Donald Trump, and that they were kind of disappointed?""

The NFL introduced the dynamic kickoff prior to the start of the 2024 season, taking a page out of the XFL's playbook.

But the new kickoff formations have not exactly led to increased returns.

Front Office Sports noted that only 29.1% of kickoffs have been returned this season -- only about 7% more than what it was during the 2023 season.

Former President Trump sounded off on the new kickoff rules in an interview with OutKick founder Clay Travis on Saturday.

""Big time college football is as big as the NFL,"" he said. ""I don't know what they're doing with the kickoff return in the NFL. And I don't want to get involved in controversy, of course, but it looks so bad.

""And I noticed that they hadn't done that in college, and they shouldn't do it,"" he said. ""And I think the NFL should go back. And maybe it is a little bit more dangerous, but I doubt that it's any more dangerous. It's football.""

Where is Joe Biden?",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-southeast-underwater-middle-east-fire-ports-closed-where-joe-biden,2024-10-02T16:31:08Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

""It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is snoring,"" used to just be a nursery rhyme. Today it is the frightening reality of our lack of leadership in the White House, as President Joe Biden old-man shuffles his way to the end of his misbegotten and only term as president.

On Wednesday, October 2, Biden is finally set to visit the site of devastation in North Carolina wrought by Hurricane Helene, even if he has to skip a nap or two. This comes amid real concerns that the federal response is lackluster and insufficient.

Then there is the ongoing war in the Middle East, which on Tuesday, October 1, saw Iran launch the largest ballistic missile attack in human history against Israel. This, despite the fact that, on several occasions when Biden seemed half cogent, he warned the mullahs by sternly saying, ""Don't""

BIDEN HAS 'PRIVATELY COMPLAINED' ABOUT HOW QUICKLY DEMOCRATS HAVE MOVED ON FROM HIM: REPORT

Well, they did anyway. And while, thankfully, owing to the military might of Israel and America, the Iranian onslaught carried all the devastation of a Nerf gun fight, it was still a slap in the face of our feckless president.

As if those two disasters weren't enough, this same week has also seen the International Longshoremen's Association go on strike from Maine to Texas, shutting down the supply line for everything from batteries to bananas, despite Biden's claim that a deal would be worked out.

Of all these crises, these latter may be the most devastating to Scranton Joe because it is something that, in his prime, Biden would have been able to clean up faster than a Swiffer.

There are only a handful of people alive who have the deep, long-lasting relationship and trust with organized labor that Biden has developed over the last 50 years. At one time, he was absolutely the man for this job. Today, he is simply absent.

This is why president by committee doesn't work. Longshoremen might have trusted Biden; they do not trust the faceless deep state blob that rules us today.

Americans know they currently have no functioning president, and have for some time. In August, Sam, a restaurateur in San Francisco told me, ""I don't know who's running the country, but it's not him."" In Virginia, Sarah, a Democrat, simply said, ""It's sad, but he's just gone.""

To be blunt, this situation is incredibly dangerous. We heard almost nothing from our president as Iran attempted to start World War III. Instead, we saw National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan at the White House podium, the very man whose incompetence helped light the match of this conflagration.

You remember Sullivan, he was the guy who said days before the barbaric Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, that the Middle East was quieter than it had been in two decades.

Amazingly, Sullivan, who shouldn't even be managing a Dairy Queen, much less American foreign policy, still has his job. And why? Because he doesn't have a boss. Nobody in the administration does. I'm not convinced Biden can recognize Jake Sullivan, much less fire him.

It really is a fine mess the Democrats have gotten us into. The president is incapable of fulfilling his duties, and his vice president is now running for president. And by running, I mean as far away from Grandpa Joe as she can get.

In a sane world, our senile commander in chief would step down, and Vice President Kamala Harris would take the reins. But that can't happen because, if it did, she would suddenly be responsible for the haywire state of world and domestic affairs and might actually have to do a serious interview or two.

For all intents and purposes, the United States of America has no president. But what we do have is a host of crisis-level situations at home and abroad that are not being competently addressed.

There are only a handful of people alive who have the deep, long-lasting relationship and trust with organized labor that Biden has developed over the last 50 years. At one time, he was absolutely the man for this job. Today, he is simply absent.

For four more months, until either former President Donald Trump or Kamala Harris is sworn in as president next year, our ship of state has no captain. And rudderless, it is at significant risk of capsizing.

Joe Biden has gone to bed, he's wrong in the head, and he doesn't start work until 10 in the morning. Our allies know it. Far worse, our foes know it, and as usual, it is the American people who are suffering.

"WATCH: Voters react in real time to key Vance-Walz debate moments on immigration, democracy, abortion",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/watch-voters-react-real-time-key-vance-walz-debate-moments-immigration-democracy-abortion,2024-10-02T16:27:52Z,"Fox News Digital ranks the top five memorable moments from the 2024 Vice Presidential Debate between Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz.

A Fox News Digital focus group of Republicans, Democrats and independents reacted to key moments from the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate between Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night, offering real-time responses to the candidates' statements.

In a focus group hosted by Lee Carter, participants across the political spectrum used dials showing their favorable, unfavorable or neutral responses to Vance and Walz. Their reactions gave insights into how the voters who will help decide the election felt about the demeanor, character and policies of the two men, one of whom will be the next vice president.

Here are some of the most significant voter reactions from Tuesday night's focus group.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

Vance's argument that the U.S. needed to ""stop the bleeding"" at the border during Tuesday's debate elicited a mixed response from voters.

Vance received mixed responses when he said, ""Before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding... we have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.""

While Republican views of Vance's answers had an immediate positive response, Democratic viewers of the debate went in an opposite direction, the dials showed. Independents, meanwhile, hovered around a neutral response to Vance's answer.

Voters began to see Vance's response in a more positive light when he touched on former President Trump's border policies, arguing that the next administration should return to handling the border similar to how Trump did during his four years in office.

Democrats and independents reacted moderately-to-highly favorable to Walz's rejoinder on the migrant crisis and his criticism of the Trump administration.

Walz touted the bipartisan immigration bill that Trump pushed to kill earlier this year and defended Kamala Harris' record in California on the issue. Republicans were unfavorable to Walz but independents and Democrats gave him high marks throughout his answer.

""Pass the bill, she'll sign it,"" Walz said.

Republican, Democrat and independent voters reacted differently when Vance stated that he and Trump support ""clean air, clean water"" when climate change was brought up at the debate.

""Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say, Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer,"" Vance said.

The Fox News Debate Dial showed support among independents and Democrats dipping downward when Vance made that statement. Support among Republicans remained fairly consistent.

But support among independent viewers began to rise again when Vance referenced how Democrats bring up carbon emissions when discussing climate change.

""This idea that carbon emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true,"" Vance said. ""Well, if you believe that, what would you -- would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to restore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.""

One of Walz's most difficult moments at the debate received poor to middling reviews across the board from the focus group.

Moderators confronted Walz on his prior claim that he was present at the Tiananmen Square protests in Hong Kong in 1989, when he didn't travel to Asia until later that year. Walz gave a meandering answer that showed sub-par responses from Democrats, Republicans and independents almost throughout his entire comment, which didn't directly address the discrepancy.

At one point, he admitted he could be a ""knucklehead."" He eventually admitted he'd misspoke.

Walz's support among Republicans dipped to its lowest point - under 10% - when he said former President Donald Trump would have benefited from participating in one of his China trips, arguing Trump would never have befriended Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming public resources in Springfield, Ohio.

Independent and Republican voters disapproved of the interjection, but independent voters dipped significantly when Vance began explaining his stance.

Independents were mixed, while Republicans were highly favorable of Vance saying he was ""wrong"" about Trump in the past when confronted about his past criticism of his running mate.

""Sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the president, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record,"" Vance said.

When Walz was asked whether he supports abortion up until the ninth month as Minnesota is one of the least restrictive states for abortion, he responded, ""That's not what the bill says.""

While Republican voters dipped significantly as Walz spoke, independent and Democratic voters stayed mostly in the approval zone.

""What we did is restore Roe v. Wade, we made sure that we put women in charge of their health care,"" Walz said.

Independents dipped slightly in approval while Democratic voters shot up during his statement. The two eventually evened out and stayed in the approval zone.

""This is a basic human right,"" he later said.

The independent voters stayed slightly under the Democratic approval line, as Republicans significantly disapproved.

Vance received a positive reaction across the board from Democrats, Republicans and Independents when he told Walz he was sorry his son was once a witness to a shooting.

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that,"" the senator told Walz.

Independents gave Vance an immediate low rating when he said he was focused on the future after Walz asked him if Trump lost the 2020 election.

Republicans on the Fox News Debate Dial had been unimpressed with Walz's line of questioning and the dial went down, with the approval staying generally the same with Vance's answers, but the dials for independents and Democrats took a sharp dive as Vance brushed off the question. It dove the sharpest among independents.

Liberal media pundits repeatedly played and discussed the clip in the debate's aftermath, saying it was one of Walz's strongest moments in a night that Vance otherwise controlled.

""I actually think if you're a woman, that might be the worst moment JD Vance had, because he was going to mansplain right over that mute button.

Vance called out the debate moderators, CBS' Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, during the debate for fact-checking him during the debate after he brought up migrants in Springfield, Ohio. The moderators eventually muted his microphone as he was trying to talk.

She compared the moment to the debate Vice President Kamala Harris had with former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020, when Harris said, ""I'm speaking.""

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""There was this real belief that what he had to say was more important than the debate rules and the moderators,"" she said.

Wallace also praised the debate moderators for using ""their mic muting power.""

The Trump campaign ripped Wallace in a statement to Fox News Digital, calling her an ""unhinged idiot who beclowned herself by acting like a crazy person."" ""She's a joke and nobody takes her seriously,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said to Fox Digital.

Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance on Tuesday said he wanted to focus on the future when asked about former President Trump's denials that he lost the 2020 election - an answer that drew negative reactions from some voters, according to the Fox News Debate Dial.

Vance was asked by Democratic candidate Gov. Tim Walz whether Trump lost the 2020 election, something that Trump has repeatedly denied, and which led to the protests on Jan 6, 2021.

""This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen, and it manifested itself because of Donald Trump's inability to say - he is still saying he didn't lose the election,"" Walz said. ""Did he lose the 2020 election?""

Vance attempted to put the ball back in Walz's court.

""Tim, I'm focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 COVID situation?"" he responded.

Walz called it a ""damning non-answer.""

""It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship,"" Vance said, going on to say that there were ""problems"" in 2020.

Tim Walz ""embarrassed himself"" during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, while Sen. JD Vance's steady presentation ""reconfirmed"" his choice to make the senator from Ohio his running mate.

Trump spoke exclusively with Fox News Digital on Wednesday morning, hours after Vance, R-Ohio, and Walz faced off in the CBS News vice presidential debate in New York City. The two sparred on issues like foreign policy, border security, abortion and climate change, while introducing themselves and their records to the American people.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

""JD was fantastic last night -- it just reconfirmed my choice,"" Trump told Fox News Digital. ""There was a brilliance to what he did.""

""On the other hand, Tim Walz proved to be a man that doesn't have it in any way shape or form for the office that he is seeking, though I would put him a large number of steps above Kamala,"" Trump said.

The former president and Republican presidential nominee said Walz ""embarrassed himself and the Democrat Party last night but was made to look even worse by JD's brilliant performance.""

""This is what the country needs; smart people, not people that can't put two sentences together,"" Trump said. ""We have to take our country back.""

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs. Tuesday began with nearly 50,000 unionized dockworkers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a rough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago. A nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

As for a preemptive strike, Vance said, ""It is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe. And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys.""

Walz fired back. He slammed the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" adding Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last 3½ years? And the answer is, your running mate, not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, saying he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves, ""When was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border, a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no, told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking. Some of them, hopefully, are at homes with their families.

""Some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules. The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris' wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, 'You know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies.' I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they, frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us, as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options right now."""
"Vance oozed confidence compared to jittery Walz, body language expert says: 'Captain of the ship'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vance-oozed-confidence-compared-jittery-walz-body-language-expert-says-captain-ship,2024-10-02T15:31:39Z,"Body language expert Carole Lieberman, M.D., weighs in on Vance-Walz VP Debate.

Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought together two candidates with different visions for the future of America.

Their body language also sharply contrasted with one another as Vance espoused a sense of calmness and command of the issues, whereas Walz appeared nervous and overly fidgety at times, although he did manage to find his stride later in the debate, body language expert Carole Lieberman, M.D., tells Fox News Digital.

""What JD Vance had that made him most likable and most trusted was that he was authentic... you could just say it in one word. JD Vance was authentic. He did big hand movements and so on, but they were just to explain what he was saying,"" Lieberman said.

TOP 5 CLASHES BETWEEN VANCE AND WALZ DURING DEBATE SHOWDOWN: 'YOUR MICS ARE CUT'

""JD Vance came across as being very steady, like you can kind of see him as a captain of the ship, and he wasn't too stiff, but you knew what you were going to get. Each time he seemed sure of himself... And so you felt like you would be safe with him. He gave an air of stability,"" Lieberman added.

That ran counter to Walz, whom Lieberman said was anxious and jittery, particularly at the beginning of the debate.

""With Tim Walz, he was all over the place. He was very nervous, and he also had body language signs of lying. His body language was discordant with what he was saying. It was like too much, it made you feel exhausted and scared.""

Lieberman says Walz fumbled his question about being in Tiananmen Square for the deadly protests in the spring of 1989. Walz previously said he was in Hong Kong during the protests, but Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets report that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy. Walz initially tried to talk around the question but eventually admitted he ""misspoke"" after calling himself a ""knucklehead at times.""

""He was so defensive, he was just talking in circles and didn't want to admit that he had lied. If he had said that at the very beginning, it would have been more honest.""

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS ADMITS FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP WAS BECAUSE CNN LET HIS STATEMENTS 'HANG' AT FIRST DEBATE

Lieberman says body language plays an important role in debates, as people may not give their full attention to the entire debate and some topics interest people more than others.

She says 40-year-old Vance came across as the more experienced politician, even though he has only served in the Senate since January 2023, whereas Walz served in Congress from 2007 to 2019 before going on to be governor of Minnesota.

""[Walz] seemed like he was the new politician, like he was just trying to figure these things out. He was always looking down... I mean yes, it's OK to take notes when you're talking but... he was frantically taking notes like, 'Oh man I better say that' and 'This is the answer to that.' It really didn't seem to help him much, but I think it was a nervous compensation.""

""Whereas with JD you could see the Yale debater,"" Lieberman said.

""He obviously has had... years and years of practice, debating in college and as a lawyer and so on. You read about or heard about both of them practicing, but if it's coming from an authentic place, you don't really have to practice that much. You know what you want to do and you just say it. Whereas if you're hiding things by squirreling around, then you do have to practice to make sure you don't say that, or you do say that. And that's kind of how it came across.""

The CBS News Vice Presidential Debate showcased the two candidates' platforms on issues such as the ongoing war raging in the Middle East, abortion laws and their respective tickets' economic records. During the 90-minute debate, Vance and Walz had a handful of clashes, including moderators turning off Vance's microphone.

Commentators on both sides of the political spectrum largely agreed that Vance won the debate with a more polished performance in what was a highly policy-driven event devoid of personal attacks. The pair were seen shaking hands and chatting immediately after the debate.

Lieberman says Vance was confident in prosecuting the case for the Trump ticket and was comfortable arguing the issues the Republican Party stands for.

""He wanted to 'Let's go, I can't wait to do this, I'm going to do it'... he's Trump lite,"" Lieberman said. ""It's kind of the authenticity that I want to take care of America, I want to make America great again, all of that just came through naturally and by the end, you just kind of wanted him to push Tim Walz away. 'You're making me nervous' kind of thing and with JD Vance you just kind of felt 'OK, that's good.'""

Lieberman says it appears that Walz's strategy was to blame Trump, in large part, for many of the issues or cite Trump when responding to answers, and when that line of response became ineffective, he appeared lost.

""Walz was nervous, in parts, and then he had some signs of lying, like, for example, fidgeting. Mainly his movements were discordant with what he was saying. These puppy dog looks at Vance did him in, in my opinion... He was practicing what to say bad about Trump and that was not a good plan.""

""Throughout the 90 minutes, you would find yourself getting more and more nervous, anxious, irritated by Tim Walz, whereas you were beginning to feel calmer and as though things were going to be OK with JD Vance. And even if you couldn't hear the words that they were speaking and you were just watching them, this is how you would feel."""

""We all want to solve this, most of us want to solve this,"" Walz said as he spoke of the immigration crisis during the debate.

Democratic and independent support for Walz was high as he talked about the issue of the fentanyl and opioid crisis.

Support from both Democrats and independents spiked when Walz said Vice President Kamala Harris was ""the only person in this race who prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drug interventions.""

Support from independent and Democratic respondents remained steady for the majority of his remarks on the issue of immigration.

""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?"" Walz said, prompting a significant decline in support from independent viewers.

""Donald Trump had four years. He had four years to do this. And he promised you, America, how easy it would be. I'll build you a big beautiful wall, and Mexico will pay for it. Less than 2% of that wall got built and Mexico didn't pay a dime,"" Walz said, to which Democratic viewer support began to rise.

A majority of the 13 columnists and contributors polled by The New York Times agreed that JD Vance won the debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night.

Multiple New York Times columnists, including Binyamin Appelbaum, said that Vance was overall effective in his presentation on the debate stage. Seven of the columnists and contributors said that Vance defeated Walz in the debate, with two saying that the face-off was a draw and three writers concluding that Walz won.

""He made Trumpism sound polite, calm and coherent,"" Appelbaum said of Vance.

GOP LAWMAKERS, LEADERS REACT TO VANCE, WALZ DEBATE: 'SPITTING COLD, HARD TRUTH'

""Vance was far nimbler than the nervous Tim Walz, especially in the first half of the debate.

""Walz won,"" Times columnist Charles M. Blow wrote. ""You could tell that he was a teacher, because he clearly did his homework. Anyone afraid that Vance would roll over him could breathe easily.""

Newsletter writer Matt Labash said that ""Nobody truly dominated.""

""But I'm giving the slight edge to Walz, since Vance embarrassingly soft-pedaled Jan. 6 and Trump posted this to Truth Social during the debate: 'More Notes!

Other writers said that the debate outcome was more even.

Contributing Times Opinion writer Jane Coaston wrote that ""Vance seemed smoother and more practiced, but 'won' is a very strong term here.""

Times columnist Gail Collins said that the debate was a ""draw"" because ""Walz was so bad in much of his delivery. Vance was a much more forceful speaker while spewing lies on everything from abortion to Biden's foreign policy.""

Contributing Times opinion writer Peter Wehner said that Vance proved he was ""sharp and in command and ... an excellent debater.""

""At times he tried too hard to appear likable; I came away more convinced that he's a hollow man, radioactive and incendiary one day, conciliatory and agreeable the next,"" Wehner said. ""But the 'good Vance' did a lot to repair his tattered image.""

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital, ""Senator JD Vance completely dominated the debate and showed why we need to return President Trump to the White House."" He added that Trump's vice presidential nominee ""gave clear answers how the Trump-Vance ticket will turn around our economy, secure our southern border, make our streets safe once again, and restore peace in the Middle East.""

Cheung continued by saying that Vance ""exposed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for being failed, radical leftists who are all slogans with zero substance.""

""He called out Kamala Harris for destroying our southern border. He called out Harris for creating the record inflation making life unaffordable for millions of Americans. And he called out Harris for enabling Iran, leading to the current attacks on Israel,"" the spokesman added.

"Biden, Harris head to hurricane-ravaged Southeast in wake of Trump visit",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-harris-head-hurricane-ravaged-southeast-wake-trump-visit,2024-10-02T14:05:52Z,"Former President Trump makes a stop in Valdosta, Georgia to get a briefing on Hurricane Helene recovery efforts and help distribute relief supplies.

President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris each travel to the storm-ravaged Southeast on Wednesday, as the death toll and devastation from Hurricane Helene soars and a couple of million people remain without power and running water.

Over 160 people have been killed by Helene since the hurricane made landfall in Florida late Thursday before tearing a path of destruction through the interior Southeast. The storm sparked millions of power outages and billions of dollars in property damage as it smashed through the southern Appalachian Mountains and into the Tennessee Valley.

As the floodwaters from the storm receded, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper lamented that in the western part of his state ""communities were wiped off the map.""

NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS FIGHT FOR THEIR SURVIVAL

North Carolina and Georgia, which was also hard hit by the storm, are two of the seven key battlegrounds whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 election victory over former President Trump and are expected to determine the outcome of the 2024 showdown between Harris and Trump.

And with a margin-of-error race between the vice president and Trump with less than five weeks to go until Election Day on Nov. 5, and with the former president during a trip to the storm-damaged region earlier this week blasting both Biden and Harris over the federal response, the hurricane has become front-and-center in the White House race.

RESCUE MISSIONS UNDERWAY IN NORTH CAROLINA AFTER HURRICANE HELENE BRINGS 'HISTORIC' FLOODING, LANDSLIDES

The president on Wednesday heads to North Carolina, where he'll survey damage from a helicopter flight over the city of Ashville, one of the hardest hit areas. Biden will also visit a rescue command center in the state before also stopping in neighboring South Carolina.

""My top priority is to ensure the communities devastated by this hurricane get the help and support they need as quickly as possible,"" Biden told reporters Tuesday as he spoke during a Cabinet meeting focusing on the federal response.

Trump this past weekend accused the president of ""sleeping"" at his beach house in Delaware as the storm blasted the Southeast.

And speaking with reporters as he arrived in Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday, the former president charged that ""the federal government is not being responsive.""

And he falsely claimed that Biden had not spoken with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a conservative Republican.

Pushing back against the political attacks, Biden has noted that he was on the phone with federal, state and local officials throughout the weekend and returned to the nation's capital on Sunday afternoon to monitor storm rescue and relief efforts.

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON HELENE'S HAVOC

""We had over 1,000 federal personnel, including search and rescue teams, at the ready on the ground before it hit,"" the president said on Tuesday. ""Over the past several days, I've been in regular contact with the governors, the mayors, the county officials, and all the affected areas. That includes Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Virginia.""

And Biden emphasized that his administration has sent ""every available resource that we have at our disposal to the affected region"" and pledged ""we'll be there until this work is done.""

Trump on Sunday attacked Harris for attending ""fundraising events with her radical left lunatic donors"" in California over the weekend. And he argued that Harris ""ought to be down in the area"" where the storm caused destruction.

On Monday during his stop in Georgia, Trump repeated the dig, saying, ""The vice president, she's out someplace campaigning looking for money.""

The White House has highlighted that the vice president over the weekend was on the phone with federal, state and local officials.

Harris said on Saturday that she and the president ""remain committed to ensuring that no community or state has to respond to this disaster alone.""

On Monday, Harris visited FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] headquarters in Washington, D.C., where she received a briefing on relief and rescue efforts.

""We will do everything in our power to help communities respond and recover,"" Harris vowed.

Harris on Wednesday travels to Georgia to survey the impacts of the storm and receive an on-the-ground briefing and provide updates on the federal response.

Harris was originally scheduled to take part Wednesday in a campaign bus swing through central Pennsylvania, another key battleground state, with her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

With the vice president headed to Georgia, Walz will headline the bus tour, which comes the day after he faced off in the running mates debate against Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, the GOP vice presidential nominee.

During his Monday stop in Georgia, Trump highlighted that ""I've come to Valdosta with large semi-trucks, many of them, filled with relief aid. A tanker truck filled up with gasoline, a couple of big tanker trucks filled up with gasoline, which they can't get now. And we'll be working to distribute it throughout the day.""

And a GoFundMe page set up by the Trump campaign earlier this week has raised nearly $4 million so far for storm victims.

Presidents and vice presidents often don't travel immediately to storm-damaged areas, to prevent their trips from hampering badly needed rescue and relief efforts.

""I'm committed to traveling to the impacted areas as soon as possible, but I've been told that it would be disruptive if I did it right now. We will not do that at the risk of diverting or delaying any of the response assets needed to deal with this crisis,"" Biden told reporters on Monday.

And Harris said on Tuesday, ""I plan to be on the ground as soon as possible - but as soon as possible without disrupting any emergency response operations, because that must be the highest priority and the first order of business.""

But the optics of Trump's Monday stop in Georgia may have put some political pressure on Biden and Harris.

Longtime Republican strategist David Kochel said Trump had been ""very aggressive"" with his quick trip to the storm-damaged region.

""I think he put a lot of pressure on them to try to do something,"" Kochel, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, told Fox News. ""He's out there pushing a line that they don't care - they're not doing anything and I think they're reacting to it.""

The response by elected officials to natural disasters can impact their political standing.

President George W. Bush was heavily criticized in the summer of 2005 for his initial response to Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans.

And Trump faced criticism early in his White House tenure as Puerto Rico struggled to recover from a powerful storm. The president was pilloried for throwing paper towels to the crowd as he stopped by a relief center during a storm-related visit to the island."

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

When Vance tried to push back on the fact-check, Brennan and her co-moderator Norah O'Donnell attempted to speak over Vance, insisting that they had to move on to the next question.

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" Vance reminded them. ""And since you are fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

""Senator, we have so much we have to get to, thank you so much for explaining the legal process,"" Brennan said before urging O'Donnell again to move on to the next question.

""The audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" she added when Vance continued to respond.

Johnson commended Vance for his performance as he went head-to-head against the Minnesota governor, praising him for shedding light on the Biden-Harris administration's ""open"" border policies.

""The immigration policy is basically nonexistent,"" Johnson said. ""They opened the border. They're allowing everyone in. They put out the welcome mat, and the catastrophe that this has been to our country in every metric of public policy, with the fentanyl poisonings of it being the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 49.

""Sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the president, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump.

""There were a lot of things on the border, on tariffs, for example, where I think that we could have done so much more if the Republican Congress and the Democrats in Congress had been a little bit better about how they govern the country.

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan were panned by critics as they moderated Tuesday night's vice presidential debate between Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, the moderators repeatedly did so. Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

As the moderators attempted to move on, Vance pushed back.

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" Vance reminded them. ""And since you are fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

The fact-checking by the CBS moderators was slammed by critics.

""The moderators were obnoxious and made it feel like three on one on Vance,"" Fox News' Brit Hume reacted.

Fox News' Laura Ingraham called out the ""smug, arrogant bias"" of the moderators.

""Almost every question was designed to make Republicans look bad, slanting Trump's views on childcare. And yet Vance seemed to take it all in stride. And he really, I think, with most questions, really showed his humanity and also his knowledge of the issues,"" Ingraham said.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

Critics also took to social media to pile on the CBS anchors.

""Once again another major media outlet embarrasses themselves on a debate stage,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., wrote. ""In just the first 30 minutes of the CBS debate the moderators have already offered two gratuitous editorial statements, (one of them misleading), taking a shot at JD Vance under the guise of 'fact checking'.""

""CBS literally cut off @JDVance's mic mid-sentence as he was trying to fact-check Tim Walz. They'd never do it if the tables were turned,"" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah said.

""Margaret Brennan interrupting JD Vance technically correcting her false fact check of him is a terrible look for @CBSNews,"" conservative strategist Brad Todd said. ""They just cannot help themselves. Democracy Dies in Muted Microphones.""

""What is this CBS bulls---? If you're going to fact check, then say you will. Don't say you won't and then do!"" exclaimed ""Breaking Points"" co-host Saagar Enjeti.

""The way the moderators think it's their job to have the last word on how to frame an issue is amazing,"" Wall Street Journal film critic Kyle Smith quipped.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Fox News' Bill Melugin, who has extensively covered the migrant crisis during the Biden-Harris administration, provided his own fact-check of the debate exchange.

""CBS cuts Vance's mic while he's explaining how the Biden/Harris admin has allowed over 800,000 migrants to enter the U.S. via the CBP One App 'lawfully'. It then sounded like Walz claimed the CBP One app has been used since the 90s, which is completely false,"" Melugin wrote on X. ""The Biden/Harris admin started using it in winter 2023 to begin mass paroling migrants into the country by the hundreds of thousands, typically between 1,300-1,500 every single day.""

Notably, O'Donnell and Brennan cooled off on the fact-checking after they returned from the commercial break.

The backlash the CBS News moderators received resembles the uproar sparked by ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis for their partisan moderating during the first presidential debate between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Halloween mega-store rips 'SNL' in revenge for scathing new sketch: 'Irrelevant 50-year-old TV show',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/halloween-store-rips-snl-revenge-scathing-sketch-irrelevant-50-year-old-tv-show,2024-10-02T12:21:40Z,"""Saturday Night Live"" had some fun at the expense of ABC News and its anchor David Muir for their ""biased"" presidential debate earlier this month.

Halloween pop-up store chain Spirit Halloween recently slammed iconic sketch-comedy show ""Saturday Night Live"" in an X post this week after the NBC program made fun of the store in a skit last weekend.

The store's official X account trolled SNL with an image of a mock Halloween costume that slammed it as an ""irrelevant 50-year-old TV show"" whose ratings are ""shrinking.""

Spirit Halloween's made the anti-SNL statement just a few days after the show featured a sketch mocking the holiday-themed store.

The sketch - which aired during the premiere episode of the comedy show's 50th season - was a fake commercial for the store that poked fun at it for repurposing the storefronts of shuttered businesses in towns that have hit hard times, only to leave after selling Halloween costumes for six weeks.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUSHES BACK ON 'SNL' SKIT ABOUT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS: 'DISGUSTING'

""Thanks to us, what used to be a condemned AutoZone where a murder happened is once again a thriving business where a murder happened,"" SNL castmate Michael Longfellow quipped during the sketch while portraying a Spirit Halloween employee.

The official SNL X account shared the sketch to the social media platform with the caption, ""when others leave, Spirit Halloween shows up.""

The holiday store shot back on X on Monday, providing a spoof of its own on the long-running comedy show.

The store shared an image of an ""SNL 50"" costume contained in Spirit Halloween's recognizable orange packaging.

Like Spirit's real-life packages, the spoof featured descriptions of the costume, in this case, negative lines about SNL's 50th season.

The package read, ""Includes: Dated references, Unknown cast members, Shrinking ratings.""

In the post's caption, the store wrote, ""We are great at raising things back from the dead @nbcsnl.""

MSNBC GUEST CLAIMS LATINOS 'WANT TO BE WHITE' WHILE DISCUSSING THEIR SHIFT TOWARD GOP

X users found the feud between the store and the show amusing.

Comedian and author Lou Perez wrote, ""Both the SNL sketch and Spirit Halloween's response are funny. More of this, please.""

Actor Nathan Brimmer mocked the store, commenting, ""Seeing you butthurt over getting properly served on SNL is delicious.""

Comedian Luis J. Gomez praised Spirit, stating, ""Spirit Halloween with the kill shot.""

The latest episode of SNL went viral for other reasons this weekend. Former NBCUniversal senior executive Mike Sington slammed the show for doing a sketch making light of the assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump.

The sketch featured Trump - played by SNL castmember James Austin Johnson - urging his rallygoers to stay as gunshots ripped towards him.

""Where the hell is everyone going? Where are you going? I see you trying to leave, but the doors are locked. Come on back -- we're having fun. We love my rallies, except when someone does the 'bing, bong, bing, bing, bing' right at me,"" Johnson as Trump said, with finger guns.

Sington told Fox News Digital this week, ""I was watching it live, and actually cringed when they mocked the assassination attempts in an effort to be funny. I'm no fan of Trump's, but I thought it was in extremely poor taste.""

Voters react to Gov Tim Walz dodging Tiananmen Square question: 'I'm a knucklehead at times',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/voters-react-gov-tim-walz-dodging-tiananmen-square-question-im-knucklehead-times,2024-10-02T12:15:08Z,"A focus group of Democrats, independents and Republicans reacted to the moment when Gov. Tim Walz called himself a ""knucklehead"" for claiming to have been in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre.

Moderators confronted Walz on the claim during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate Tuesday night. Walz admitted that he only traveled to Asia in August 1989, several months after the April 15 massacre. The focus group found that voters were initially skeptical of Walz's answer, but he eventually recovered.

""Can you explain that discrepancy?"" a moderator asked, as the focus group remained neutral.

""Look, I grew up in small rural Nebraska, a town of 400. A town that you rode your bikes with your buddies until the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service. I joined the national guard at 17, worked on family farms, and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher. Passionate about it. Young teacher. My first year out, I got the opportunity in the summer of '89 to travel to China--35 years ago, to be able to do that,"" Walz said.

ABC DEBATE MODERATORS SPARK FURY FOR AGGRESSIVE FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP, EASY TREATMENT OF HARRIS

""I came back home and started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams, we would take baseball teams, we would take dancers, and we would go back and forth to China,"" he added.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

The focus group showed support from Republicans, independents and Democrats all going down for Walz during the first portion of his response.

However, Walz recovered among independents and Democrats when he went on to admit that he can be ""a knucklehead at times.""

""Many times I will talk a lot. I will get caught up in the rhetoric,"" he said, as support from independents rose above 50% in the focus group.

Walz's support among Republicans dipped to its lowest point - under 10% - when he said former President Donald Trump would have benefited from participating in one of his China trips, arguing Trump would never have befriended Chinese President Xi Jinping."
"Amid soaring threats from Iran, Russia against US homeland, Biden-Harris must focus on protecting us all",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/amid-soaring-threats-from-iran-russia-against-us-homeland-biden-harris-must-focus-protecting-us-all,2024-10-02T11:15:19Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In his remarks during last week's United Nations General Assembly, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, claimed that Iran wants to ""live in peace."" He demanded ""a world free of nuclear weapons,"" and declared that Iran ""is ready to disarm,"" if Israel does the same.

But just two weeks prior, Iran and its fellow dictatorship Russia were slapped with new economic sanctions by the Biden-Harris administration for Tehran's delivery of ballistic missiles to Moscow. In fact, the national security community is increasingly concerned about the growing relations between two of America's top adversaries. However, as Team Biden-Harris is hyper-focused on the threat this unholy alliance poses elsewhere in the world - Ukraine, the Middle East - what about us? Is anyone in charge of protecting our homeland?

As a former U.S. intelligence analyst who led Red Teams during war games, my team's job was to come up with, thinking like our adversaries, out-of-the-ordinary ideas - no matter how implausible - that Red Force (Russia, Iran, etc.) could use against Blue Force (U.S. and Allied militaries). The goal was to enable the president, the Pentagon and other decision makers to develop plans for countering our adversaries and protecting the homeland. Here are a few insights, from the intelligence perspective, that make the Iran-Russia threat even bigger than most Americans realize.

First, neither Russian nor Iranian leaders respect the Biden-Harris administration, making them more likely to act more aggressively against the United States. As a clear sign of indifference to Washington's ire, two days after the new sanctions went into effect, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting with Ali Ahmadian, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran. In it, he praised the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, for fostering ""additional momentum"" in Russian-Iranian relations and thanked Pezeshkian's team for making the relationship a ""priority."" Five days later, Putin dispatched his top security official, Sergei Shoigu, to Tehran, where Shoigu held secret talks with Pezeshkian.

WHY RUSSIAN STATE MEDIA IS OBSESSING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION AND PRAISING WALZ

Neither Russia nor Iran is afraid of economic sanctions. They've used loopholes in the sanctions regime to circumvent them and found alternative ways to finance their policy priorities and military programs. Despite the fact that the U.S., European Union (EU) and its Western allies banned nearly all Russian imports at the start of the war in Ukraine, Western nations purchased $2 billion worth of Russian oil indirectly through Turkey.

In 2023, the Biden-Harris administration released $6 billion in unfrozen assets to Iran as part of the deal to release five American hostages in exchange for five Iranians held in U.S. prisons. It is almost a certainty that some of those funds were diverted by Iran toward its military programs and to train and equip its proxy terrorist groups, such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis.

Sanctions, therefore, are an optics instrument that politicians use to virtue signal that they are doing something in response to hostile foreign activities. They have not and will not change the behavior of our adversaries.

Second, both Putin and the ayatollahs understand that as Team Biden-Harris is focused on European and Ukrainian security, security inside the homeland isn't taken seriously, presenting a vulnerability to be exploited. Explaining the decision for the new sanctions package, Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed concern that Moscow will ""likely use... Iranian ballistic missiles... against Ukraine."" Blinken characterized the weapons trade between Moscow and Tehran as a ""threat to European security.""

The Biden-Harris administration has approved billions of dollars for Ukraine to aid its defense against Russia, even as our own Secret Service is in crisis due to staffing shortages, high levels of turnover, inadequate training and incompetence of some of its personnel.

RUSSIA, CHINA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA RATCHETING UP THREATS AGAINST US. WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW

Two failed assassination attempts on former President Trump, during which would-be assassins were able to penetrate the security perimeter of the protectee, clearly demonstrate that the level of protection the Secret Service delivers is low. If security for a former president, with all the law enforcement personnel surrounding him 24/7, can be breached by an amateur, an operative trained and resourced by a state-actor like Iran or Russia, can do so much more damage. It also means that other targets - government buildings, military installations, critical infrastructure - are likely to be equally vulnerable. Saying nothing of soft targets, such as shopping malls and other public spaces.

Third, Russia and Iran have the capabilities and political will to conduct hostile clandestine operations inside the U.S. The recent arrest in New York of a Iranian-linked Pakistani man who plotted to kill American leaders, highly likely including Trump, is just one example of Iran's ongoing policy of infiltrating operatives inside the U.S. for nefarious purposes.

Moreover, according to a 2024 report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Iran has been developing ""surrogate networks inside the United States"" for ""more than a decade."" This assessment is consistent with a warning contained in another report about Iran's plans to attack strategic security assets and institutions in the U.S. The report, titled ""The Unseen Threat of the Mapping Project,"" claims that Iranian elements have identified 298 American strategic security assets and institutions, as well as personnel, for attacks, kidnappings and assassinations.

Couple this with the fact that Russia, for decades, has been running an ""illegals"" program aimed at maintaining networks of deep-cover sleeper agents inside the United States. In 2010, the FBI had to pull the plug on a 10-year counter-intelligence operation aimed at rooting out such a spy network inside the United States because one of the female spies was moving uncomfortably close in access to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, her husband Bill Clinton, and members of their inner circle. The Russians almost certainly keep this program alive, now that the Biden-Harris open border policy has made it so much easier to infiltrate foreign operatives.

The Iranian regime has been funding anti-Israel protests on university campuses across the country. These ostensibly ""grassroots activist"" groups, which sometimes don't know who is behind them, present a vast pool of resources that could be weaponized, with the help of foreign clandestine operatives. What Putin and the ayatollahs want is to foment social unrest inside the United States, consistent with the Russian doctrine of ""controlled instability.""

Fourth, should Russia and Iran join forces in strategic capabilities, the threat to homeland security could be catastrophic. The U.S. government investigation in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks concluded that the government's principal error was a failure to ""connect the dots."" In other words, the pieces of the puzzle were to be found in many corners of the U.S. government. Yet no one connected the dots, making it impossible to predict and preempt the attacks.

We are now living in a similar period. Our security apparatus is stretched thin, with analysts being pulled in many different directions - Ukraine, the Middle East, China. The same failure of imagination that plagued our intelligence in 2001 could prevent us from visualizing an impending threat coming from Iran-Russia cooperation. Below, I will connect the dots.

Putin spokesperson Dmitriy Peskov acknowledged that the two countries are cooperating, including on ""the most sensitive"" areas,"" which he didn't specify. As someone who spent my intelligence career tracking threats to our homeland, here they are - cyber attacks, space warfare and WMD. We are vulnerable in these areas due to our reliance on technology in military operations and civilian life.

Russia has the world's most extensive nuclear know how, some of which it is likely sharing with Iran, which is already extremely close to operationalizing its atomic weapons. Russia is also sharing space launch technology with Iran, helping Tehran place its satellites into orbit. A multi-mission satellite network is a pre-requisite for missile warning, targeting, and command and control, including the employment of nuclear weapons.

Russia has developed a comprehensive suite of counter-space weapons to target U.S. satellites during wartime and electronic warfare capabilities to disrupt the functioning of U.S. satellites in peacetime. Moscow has already used some of these capabilities during its war on Ukraine. It probably will share some of these technologies with Iran, which already has demonstrated jamming capabilities.

U.S. airlines, which rely on GPS for flight navigation, are already concerned about becoming targets of GPS spoofing. Spoofing attacks have surged over the past six months, with most of them originating from electronic-warfare transmitters in Russia, Ukraine and Israel.

Russia already poses a chemical and biological weapons (CBW) threat and retains an undeclared chemical weapons program, having used them at least twice in recent years, according to a 2024 intelligence report. Iran continues ""research and development of chemical and biological agents for offensive purposes."" ""Iranian military scientists have researched chemicals, toxins, and bioregulators, all of which have a wide range of sedation, dissociation, and amnestic incapacitating effects.""

Military ties between Moscow and Tehran are indeed the closest they've ever been, having strengthened dramatically on Biden-Harris' watch. As we are nearing the presidential election and Team Biden-Harris continues to prioritize someone else's security, Americans must decide which future president is more likely to place America's security first."
Several questions about Walz's record not asked about during vice presidential debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/several-questions-about-walzs-record-not-asked-about-during-vice-presidential-debate,2024-10-02T11:11:31Z,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz responds to a question on Vice President Harris' handling of the border at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was not asked about several highly talked about news stories in the first and only vice presidential debate on Tuesday, including his military service, which Walz did not strongly invoke either.

The CBS Vice Presidential Debate in New York City showcased the Republican and Democrat candidates answering questions on a variety of issues, but Walz's military service, which he has faced sharp criticism from Republicans and some veterans for allegedly embellishing, was not asked about.

Walz only briefly mentioned his military service during the debate when he was forced to correct the record on whether he was in China for the Tiananmen Square protests.

At another point in the debate, Walz referred to himself as a ""good soldier.""

Walz was also not asked during the debate about how many times he has visited China.

A VISIBLY SHAKY WALZ SAYS THE WORLD NEEDS 'STEADY LEADERSHIP'

In the past, Walz has claimed he went ""dozens of times"" and once claimed he went ""about 30 times."" This week, the Harris-Walz campaign walked that back and said the actual number is ""closer to 15 times.""

Other questions Walz was not asked during the debate include his disputed claims about his wife's IVF treatment and his claim that he carried weapons ""in war.""

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

When Vance tried to push back on the fact-check, Brennan and her co-moderator Norah O'Donnell attempted to speak over Vance, insisting that they had to move on to the next question.

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" Vance reminded them. ""And since you are fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Walz attempted to argue with him.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

Democrats quickly came out in support of Walz's debate performance as it was unfolding, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who said Walz was ""laying down facts.""

""Gov Walz dominating JD Vance on the immigration exchange with undecided voters in a western battleground state,"" David Plouffe, campaign manager and White House Senior Advisor for Barack Obama and Senior Advisor for Kamala Harris for President, posted on X.

Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz faced backlash on social media after he defended an individual healthcare mandate during a back and forth with his counterpart, Republican Sen. JD Vance, in their first and only debate on Tuesday night.

""The question about this of young people, whatever, that's the individual mandate,"" Walz said during a conversation on healthcare and the Affordable Care Act at the CBS News debate in New York City. ""And Republicans fought tooth and nail saying Americans should be free to do this.""

Vance then interjected, asking, ""Tim do you think the individual mandate is a good idea?""

""I think the idea of making sure the risk pool is broad enough to cover everyone -- that's the only way insurance works. When it doesn't, it collapses. You are asking pre- ACA where we get people out. Look, people know that they need to be on health care. People expect it to be there.""

BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN HAS 'FAILED' REPEATEDLY ON HEALTH CARE: ANALYSIS

Walz went on to say that the ACA ""works"" but we can ""continue to do better.""

Walz's comments defending the individual mandate drew criticism on social media, with people pointing out that it was repealed during the Trump administration.

""We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year -- forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans,"" Trump told an audience during the 2018 State of the Union Address.

""We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare -- the individual mandate is now gone,"" he added.

7 REASONS TO FEAR KAMALA HARRIS' RADICAL 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SCHEMES

""Tim Walz just endorsed reinstating the Obamacare mandate which was a massive tax penalty for Americans who can't afford to buy insurance,"" GOP Sen. Tom Cotton posted on X.

""Oh my god, Walz defending the individual mandate,"" journalist Josh Barro posted on X. ""Does he know there isn't one anymore?""

""Tim Walz doubles down on his support for Obamacare's individual mandate tax, by far the least popular part of Obamacare,"" Americans for Tax Reform Director Mike Palicz posted on X.

""This would violate Kamala's pledge not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400K. Trump Tax Cuts repealed the hated individual mandate tax.""

During the debate, Vance argued, ""Donald Trump has said that if we allow states to experiment a little bit on how to cover both the chronically ill, but the non-chronically ill, it's not just a plan. He actually implemented some of these regulations when he was President of the United States. And I think you can make a really good argument that it salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came along.""

Fox News Digital reported Monday that Walz has previously voiced his support for single-payer government-run healthcare.

""I think that's probably the path where we end up,"" Walz said in a 2018 debate while running for governor when asked, ""Are you for single-payer?""

""And I say that because, be very clear about this, there were no protections for preexisting conditions before the ACA,"" Walz continued. ""A vote for the ACA was the first time in this nation's history we had those protections and making sure people have that protection, making sure they were covered, and then making sure we were focused on preventative care, people were finally getting that under the ACA, we started to see health outcomes improve and that's the real key to driving down insurance premium prices."""
Trump calls for Pete Rose's Hall of Fame induction: 'Do it now before his funeral',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-calls-pete-roses-hall-fame-induction-do-now-before-his-funeral,2024-10-02T10:00:10Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former President Donald Trump has weighed in on Pete Rose's potential Hall of Fame induction.

Major League Baseball's all-time hit king died on Monday at the age of 83 due to hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Rose has a complicated legacy, as his stats scream Hall of Fame, but due to gambling while he was a manager, he was placed on baseball's permanently ineligible list.

Two years later, the Baseball Hall of Fame voted in 1991 to ban those on that list from ever being inducted. Thus, he remained a non-Hall of Famer.

The debate is now almost four decades old, and the consensus feeling is that Rose would eventually get into Cooperstown after his death.

That would inevitably be the case, but Trump does not want to wait any longer - he wants Rose in the Hall ""now.""

""The GREAT Pete Rose just died. He was one of the most magnificent baseball players ever to play the game. He paid the price!"" Trump posted on both Truth Social and X during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate. ""Major League Baseball should have allowed him into the Hall of Fame many years ago. Do it now, before his funeral!""

LEGENDARY SPORTSCASTER JIM GRAY REMEMBERS MLB GREAT PETE ROSE

MLB, despite the two parties' differences, shared a statement about Rose.

""Major League Baseball extends its deepest condolences to Pete Rose's family, his friends across the game, and the fans of his hometown of Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Montreal and beyond who admired his greatness, grit and determination on the field of play. May he rest in peace,"" the league wrote.

Rose broke out with his hometown Cincinnati Reds, the team he played 19 of his 24 seasons with, three of which he also served as acting manager, in 1963, and he went on to make league history, while securing three World Series titles along the way.

Nicknamed ""Charlie Hustle"" for his relentless drive when on the diamond, Rose was league MVP in 1973, a 17-time All-Star, three-time batting title winner, Rookie of the Year, and World Series MVP in his career. MLB denied all of his requests for reinstatement.

Rose later admitted in 2004 that he did bet on baseball and the Reds, and a June 2015 investigation by ESPN found that Rose did indeed bet on baseball while serving as player and manager for the Reds, with records of the bets made public.

Rose, a switch-hitter, not only leads MLB in all-time hits, but he also has the most games played (3,562), at-bats (14,053), and singles (3,215) recorded. He owned a career .303/.375/.409 slashline with 746 doubles, 1,314 RBI and 160 home runs.

Politico's chief Washington correspondent and Playbook co-author Ryan Lizza is taking a leave of absence after his ex-fiancée, Olivia Nuzzi, accused him of harassment and blackmail in a court filing.

It was revealed last month that Lizza and Nuzzi had previously called off their engagement when news broke that the star New York Magazine writer had been inappropriately involved with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

In the court filing to Washington DC's Superior Court on Tuesday, Nuzzi reportedly claimed in August that Lizza ""explicitly threatened to make public personal information about me to destroy my life, career, and reputation -- a threat he has since carried out.""

""POLITICO and Ryan Lizza have mutually agreed that it is in everyone's best interest for him to step back and take a leave of absence while an investigation is conducted,"" a Politico spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

NEW YORK MAG PUTS REPORTER OLIVIA NUZZI ON LEAVE FOR ALLEGED 'PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP' WITH RFK JR.

Neither Lizza nor Nuzzi immediately responded Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

Nuzzi had been placed on leave by New York Magazine last month as a result of the Kennedy revelation.

Nuzzi alleged the harassment began in July and accused Lizza of trying to blackmail her into staying together, according to CNN.

""She said by the next month, Lizza had stolen a personal electronic device from her, was hacking her devices, then anonymously shopping information about her to the media,"" CNN reported. ""Some of the information may have been 'doctored' to hurt her more, Nuzzi alleged, and she believes Lizza impersonated 'an anonymous campaign operative' to give a political campaign information that would hurt her further, according to the court records.""

'THE VIEW' CALLS OUT 'CONFLICT OF INTEREST' IN NY MAG REPORTER'S 'PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP' WITH RFK JR.

Nuzzi also accused Lizza of tipping off her employer about her relationship with RFK Jr. possibly ""through a third party or anonymous channel"" and that he ""threatened her with violence 'to assume his share of financial responsibility' for a joint book contract they had,"" per CNN's reporting.

A judge granted Nuzzi's request, temporarily barring Lizza from contacting her. A hearing is set for Oct. 15, giving a chance for Lizza to respond in court, though he denied Nuzzi's allegations to CNN.

""I am saddened that my ex-fiancée would resort to making a series of false accusations against me as a way to divert attention from her own personal and professional failings. I emphatically deny these allegations and I will defend myself against them vigorously and successfully,"" Lizza told CNN.

Nuzzi's relationship with RFK Jr. began late last year after she interviewed the then-independent presidential candidate, who has since suspended his campaign and endorsed former President Trump. RFK Jr. is married to actress Cheryl Hines.

It has been reported that Nuzzi initially denied she was personally involved with RFK Jr. after being confronted by her boss, New York Magazine editor David Haskell, but eventually came clean.

""Earlier this year, the nature of some communication between myself and a former reporting subject turned personal,"" Nuzzi said in a statement last month. ""I did not directly report on the subject nor use them as a source. The relationship was never physical but should have been disclosed to prevent the appearance of a conflict. I deeply regret not doing so immediately and apologize to those I've disappointed, especially my colleagues at New York.""

A Kennedy spokesperson also previously denied any sort of physical relationship and said he had only met Nuzzi once.

""Mr. Kennedy only met Olivia Nuzzi once in his life for an interview she requested, which yielded a hit piece,"" a Kennedy spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

New York Magazine said in its statement at the time that Nuzzi would have been removed from her reporting duties on the campaign if it had been made aware of the relationship earlier.

""Had the magazine been aware of this relationship, she would not have continued to cover the presidential campaign. An internal review of her published work has found no inaccuracies nor evidence of bias,"" New York Magazine said.

Top 5 moments from only VP debate between Vance and Walz before election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-5-moments-from-only-vp-debate-between-vance-walz-before-election,2024-10-02T08:11:29Z,"Fox News Digital ranks the top five memorable moments from the 2024 Vice Presidential Debate between Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz.

Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., met face to face on Tuesday night in New York City for the only vice presidential debate before the election.

The event covered a variety of subjects ranging from immigration to climate change to abortion as the two lesser known politicians sought to make their introductions to American voters before election day.

Here are the top moments from the debate:

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

After CBS News' Margaret Brennan offered an impromptu fact-check in response to Vance describing cities being overwhelmed by illegal immigration, noting that many Haitians in Springfield, Ohio have been granted a legal status, Vance hit back at her for violating the terms of the debate.

""Margaret, the rules were that you are not going to fact-check. And since you're fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" he said. ""So there's an application called the CBP one app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand.""

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Vance told Walz that he was sorry to hear that his son had been witness to a shooting, in a moment of civility that was particularly frequent during the vice presidential debate. This civility has also been less and less common during presidential debates, which have proven contentious in recent election cycles.

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that,"" the senator told Walz.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

""The American citizens have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace, Tim,"" Vance said during the debate.

""And I actually think I agree with you,"" the Ohio senator said, adding, ""I think you want to solve this problem.""

""But I don't think that Kamala Harris does.""

Walz claimed there would be ""a registry of pregnancies"" under what he said was Trump and Vance's Project 2025. The Project 2025 is an endeavor of conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation.

""It's going to make it more difficult, if not impossible, to get contraception and limit access, if not eliminate access, to infertility treatments,"" he said.

But Vance denied this claim. ""No, certainly we won't,"" he pushed back at the statement.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Walz referred back to his notes in one answer on Tuesday night, after frequently scribbling down observations during the debate.

""Economists can't be trusted. Science can't be trusted. National security folks can't be trusted,"" he listed, referencing Vance's skepticism of those heralded as experts. ""Look, if you're going to be president, you don't have all the answers. Donald Trump believes he does.""

Even Trump poked fun at the noticeable amount of notes that the Minnesota governor was taking, writing on Truth Social, ""Walz is taking so many notes - Never seen a Candidate take more! He needs the notes to keep his brain intact."""
Top 5 clashes between Vance and Walz during debate showdown: 'Your mics are cut',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-5-clashes-between-vance-walz-during-debate-showdown-your-mics-cut,2024-10-02T08:11:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance took the same stage for their first and only vice presidential debate this election cycle on Tuesday evening, when the pair had a handful of fiery clashes over top voter concerns.

The CBS News Vice Presidential Debate showcased the two vice presidential candidates' platforms on issues such as the ongoing war raging in the Middle East, abortion laws and their respective tickets' economic records. Amid the 90-minute debate, Vance and Walz had a handful of clashes, including moderators turning off Vance's microphone.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

The CBS debate's rules included leaving microphones on for both candidates no matter who was speaking, breaking from the two presidential debates this cycle that muted microphones when a candidate was not speaking. The outlet, however, reserved the right to turn the microphones off if they felt it was warranted.

Moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell did mute the pair Tuesday when Vance spoke up to complain that the moderators were trying to fact-check him on his remarks regarding illegal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace,"" Vance said referring to about immigration issues in a city in his home state.

After Vance and Walz both delivered responses regarding immigration, Brennan told viewers that Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

Vance took issues with the on-air ""fact-check"" before he was muted.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS ADMITS FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP WAS BECAUSE CNN LET HIS STATEMENTS 'HANG' AT FIRST DEBATE

""The rules were that you were not going to fact-check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said. ""So there's an application called the CBP. One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in. Applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.""

Moderators tried to quiet Vance before cutting his and Walz's mics.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Margaret Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get to.""

Walz was forced to answer questions regarding his travel to China during Tuesday night's debate.

Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets, however, are now reporting that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""Look, I grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service,"" a visibly shaky Walz said. ""I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.""

""I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams. We would take baseball teams. We would take dancers. And we would go back and forth to China,"" Walz said, noting the trips were ""to try and learn.""

""Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, and I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect,"" Walz continued.

""And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Brennan pushed back, reminding Walz of the question and again asking him to explain the discrepancy.

""All I said on this was, as I got there that summer and misspoke on this,"" Walz said. ""So, I will just -- that's what I've said. So, I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests, went in and, from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance.""

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz claimed during the debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws after Roe v. Wade was overturned, sparking a clash with Vance.

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade,"" he said.

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Vance shot back that a Minnesota abortion law does not require doctors to save a baby who survives an abortion.

""First of all, governor, I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive, and there are a lot of people who should still be alive. And I certainly wish that she was. And maybe you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me. But as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion,"" he said.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""That's not true,"" Walz said.

""Choice or not option that is fundamentally barbaric,"" Vance continued.

The pair also sparred over immigration a handful of times throughout the debate, including Vance slamming Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of immigration.

""First of all, the gross majority of what we need to do to the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job,"" Vance said during a discussion on the Haitian migrant surge in Springfield, Ohio, and immigration overall.

""I've been to the southern border more than our 'border czar' Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.""

Vance continued by saying that, ""of course, additional resources would help,"" but that the issue is mostly about the Biden administration not empowering law enforcement to say ""if you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico"" and ""go back through proper channels.""

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION

""Now, Gov. Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield,"" Vance said. ""Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.

Walz repeatedly argued Trump shut down a Senate immigration bill earlier this year that he believes would have made strengthened border security.

""It is law enforcement that asked for the bill,"" Walz said. ""They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.

""On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.""

""This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then, you start to make a difference in this, and you start to adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.""

The pair of vice presidential candidates also sparred over the threat of censorship on Tuesday, as Walz pressed Vance on the 2020 election and Jan. 6, 2021.

""It's really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 years in this country. We are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election,"" Vance said after Walz cited Jan. 6, when Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol.

""We have to remember that for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections. Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board. But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor,"" Vance continued.

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

Walz countered that ""Jan. 6 was not Facebook ads.""

""This idea that there's censorship to stop people from doing, threatening to kill someone, threatening to do something, that's not that's not censorship. Censorship is book banning. We've seen that. We've seen that brought up,"" he continued.

Walz continued that Trump has repeatedly claimed he won the 2020 presidential election.

""Did he lose the 2020 election?"" Walz asked Vance of Trump during the last election cycle.

""Tim, I'm focused on the future,"" Vance replied. ""Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?""

""That is a damning non-answer,"" Walz said. ""I'm pretty shocked by this. He lost the election. This is not a debate, it's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world.""

""It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship,"" Vance shot back.

Conservative social media reactions pour in declaring winner of VP debate: 'This was a massacre',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/conservative-social-media-reactions-pour-in-declaring-winner-vp-debate-massacre,2024-10-02T08:11:16Z,"A panel of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents give a show of hands in support of either JD Vance or Tim Walz after Tuesday nights Vice Presidential Debate.

Reactions from conservatives on social media poured in during and following the first and only vice presidential debate on Tuesday night with the majority praising JD Vance for his performance.

""This was a massacre,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis posted on X. ""JD Vance absolutely destroyed Tim Walz.""

""JD Vance just won big,"" conservative commentator Charlie Kirk posted on X along with a video montage of facial reactions by the two candidates. ""And it wasn't even close.""

""Tonight's debate underscored that the Harris-Walz ticket is the most radical in our nation's history,"" Jessica Anderson, President of Sentinel Action Fund, said in a statement.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

""As Governor, Walz implemented his far-left agenda in Minnesota, with soft-on-crime policies, authoritarian COVID lockdowns, and support for limitless abortion. As Vice President, he will expand his extremism beyond Minnesota as the unapologetic wingman for Kamala Harris.""

""Vance absolutely crushed it tonight and secured a very bright future in the GOP,"" American Principles Project President Terry Schilling posted on X.

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION'

""Very proud of JD for a stellar performance tonight,"" former presidential candidate Vivek Ramasawmy posted on X. ""And my condolences to Tim Walz - it was unkind for them to put him in this position.""

""JD Vance won big and demonstrated why he was a fantastic pick by President Trump,"" Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton posted on X. ""He skillfully contrasted Trump's record of peace and prosperity with Kamala's record of disaster.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

The Harris campaign released a statement following the debate expressing why it believes that Walz, not Vance, had the strongest night.

""Tonight, Governor Walz showed exactly why Vice President Harris picked him: he is a leader who cares about the issues that matter most to the American people,"" Harris-Walz Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement. ""In the debate, Americans got to see a real contrast: a straight talker focused on sharing real solutions, and a slick politician who spent the whole night defending Donald Trump's division and failures.""

""On every single issue - the economy, health care, foreign policy, reproductive freedom, gun violence - Governor Walz won. He spoke passionately about the Vice President's vision for a new way forward for the country. And in what was the most critical moment of the entire debate, which came in its final exchange, he stood up for our Constitution, while JD Vance admitted he'd put Trump ahead of the country.""

O'Malley Dillon continued, ""The choice facing the American people in November was on full display tonight: between charting a new way forward, or going backwards. Vice President Harris believes that the American people deserve to see her and Trump on the debate stage one more time. She will be in Atlanta on October 23 - Donald Trump should step up and face the voters.""

The Trump campaign said in a statement that Vance ""unequivocally won tonight's debate in dominating fashion"" in what was ""the best debate performance from any Vice-Presidential candidate in history.""

""Senator Vance spoke the truth, eloquently prosecuted the case against Kamala Harris' failed record, and effectively held Governor Tim Walz accountable for his lies on behalf of the Harris-Biden Administration,"" Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said. ""Senator Vance also perfectly articulated the Trump-Vance vision to make America safe again with their plan to launch the largest mass deportation operation in history; to make America strong again with a peace through strength foreign policy agenda; and to make America wealthy again by cutting taxes, unleashing American energy dominance, and ending inflation.""

""Tonight, Senator Vance proved why President Trump chose him as his running mate. Together, they make the strongest and most dynamic presidential ticket ever, and they are going to win on November 5th."""
Mothers who lost daughters to illegal immigrants say VP Harris' border trip was 'political stunt',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/mothers-lost-daughters-illegal-immigrants-vp-harris-border-trip-political-stunt,2024-10-02T08:07:02Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Two mothers who lost their daughters to illegal immigrants called out VP Kamala Harris for not reaching out to their families and called the vice president's border trip a ""sham"" and a political stunt.

""I lost my 12-year-old daughter to illegal immigrants that the Biden-Harris administration policies, border policies have let in this country, and we're not safe anymore,"" Alexis Nungaray, who lost her daughter Jocelyn, said on ""Hannity"" Monday.

Jocelyn Nungaray was sexually assaulted before being strangled and left dead in a Houston creek by two illegal immigrants from Venezuela in June.

HARRIS HEADS TO SOUTHERN BORDER LOOKING TO FLIP SCRIPT ON IMMIGRATION CRITICISMS

""I think Kamala Harris's border trip this past Friday was such a sham. It was the most disgraced, hollow effort I have ever seen from a candidate for presidency,"" she added.

Harris visited the southern border in Douglas, Arizona on Friday; Arizona is a swing state that is currently considered a ""toss up"" for the presidential race, according to the latest Fox News Power Rankings.

Nungaray said, ""it pissed me the hell off when I saw it. She's been in charge of the border for more than three years. She's done absolutely nothing.""

She added that Harris had her people there to capture the ""right angles"" during her border trip, calling it a photo-op for ""political gain.""

Nungaray said it was ""disgusting"" that she was only at the border for approximately ""20 minutes"" and didn't speak to any ""ground people or agents.""

Nungaray said when Trump visited the border she was invited, but she was not invited by Harris.

""If I was there this time and I would have witnessed how she handled that entire interaction, I would have walked up to her and I would have asked her, 'with this same effort you're giving, which is not any, would it be the same if this was your daughter that you had to bury?'"" said Nungaray.

Additionally, Nungaray said Harris has not reached out to her family to ""even give condolences.""

""It's because of people like Kamala Harris and [Democrat] Collin Allred, who's running for senator in Texas, which is where I'm at. People like that, they don't keep the people safe. They don't keep our children safe. We need somebody who will actually make change and actually do something. And that's not Kamala.""

Patty Morin, who lost her daughter Rachel Morin to an illegal immigrant, called out Harris as well.

Rachel Morin, a mother of five, was raped and murdered by an illegal immigrant from El Salvador in an affluent Baltimore suburb north of the city while going on a run in 2023.

""She's done nothing the last four years. She's denied that there's been a problem. She hasn't even acknowledged the murders of my daughter or Alexis's or some of the other victims,"" Morin said on ""Hannity.""

""This whole thing going to the border is just a political stunt, hoping that she's going to check off a box and win some points.""

""[Harris] has not done anything to keep America safe at all,"" Morin added.

Nungaray said she felt ""empathy"" from former President Trump when he reached out to the family.

""It wasn't him calling me as a previous president. It was him calling me as a father. As someone who has kids, someone who couldn't even imagine what it would be like if this was their child.""

Morin said, ""President Trump has reached out to our family multiple times, to multiple members. He's been very compassionate and genuinely cares about our family and our recovering from this tragedy.""

Vice President Kamala Harris visited the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona on Friday, the first time she has been to the border since 2021. It comes as her campaign is being dogged by her record on illegal immigration.

""After years of not just ignoring the problem, but helping create it, Vice President Kamala is finally headed down to the border,"" the National Border Patrol Council said in a statement. ""This is nothing more than for her to check the box, but what it is in reality is a slap in the face towards the men and women that put their lives on the line every day, and also a slap in the face to the American public. Where has she been?""

Harris became vice president in 2021 and the administration immediately rolled back a number of Trump-era initiatives and attempted to place a moratorium on deportations.

Migrant numbers skyrocketed, and Biden told reporters in March that Harris would be put in charge of tackling root causes, issues like climate change, poverty and violence that the administration believes was driving migrants north.

It quickly led to Harris being dubbed by media outlets and Republicans as the ""border czar."" The White House rejected that title, but it has made her a figurehead along with DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for the crisis.

""The border is secure, but we also have a broken immigration system, in particular over the last four years before we came in, and it needs to be fixed,"" Harris said on NBC in 2022.

Fiscal year 2023 broke the record for migrant encounters with over 2.4 million, while December had nearly 250,000 encounters in a single month."
"Politics hijacks hurricane devastation in the South, Biden calls Trump a liar",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/politics-hijacks-hurricane-devastation-south-biden-calls-trump-liar,2024-10-02T07:15:37Z,"Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) reacts to Hurricane Helene response from Biden and Harris and said visiting areas affected by the storm helps bring additional help and support.

Television news, with few exceptions, completely botched the unimaginable devastation that struck western North Carolina over the weekend.

Once Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida and headed inland, officials assumed it would lose strength. Instead, cities like Asheville, and eastern Tennessee, were hit with an almost biblical level of flooding, leaving a trail of impassable roads and collapsed bridges.

Why was this not the lead story everywhere?

To be candid, North Carolina is just a blip on the radar of the coastal media elites, dismissed as fly-over country. Most news organizations don't have a single reporter based there.

NORTH CAROLINA REELING FROM DEVASTATING HELENE AS DEATH TOLL CLIMBS: 'NEVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS'

President Biden just put out statements over the weekend, adding to the sense that this wasn't a Katrina-level crisis. I went to New Orleans eight months after that 2005 storm and was stunned to see mile after mile and after mile of uninhabited suburban homes damaged by the flooding.

Imagine if the same level of flooding hit northern New Jersey, right across from Manhattan. There would have been 500 times as much coverage. In fact, we had a real-life example in Superstorm Sandy, which rightly drew enormous media attention.

Many shows had their B teams in, with few taking charge and ordering a full-scale mobilization on the story.

I was just realizing the magnitude of the destruction on my show when leadoff guest Mary Katharine Ham, who's from North Carolina, texted me an hour before airtime and pushed to cover the story that was being largely ignored. It was a packed program, but I gave her a couple of minutes to talk about it on ""Media Buzz.""

By Monday, perhaps realizing that they looked terrible, TV outlets shifted gears and started constant coverage of the plight of North Carolina, interviewing local officials and survivors. But their journalists faced the challenge of getting to a mountainous region that was isolated and in some towns all but wiped out.

And yet the New York Times and Washington Post did a terrific job of getting their reporters to produce one front-page story after another from the city of Asheville, an artsy town partially submerged by the monster flooding.

KAMALA HARRIS' SOFT MEDIA INTERVIEWS ARE A 'BETRAYAL OF JOURNALISM': MARY KATHARINE HAM

As the Times put it, the storm left ""at least 37 people dead in the region and communities struggling to cope without water, food, power, gasoline and cellphone service.""

The Washington Post, from Canton, N.C.: ""Doris Towers awoke to the beeping of her husband's dialysis machine early Friday morning, meaning it had lost power. Her neighbor's Christmas lights, still up from last year, had gone out. Those were early hints of Helene's destruction to come. She hadn't known a storm was on the way.

""Across the mountains in Swannanoa, Joe Dancy and Jenna Shaw got up before dawn to walk their dog and saw floodwaters creeping toward their house. An hour later, they were climbing out a window with the help of a National Guard soldier.""

Biden, who will visit North Carolina today - Kamala Harris is also planning a visit-addressed the nation on Monday morning with his trademark empathy: ""I'm here to tell every single survivor in these impacted areas that we will be there with you as long as it takes.""

But the president, who kept coughing because of a cold, should have given that speech on Sunday. That would have spurred the journalists into action, because they often follow the White House, and instead left the impression that no one was in charge.

Donald Trump, meanwhile, visited a shelter in Valdosta, Ga., and said, reading from notes:

TRUMP LAUNCHES GOFUNDME TO HELP HURRICANE HELENE VICTIMS, RAISES MORE THAN $1M

""As you know, our country is in the final weeks of a hard-fought national election. At a time like this when a crisis hits, when our fellow citizens cry out in need, none of that matters. We're not talking about politics now. We have to all get together and get this solved.""

The important thing is that Trump, working with Franklin Graham, son of Rev. Billy, who heads a Christian relief group, brought plenty of supplies.

But the former president didn't stay on that high road for long. He posted that Biden and Harris ""have left Americans to drown in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and elsewhere in the South.""

FEMA officials have been working furiously - more than 3,300 federal agents are on the ground-and Harris, canceling several events, returned to Washington for a briefing from agency chief Deanne Criswell, and addressed officials there about the ""heartbreaking"" losses.

Trump also claimed that GOP Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp had not been able to reach Biden. But Kemp told reporters he did talk to Biden and the president ""offered that if there are other things that we need just to call him directly, which - I appreciated that.""

""He's lying, and the governor told him he was lying,"" Biden said. ""I don't know why he does this. I don't care what he says about me. I care about what he communicates to people that are in need. He implies that we're not doing everything possible. We are.""

Vance vs. Walz debate: Top takeaways from VP candidates' face-off,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/vance-vs-walz-debate-top-takeaways-from-vp-candidates-face-off,2024-10-02T05:50:19Z,"In recent weeks, Tim Walz' team tried to lower expectations for his debate with rival JD Vance. Now we know why.

Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Walz did not turn in a disastrous performance on the debate stage, but he was clearly outclassed by Ohio Sen. Vance. Trump supporters who have questioned the young Ohio senator's qualifications for the nation's second-highest office, or asked why the former president chose him to be his running mate, slept better on Tuesday night. He was sharp, appealing, and policy-savvy. Most important, Vance totally upended the media's unflattering characterization of him by being sympathetic, respectful and likeable.

Vance had the advantage of having held dozens of press interviews in recent weeks; he was ready and tested. By contrast, Walz has done almost no unscripted encounters with the media since he became the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate; his inability to go beyond talking points and delve deep into policy was not surprising.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

Walz spent much of the debate talking about programs he claimed to have successfully enacted in Minnesota, like paid family leave. What he was supposed to do on Tuesday night was make the case for running mate Vice President Kamala Harris.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

As with the ABC presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, the CBS News moderators embarrassed themselves by clearly favoring the Democrat contestant. Moreover, CBS' Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell affected a grating school-marmish tone, overly eager to chaperone what was an extremely orderly debate.

Their questions featured well-worn Democrat priorities (climate change, abortion) and they largely avoided topics that could have played well for Vance, like crime. O'Donnell challenged the senator on Trump formerly calling climate change a ""hoax"" and then asserted gratuitously that ""the overwhelming consensus is that the climate is changing.""

Moreover, having said they would not fact-check the candidates, the two women intervened more than once to question a response from Vance, while doing so only one time with Walz.

Unhappily for the Minnesota governor, that one probing question was calamitous. Asked why he had falsely claimed to be in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Walz launched into a word salad that would have made Kamala Harris proud, talking about his experiences traveling in China. Asked again to answer why he had been untruthful, Walz misfired and looked stunned. In effect, he was caught out in a lie. Since he has a history of spinning falsehoods about his past, and especially about his military rank, this was not helpful.

Vance, like Walz, was meant to argue the case for his running mate, and that he did. When the moderators and Walz derided Trump's claim during the presidential debate that he had the ""concept of a plan"" on health care, Vance said that Trump did not have a plan - he had a record. More than once during the evening he reminded the audience that during Trump's presidency inflation was low, the border was closed and the world was at peace.

KAMALA HARRIS MAKES A DESPERATE MOVE ON A CRITICAL ISSUE TO SAVE A SINKING CAMPAIGN

When moderator Margaret Brennan pushed Vance to explain why Trump had abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, thus purportedly allowing the terror state to speed up its efforts to build a nuclear weapon, Vance noted that for the past three-plus years Harris and Biden have been in charge. He rightly pointed out that they helped rebuild Iran's ability to wage war by not enforcing the Trump sanctions, thus allowing the mullahs to grow their income by $100 billion. With Iran just having attacked Israel with 180 missiles, Vance's referencing the Reagan-Trump doctrine of peace through strength resonated.

While Walz repeated Harris' vague promises about making life better for middle class families, Vance reminded the audience that take-home pay had risen under Trump and inflation was low, while under Harris, prices on everything from food to housing had shot up more than 20%. When Walz claimed economists backed Harris' plan over Trump's, Vance responded that Trump didn't have Ph.D.s on his team, he had common sense.

When Walz accused Trump of wanting to enact tariffs on imports, which would serve as a new tax on Americans, Vance congratulated President Joe Biden on keeping the former president's tariffs on China in place, defusing the issue.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

Vance clearly won the dispute over the border, noting that Harris had bragged for three years about undoing all the restrictions that Trump put in place. When Brennan challenged Vance on how Trump would handle separating families while carrying out deportations, Vance referred to the horrifying report that the Department of Homeland Security has lost track of more than 320,000 children brought across the border illegally - a damning and heartbreaking situation that has resulted from Harris' open border.

Not surprisingly, the debate got heated on the subject of abortion. Vance criticized the Minnesota law signed by Walz that does not require the doctor to do everything necessary for the care of a baby that survives a late-term abortion. Walz disputed the characterization, but Vance is correct. Walz, meanwhile, charged Vance with having earlier backed a 15-week national abortion ban. Vance explained that he shares Trump's view that the states are now charged with setting the regulations.

The candidates sparred on other topics, and took expected swipes at each other's running mates, but both maintained their composure and even agreed that on some issues, like school safety, they could likely find some common ground. Especially given the Harris-Walz strategy of avoiding scrutiny and trying to hide their progressive agendas, it was an unusually useful event for America's voters.

The winner of the night, without a doubt, was JD Vance. Will it matter? After all, many argue that no one votes for the V.P. But voters tell pollsters they do not enough about Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

Now they know more, and on the basis of Tuesday night's performance, Vance might have won over a few folks. With the race a dead heat, everything matters."
Donald Trump Jr. tells CNN the 'media has radicalized' people who want to assassinate his father,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/donald-trump-jr-tells-cnn-media-has-radicalized-people-who-want-kill-his-father,2024-10-02T05:17:19Z,"Donald Trump Jr. and CNN's Kaitlan Collins clashed over the media's rhetoric leading up to the two assassination attempts of his father.

In a tense interview with CNN, Donald Trump Jr. said Tuesday the media is partly responsible for the recent assassination attempts against his father, former President Trump, by pushing false narratives that radicalize his critics.

In the spin room following the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, Trump Jr. agreed with CNN's Kaitlan Collins that the event was ""civil"" and noted Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz even acknowledged when they agreed. The CNN host then asked, ""Should we see more of that on the debate stage when your dad's up there?""

""You know what? I'd love to see that across the board,"" Trump Jr. said. ""We've all heard about Trump Derangement Syndrome, we've seen what they've lied about ... 'I was an agent of Russia, but Hunter Biden's laptop was totally Russian disinformation.' It turns out, the opposite was true.""

NBC'S 'SNL' ROASTED FOR MOCKING ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS AGAINST TRUMP: 'ACTIVISM MASQUERADING AS COMEDY'

""The media did that, they created so much of that environment. The media has radicalized the people that are trying to kill my father. I've had to deal with that twice now in the last two months,"" he continued. ""I've had to have that conversation with my five young children twice in the last two months about someone trying to shoot their grandfather.""

Trump Jr. then said ""that didn't just magically happen,"" and accused the media of creating a ""fake Russia scenario"" to tarnish his father.

""They ran with it for years, even when it was disproven, they still ran with it. You know, that environment wasn't just created by Donald Trump,"" Trump Jr. said.

Collins shot back, ""Everyone wants your dad to be safe. Nobody wants the threats against his life to happen, but you can't blame the media for those threats. There's been no evidence.""

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

The former president's son disagreed.

""When someone allows someone to have a platform to call someone 'literally Hitler,' every day for nine years, it creates it. Whether you want to believe it or not, that's a fact,"" Trump Jr. said.

When Trump narrowly survived the assassination attempt against him in July, a bullet grazed the former president's ear and the shooter killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore -- a husband, father and former fire chief at the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Department. The gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, also critically wounded two other rally-goers.

Just two months later, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was arrested on Sept. 15 after allegedly pushing the muzzle of an AK-47 through the chainlink fence outside where Trump was golfing in Florida. No shots were fired at Trump after the Secret Service spotted the potential gunman and opened fire; the suspect fled and was arrested shortly afterward.

A focus group of Republicans, Democrats and independents reacted to former President Trump's running mate Sen. JD Vance's microphone being cut off during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate on Tuesday night.

Independent and Republican voters disapproved of the interjection, but independent voters dipped significantly when Vance began explaining his stance.

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming public resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" Vance reminded them. ""And since you are fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

When Walz tried interjecting, independent approval also decreased for a brief moment.

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

When the microphones were cut off, the independent voter dial line can be seen moving in the approval direction as Republican approval decreased slightly.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance's argument that the U.S. needed to ""stop the bleeding"" at the border during Tuesday's debate elicited a mixed response from voters,

""Before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding,"" Vance argued during Tuesday's debate. ""We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.""

According to Fox News debate dials, which measure how Republican, Democrat, and Independent voters are responding to particular answers by candidates during the debate, the response by Vance received mixed responses.

While Republican views of Vance's answers had an immediate positive response, Democratic viewers of the debate went in an opposite direction, the dials showed. Independents, meanwhile, hovered around 50% approval with Vance's answer.

Voters began to see Vance's response in a more positive light when he touched on former President Donald Trump's border policies, arguing that the next administration should return to handling the border similar to how Trump did during his four years in office.

Voters also responded well to Vance's remarks on deportation, where the Ohio Senator argued in favor of focusing on those who have committed crimes in addition to crossing the border illegally.

JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz's performances at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

The largely civil and arguably quite informative debate between Democratic nominee Gov. Tim Walz and Republican nominee Sen. JD Vance on Tuesday night has underscored one thing. We need another presidential debate.

Both Walz and Vance stuck to familiar positions on the issues on the debate stage, whether it was on the economy, health care, energy or immigration. No new ground was broken, no dramatic changes in policy were unveiled.

Still, the debate, in my estimation, was very important for a fundamental reason: it was civil, it was informative, and it included a surprisingly high degree of bipartisanship that has been noticeably absent from the 2024 presidential race.

It is certain that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump watched the debate. And both, I am sure, concluded that their respective running mates did an excellent job in both underscoring their core positions as well as attacking their rivals.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

But most importantly, on Tuesday night there was a comment that I think both candidates underscored in their own way: That we can do better as Americans, we can solve our problems and provide leadership as people who disagree, and sometimes vigorously, but have a broader purpose beyond our narrow partisan concerns.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

This is not simply a homily. It's much more. It is a large-scale call for a different kind of politics, even if implicitly made by both candidates, it is a recognition of the extraordinary challenges we face, both domestically and internationally, in the wake of Iran's attack on Israel. And most of all, it underscores to me why both presidential candidates need to quickly accept the invitation of various news networks for another debate or more debates in the final 35 days of this campaign.

It's virtually certain that no minds were changed on Tuesday night.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

To be sure, the pundits will be vetting what the candidates said or didn't say about immigration and abortion. Two topics on which they disagree vehemently. But the two vice presidential candidates were largely repeating and underscoring what their respective nominees have said and believe.

The key now is for the media to focus on what the American people want and require as this extraordinary race comes down to the finish line. The two presidential campaigns need to face off, at least once, if not more times, to discuss and debate their positions on the issues with a greater degree of specificity and precision than they have done previously.

The 2024 presidential race is now an effective statistical tie. This is especially true when one looks at the seven key swing states in this election. There is a degree of uncertainty about precisely where the candidates stand on the important issues facing our country after a raucous presidential debate last month that was more personally divisive than it was informative.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

For us to make an informed choice as Americans, we need to replicate what happened on Tuesday night with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The two presidential candidates need to tell us, in programmatic terms, what they will do on the economy, immigration, crime, health care, energy and, of course, on foreign affairs, a critical topic which did not get anywhere near the attention it deserved and required.

The level of dissatisfaction of the American electorate with the candidates and with the political process cannot be overestimated. We saw what the American people deserve but have not received until now in this presidential election.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

Both vice presidential candidates were likable on Tuesday night. Vance had heretofore not been seen that way. On the debate stage, it was hard not to empathize with him, even if you disagreed with him. Likewise, Walz delivered as a likable everyman figure.

I came away from the presidential debate last month not wanting to have dinner with either Trump or Harris. After the V.P. debate, I wanted to get to know both candidates better.

My takeaway from Tuesday night is that, for virtually the first time in this election cycle, Vance and Walz quietly acknowledged that the electorate requires something more before Election Day. It's up to Trump and Harris to give it to them--in person--at least one more time, if not more."

JD Vance addresses the Iran Nuclear Deal during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democrat vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced off Tuesday night in their first -- and only -- debate, sparring over issues from foreign policy to border security; abortion to climate change; and introducing themselves and their records to the American people with just five weeks to Election Day.

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5th, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs, on a day that began with nearly 50,000 unionized dock workers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a tough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

As for a preemptive strike, Vance said ""it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe.""

""And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys,"" Vance said.

Walz fired back, slamming the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" while saying Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

But Vance fired back.

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years? And the answer is, your running mate -- not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, said he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves ""when was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border -- a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no. told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking; some of them, hopefully are at homes with their families; some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules,"" Vance said. ""The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris's wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, you know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies. I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

Walz pushed back, saying children have not been used as ""drug mules,"" and defending Harris, saying she was attorney general in California and ""prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drugs.""

Walz also hit Vance over claims he had made about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, saying he had demonized them.

""Look in Springfield Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans,"" Vance said.

At that point, moderators tried to correct Vance--but the GOP vice presidential nominee pushed back, reminding that the moderators said they would not fact-check the candidates.

The moderators said that many Haitian residents in Springfield, Ohio have legal temporary status. Vance jumped in to ""say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process and tying it to a Harris-backed process, the moderators spoke over him, sarcastically thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

""We have so much we have to get to, thank you so much for explaining the legal process,"" Margaret Brennan said before asking her co-moderator to ask the next question.

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American People's Trust back on this issue, where they frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options right now.""

Vance echoed Trump's view of abortion--supporting the Supreme Court's decision to return the issue of abortion back to the states, while supporting exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON 2 TOP ISSUES AHEAD OF VP DEBATE

""The proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions,"" Vance said. ""Let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big a very diverse. And let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.""

Meanwhile, the moderators switched to questions of leadership -- with the moderators pressing Walz on whether he was actually in China for the Tiananmen Square protests, like he claimed.

A visibly nervous Walz attempted to explain the discrepancy, ultimately saying he ""misspoke"" and was not there until later that year.

And the question for Vance was about his past criticisms of Trump.

Vance said, at the time, he disliked Trump because he ""believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record.""

""Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take-home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans, a secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on. And yeah, when you screw up, when you misspeak, when you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people about it,"" Vance said.

Meanwhile, Vance offered his sympathies to Walz during the section of the debate focused on gun violence, when he learned that Walz's son had witnessed a shooting.

Walz said his 17-year-old son ""witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball.""

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting. I'm sorry about that -- Christ, have mercy,"" Vance said.

The two spoke about school shootings and their plans to solve gun violence.

""We have to make the doors locked better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger, and of course, we've got to increase school resource officers. Because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience,"" Vance said.

Walz said the conversation was a good start but had to go further.

""Even though they have a high gun ownership rate in the country, there are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment. And the idea to have some of these weapons out there, it just doesn't make any sense,"" he said.

And on another top issue this cycle: democracy.

Vance was pushed on his past comments, in which he said he would not have voted to certify the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021.

Vance fired back at the assertion that Trump could pose a ""threat to democracy,"" saying that he believes ""we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country.""

""But unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about. It is the threat of censorship. It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics. It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens,"" Vance said.

Walz redirected the discussion back to Jan. 6, 2021, blasting Trump and Republicans for allegedly denying the events of that day.

""I will tell you this, that when this is over, we need to shake hands this election and the winner needs to be the winner. This has got to stop. It's tearing our country apart,"" Walz said.

But Vance replied, saying it is ""really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th.""

""As we have done for 250 years in this country, we are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election. And of course, I hope that we win, and I think we're going to win,"" Vance said. ""But if Tim Walz is the next vice president, he'll have my prayers. He'll have my best wishes and he'll have my help whenever he wants it.""

But Vance reminded Americans that ""for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections.""

""Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board,"" Vance said. ""But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor.""

As the debate came to a close, Vance and Walz both promised voters a new direction for the United States.

""Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward,"" Walz said. ""She's bringing us a politics of joy. She's bringing real solutions for the middle class. And she's centering you at the heart of that, all the while asking everyone, join this movement. Make your voices heard.""

Vance also gave a message of change to the voters.

""We need change. We need a new direction. We need a president who has already done this once before and did it well. Please vote for Donald Trump,"" Vance said. ""And whether you vote for me or vote for Tim Walz, I just want to say I'm so proud to be doing this and I'm rooting for you.

Walz came into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating. Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable.

Heading into the debate, Vance had been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Both running mates get right back on the campaign trail on Wednesday in two of the key seven battleground states that will likely determine whether Harris or Trump succeed President Biden in the White House.

Vance holds campaign events in Auburn Hills and Marne, Michigan. And Walz takes part in a campaign bus tour swing through parts of central Pennsylvania which kicks off at the airport in Harrisburg, the state capital."

Project 2025 refers to a set of conservative policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation and has turned into a right-wing-'boogeyman' style Democratic talking point and fodder for Trump critics.

The debate in New York City on CBS News was Walz and Vance's only debate prior to the monumental election on Nov. 5.

""Tim Walz is as radical as they come on the issue of immigration,"" Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., wrote on X. ""As governor of Minnesota, he supported free health care, free college tuition, and driver's licenses for illegal immigrants.

The debate began with CBS News moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan asking the candidates about their Middle East policy after Iran attacked Israel with a massive missile barrage.

""Tim Walz's answer on Israel was incomprehensible. Like Kamala--Walz has no idea what he is talking about,"" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X. ""Kamala and Walz would make the chaos in the Middle East worse.""

""Iran rained missiles down on Israel TODAY, 1,350 days into Kamala Harris' tenure as Vice President, so naturally Tim Walz says it's Donald Trump's fault,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Tim Murtaugh wrote on X.

Tim Walz during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate on The Ingraham Angle.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz baffled the internet on Tuesday when he accidentally declared he has ""become friends with school shooters"" during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate against Sen. JD Vance.

The poorly timed mishap occurred when Walz was asked about changing positions on banning assault weapons, which he previously opposed but now supports.

""I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it,"" Walz said.

SOME BIDEN 2020 VOTERS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS

While Walz presumably meant he has become friendly with parents who lost children during horrific school shootings, the internet was sent into a tizzy.

""Walz saying he's become friends with school shooters, when he meant victims, is an innocent misstatement. Repeatedly lying about his military rank, his DUI, IVF and Hong Kong/Tiananmen Square are not innocent misstatements,"" Fox News contributor Guy Benson responded.

The Media Research Center called it an ""unfortunate slip of the tongue.""

Walz's critics were quick to mock Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate. Former President Trump asked if Walz is ""insane,"" Trump War Room quickly shared video of the gaffe and Walz was declared ""not ready for primetime"" by Trump national press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy downplayed the gaffe.

""Walz obviously misspoke, he didn't mean he'd become friends with school shooters. C'mon. This is a good, high minded debate as things go these days,"" McCarthy wrote.

Pundit John Podhoretz added, ""Walz obviously meant he's become friends with parents whose children were tragically shot. People will forgive his misstatement. As long as it's true.""

However, journalist Andy Ngo called it the ""gaffe of the 2024 election"" and influence Robby Starbuck asked, ""Umm... Does he want to explain that?""

Vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz sparred on the issue of immigration in their debate Tuesday night, and Vance called out the immigration policies of VP Kamala Harris.

""First of all, the gross majority of what we need to do to the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job,"" Vance said during the Tuesday night debate on CBS during a discussion on the Haitian migrant surge in Springfield and immigration overall.

""I've been to the southern border more than our 'border czar' Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.""

Vance continued by saying that, ""of course, additional resources would help,"" but that the issue is mostly about the Biden administration not empowering law enforcement to say ""if you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico"" and ""go back through proper channels.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

""Now, Gov. Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield,"" Vance said. ""Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.

""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris' open border. It is a disgrace, Tim, and I actually think I agree with you. I think you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does.""

Walz repeatedly made the case that Trump shut down the Senate immigration bill earlier this year that VP Harris has said she will sign in a move he believes would have made strides at the border.

""It is law enforcement that asked for the bill,"" Walz said. ""They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.

""On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.

""This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then, you start to make a difference in this, and you start to adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.""

Vance referred to the Biden-Harris record on immigration as a ""disgrace.""

""Look, what Tim said just doesn't pass the smell test,"" Vance said. ""For three years. Kamala Harris went out bragging that she was going to undo Donald Trump's border policy. She did exactly that. We had a record number of illegal crossings. We had a record number of fentanyl coming into our country.

""And now that she's running for president or a few months before, she says that somehow she got religion and cares a lot about a piece of legislation. The only thing that she did when she became the vice president, when she became the appointed border czar was to undo 94 Donald Trump executive actions that opened the border. This problem is leading to massive problems in the United States of America. Parents who can't afford health care, schools that are overwhelmed. It's got to stop. And it will when Donald Trump is president.""

A Harris campaign official told Fox News Digital that its focus group of undecided voters watching the debate reacted more strongly in favor of Walz's comments.

""Overall, Gov. Walz outperformed JD Vance in the immigration section, and the highest rating for Gov. Walz of the night so far was when he reminded viewers of Donald Trump's failed promise to build a wall, only building 2% of it,"" the campaign said."

Sen. JD Vance pushed back on the CBS News moderators who attempted to fact-check him in a contentious moment during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday.

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan, interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

When Vance tried to push back on the fact-check, Brennan and her co-moderator Norah O'Donnell attempted to speak over Vance, insisting that they had to move on to the next question.

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" Vance reminded them. ""And since you are fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

""The audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" she added when Vance continued to respond.

CBS News announced last week that it would not allow its moderators to partake in any fact checking or correcting live in an effort to avoid the fury sparked by ABC News for its partisan handling of the first presidential debate between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Walz forced to correct record on whether he was in China for the Tiananmen Square protests,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-forced-correct-record-whether-he-china-tiananmen-square-protests,2024-10-02T02:36:59Z,"Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., joins 'Jesse Watters Primetime' to discuss a House investigation into Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz's alleged ties to China.

Democrat vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was forced to answer questions about his controversial travel to China, and misstatements about those trips, during Tuesday night's debate.

Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. But Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are now reporting that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy.

COMER SUBPOENAS DHS FOR RECORDS RELATING TO WALZ'S ALLEGED TIES TO CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY

""Look, I grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service,"" a visibly-shaky Walz said. ""I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms, and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.""

Walz said that as a ""passionate young teacher"" he had ""the opportunity in the summer of '89 to travel to China -- 35 years ago.""

""I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams, we would take baseball teams, we would take dancers, and we would go back and forth to China,"" Walz said, noting the trips were ""to try and learn.""

""Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, and I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect,"" Walz continued.

""And I'm a knucklehead at times,"" Walz said.

Walz said his commitment ""from the beginning"" has been to ""make sure that I'm there for the people.""

""Many times, I will talk a lot. I will get caught up in rhetoric. But being there, the impact it made, the difference it made in my life, I learned a lot about China,"" Walz said. ""I hear the critiques of this.""

Walz said he would ""make the case that Donald Trump should have come on one of those trips with us.""

""I guarantee you he wouldn't be, praising XI Jinping about Covid. And I guarantee you he wouldn't start a trade war that he ends up losing,"" Walz said. ""So this is about trying to understand the world. It's about trying to do the best you can for your community, and then it's putting yourself out there and letting your folks understand what it is.""

He added: ""My commitment, whether it be through teaching, which I was good at or whether it was being a good soldier or was being a good member of Congress. Those are the things that I think are the values that people care about.""

But Brennan pushed back, reminding Walz of the question, and again asking him to explain the discrepancy.

""All I said on this was, as I got there that summer and misspoke on this,"" Walz said. ""So I will just that's what I've said. So I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests went in and from that I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance.""

Walz's ties to China have come under the microscope since becoming Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT INVESTIGATING WALZ OVER 'LONGSTANDING CONNECTIONS' TO CHINA

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., launched an investigation into Walz's alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

Comer revealed that Walz has ""engaged and partnered with"" Chinese entities, making him ""susceptible"" to the CCP's strategy of ""elite capture,"" which seeks to co-opt influential figures in elite political, cultural and academic circles to ""influence the United States to the benefit of the communist regime and the detriment of Americans.""

Comer has pointed to reports that Walz, while working as a teacher in the 1990s, organized a trip to China for Alliance High School students. The costs were reportedly ""paid by the Chinese government.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

Comer is investigating Walz's 1994-created private company named ""Educational Travel Adventures, Inc.,"" which coordinated annual student trips to China until 2003 and was led by Walz.

The company reportedly ""dissolved four days after he took congressional office in 2007.""

Comer said Walz has traveled to China an estimated ""30 times.""

Comer has now issued a subpoena for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, compelling him to produce DHS records related to Walz's alleged ties to the CCP.

Walz, meanwhile, during a congressional hearing in 2016, said he had ""been to China dozens of times.""

""I've been there about 30 times,"" Walz told an agriculture-focused publication in 2016.

However, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson recently said to Minnesota Public Radio that the number was ""closer to 15 times."""

""Honestly, Tim, I think he's got a tough job here because you've got to play Whac-A-Mole. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take home pay, which of course he did. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation, which of course he did,"" Vance said Tuesday evening during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate in New York City.

Vance was responding after Walz slammed the GOP ticket as one that protects billionaires with tax cuts and pledging that he's a ""union guy"" who wants to keep jobs in the U.S.

The economy is a top voter concern this election cycle, ranking alongside issues such as the immigration crisis, abortion and national security.

""I hope we have a conversation on health care then, senator,"" Walz said as Vance wrapped up his points on the economy.

""Please,"" Vance responded.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz kicked off his debate against Ohio Sen. JD Vance on shaky footing when he was first asked about his foreign policy platform in the Middle East.

""Governor Walz, if you were the final voice in the Situation Room, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran?"" CBS' Margaret Brennan asked Walz on Tuesday evening in New York City during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate.

Walz thanked the moderators for hosting him before delivering a halting and stammering answer while calling for ""steady leadership.""

""Iran, our I, Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental. Getting its hostages back, fundamental. And ending the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute fundamental necessity for the United States to have to steady leadership there. You saw it experienced today where along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, able to stop the incoming attack,"" Walz responded, taking a few pauses between words.

ISRAEL UNDER ATTACK: IRAN LAUNCHES MISSILES, GUNMEN KILL AT LEAST 8 NEAR TEL AVIV

Earlier Tuesday, Iran launched more than 100 ballistic missiles at Israel. War broke out in Israel nearly one year ago on Oct. 7 when Hamas launched attacks on the nation.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter. It's clear. And the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment,"" Walz continued.

GOP LEADER SAYS VANCE 'ABSOLUTELY PREPARED' FOR VP DEBATE SHOWDOWN WITH WALZ

Walz continued his response by taking shots at former President Donald Trump and his former administration officials.

""His chief of staff, John Kelly, said that he was the most flawed human being you'd ever met. And both of his secretaries of defense and his national security advisers said he should be nowhere near the White House. Now, the person closest to them... said he's unfit for the highest office. That was Sen. Vance,"" Walz said, referring to Vance's previous criticisms of Trump before he was elected to the White House in 2016.

""What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership.

Former CBS News anchor Dan Rather scolded his former employer for declining to fact-check during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, saying the network is ""trying to avoid the blowback ABC got"" for fact-checking former President Trump.

Rather stepped down from his role as CBS' evening news anchor in 2005 and eventually left the network the following year after reporting a discredited story about then-President George W. Bush. He took to Substack Monday ahead of his old employer hosting the CBS Vice Presidential Debate between Sen. JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz, which will be moderated by Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell.

""There are few guarantees in life, but odds are that more than one lie will be told by Donald Trump's protege and running mate, JD Vance. If there's one thing Vance has learned from Trump, it's that lying to get ahead is OK. If you get caught, just double down and lie some more. Who's going to fact check you? Well, apparently not CBS News,"" Rather wrote.

ABC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: MODERATORS DAVID MUIR AND LINSEY DAVIS FACT-CHECK TRUMP 5 TIMES, 0 FOR HARRIS

Rather said he was ""reluctant"" to criticize CBS News, where he worked for 45 years, but he feels it is necessary. His call for fact-checking come after ABC News was widely criticized for correcting Trump multiple times but failing to fact-check Vice President Kamala Harris during the recent presidential debate.

""With that as background, it is necessary to report and comment on the fact that CBS News has decided not to fact-check the candidates in real time. I would love to know what went into this decision, because it feels spineless, especially after ABC's Linsey Davis and David Muir effectively and correctly fact-checked Trump during the debate with Kamala Harris,"" Rather wrote.

""CBS says it is up to the candidates to fact-check, though 'the moderators will facilitate those opportunities' during rebuttal time,"" he continued. ""While both fact-checking (ABC during the Harris-Trump debate) and not fact-checking (CNN during the Biden-Trump debate) have drawn criticism this year, for the most part, the criticism was unsurprisingly partisan.""

Rather noted that CBS News would fact-check the candidates online, but dismissed viewers for being able to follow along in real time.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

""Simply put, this 'rule,' imposed by CBS, incentivizes lying. It invites the participants to bend the truth, since their opponent then has to spend his rebuttal time calling out the lie, rather than giving an opposing view. And the calling out of a lie by an opponent rather than an impartial moderator is less credible,"" Rather wrote.

""It seems clear that CBS is trying to avoid the blowback ABC got after the presidential debate. A journalist, much less a news organization, should not be afraid to take heat,"" Rather continued. ""Their responsibility is to call out lies. If they don't do that on live television, during the most consequential election in modern history, they are the lesser for it. But the biggest loser is the American electorate.""

CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump campaign denies it ever agreed to '60 Minutes' interview after CBS News claimed he backed out,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-campaign-denies-ever-agreed-60-minutes-interview-after-cbs-news-claimed-he-backed-out,2024-10-01T23:20:21Z,"'Gutfeld!' guests discuss CBS News verifying Hunter Biden's laptop two years after dismissing it.

The Trump campaign is denying that it had ever formally accepted the invitation for former President Trump to sit for a ""60 Minutes"" interview after CBS News claimed he had backed out.

""60 Minutes is scheduled to air a primetime election special on a Monday edition of the broadcast on Oct. 7 at 8 p.m... This year, both the Harris and Trump campaigns agreed to sit down with 60 Minutes,"" CBS News said in a statement released Tuesday. ""Vice President Harris will speak with correspondent Bill Whitaker. After initially accepting 60 Minutes' request for an interview with Scott Pelley, former President Trump's campaign has decided not to participate. Pelley will address this Monday evening.""

But according to Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung, that was ""fake news.""

""60 Minutes begged for an interview, even after they were caught lying about Hunter Biden's laptop back in 2020,"" Cheung wrote on X. ""There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in.""

CBS News did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Cheung was alluding to the testy exchange Trump had with veteran ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl, who dismissed the Hunter Biden laptop scandal during their interview just days before the 2020 election.

At the time, Trump insisted that then-candidate Joe Biden was ""in the midst of a scandal.""

""He's not,"" Stahl gleefully replied.

""Of course he is, Lesley,"" Trump sternly doubled down.

""No, c'mon,"" Stahl continued to reject the president's claim, before lecturing him, ""This is '60 Minutes' and we can't put on things that we can't verify.""

CBS News eventually went on and verified the infamous laptop in 2022.

CBS News stated that its election special will air Monday as planned, featuring only the Harris interview.

""Our original invitation to former President Donald Trump to be interviewed on 60 Minutes stands,"" CBS News added.

The network's announcement comes just hours before it is set to host the vice-presidential debate between Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

Hours before the vice presidential debate, former President Donald Trump addressed a crowd at his campaign rally in Wisconsin and bashed the Biden administration over Iran's historic attack on Israel.

""A short time ago, Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at Israel... I've been talking about World War III for a long time, and I don't want to make predictions because the predictions always come true. We're not going to make [predictions]... but they are very close to global catastrophe,"" Trump said. ""We have a non-existent president and a non-existent vice president who should be in charge, but nobody knows what's going on.""

Trump's comments come after Israel said Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at the country, marking the largest ballistic missile attack in history.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike late last week and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, according to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst.

IRAN ATTACK ON ISRAEL 'INEFFECTIVE' BUT A 'SIGNIFICANT ESCALATION': WHITE HOUSE

Iran's Revolutionary Guard warned in a statement released by Iranian state media that if Israel responds to the missile barrage, ""it will face crushing attacks.""

Trump accused President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of weak leadership on the world stage.

""That's why Israel was under attack just a little while ago. Because they don't respect our country anymore. The so-called enemy doesn't respect our country any longer,"" Trump said.

IRAN FIRES MULTIPLE MISSILE STRIKES ACROSS ISRAEL

Trump claimed Biden and Harris made Iran rich in a very short period of time.

""They have $300 billion now. They're rich. I mean, they pay 6 billion every time they have somebody that was kidnaped, it's always $6 billion,"" Trump said.

""Iran was on the verge of bankruptcy. They had no money left. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. The people they're fighting now, they would have been willing to make any deal. You could have made any deal. But Kamala flooded them with American cash and everything. Now, I mean, they're flooding them with cash. It's honestly not even believable,"" Trump continued.

National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the Iranian missile attack on Israel was ""defeated and ineffective"" and that the U.S. military coordinated with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to repel the strikes.

""U.S. naval destroyers joined Israeli Air Defense units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles. President Biden and Vice President Harris monitored the attack and the response from the White House Situation Room, joined in person and remotely by their national security team,"" Sullivan said.

Sullivan characterized the attack as a ""significant escalation"" while speaking at a White House briefing on Tuesday.

Sullivan said no deaths were reported on the Israeli side, although the White House is monitoring the reported death of a Palestinian civilian in Jericho in the West Bank.

""We do not know of any damage to aircraft or strategic military assets in Israel. In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective. The word fog of war was invented for a situation like this. This is a fluid situation,"" he said.

Many missiles were intercepted by Israel's missile defense systems, while others did hit the ground.

The Pentagon says the U.S. fired approximately 12 interceptors against Iranian missiles.

Antony Blinken does victory lap on Biden-Harris' 'stronger' foreign policy same day Iran attacks Israel,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/antony-blinken-op-ed-touts-biden-harris-foreign-policy-renewal-same-day-iran-attacks-israel,2024-10-01T22:09:19Z,"Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest on Israel's possible response after the Iran missile attack on 'Your World.'

Secretary of State Antony Blinken published an op-ed Tuesday touting the Biden-Harris administration's foreign policy record, stating they took drastic deviations from former President Trump, the same day Iran directly attacked Israel with hundreds of ballistic missiles.

Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel Tuesday evening local time in what the administration called a ""signigicant escalation by Iran."" The indiscriminate rocket fire were part of the Shia regime's response to Israel assassinating nearly all of Hezbollah senior leadership, including long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Hours before Iran's attack, Blinken's op-ed touted how Biden-Harris' ""renewal"" strategy post-Trump was working and strengthening America's interests abroad.

""The Biden administration's strategy has put the United States in a much stronger geopolitical position today than it was four years ago,"" Blinken said.

PENTAGON SENDING A 'FEW THOUSAND' PERSONNEL TO MIDDLE EAST DAY AFTER BIDEN SAID HE WOULDN'T ADD COMBAT TROOPS

Blinken said the administration prioritized international cooperation and avoided making decisions abroad in isolation.

""From day one, President Biden and Vice President Harris made a foundational choice that in a more competitive and combustible world, the United States cannot go it alone. If America wants to protect its security and create opportunities for its people, it must stand with those who have a stake in a free, open, secure, and prosperous world and stand up to those who threaten that world,"" he wrote. ""President Biden and Vice President Harris pursued a strategy of renewal, pairing historic investments in competitiveness at home with an intensive diplomatic campaign to revitalize partnerships abroad,"" he said. ""This twin-pillared strategy, they believed, was the best way to disabuse competitors of their assumptions that the United States was declining and diffident.""

Blinken also stated the war in Gaza is interconnected to Iran's maligned behavior.

""Without an end to the war in Gaza and a time-bound, credible path to statehood that addresses the Palestinians' legitimate aspirations and Israel's security needs, normalization cannot move forward. But if these efforts succeed, normalization would join Israel to a regional security architecture, unlock economic opportunities across the region, and isolate Iran and its proxies,"" he continued. ""Glimmers of such integration were on display in the coalition of countries, including Arab states, that helped Israel defend itself against an unprecedented direct attack from Iran in April.""

The State Department referred Fox News Digital to the department's briefing when asked for comment.

House Republicans have described Biden-Harris foreign policy as one aiming at ""appeasement,"" particularly towards Iran.

CNN's Harry Enten says JD Vance has 'nothing to lose' in debate with Walz because of low favorability ratings,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnns-harry-enten-says-jd-vance-has-nothing-lose-debate-walz-because-low-favorability-ratings,2024-10-01T19:42:52Z,"CNN's Harry Enten said Tuesday that Sen. JD Vance had ""nothing to lose"" during his debate against Tim Walz, due to his low favorability ratings.

CNN data reporter Harry Enten said Tuesday that Sen. JD Vance had nothing to lose in his debate against Gov. Tim Walz because of his low favorability ratings.

""This is the net favorable ratings, -11 points for JD Vance. No bueno,"" Enten said. ""Tim Walz, look at that, a +4 net favorability rating.""

According to the favorability ratings, Vance has a lower net favorability than his running mate, former President Trump, whose net favorability rating is -9. However, Walz has a higher net rating than his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, who sits at a +1 net favorability rating.

""The bottom line is JD Vance not very well liked going into this first debate, but he really has nothing to lose because he's already the least liked VP nominee going into his first debate. I mean, you can't get worse than last, so let's see if you can come out tonight, maybe show the voters something that they haven't seen before and aren't expecting,"" he said.

Enten said Vance has been a ""drag"" on Trump.

""J.D. Vance has actually, if anything, been a drag on the Republican side of the ticket, while Tim Walz has actually, if anything, helped Kamala Harris up a little bit. But the bottom line is here, this negative 11 points, no good. This plus four points, pretty good in today's polarized environment,"" Enten said.

The CNN data reporter also said Vance had the worst net favorablity rating of all time heading into a VP debate.

""The only other person in negative net favorability territory is Dan Quayle back in 1988, with a -3 net favorability rating, if you know anything about VPs and the way that folks view them, you do not want to be in the company of Dan Quayle, JD Vance is in the company and is actually in a worse position going into his first debate than, of course, Dan Quayle was going into his first debate in 1988. And of course, that debate did not go very well,"" Enten said.

Enten said that low expectations for Vance might end up helping him in the debate, as Walz was favored to win the debate.

""Who do bettors think will win the first debate? In fact, they believe that Tim Walz is the favorite going into this first debate, JD Vance is actually the underdog, at least who the bettors think will win in those post-debate polls that we'll obviously get later on,"" Enten said.

Former Obama adviser David Axelrod suggested Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, was better prepared for Tuesday night's vice-presidential debate because he had been frequently engaging with the media while his opponent, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, ""has not.""

""Vance was chosen by Trump to be his designated hitter on TV and he is ubiquitous on these Sunday shows and in interviews. He has been prepping, not just for the last week, but through these appearances, Walz has not,"" Axelrod said Tuesday on CNN.

Vance and Walz will face off in their first and likely only debate before the November election on Tuesday. The debate will be moderated by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan.

According to staffers for the Walz campaign, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate is reportedly nervous about coming off poorly during the debate and letting down his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris.

TRUMP-VANCE TICKET HAS DONE COMBINED 60 INTERVIEWS SINCE LAST MONTH COMPARED TO 21 FOR HARRIS-WALZ

Axelrod said these leaked comments to the media show that his campaign is ""actively trying to lower expectations"" for the Democrat ahead of the debate.

""It's interesting to me that the campaign has basically leaked over the last 24 hours, 'Well, he told us that he wasn't a good debater.' I mean, they're actively trying to lower expectation for Walz,"" he continued.

""[V]ance is very good at this. And he was chosen for that. Walz was chosen for that affability, that warmth. And the question is, is it going to be a Labrador Retriever versus a coyote? And how does that turn out?"" Axelrod asked.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Harris-Walz campaign for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

WALZ'S DEBATE PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS LOWERED AHEAD OF SHOWDOWN WITH VANCE: 'STILL LARGELY UNTESTED'

The Democratic presidential ticket still lags behind the Republican ticket in sitting down for interviews with the media, though Harris has stepped up her appearances in recent days.

Trump and Vance have sat down for at least 60 interviews since the Harris-Walz ticket was formed, as of Monday, compared to 21 non-scripted interviews for Harris and Walz.

Former Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill argued on MSNBC that the media should ""lower"" its expectations for Walz's performance on Tuesday.

""I'm just a little worried about the expectations game at this point. I think people -- yes, JD Vance has said some really, I think, disqualifying things about women and how he views people and their role in life. But he will be articulate and he will be prepared and he will be better than Trump was,"" she said on the liberal network on Sunday.

""I just think we need to lower expectations a little bit, because then we can all be pleasantly surprised if I'm wrong and that Tim Walz just mops the floor with him the same way Kamala Harris mopped the floor with Donald Trump,"" McCaskill added.

The Washington Post's coverage of GOP vice-presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, is overwhelmingly negative, with almost none of its content resembling anything positive in recent weeks, Fox News Digital has found.

From August 6 to September 30, a whopping 71% of The Post's content was negative, according to its online search results. Just 1.4% was positive, while roughly 28% was neutral.

The search results included news reports, opinion pieces, political cartoons, videos and podcast links spanning from when his Democratic rival, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, was tapped by Vice President Kamala Harris as her running mate. Negative results include unflattering reports about the candidate.

CBS NEWS CASTS A LONG SHADOW OF ANTI-TRUMP BIAS AHEAD OF ITS VICE-PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Seventeen of the 49 negative results, or more than one-third, involved his comments about Springfield, Ohio. Three of them involved taking his quote about school shootings out of context when he said ""I don't like that this is a fact of life."" Also among the negative results were five separate fact-checks against Vance, three of them resulting in the harshest rating of ""Four Pinocchios.""

Last week, The Post made headlines after it obtained private messages Vance sent in 2020 critical of then-President Trump.

Perhaps the most prolific in the anti-Vance bashing is columnist Philip Bump, who has written at least ten pieces primarily knocking the Republican hopeful during the 55-day period.

Fellow columnist Jennifer Rubin is setting expectations low for Vance ahead of Tuesday night's vice-presidential debate with Walz, in a piece headlined, ""Vance had better buckle up: His debate might go as badly as Trump's.""

The only remotely positive article Fox News Digital was able to find was an op-ed with the headline ""JD Vance isn't wrong about the value of family caregivers.""

Meanwhile, Walz has gotten much rosier coverage since he joined the Democratic ticket. More than 50% of The Post's coverage was either positive or took a defensive stance of the Minnesota governor. Just 8% of the coverage was negative, and 41% of the results were neutral.

Two of the eight negative articles among the search results were on how Walz was facing ""new scrutiny"" over his military service record as well as his handling of the 2020 George Floyd riots in Minneapolis.

While Vance was the subject of five fact-checks, Walz was only the main subject of two, one of them rated ""Four Pinocchios."" Walz was also included among fact-checked speakers on Day 3 of the Democratic National Convention.

FOX NEWS MEDIA WILL PRESENT SPECIAL LIVE COVERAGE OF VANCE-WALZ DEBATE

The only opinion piece overtly critical of the governor that Fox News Digital was able to find was one written Aug. 30 by columnist Kathleen Parker about his history of dishonesty.

Despite largely keeping a low profile, particularly from the media, Walz was showered with glowing pieces by The Post right out of the gate.

""Tim Walz's journey from high school football coach to VP candidate,"" one headline read on the day Harris announced her running mate. The next day, columnist Michele L. Norris laid out ""6 reasons Tim Walz was the right choice."" The day after that, The Post published the story ""Harris and Walz seize on joyful message in contrast to darker Trump themes.""

According to The Post, Walz was a man of political evolution in stories like ""How Tim Walz went from NRA-endorsed to a gun-control advocate"" and ""How Black women shaped Tim Walz's politics after the death of George Floyd.""

Additionally, the ""Democracy Dies in Darkness"" paper made Walz into a fashion icon with stories like ""For Tim Walz, 'a dad in plaid,' dressing down is leveling up"" and ""Viral Harris-Walz camo hats riff on red-state style, draw ire of NRA."" He became the pinnacle of manliness in articles like ""Masculinity's check-engine light is on. Let Tim Walz have a look"" and ""Tim Walz as football coach: A rambunctious, rah-rah joker.""

Additionally, the sources told NBC that Biden ""was particularly stung"" by Harris' recent line during her debate with former President Trump in which she drew a stark distinction between her and her boss.

""Clearly, I am not Joe Biden. And I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country,"" the vice president said during the debate, drawing a stark contrast between her and Biden's policies, as Trump was trying to grill her over the current administration's record.

Those familiar with Biden's feelings on the matter acknowledged that he still wants Harris to win and ""that he plans to do whatever he can to help her,"" the report noted.

An anonymous senior Harris campaign official said that Biden ""always just says to her, 'The most important thing is that you win.'"" The official added, ""We have to tell people who she is and what she would do.""

They also noted, ""There wasn't a real interest in hearing about [Biden's] accomplishments when he was running. That's still the case.""

However, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates denied the claims made by these sources, telling the outlet, ""These uninformed claims are the polar opposite of the truth.""

""President Biden welcomes the strong response the American people are having to Vice President Harris' leadership and to policies that move us into the future, away from dangerous agendas from the past like MAGAnomics and abortion bans,"" Bates added.

The spokesperson doubled down on his rejection of these claims, telling Fox News Digital they are ""not"" true.

The sources have said that Biden understands the political reasoning behind shifting away from his record, though they noted it still ""frustrates him at times.""

""But while Biden is attuned to political realities, he also has expressed a range of emotions about his exit from the race -- from feeling his legacy rests on a Harris victory to anguishing over his imprint's vanishing from the national stage, according to the people familiar with his private comments,"" the article stated.

One source described his mixed emotions on the issue, stating, ""It's very complex.""

Another Harris campaign official defended Harris' pivot away from Biden, telling NBC, ""She has to become her own person. She needs to do that to win.""

Despite Biden's acceptance of Harris' candidacy, he maintains that he would have beaten Trump in November if he was still in the race. He told the co-hosts of ""The View"" last week that he was ""confident"" he could have beaten Trump and said he didn't sense an ""overwhelming reluctance"" about his re-election effort from fellow Democrats.

""I was confident I would beat Trump -- he's a loser,"" he declared.

DAVID MARCUS: The Vance vs. Walz debate is best scored using boxing rules,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-vance-vs-walz-debate-best-scored-using-boxing-rules,2024-10-01T17:53:41Z,"DEBATE DAY: Live coverage begins today at 8 p.m. ET for the Fox News Simulcast of the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate.

The first rule of deciding who won a major political debate is that nobody wins a major political debate. There is no final score as the buzzer sounds, no final wink to be tiddled, it is a purely subjective matter. And that will be true of the vice-presidential debate between Republican nominee JD Vance and Democratic nominee Tim Walz.

That having been said, I've recently adopted a method of scoring debates from the world of pugilistics, that I think actually gives a pretty decent assessment of what most American voters see.

My advice in picking a winner is to borrow the scoring system of a boxing match. The basic rules are relatively simple. In each round the boxer who wins the 3 minutes gets 10 points, the loser gets 9, unless there is a knockdown or it is overwhelming, in which case the round is scored 10-8. A tie is 10-10.

Obviously, a knockout ends the fight.

HEIGHTENED 'SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPORTANCE' AS VANCE, WALZ FACE OFF IN VP DEBATE

I first tried this approach last month with the Trump vs. Harris debate. And I wound up with Trump winning 157 to 150. It wasn't the only reason I thought and wrote that night that Trump won the debate, despite overwhelming media insistence that girl boss Kamala had kicked ass. But it was part of it.

And with polling showing no significant bump for Harris since their face-off and the fact that we've even seen some Trump swing state surge since their debate, my ostentatious declaration of a Trump victory looks a little less crazy today.

The legacy news media, who wanted any excuse to hand Harris a W anyway, viewed the tête-à-tête as a kind of Lifetime movie in which Harris had finally spoken truth to power, but I find in most of America that narrative doesn't have a whole lot of purchase. The voters want answers.

THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN OF TUESDAY'S JD VANCE-TIM WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

That's where boxing scoring comes in. If openings, closings, and each question, are the ""rounds"" of the debate, you wind up with about 15. See what I'm saying? The incremental 10-9 or 10-8 scores of each, mirror the nuance of how swayable voters watch the event.

The basic philosophy behind boxing scoring is that the primary job is to survive the round, so if you manage that, you get an automatic 8 points, winning the round, and can only bump that up by at most 2.

One could argue there is a fundamental unfairness here, that if I am 40 percent better at landing punches in a round than my opponent, I only get a 10 percent point advantage in scoring, but that is also the beauty of the system. Fights aren't just about math.

This actually tracks very well with how political debates work.

The audience, which is to say the voters, do tend to see each question or issue as one round, and if Walz can get a 10-8 on abortion, or Vance can on the border, that goes a long way towards the kind of 7 point win I gave Trump over Harris.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

Another way to think of this is that 90 percent of Americans likely already know who they are voting for, only 10 percent can be swayed, and boxing's unique scoring system almost perfectly corresponds to this.

Eighty to 90 percent we are just scoring as a wash.

There is, of course, the chance of a knockout, but these days, that chance seems remote. Back when Reagan said ""There you go again,"" or Obama, in retrospect wrongly, told Romney the 1980s wanted their foreign policy back over fears regarding Russia, the possibility of something near consensus on the question existed.

Those days are no longer with us, if they aren't over forever.

Nobody really wins a debate, but we can still score them, we can still pay close attention to who is and isn't actually answering the questions, and that has a lot of value.

So give a shot, grab a pad and paper, if you still have those, and just jot down your score for each question, 10-10, 10-9 or 10-8. Like a Ouija board your political leanings might push the pen a bit, but even so, you might be surprised by the results.

As Mike Tyson once put it, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. Let's keep a close eye on the flying rhetorical hands of Tim Walz and JD Vance."

Former NFL star Antonio Brown drew backlash on social media this week over his post about Travis Kelce, which sideswiped pop star Taylor Swift in the process.

Brown was apparently keen on the Kansas City Chiefs' win over the Los Angeles Chargers, in which Kelce led the team with seven catches for 89 yards and set the team's all-time record for receptions. The Chiefs won the game 17-10.

The former wide receiver, who walked off the field while his Tampa Bay Buccaneers were playing the New York Jets, decided to fire off a wild post on X.

""Travis Kelce needs some black p----,"" he wrote. ""Bro Washed.""

It did not appear to go over well with the NFL world.

""Guy who spends Sundays on Twitter calls guy that is one year older than him and that is still playing 'washed'? OK. That checks out.,"" one person wrote on X.

Another person called Brown a ""f---in weirdo,"" while another added, ""Yeah the CTE winning.""

Brown has a history of saying outlandish things on X for engagement.

He took a dig at Swift back in September over Brittany Mahomes' apparent support for former President Donald Trump, while the pop star endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president.

Brown also made a crude innuendo about Caitlin Clark back in May - weeks after the current WNBA star blocked him on social media.

"Trump edges Harris in North Carolina poll, state that hasn't voted Democratic since 2008",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-harris-struggle-north-carolina-hurricane-recovery-underway-poll,2024-10-01T16:18:21Z,"Swannanoa resident Zach Dasher joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the 'complete devastation' left by Hurricane Helene and how he is taking action to help his community.

North Carolina remains a dead heat in the presidential race as the November elections draw ever nearer.

The state - which is now undergoing serious recovery efforts following the devastation of Hurricane Helene - has been consistently close in its political polling.

A new poll conducted by the Washington Post finds former President Trump leading with 50% of likely North Carolina voters compared to Vice President Harris' 48%.

BIDEN TO VISIT NORTH CAROLINA DAYS AFTER HELENE'S PATH OF DESTRUCTION LEAVES MANY DEVASTATED

Trump's slim lead is within the poll's +/- 3.5% margin of error, but the former president won the state in 2020 with a similarly tight 1.3% lead. The poll contacted 1,001 registered voters randomly selected from a statewide database.

North Carolina has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since former President Obama's 2008 victory, but the Democratic National Committee sees the state's Republican majority as fragile, with a possibility to tip the other way.

Because the majority of the survey was conducted before the full impact of Helene on the state, it does not reflect any possible shifts the storm may cause in public opinion.

NORTH CAROLINA REVEALS SHOCKING DAMAGE TO TOURIST TOWN: 'ALL OF IT WAS WASHED INTO THE LAKE'

More than 120 people have been killed by Helene since the hurricane made landfall in Florida late Thursday before tearing a path of destruction through the interior Southeast.

The storm caused millions to suffer power outages and billions in property damage as it smashed through the southern Appalachian Mountains and into the Tennessee Valley.

President Biden announced Monday that he will visit North Carolina on Wednesday after Hurricane Helene ravaged the state.

The president's announcement comes after critics slammed him for a lack of leadership following the monster storm's devastating impact on the southeastern portion of the country.

GOP leader says Vance 'absolutely prepared' for VP debate showdown with Walz,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-leader-says-vance-absolutely-prepared-vp-debate-showdown-walz,2024-10-01T15:50:59Z,"NEW YORK - Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley is confident that Sen. JD Vance of Ohio is ""absolutely prepared"" for Tuesday night's vice presidential debate showdown.

Vance, former President Trump's running mate on the GOP 2024 ticket, will face off in New York City with Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota in the one and only debate between the two running mates.

""You look at everything he's done since he was named as the candidate. He's been preparing, he's been talking with the press, he's been out there, he's been moving around and talking to the American voters. So, he's very ready to have this conversation,"" Whatley emphasized in a Fox News Digital interview hours ahead of the debate.

A source familiar with Vance's debate prep told Fox News Digital that over the last month, the senator took part in a series of murder board sessions with his team, where a group of people ask tough questions and have candid discussions to help someone prepare for a difficult examination or test, or in Vance's case, a vice presidential debate.

THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN OF TUESDAY'S JD VANCE-TIM WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

According to the source, Vance conducted a mock debate over the past week, with Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the House majority whip, playing the role of Walz. Former Trump administration Treasury Department assistant secretary Monica Crowley played the role of one of the moderators from CBS News, which is hosting the debate in New York City.

Halfway through the mock debate, the power went out, as a strong storm slammed through the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio, where Vance lives and where the prep session was held. But according to the source, who shared the details first with Fox News, Vance and the team continued on, using lanterns for lighting and cellphones for timers.

Heading into the 2024 vice presidential debate, the 40-year-old Vance has been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Walz, who is 60, has been much more reluctant to speak with the national news media.

The governor was in debate camp ahead of the showdown to prepare. Walz huddled with advisers and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - who played the role of Vance in mock debates - in Harbor Springs, Michigan, near the northern tip of the state's lower peninsula.

Also helping out - Walz's wife - Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz.

Asked on the eve of the showdown with Vance how his wife had been helping him with debate preparation, Walz told reporters, ""She wins every one.""

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2024 ELECTION POWER RANKINGS SHOW

With a second face-to-face showdown between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump unlikely - and with a margin-of-error White House race with five weeks until Election Day in November - there will be heightened stakes at the running mate debate, which is traditionally seen as a second-tier event in the presidential campaign.

""Given that we're only likely to have one head-to-head match-up between the principal candidates and this is the last meet-up between the two tickets directly before the election, it heightens the importance and significance of this debate,"" longtime Republican strategist and communicator Ryan Williams, a veteran of multiple presidential campaigns, told Fox News.

Most political pundits said Harris bested Trump last month in their first and likely only debate. And flash polls of debate watchers agreed.

So a strong showing by Vance in Tuesday's vice presidential debate could give Trump a boost.

And there's a precedent from 12 years ago.

After a shaky first debate by then-President Barack Obama against 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, then-Vice President Joe Biden's well-regarded performance in the running mate debate against Romney running mate Rep. Paul Ryan gave the Democrats' ticket a big boost.

Whatley, the former RNC general counsel and former North Carolina GOP chair who's a close ally of Trump, told Fox Digital that Vance's debate mission is to ""deliver the message"" to voters across the country.

Whatley argued that ""if you look at the Democrats, they don't just have messenger problems, they have message problems. The polices that they're pushing right now are not popular with the American people.... I think on every single one of these issues, the Republican ticket is the ticket of strength, the ticket of common sense, and I feel really great about where we're going into tonight.""

The RNC chair also said that when it comes to Vance's game plan for the debate, ""I think he's going to talk about the issues that the voters care about and those are the issues like inflation, like the southern border, like prices at the grocery store and at the gas pump. That's really what people care about. That's what we're going to talk about.""

Part of the Harris campaign's strategy ahead of the debate is to raise expectations for Walz.

For weeks, they've painted Walz as a regular guy who will be facing off with the Ivy League-trained Vance. What they don't mention is that Walz won six House races and two gubernatorial elections.

The Trump campaign's playing the same game.

""Walz is very good in debates. I want to repeat that. Tim Walz is very good in debates. Really good. He's been a politician for nearly 20 years. He'll be very well-prepared for tomorrow night,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters on Monday.

But Trump seemed to undercut this campaign's argument, charging in an interview with Kellyanne Conway's Fox Nation program ""Here's the Deal with Kellyanne"" that Vance is ""going up against a moron. A total moron, how she picked him is unbelievable.""

Walz comes into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating.

Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable."

Some Biden 2020 voters say they don't know enough about Kamala Harris,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/some-biden-2020-voters-say-dont-know-enough-kamala-harris,2024-10-01T14:33:38Z,"Fox News contributor Mary Katharine Ham and Democratic strategist Tim Hogan analyze Vice President Kamala Harris' 'easy' interview with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle.

Some Biden 2020 voters still want to know more about Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the election, telling the New York Times that they don't know enough about the Democratic nominee's policies.

""I need to hear more from Kamala Harris in terms of what she wants to do. I hear a lot from Trump, and I agree with some of his policies, but I don't like his character. And I think I need to hear a little bit more from her for her to win my vote,"" Prince, a Democratic North Carolina voter, told the Times.

The New York Times spoke to 15 voters that voted for President Biden in 2020 in a Times Opinion focus group. While some said they still wanted more from Harris, by the end of the discussion, only three voters remained truly undecided between Harris and former President Trump.

""I don't know that there's much that Trump could say, because we already know what he's like. I think for Harris, if she came out with a more specific outline of some of her policies and if I heard some policies that aren't too good to be true, like the $25,000 home-buyer tax credit,"" a North Carolina Republican voter said.

The third person who was undecided, a 35-year-old Independent voter from Georgia, said he wanted to know more about Harris' plan for immigration and her economic policies.

The voter also said that he would be more invested in the vice presidential debate and hopes Gov. Tim Walz will be able to talk about Harris' policies in more detail.

An Independent voter from Nevada said while she leaned more towards Harris, she pulled back a bit because she didn't ""know enough about her.""

However, at the end of the discussion, the voter did not say she remained undecided.

The New York Times' moderator of the discussion, Magie Omero, asked the group what they liked best and least about the vice president and the former president.

One Michigan voter said what he liked best about Harris was that she was not Trump. Another said Harris is smart and ""relatable."" Others likened Trump to a dictator, and many suggested he was ""self-centered.""

""I don't feel like she's had time to set herself apart from what Biden's been doing for the last four years. For the most part, she's run with a similar plan. I don't know that that's the best plan,"" one of the Republican voters from North Carolina said, responding to the question about what they like least about Harris.

Another Republican voter agreed and added, ""She gives the impression of a fresh perspective, but I don't think we've had enough time to actually get details as to what that perspective is.""

A Democratic Pennsylvania voter agreed with both Republicans and said they didn't know enough about Harris' agenda.

Fox News Power Rankings: Trump maintains lead on 2 top issues ahead of VP debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/power-rankings-trump-maintains-lead-two-top-issues-ahead-vp-debate,2024-10-01T13:08:36Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance are hours away from the first and only vice presidential debate.

As the latest Fox News Power Rankings reveal, Vance starts the evening with a lead on the economy and immigration, while Walz has an advantage on abortion.

Vice presidential hopefuls do not attract as much attention as their bosses when they debate, but as Fox News' Arnon Mishkin argued Monday, they have changed the direction of at least six elections in the last 50 years.

In most cases, these debates are won on policy. Voters are not as familiar with these nominees as they are with former President Donald Trump or even Vice President Kamala Harris, and they do not need to make their choice.

The smart play for these vice presidential candidates is to focus on the major issues at stake and how their administrations would solve them.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS TICKS UP AND SENATE REPUBLICANS TAKE CHARGE

That is especially true for Walz on the economy and immigration, since the Harris campaign continues to lag on those issues. Vance, meanwhile, has struggled with poor favorability ratings, so his challenge is to hammer the popular parts of the Trump agenda and avoid wading into the culture war trenches.

There are also style points up for grabs. Many voters will only ever see this debate in short clips on social media, so acting like a policy wonk is less likely than ever to get the job done.

Trump continues to hold an advantage on two of the top three issues in this campaign. He leads on the economy by nine points and immigration by 11.

Those numbers have barely budged since Harris and Trump debated. In August, when the Power Rankings last looked at the major issues, the former president led on the economy by eight and immigration by 13.

Harris is far out in front on abortion. She leads by 17 points on that issue, also a negligible movement since the last tracker (Harris +18).

This tracker includes polls from Fox News, Quinnipiac, CNN/SSRS, NBC News and the New York Times/Siena.

Trump lost a point in the horse race after his debate with Harris while the vice president gained one; these modest shifts mirrored those after the first debate in 2020.

Together, these results suggest that the cause of Trump's slight decline was style rather than substance.

Conversely, while Harris won the debate and held on to her advantage on abortion, she has not consistently closed the issues gap, particularly on immigration.

That is not ideal for her, given the economy (38%) and immigration (17%) are two of the top three issues for voters. A recent Fox News national survey showed those issues and abortion (16%) were the only three that a double-digit percentage of voters called their ""most important"" issue in deciding their vote.

According to the same survey, Harris has strong leads in issues outside the top three. That includes health care, helping the middle class and climate change. These are ""bread and butter"" issues that the left has relied on to drag out base voters in previous elections.

The Democratic candidate also has a lead in uniting the country and, as consistent with previous trackers, having the right temperament for the job.

The candidates are evenly divided on national security. Neither has an advantage in handling a crisis that puts the country at risk, being commander in chief or decisions about using nuclear weapons. Trump's temperament deficit should give Harris an opportunity to lead on some of these qualities, but that has not materialized.

ARNON MISHKIN: JD VANCE IS AN EXCELLENT DEBATER AND PRACTICES FOR THE DEBATE EVERY SUNDAY

Finally, voters prefer Trump on foreign policy. He has a six-point lead in handling the Israel/Hamas war and an eight-point lead on the Ukraine/Russia war.

Tuesday is debate night. Walz and Vance will face off at an event hosted by CBS News in New York City. Fox News will simulcast the debate with special coverage anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum at 8:20 p.m. ET.

Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate to be moderated by MacCallum and Baier in October.

Walz's debate performance expectations lowered ahead of showdown with Vance: 'Still largely untested',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/walzs-debate-performance-expectations-lowered-ahead-showdown-vance-still-largely-untested,2024-10-01T12:55:37Z,"A 'Fox News Live' political panel provided its expectations ahead of the vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz, as well as its views on the border issue.

Some Democratic allies of Gov. Tim Walz are concerned about how he will fare in the vice presidential debate between him and Sen. JD Vance, worrying that the Minnesota governor remains untested.

""We've never seen him on the national scale before,"" a Minnesota Democrat told Politico. The outlet reported that Vance hasn't been tested in a scenario like a debate, where he will face direct questioning and attacks from the other side.

Walz and Vance are set to clash on Tuesday during the first vice presidential debate, which will be moderated by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan.

""He can be very: 'That's it I'm done,'"" a Minnesota state lawmaker told the outlet. Politico reported that Walz shuts down conversations and gets defensive when he's asked to discuss ""missteps"" in private, and it noted Walz was ""still largely untested and has never faced the intense, direct questioning that Vance is sure to launch.""

HARRIS 2024 SENIOR CAMPAIGN ADVISER PREVIEWS UPCOMING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'TWO VERY DIFFERENT VISIONS'

""She did so strong. She's actually made it very difficult for Walz, because I don't see any way that he could match her level of intensity and humor,"" another ally of the Minnesota governor said, noting Vice President Kamala Harris' debate performance against former President Trump that received high media praise.

Harris' inner circle reportedly discussed Walz's habit of being ""gruff and brass,"" Politico reported, while they were vetting him.

According to the outlet, a Minnesota lawmaker recalled Walz saying ""'Alright, I've done all the answering I'm going to do. Meeting's over,'"" when he was asked about questions he didn't want to talk about.

A Democratic lawmaker described a call with Walz in 2020 amid the George Floyd riots, during which Walz reportedly ""signaled he was done with the conversation,"" after he was pressed on why he didn't call the National Guard in sooner.

""I don't think he hung up, but definitely that was it. The call was over,"" the Democratic lawmaker said.

""At times, he could be the exact opposite of what he usually is. That was one of them,"" the person told Politico.

Politico also reported that Walz struggled to explain Harris' economic agenda and kept repeating the words ""opportunity economy."" The report said it came off as vague to those in attendance.

MSNBC's Claire McCaskill, a former Democratic senator, said during an interview on Monday that expectations for the VP debates should be ""lowered.""

""I'm just a little worried about the expectations game at this point. I think people -- yes, J.D. Vance has said some really, I think, disqualifying things about women and how he views people and their role in life. But he will be articulate and he will be prepared and he will be better than Trump was,"" she said.

McCaskill said it would be a ""challenge"" for Walz to be able to counter Vance and ""stay really likable and relatable.""

""I just think we need to lower expectations a little bit, because then we can all be pleasantly surprised if I'm wrong and that Tim Walz just mops the floor with him the same way Kamala Harris mopped the floor with Donald Trump,"" McCaskill added.

"Mast demands VA fire staffers over Vance, Walz medical record breach, FBI probe possible foreign interference",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mast-demands-va-fire-staffers-over-vance-walz-medical-record-breach-fbi-probe-possible-foreign-interference,2024-10-01T12:24:29Z,"FIRST ON FOX - Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., is demanding that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) immediately fire the at least a dozen employees who reportedly improperly accessed the medical records of vice presidential candidates Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz this summer.

Mast, chairman of Veterans For Trump, penned a letter urging VA Secretary Denis McDonough for a ""swift response and action to prevent such egregious violations of privacy within the VA from occurring again."" The Florida Republican is also calling for the FBI to get involved to investigate the possibility of foreign election interference.

""I urge you to buck the employee union of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and immediately fire the employees who were caught snooping into the private medical records of Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz - who are both running to be vice president. VA employees know this is not permitted,"" Mast wrote in a letter first obtained by Fox News Digital. ""As a combat-injured veteran, I rely on the VA for my medical care. This isn't just a legal misstep; it's a breach that undermines veterans' confidence in the VA and raises serious questions about the professionalism of VA personnel.""

The Washington Post first reported Monday that at least 12 VA employees within the agency's health administration were under criminal investigation after VA investigators discovered they improperly accessed the medical records of Vance and Walz. VA Inspector General Michael Missal's office reportedly informed both candidates' campaigns and shared evidence with federal prosecutors related to several of the health system employees, including a physician and a contractor who ""spent extended time"" viewing the files of former President Trump and Vice President Harris' running mates.

VA EMPLOYEES IMPROPERLY ACCESSED JD VANCE, TIM WALZ'S MEDICAL RECORDS, PROMPTING CRIMINAL PROBE: REPORT

""Dismissing these employees and referring them to the Justice Department for prosecution, provided there is evidence that laws were broken, is the first step the VA must take to restore credibility,"" Mast wrote. ""Furthermore, I urge you to fully brief Congress on how this violation of privacy transpired and implement new guidelines to prevent such acts from occurring in the future.""

Mast, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, implored McDonough to coordinate with the FBI.

The letter comes a week after Trump's campaign said he was briefed on ""real and specific threats"" from Iran to assassinate the Republican presidential nominee.

""Given the recent foreign meddling in our elections - like Iran's assassination plots against President Trump - I also request your department coordinate with the FBI to ensure Senator Vance and Governor Walz's medical information was neither shared with foreign operatives nor accessed on their behalf,"" Mast, who served in the U.S. Army for 12 years and lost both legs to catastrophic injuries endured while working as a bomb disposal expert in Afghanistan, wrote. ""Safeguarding sensitive information about our public officials is critical to national security and the integrity of our democracy.""

TRUMP REACTS TO ASSASSINATION PLOTS WITH BIG WARNING TO IRAN

Last month, experts from the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a summary of the current threat environment citing how the ""big three foreign influence actors, Russia, Iran, and China are all trying by some measure to exacerbate divisions in U.S. society for their own benefit, and see election periods as moments of vulnerability.""

""Like Russia, Iran has a multi-pronged approach that looks to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process. Tehran has also sought cyber access to individuals with direct ties to the presidential campaigns of both political parties, while elements have also denigrated the former president,"" they said. ""Iran has a suite of tools at its disposal, as demonstrated in recent reports outlining Iran's cyber operations, including the hack-and-leak operation against the former president's campaign. Iran is also conducting covert social media operations using fake personas, and is using AI to help publish inauthentic news articles.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the VA and the FBI regarding Mast's letter.

Regarding the Post's reporting on Monday, VA Press Secretary Terrence Hayes said in a statement that the agency ""reported to law enforcement allegations that VA personnel may have improperly accessed Veteran records"" and takes ""the privacy of the Veterans we serve very seriously and have strict policies in place to protect their records.""

""Any attempt to improperly access Veteran records by VA personnel is unacceptable and will not be tolerated,"" Hayes wrote.

The potential motive for accessing the medical records is under investigation, and investigators are still trying to determine if Vance and Walz's information was shared as a result of the breaches, the Post reported.

The VA employees under investigation, including the physician and contractor, accessed the medical records using their VA computers and did so mostly from their government offices, sources told the newspaper. Some of the staffers in question reportedly told investigators they were simply curious to see the files of Vance and Walz given both candidates have defended their military records on the campaign trail.

The Department of Justice declined to comment about the report. The breach reportedly did not include access to any disability compensation, which has more security protocols than health information."

Montana GOP Senate candidate Sheehy says he was in Afghanistan while Jon Tester was 'eating lobbyist steak',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/montana-gop-senate-candidate-sheehy-says-he-afghanistan-while-jon-tester-eating-lobbyist-steak,2024-10-01T09:53:21Z,"Montana Senate candidate Tim Sheehy joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the importance of the race and what issues matter most to voters as he fights to oust Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.

Montana U.S. Senate candidate Tim Sheehy, a Republican, ripped his opponent, incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester, for his ties to lobbyists during a debate on Monday.

Tester is seeking to hold onto his Senate seat to continue representing the red state of Montana in a race that could determine which party controls the upper chamber of Congress, and recent polling shows that Sheehy is leading just weeks before Election Day.

During the debate on Monday, Sheehy knocked his Democrat opponent for his relationship with lobbyists in Washington, D.C.

""Sen. Tester knows all about backroom meetings, he's been taking them for 20 years ... While I was fighting in Afghanistan, he was eating lobbyist steak in D.C.,"" said Sheehy, a former U.S. Navy SEAL.

'WHOEVER GETS ELECTED': VULNERABLE DEM TESTER DIGS IN HEELS ON NOT ENDORSING HARRIS

Lobbyists have donated more heavily to Tester during this election cycle than to any other member of Congress, according to the non-partisan group OpenSecrets.

Tester is the last remaining Democrat to hold high office in Montana, where Republicans, including former President Trump, supported Sheehy's campaign with the hope that he could defeat the vulnerable Democrat and help the GOP win back control of the Senate.

Republicans need to gain only two seats in next month's election to win the Senate majority. GOP West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice is considered a lock in his state's Senate race against Democrat Glenn Elliott, meaning the Senate majority could run through Montana.

Trump won Montana by about 17 percentage points in 2020 and, given that the state is overwhelmingly Republican, Sheehy has often sought to tie Tester to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as the Republican candidate looks to take advantage of public dissatisfaction over the administration's struggles to address the influx of illegal immigration at the Southern Border.

JON TESTER CASTS DOUBT ON UNFAVORABLE POLL IN MONTANA SENATE RACE: 'GIVE ME A BREAK'

""Democrats on the Hill refused to hold the administration accountable for the largest mass migration in the history of this country,"" Sheehy said.

Tester, however, has declined to endorse Harris and has attempted to distance himself from her on the campaign trail, and he skipped the Democratic National Convention in August, when she was named the party's nominee for president after Biden dropped out.

The Democrat has also criticized some of the administration's policy decisions. This includes his opposition to the move for tighter pollution rules for coal plants and his calls for more to be done on immigration.

""Look, I'll be the first person to tell you that President Biden has not done a good job on the southern border,"" Tester said Monday.

Sheehy and Tester also addressed abortion, in which the Democrat said he wants to reinstate Roe v. Wade after the landmark ruling was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court two years ago, returning the power to make laws regarding abortion back to the states.

The Republican acknowledged that remarks he made last year about Native Americans were ""insensitive,"" but refused his opponent's request to apologize. Sheehy had told a group of laughing supporters about bonding ""with all the Indians ... while they're drunk at 8 a.m.,"" while working cattle at a ranch on the Crow Indian Reservation.

""Yeah, insensitive,"" Sheehy said. ""I come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color jokes sometimes.""

Tester pressed his opponent, ""Tim, the statement you made degrades Native Americans across this country. You're a big guy, just apologize.""

""Will you apologize for opening the border?"" Sheehy shot back."
NBC's 'SNL' roasted for mocking assassination attempts against Trump: 'Activism masquerading as comedy',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nbcs-snl-roasted-for-mocking-assassination-attempts-against-trump-activism-masquerading-as-comedy,2024-10-01T09:23:40Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" has been blasted as ""completely inappropriate"" for making light of assassination attempts against former President Trump in its latest episode.

""SNL"" has managed to take a break from comedy for somber moments in the past, such as when Kate McKinnon performed a version of ""Hallelujah"" while impersonating Hillary Clinton following Trump's shock 2016 election victory. But while the Democratic nominee losing to Trump in 2016 was worthy of a melancholy cold open, recent assassination attempts on Trump were not.

The long-running program began its 50th season on Saturday evening with a variety of special guests mocking current political affairs, such as Maya Rudolph as Vice President Kamala Harris, Andy Samberg as her husband Doug Emhoff, Jim Gaffigan as Gov. Tim Walz and Dana Carvey as President Biden.

James Austin Johnson played Trump and lampooned the first assassination attempt - which killed one of Trump's supporters - that occurred July 13 in Butler, Pa., as he depicted the former president at one of his rallies.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUSHES BACK ON 'SNL' SKIT ABOUT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS: 'DISGUSTING'

""Where the hell is everyone going? Where are you going? I see you trying to leave, but the doors are locked. Come on back -- we're having fun. We love my rallies, except when someone does the 'bing, bong, bing, bing, bing' right at me,"" Johnson as Trump said, referring to the sounds of bullets. ""You know that happened because of the rhetoric of the radical left. They say that me blaming the Democrats for inciting violence is the pot calling the kettle black.""

Former NBCUniversal senior executive Mike Sington, who now bills himself as a pop culture expert and Hollywood insider, couldn't believe ""SNL"" went there.

""I was watching it live, and actually cringed when they mocked the assassination attempts in an effort to be funny. I'm no fan of Trump's, but I thought it was in extremely poor taste,"" Sington told Fox News Digital.

Fox News host Jimmy Failla wasn't surprised because ""SNL"" has pivoted from comedy to ""activism masquerading as comedy"" in recent years. The show openly celebrated Trump losing in 2020, and its cast members

""'SNL' has basically devolved into a group therapy session for liberals who are wildly out of touch with the zeitgeist,"" Failla told Fox News Digital.

Failla said the infamous ""Hallelujah"" rendition following Clinton's 2016 loss proved how self-absorbed the show is, specifically when considering that Trump was a longtime NBC personality prior to entering politics.

""They go after things that work well in a liberal bubble, but look stupid to the rest of us, because it looks like activism masquerading as comedy,"" Failla said.

""The things they made fun of with Biden are the harmless things, whereas the things they make fun of with Trump always have the undercoating that's looking to steer the conversation towards how their viewers are going to vote,"" he continued. ""It's beneath the show that really forged an identity by dabbling in politics, but in an accessible way, which is what we try to do on my show.""

Failla, who hosts ""FOX News Saturday Night,"" believes anything can be mocked if it's done tastefully.

MSNBC GUEST CLAIMS LATINOS 'WANT TO BE WHITE' WHILE DISCUSSING THEIR SHIFT TOWARD GOP

""If you're making fun of a situation where he was shot and someone else was killed, then it better be funny. Like the juice better be worth the squeeze, which it clearly wasn't in this case,"" Failla said. ""And they didn't make any effort to hide their political bias in how they covered this.""

Failla said a lot of people turn to comedy as a distraction, but ""SNL"" doesn't offer the escape that it used to.

""They're keeping the focus on division. And I cover politics every week. So, I'm not saying they shouldn't. I'm just saying they're covering it in a way that's clearly catering so wholeheartedly to one side of the aisle that sometimes you see the malice in what they're doing,"" Failla said.

""You can mock anything in the name of comedy. But if you're mocking it in the name of a political ideology, you're no longer doing comedy,"" he added. ""You're doing activism masquerading as comedy. And that's what that came off as. It came off as just tasteless activism.""

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Political satirist Tim Young believes the NBC program ""jumped the shark politically"" years ago, particularly when they treated Trump's 2016 victory ""as if it were a funeral"" with McKinnon playing the piano on a dark stage.

""From that point forward, it's been full-on leftist propaganda. Their mocking of Trump's assassination attempts was completely inappropriate,"" Young told Fox News Digital.

Young believes poking fun at the assassination attempts ""feeds leftist conspiracies that it never happened"" and also ""downplays the seriousness of the threats on Trump's life.""

""Which I believe encourages more lunatics and foreign adversaries to try,"" Young said.

TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT WROTE CHILLING LETTER MONTHS BEFORE GOLF COURSE PLOT

The Trump campaign posted to social media, ""There were two assassination attempts against President Trump within a span of seven weeks. @nbcsnl apparently finds that funny. Disgusting.""

""SNL"" also referenced the assassination attempts during the ""Weekend Update"" segment, during which Colin Jost quipped that he was ""starting to worry that bullet got a little more than just the ear,"" after playing a clip of Trump saying he had a better ""body"" than President Biden at a recent rally.

Conservative radio host Jason Rantz said he is ""all for comedy having no rules about what it targets"" for humor as long as everything is balanced and amusing.

""Bad taste? Sure, but that's their choice to make. My issue is how disgustingly one-sided the humor has become,"" Rantz told Fox News Digital.

""It's not just Trump they loathe -- it's everyone who supports him,"" he continued. ""At the very least, you'd hope they'd be funny while being so obnoxiously partisan. But no, they're not funny. They haven't been funny in decades.""

CNN'S DANA BASH ADMITS SHE PREPPED 'MUCH MORE' FOR HOW TRUMP WOULD ACT DURING FIRST DEBATE THAN FOR BIDEN

When Trump narrowly survived the assassination attempt against him in July, a bullet grazed the president's ear and the shooter killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore -- a husband, father and former fire chief at the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Department. The gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, also critically wounded two other rally-goers. Weeks later, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was arrested on Sept. 15 after allegedly pushing the muzzle of an AK-47 through the chainlink fence outside where Trump was golfing in Florida.

While Young is appalled the program would make light of the assassination attempts, he also noticed something ""significant"" during the same sketch.

""They mocked all of Biden's confusion, smelling hair, etc. for one of the first real times since he's been in office,"" Young said.

""'SNL' defended Biden by not being hard on him before,"" Young added. ""Now that Kamala has been installed as the Democrat nominee, they finally treat him like they have other candidates pre-Trump.""

Harris 2024 campaign senior adviser previews upcoming vice presidential debate: 'Two very different visions',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-2024-campaign-senior-adviser-previews-upcoming-vice-presidential-debate-two-very-different-visions,2024-10-01T09:23:36Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A senior adviser to the 2024 Harris campaign said Tim Walz is ""looking forward"" to debating JD Vance Tuesday at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate in New York City in what could be the first and last meeting between the two before the November election.

Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum asked Ian Sams, the former White House spokesperson for oversight and investigations, Monday on ""The Story"" about a CNN report that says Harris' running mate is nervous heading into the debate.

CNN spoke with aides close to Walz and top campaign staffers who said the Minnesota governor is worried about letting Harris down and reportedly said in his running mate interview that he was a bad debater.

""I think voters are going to get a chance to see two running mates who are advocating for two very different visions for the country,"" said Sams.

""Just today, for example, we have a new report out from the campaign on famously, Donald Trump in the first debate, saying he has a 'concept of a plan' on health care. Well, right after that, JD Vance, his running mate, came out and explained what that plan meant by pushing - that we're going to reopen what are called high-risk pools. That's for people with preexisting conditions.""

5 STEPS TOWARD A FRESH APPROACH TO HEALTH CARE REFORM

MacCallum interrupted the senior adviser, returning to her question about Walz's reported nerves and how he's feeling ahead of the debate.

""He's looking forward to the debate,"" Sams said of Walz. ""I think he's looking forward to debating JD Vance, who, again, is continuing to advocate for returning to high-risk pools that'll put people with preexisting conditions back into these high-risk pools that cost them more money and could kick them off of their insurance.""

Vance gave an interview in mid-September to NBC's ""Meet the Press"" in which he attempted to put more meat on the bones of former President Trump's ""concepts"" of a health care plan that would be an alternative to the Affordable Care Act.

""You want to make sure that preexisting coverage - conditions - are covered, you want to make sure that people have access to the doctors that they need, and you also want to implement some deregulatory agenda so that people can choose a health care plan that fits them,"" said Vance.

VA EMPLOYEES IMPROPERLY ACCESSED JD VANCE, TIM WALZ'S MEDICAL RECORDS, PROMPTING CRIMINAL PROBE: REPORT

""We want to make sure everybody is covered. But the best way to do that is to actually promote some more choice in our health care system and not have a one-size-fits-all approach that puts a lot of people into the same insurance pools, into the same risk pools, that actually makes it harder for people to make the right choices for their families.""

The Harris-Walz campaign released a 43-page report attacking their Republican opponents' health care plan and highlighted four key concepts it says the Trump-Vance campaign wants to end.

Sams said he ultimately believes the November election will be ""really close,"" and voters will be the ones who have the final say in which issues are most important for them as they head to the ballot box.

""I think when we look [at] the fact that we have only 36 or so days left until the election, you know, the candidates are going to have to be out there earning people's support. And this is a 50-50 race,"" he told MacCallum.

Kamala Harris makes a desperate move on a critical issue to save a sinking campaign,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-harris-makes-desperate-move-critical-issue-save-sinking-campaign,2024-10-01T09:09:12Z,"The Democrat nominee's campaign is fizzling like a week-old party balloon; desperate to regain momentum, she is trying to defuse one of her most vulnerable positions -- immigration. The latest Quinnipiac poll of 1,728 likely voters shows Harris dead even with Trump; in August the same poll showed her leading by two points. Nate Silver reports that Harris' chances of winning are dropping and the Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Harris' lead declining slightly. That small slippage comes despite massive spending by Democrats, and especially in swing states, where Trump on average leads Harris by the slimmest of margins.

The Harris team sees their ""joy"" campaign losing steam and has decided with great trepidation that the candidate must be more accountable on issues important to voters. Immigration is one of those top concerns on which she is currently being clobbered by Trump. According to CNN, 49% of voters trust the former president on immigration compared to 35% trusting Harris. The open border may prove key to winning toss-up states like Arizona and also to winning over Black men, especially those who are concerned about the impact of lawless immigration on the jobs market.

VP HARRIS OUTLINES 'ORDERLY AND SECURE' IMMIGRATION PLAN, RIPS TRUMP IN FIRST BORDER STOP SINCE NOMINATION

That's the only possible explanation for why she would humiliate herself by visiting our southern border -- the original Biden-Harris crime scene. From the earliest days of this administration, critics were aghast at the sudden spike in the number of people coming across the border illegally. The surge was not surprising; after all, Biden took 89 executive actions in his first 100 days in office to undo the safeguards erected by Donald Trump and open the floodgates. But many were shocked at the White House's indifference to what was called a ""crisis"" even as it built to horrifying and politically damaging levels.

It takes unimaginable chutzpah, 30 days out from the election, to try to convince voters that Harris has been concerned about the border all along, and that Donald Trump is actually to blame for the flood of illegal entrants in the past three years. To that end, Harris engaged in a meaningless photo op showing the vice president striding resolutely next to a wall that she had previously described as a ""gross misuse of taxpayer money"" and vowed to ""block any funding for"" during Trump's presidency.

Harris seemed to believe that taking 20 minutes - 20 minutes!!! - out of her frantic campaigning would change how millions of Americans viewed her failure to secure our border. She was hoping to be excused for allowing more than ten million people to illegally enter our country, and forgiven by the families of those killed by migrants or by fentanyl.

She took this politically risky leap on the heels of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reporting that 425,431 convicted criminals, including 62,231 convicted of assault, 2,521 kidnappers, 14,301 convicted of burglary, and 13,099 convicted of murder - all of whom crossed our border illegally -- are at large in our country.

Are these the folks that pro-immigration groups, led by United We Dream and Amnesty International USA recently claimed in a letter to Joe Biden, ""make our country better by every measure""? This is an outrage and confirms the system is broken - thanks to Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Alejandro Mayorkas, who should have been impeached or made to resign for failure to do his job.

Most pathetic, Harris continues to hope that those who blame her for ignoring her duty will decide that it was all Donald Trump's fault. If only he hadn't sabotaged the bipartisan senate bill designed to secure our border, she seems to say, Laken Riley, Rachel Morin and Jocelyn Nengaray would still be alive, as would the hundreds of thousands who have died from fentanyl overdoses.

She lies. The bill that she touts as having had bipartisan backing was ripped by most Republicans because it gave the White House too much discretion in enforcing our asylum laws and left open loopholes flagrantly abused by cartels. It is also true that a number of Democrats voted against the bill, including members of the Progressive Caucus. Finally, the bill showed up just this year after millions of migrants had already trampled our border. As the Border Patrol Union posted on X: ""Vice president Harris has ignored the border problem she created for over three years. She goes down there for 20 minutes for a photo op... where has she been the last 3 1/2 years?""

Recall that Joe Biden actually introduced an immigration ""reform"" bill the day he took office. Originally called the U.S. Citizenship Act, the bill was a sop to progressives and was not about securing the border. Instead, it was, as the name suggested, all about providing a pathway to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. That - and not protecting our border - has been the priority for the Biden-Harris White House. The legislation was such a non-starter that Democrats in charge of Congress never took it up.

A senior official of the National Border Patrol Council, said in a statement to Fox News that Harris's last-minute border visit was ""a slap in the face to the American public."""
Pennsylvania absentee voting underway in some counties,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-absentee-voting-underway-some-counties,2024-10-01T09:09:09Z,"Pennsylvania residents spoke with Fox News Digital about their thoughts on 2024's intense political rhetoric and what issues are driving their vote.

Pennsylvania's 19 Electoral College votes are up for grabs in the 2024 presidential election with absentee voting in the Keystone State underway for some voters there.

Pennsylvania was one of three Rust Belt states that flipped from the Democrats to former President Trump and Republicans in 2016, then back to President Biden four years later. In each case, the margin was thin with less than 100,000 votes separating the main candidates.

The state has also been critical to each president's pathway to victory. It has the largest population and the most Electoral College votes of the seven most competitive states in the Fox News Power Rankings.

A recent Fox News survey has the race tied, with Democrat nominee Vice President Harris and Trump each receiving support from 49% of likely voters.

The bulk of the Democrat vote comes from the ""bookends"" of the state, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where Harris will likely perform well among Black and suburban voters.

Trump makes up for that with White rural and non-college-educated voters who live in the middle of the state. The former president has brought these voters out to the ballot box twice, and a Pennsylvania-heavy rally schedule shows he is looking to do that again.

Pennsylvania is ranked ""Toss-Up"" in the Fox News Power Rankings.

The Keystone State also has a U.S. Senate race on the ballot. Democrat Sen. Bob Casey has won three elections before, but securing a fourth will be more difficult with White working-class voters drifting away from his party. Republicans are hoping businessman Dave McCormick will connect with them. That race is ranked ""Leans Dem.""

Pennsylvania is also home to a handful of competitive U.S. House races led by:

'Economy way better under Trump': Black voters share if they were better off 4 years ago,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/economy-way-better-under-trump-black-voters-share-were-better-off-4-years-ago,2024-10-01T09:09:05Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Black voters across several states spoke with Fox News Digital about whether they were far better off 4 years ago under former President Trump. Voters from Atlanta, Chicago, and Detroit shared if their financial situations had improved or gotten worse since the Biden-Harris administration took over.

One Black man from Chicago said that he has been ""shaking"" under the current economy.

""[The economy has gotten] really moreso worse. A lot of stuff hasn't really been getting better,"" Emmanuel told Fox News Digital. ""Everything went up.""

""Inflation has been terrible. And the person that was in the office there, he wasn't really doing too much for us,"" Atlanta resident Marcellus said.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

""When Trump was in office, it was gas prices that were lower,"" he added.

However, several voters said because Harris has not served as president, led them to believe she still has a chance to prove herself.

""Kamala, from my understanding, has never really been in office as the president like that ... she has been vice president,"" said Porter, a student at Harold Washington College in Chicago.

Porter, who lived in the Windy City his entire life, said ""I would say that I would have no answer for that. But I believe that when Kamala is elected towards office, her policies and what she believes in will better fit my needs as a person.""

Anneliese, another Chicago resident, said that she ""was absolutely not better under the Trump presidency.""

""Well, I wasn't under Kamala's leadership as president. I was under her vice presidency, so she was never president. Some people also get that messed up,"" she said. ""Ever since Trump started running, I experienced a lot more ... racial discrimination, gender discrimination. And I can't speak to the Kamala presidency because she hasn't been president yet.""

In Atlanta, Tim, raised the fact that Harris has never served as president.

""That's a question that we don't know yet. Right? Kamala not even in office yet, so we can't speak on it,"" Tim said. ""We just want to speak from what we can see, we have experience living under. So I guess you won't have to just wait for Kamala and see what Trump did.""

Over in Michigan, Black voters weighed in on whether they were better off under either candidate, with one of them saying that Harris ""did not do anything.""

Ithmamqureshi told Fox News Digital that he was better off under Trump.""Obviously, life was better and all that,"" Ithmamqureshi, a student in Detroit and Hamtramck native, told Fox News Digital. ""The economy was better ... life was better. COVID did take a hit and change everything to the fullest. But I would say life was better before 2020.""

""I want be biased, but I want to say I think its time for history to be made. I just think that its going to be a woman president,"" Detroit resident Mandela said.

"Heightened 'significance and importance' as Vance, Walz face-off in VP debate",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/heightened-significance-importance-vance-walz-face-off-vp-debate,2024-10-01T08:09:41Z,"NEW YORK - With a second face-to-face showdown between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump unlikely - and with a margin-of-error race with five weeks until Election Day in November - there's a lot on the line in the vice presidential debate.

While debates between the running mates are the undercard of a White House race and have rarely moved the need much in the past, when Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrats' nominee, face-off on Tuesday, there will be heightened stakes.

Any major knockout blow - or agonizing misstep - could turn what's traditionally seen as a second-tier event into an impactful showdown.

""Given that we're only likely to have one head-to-head matchup between the principal candidates and this is the last meet up between the two tickets directly before the election, it heightens the importance and significance of this debate,"" longtime Republican strategist and communicator Ryan Williams, a veteran of multiple presidential campaigns, told Fox News.

THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN OF TUESDAY'S JD VANCE-TIM WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Most political pundits said that Harris bested Trump last month in their first and likely only debate. And flash polls of debate watchers agreed.

So a strong showing by Vance in Tuesday's vice presidential debate could give Trump a boost.

CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE 2024 ELECTION

And there's a precedent from twelve years ago.

After a shaky first debate by then-President Barack Obama against 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, then-Vice President Joe Biden's well-regarded performance in the running mate debate against Romney running mate Rep. Paul Ryan gave the Democrats' ticket a big boost.

Heading into the 2024 vice presidential debate, the 40-year-old Vance has been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Walz, who is 60, has been much more reluctant to speak with the national news media.

The governor has been in debate camp ahead of the showdown, to prepare. Walz huddled with advisers and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - who played the role of Vance in mock debates - in Harbor Springs, Michigan, near the northern tip of the state's lower peninsula.

Also helping out - Walz's wife - Minnesota First Lady Gwen Walz.

Asked on the eve of the showdown with Vance how his wife had been helping him with debate preparation, Walz told reporters ""she wins every one.""

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2024 ELECTION POWER RANKINGS SHOW

A source familiar with Vance's debate prep tells Fox News Digital that over the last month, the senator took part in a series of murder board sessions with his team, where a group of people who ask tough questions and have candid discussions to help someone prepare for a difficult examination or test, or in Vance's case, a vice presidential debate.

According to the source, Vance conducted a mock debate over the past week, with Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the House majority whip, playing the role of Walz. Former Trump administration Treasury Department assistant secretary Monica Crowley played the role of one of the moderators from CBS News, which is hosting the debate in New York City.

Halfway through the mock debate, the power went out, as a strong storm slammed through the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio, where Vance lives and where the prep session was held. But according to the source, who shared the details first with Fox News, Vance and the team continued on, using lanterns for lighting and cellphones for timers.

Emmer and Walz overlapped for four years in the House before Walz won election in 2018 as Minnesota's governor. ""I do know him probably as well or better than most on the Republican side,"" he said.

And Emmer, taking a shot at his fellow Minnesotan, argued ""the hardest part of playing Walz... is trying to tell lies with a straight face, because that's what he does. He's good at the debate game, but there isn't substance there. There's a lot of air.""

Former President Trump, asked Monday if he had given his running mate any advice, told reporters, ""No, he doesn't need it.""

But he added that he and Vance had ""been speaking a little bit back and forth"" and that he thought the senator was in ""good shape.""

Part of the Trump campaign's strategy ahead of the debate is to raise expectations for Walz.

""Walz is very good in debates. I want to repeat that. Tim Walz is very good in debates. Really good. He's been a politician for nearly 20 years. He'll be very well prepared for tomorrow night,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters on Monday.

Walz comes into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating.

Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable.

The senator arrived in New York City on Monday afternoon, and in the evening took a break from debate preparations to headline a gathering of GOP mega donors.

Walz was scheduled to fly to New York City on Tuesday, ahead of the debate.

The vice presidential debate is being moderated by ""CBS Evening News"" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell and ""Face the Nation"" host and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan.

The 90-minute debate, which kicks off at 9pm ET, will take place at the CBS News broadcast center in New York City.

The Fox News Channel, FOX Business Network, Fox News Digital, Fox News Audio and Fox Nation will air special programming of the debate.

Both the Harris and Trump campaigns agreed to two four-minute commercial breaks during the debate. Campaign staff are not allowed to interact with the candidates during those breaks.

The other rules - including no studio audience - are similar to September's Harris-Trump debate and June's debate between Trump and President Biden.

But there is one major difference - a candidate's microphone won't be muted when the opponent is speaking."
Pennsylvania deadlock: Why Kamala picked the wrong running mate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/shows/media-buzz/pennsylvania-deadlock-why-kamala-picked-wrong-running-mate,2024-10-01T07:07:51Z,"Harris 2024 senior adviser Ian Sams reacts to reports Tim Walz is 'nervous' about the vice presidential debate and discusses VP Kamala Harris' stance on the looming port strike on 'The Story.'

If Kamala Harris loses Pennsylvania, Donald Trump is the 47th President of the United States.

Now you could say the same about Michigan or Wisconsin, but it especially seems that a Democratic candidate should be able to carry the Keystone State.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN 'UNDERWATER' IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE, DEM REP WARNS DONORS

And that's why, in my view, Kamala should have picked Josh Shapiro, its popular governor.

I have nothing against Tim Walz, of football coach fame, but I don't see what he's done for the ticket. There's a reason the campaign hasn't let him do any solo interviews - a stark contrast with JD Vance, who is constantly doing interviews and holding press conferences.

In fact, Vance now frequently takes reporters' questions in front of supporters, who boo the journalists, sometimes even before they start speaking.

We'll find out whether Walz can think on his feet when he faces off against Vance in tonight's VP debate. The most generous thing I can say is that the Coach will be rusty.

Let's look at the latest numbers.

The Real Clear Politics average has Trump leading Harris by a miniscule margin, 48.1% to 47.9%, which of course is a statistical tie.

At 538, the micro-margin in Pennsylvania is flipped, with Harris averaging 47.9% and Trump at 47.1%, another tie.

Now imagine that Shapiro, who is more of a moderate liberal than the uber-progressive Walz, was the running mate. And let's say Shapiro had brought in another 50,000 votes as the home-state guy. You can see where that would tip the balance.

Kamala didn't pick Josh for two reasons. They had a rough conversation when she interviewed him, with the governor insisting on an influential role if he were to relinquish his current job. But so what? Presidents and their veeps often don't see eye to eye. She preferred the image of Walz, hunter and fisherman, to the prospect of two East Coast lawyers.

But the more important reason is more troubling. Harris was under pressure from the anti-Israel faction in her party not to tap Shapiro, who is Jewish and a strong supporter of the Jewish state.

So the vice president effectively handed veto power to this minority faction, which basically backs the Hamas terrorists who would wipe out Israel, and would have faced a week or two of controversy as a result. I said at the time this would be a world-class mistake if she lost Pennsylvania.

The reason Harris has spent so much time in the Pittsburgh area is that the western end of the state is much more conservative than the eastern section anchored by Philadelphia. Her goal is to hold down Trump's margin in a part of the state that he'll easily win.

KAMALA HARRIS IS GETTING 'OUTHUSTLED' AND 'OUTCLASSED': JESSE WATTERS

One problem Harris faces right now is that she makes little news. By picking ""friendly"" interviewers, such as MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle, who has trashed Trump as a danger to democracy, she avoids tough questions and followups.

Visiting the Mexican border was a smart move, not just because Trump has a major lead on immigration, but because Harris broke into the news cycle, where images can count more than words, and attempted to position herself as tougher than Joe Biden on the issue.

Otherwise, I'm just hearing chunks of her stump speech in response to questions, starting with how her mother raised her. Repetition is important in politics, but if you don't throw in a few new lines, the press is left without a headline.

Meanwhile, Trump over the weekend called Harris ""mentally impaired,"" saying Biden just got old but she was born that way. He also said Harris should be impeached, and maybe prosecuted, for the way she helped run the country.

Now that is classic Trump. By using over-the-top rhetoric, he sparks a media debate about whether he's gone too far, and that debate revolves around the words ""Kamala"" and ""mentally impaired.""

IN HYPERPARTISAN ENVIRONMENT, MSNBC DRAWING FIRE FOR ANTI-TRUMP, PRO-HARRIS PROGRAMMING

Harris has wisely not responded to every Trump jab. But remember, Trump benefits from negative coverage as much as positive coverage because he's driving the news agenda.

Here's a pool report from Harris at a West Coast political event over the weekend: ""She then switched her remarks to talking about the need for comprehensive immigration reform. VP Harris remarks on the issue were very similar to her remarks in Arizona on Friday."" In other words, no news.

Think about this: Trump has been absolutely pummeled by a hostile press corps, is a twice-impeached convicted felon and carries the burden of Jan. 6. Harris has been riding an extraordinary wave of positive press, and yet she's slipped slightly in the polls and is tied in Pennsylvania.

And there's no question that if she loses there, the election is over."

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 72 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey last month at a star-studded campaign event.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

Biden to visit North Carolina days after Helene's path of destruction leaves many devastated,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-visit-north-carolina-days-after-helenes-path-destruction-leaves-many-devastated,2024-10-01T02:13:37Z,"Trump transition team member Tulsi Gabbard pans the Biden-Harris administration's response to Hurricane Helene on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

President Biden announced on Monday that he will visit North Carolina on Wednesday after Hurricane Helene ravaged the state.

The president's announcement comes after critics slammed him for a lack of leadership after the monster storm's devastating impact on the southeastern portion of the country.

More than 120 people have been killed by Helene since the hurricane made landfall in Florida late Thursday before tearing a path of destruction through the interior Southeast.

The storm caused millions of power outages and billions in property damage as it smashed through the southern Appalachian Mountains and into the Tennessee Valley.

""I've ensured my travel will not disrupt the ongoing response. I plan to travel to Georgia and Florida as soon as possible.""

But the president's announcement was followed by harsh criticism from the public, with one person writing, ""Joe Biden's visit is too little, too late.""

Another person wrote, ""Don't come to Florida we got hit ground zero. The governor is covering it,"" referring to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Still, several people wrote that Biden is only visiting because former President Trump had already gone to areas damaged by Helene.

JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate.

The images being projected by the DNC - which were shared first with Fox News Digital - include an eight-year old critical comment of Trump that Vance wrote on social media.

""Vance on Trump: 'What an idiot'"" read the projection, which was a portion of a direct quote from Vance's 2016 social media post.

Vance was a one-time Trump critic when the former president first won the White House. But Vance became a major supporter, and after winning election to the Senate in 2022 with Trump's support, has become a top Senate ally of the former president and his America First agenda.

Another projection charges that ""Trump is a chicken,"" as the DNC continues its attacks on the former president - launched recently on mobile and stationary billboards - for saying he won't debate Harris a second time.

Trump has said that it's too late for another debate because early in-person and absentee voting is already underway in a growing number of states across the country.

FOX EXCLUSIVE: POWER OUTAGE DOESN'T SLOW DOWN VANCE'S DEBATE PREP

A third projection from the DNC being illuminated on Trump Tower says ""Project 2025 HQ.""

Project 2025 is a political initiative published by the well-known Heritage Foundation, a top DC-based conservative think-tank. While some of the authors who worked on the initiative - which includes some controversial planks - are veterans of the Trump administration, the former president and his campaign have pushed back vehemently against repeated attempts by Democrats to link him to Project 2025.

Another projection from the DNC is less controversial. It merely says ""Go Coach Walz!""

Walz was a longtime high school teacher and coach in Nebraska and then Minnesota before entering politics.

""These projections on Trump Tower NYC are a reminder that Trump and Vance are out for themselves while Trump remains afraid to go back on that debate stage and be held accountable by Vice President Harris for his failed record and his dangerous agenda,"" DNC deputy communications director Abhi Rahman argued in a statement.

And Rahman predicted that ""America will reject their self-serving, extreme Project 2025 plans this November.""

This is the second time in a month that the Democrats have projected images on a Trump Tower.

The DNC also shined images on Trump Tower in Chicago ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August.

Trump Tower in New York City - at the intersection of 5th Avenue and 57th Street - has long been a staple of the Midtown Manhattan skyline for nearly four decades.

MSNBC'S STEPHANIE RUHLE CALLS OUT HARRIS FOR DODGING HOW SHE'D RAISE TAXES: 'SHE DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION'

""What I didn't hear from her was divisive language,"" Ruhle told her MSNBC colleague Nicolle Wallace. ""Imagine if I was sitting against Donald Trump, imagine the language he would be using, please! And just the fact that we were talking about collaborative inclusivity -- I don't know. Vote for her or don't vote for her, but isn't it great to just have a positive conversation right now?""

Ruhle admitted that Harris didn't answer a question about how she would get the funding for her ambitious economic agenda without Congress, but quickly defended her by saying Trump would ""balloon"" the deficit ""significantly bigger than Vice President Harris will.""

She went on to say it's ""okay"" for Harris not to offer specifics about her policy proposals and shrugged off the non-answers as her simply being a ""politician.""

""It's complicated, right?"" Ruhle exclaimed. ""We're a country of 330 million people, our economy is complicated. In the same way -- is the economy good or bad? It totally depends! So tariffs, if used in the right places, can work. And one could watch that and say, 'Well, she didn't give a clear, direct answer.' That's okay, because we are not talking about clear or direct issues."""
Chinese Products & Material Sourcing in the  the Regulated Cannabis (Hemp and Marijuana) Industry,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthoban/2024/10/08/chinese-products--material-sourcing-in-the--the-regulated-cannabis-hemp-and-marijuana-industry/,2024-10-08T22:21:58Z,"**There has been a large number of allegations (on LinkedIn, in the press, and otherwise) about Chinese-produced counterfeit cannabis industry products and also about Chinese-derived hemp derivatives that are alleged to be produced under less than consumer-friendly conditions and standards) making their way into U.S. markets. And after hearing about this issue numerous times in recent weeks, I decided to investigate further.

*******

In recent years, the cannabis industry has faced its fair share of controversies, one of the most notable being the infamous ""VapeGate"" scandal. Occurring in 2019, this incident revealed unsafe levels of harmful substances in various marijuana vaping products, leading to widespread panic and concern about the quality of products in the cannabis market.

However, the core issue was not necessarily rooted in the regulated cannabis marketplace, but rather, it stemmed from an inundation of counterfeit and illicit products -- many of which were allegedly sourced from China. As mainstream media continues to highlight these concerns, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand the implications of these fake products and/or supply chain on an industry striving for legitimacy and safety.

The Impact of VapeGate

""VapeGate"" sent shockwaves through the marijuana sector, primarily because it spotlighted the shortcomings of certain unregulated products that had allegedly infiltrated the state-regulated marijuana markets. Reports detailed that many unsafe vape cartridges contained harmful levels of heavy metals and other contaminants due to the use of subpar materials and manufacturing processes often associated with Chinese production. However, these products were not representative of the state-regulated marijuana markets, which (as a general rule) has safety and quality standards in place.

Despite this distinction, the media coverage often blurred the lines between illicit and legal (i.e., regulated) products, enforcing misconceptions about the broader marijuana sector. The authentic marijuana products were overshadowed by the dangerous, counterfeit alternatives that mimicked legitimate offerings. This confusion served to fuel public skepticism regarding lawful marijuana, putting legitimate producers on the defensive and driving a wedge between them and potential consumers.

Perpetuating Misinformation Once Again - This Time with Regulated Hemp Derivatives

Fast forward to today, and the same (Chinese source) narrative is appearing in discussions surrounding regulated hemp derivatives, notably Delta-8 THC (D8). By way of background, President Trump signed the Farm Bill in December, 2018, which created the federally-legal $23B hemp derivative industry. As states navigate this burgeoning market for hemp-derived products, recent media articles have raised alarms about safety and regulation. Much like during the VapeGate crisis, these reports tend to equate the packaging and labeling of legitimate, state-regulated hemp products with those produced in illicit markets or sourced from overseas, specifically China. This failure to adequately differentiate lawful producers from counterfeiters contributes to ongoing misinformation in the industry.

Reports focusing on the dangers of hemp-derived products often neglect to mention that many of the concerning items come from unregulated sources that prioritize profit over safety, and which are not registered with the relevant hemp-derivative oversight agencies at the state-level. While approximately seventeen states have enacted regulations rewarding quality production standards, many discussions still originate from perspectives that blanket all hemp derivatives as unsafe -- leading to a collectively negative perception of the entire industry.

Relevant Regulations and U.S. Supply Exist

But to investigate the bases of these allegations is imperative. And so, I will do my best here to summarize what I found.

First, regarding supply (i.e., the China issue), there are several companies that control the majority of the state-regulated hemp derivative marketplace -- 3Chi, LaurelCrest, FM Labs, MC Nutraceuticals, Open Book Extracts, Biopyure, Arvida Labs, to name a few. I reached out to these companies for background and have worked with numerous companies that do business with them over the years. I learned that these groups work very diligently each week to source various hemp extracts from U.S-grown hemp? This is not to say that there are not bad actors out there (as in all industries, including the marijuana sector) acquiring hemp material or products from China, but this would not be reflective of the state-regulated hemp derivative supply chain and marketplace, just like VapeGate was not necessarily indicative of the regulated marijuana marketplace.

But didn't U.S. hemp production decline dramatically in recent years? And so, where are we getting all of these hemp derivatives? Well, beginning in 2019, U.S. farmers produced well-over 400,000 million pounds of hemp biomass excess inventory, for a wide variety of reasons that I do not have time to detail here. In short, there was a tremendous oversupply of hemp biomass beginning in 2019, which led to the production of CBD isolate (U.S.-produced), and which continues to supply the U.S.-based hemp derivative market to this very day. Whitney Economics prepared a graphic illustrating the same:

Whitney Economics further discovered that almost 50% of those U.S farmers had residual inventory year over year beginning 2019. This is coupled with the data point that, through 2020, nearly 60% of the processing/product manufacturing capacity was not being used. It has only begun being used at majority capacity in the past few years. ""So regardless of the amount of excess supply, the processors were not pulling it though the supply chain,"" says Beau Whitney.

In short, says Whitney, ""the claims about China supply is mistaken. The data does not show this at all.""

Regarding the safety of regulated hemp derivatives, it is important to note that the industry leaders perform testing through the supply chain nearly 5-6 more times than the regulated marijuana sector. My Forbes colleague, Will Yakowitz, does a great job detailing the operation of 3Chi and the rigorous standards applied.

In addition, the state-regulated hemp derivative ingredient supply chain generally requires all operators to be GMP compliant, which means that a company is following standardized Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) principles and procedures to ensure that their products are consistently produced and meet quality standards. Joel Searls, Director of Compliance at leading cannabinoid supplier, MC Nutraceuticals, is proud of his company's GMP-certified facilities (see pics below), and states: ""at MC Nutraceuticals, we seek to provide the safest consumer-friendly ingredients. As such, we have followed the tenets of GMP compliance for quite some time, and under the State of Colorado's hemp program, we achieved third-party validated GMP compliance. We are very proud of this."" He goes on to add that ""as an ingredient supplier that services hundreds of businesses across the U.S., we have worked across the regulated hemp derivative sector and just about every operator I see is either GMP-compliant, or is in the process of achieving the same.""

As such, it is important to note that hemp derivatives are indeed state-regulated and can be produced safely, much like marijuana sector products, but at a higher standard because of the food health and safety regulations applied thereto. CEO, Mike Dee, of Flora Bio Group indicates that ""FM Labs, as a leader in the hemp ingredient manufacturing industry, is committed to supporting American farmers within our supply chain while ensuring the highest levels of quality, purity, and safety. Our rigorous testing protocols guarantee that our products meet strict cGMP and compliance standards, which is an integral part of our safety commitment not only to the consumer of our products but also to our manufacturing employees. This reflects the broader hemp industry's dedication to responsible and sustainable production practices.""

Colorado's regulated hemp sector is a national leader. After a year-long task force and a formal/informal legislative stakeholder process, very specific legislation and corresponding regulations were drafted and put into place. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's (CDPHE) scientific and enforcement teams, closely examined this issue and provided extremely detailed rules and standards for producing such products and compounds. In doing so, the CDPHE worked openly and very closely with industry operators, concerned citizen groups, and even the marijuana sector, to develop these rules. These detailed standards provide production requirements, safety standards, and storage and labeling requirements. There are detailed lists of approved solvents, residual solvent levels, and the like. Suffice to say, this was not a high school science project.

Because Colorado's hemp derivative manufacturing complex is one of the largest in the country for export (outside of Colorado), these officials took on this role very seriously and put their scientists to work. The result is groundbreaking regulation that proves that there is a safe way to produce these derivatives -- even converted compounds. Point is: there is a scientifically-sound policy roadmap for hemp regulation and the manufacture of these products, and numerous other states have followed suit and have actively regulated these sort of hemp products.

The Need for Uniform Regulation and Clarity

The challenge presented by Chinese fake hemp products and supply compounds and the associated misinformation cannot be understated. Consumers rely on media reports to inform their choices, yet the failure to clearly differentiate between legal, state-regulated products and counterfeit alternatives and/or misinformation leads to confusion and mistrust. Articles critiquing the hemp industry must strive for transparency and hang their credibility on established facts about regulation and safety standards.

The reality is that legitimate regulated hemp derivative producers are held to rigorous safety guidelines, including checks on residual solvents, safety assessments, and clear labeling standards. Unlike the false Chinese supply narrative and the fake products creeping in from the illicit market, these operators are monitored and regulated by state agencies to protect consumer health.

In the paint of negativity and skepticism directed toward the marijuana and hemp sectors, it's crucial for stakeholders, including media outlets, to draw clear boundaries between regulated and unregulated products. The impact of associating legitimate hemp derivatives with dangerous, counterfeit products or allegations of supply chain safety only serves to undermine the hard work of compliant businesses striving to establish their credibility and provide safe products to consumers.

Conclusion

As the regulated hemp derivative markets continue to evolve, the import of transparency, regulation, and public education becomes increasingly vital. Chinese fake hemp products and the misinformation generated by the media can threaten the integrity of a burgeoning industry that has the potential for significant economic and health impacts. Understanding the distinctions between regulated products and their counterfeit counterparts is essential not only for consumer safety but also for restoring confidence in an industry working toward legitimacy and public benefit. It is the responsibility of every stakeholder, from producers to consumers to the media, to promote clarity and understanding in the face of confusion.

Will Israel Attack Iran's Nuclear Program? Here's What To Know As Ex-PM Calls For Strikes,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/10/08/will-israel-attack-irans-nuclear-program-heres-what-to-know-as-ex-pm-calls-for-strikes/,2024-10-08T21:39:57Z,"While Iran does not yet have nuclear arms, analysts believe the country's nuclear development program might be a prime target for Israeli retaliation -- despite U.S. opposition -- following Iran's missile launches at Israel, as a former Israeli prime minister argues for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.

In April, top Iranian general Ahmad Haghtalab threatened that the country could revise its nuclear policies if Israel hit its nuclear sites, saying such an attack could incite Iranian counterattacks targeting Israel's own nuclear facilities, according to reporting by state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

Israel and Iran are archrivals with a history of terse relations dating back to Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. A corresponding decades-long shadow war -- fueled by Iran's years of supporting Lebanese Shia militia Hezbollah and Islamist militant group Hamas -- has become a direct conflict as tensions spiked in recent years, particularly after Hamas' attack on Israel last year and Israel's intense invasion of Gaza. Israel -- alongside the U.S. and the U.N. -- has been concerned with Iranian nuclear progress since Iran started its weapons program in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Israel has spent the decades since targeting the program to prevent nuclear development through Israeli-connected missions like stealing nuclear secrets, sabotaging explosions and launching drone attacks. While Israel never took responsibility, Iran accused the country of assassinating top Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020. Iran has enough weapons-grade nuclear fuel to make three bombs and is one of the only countries without nuclear weapons that can produce 60%-enriched uranium, a quality of enriched uranium close to the 90% needed for weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal. Russian ties to Iran have deepened in recent years, and Bloomberg has reported the U.S. is concerned about the sharing of information and technology between the two countries -- a potential boon to Iran's nuclear interest. Israel is considered an undeclared nuclear weapons power because it is believed to have nuclear arms but has not confirmed possession of them, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.

While hitting it would be viewed as a major escalation, Israel has long watched Iran's nuclear enrichment plant in Natanz, an enrichment facility buried in the desert with thousands of centrifuges, according to the New York Times. Other facilities, like the enrichment plant buried under a mountain in Fordow, represent another potential target, yet U.S. officials have historically blocked Israel from getting the bomber planes and weapons powerful enough for an attack so deep underground, The Times reports. But Israel's methods have used other methods than bombings or missile attacks. Israel has a strong cyberdefense program -- exhibited recently when it launched an attack that exploded wireless devices owned by Hezbollah members. Another attack believed to be from the U.S. and Iran happened in the early 2000s -- called ""Olympic Games"" and known commonly the Stuxnet virus -- was a cyberattack that used digital ""worms"" to disrupt Natanz's facility operations.

Matthew Bunn, a professor of energy, national security and foreign policy at Harvard, told Forbes that there would be no nuclear fallout, or spreading of radioactive material, from attacking a uranium enrichment facility like Natanz or Fordow. These facilities deal with uranium that has not been irradiated in a nuclear reactor, meaning it's less radioactive. In an attack, some areas may suffer ecological damage, but the result would be isolated to the limited quantity of uranium at the locations, he said.

In April, top Iranian general Ahmad Haghtalab threatened that the country could revise its nuclear policies if Israel hit its nuclear sites, saying such an attack could incite Iranian counterattacks targeting Israel's own nuclear facilities, according to reporting by state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

In mid-2018, former President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Under the Obama administration deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities and permit U.N. inspections, and in return, economic and financial sanctions set by the EU, U.S. and U.N. were lifted. The deal outlined three main points: reducing Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium (a key ingredient in making bombs) by 98%, stopping production of higher-grade enriched uranium for 15 years and removing two-thirds of its more than 19,000 centrifuges (machines that enrich uranium). Under the deal, it would take Iran about 12 months to make a nuclear weapon. Trump was outspoken against the deal, calling it ""too much in exchange for too little."" Since 2018, Iran has significantly advanced its nuclear program, and while there is no evidence of nuclear-armed missiles, officials are concerned about metallurgy and computer modeling research related to weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Iran's nuclear capacity is playing out as a point of contention in the 2024 presidential campaign and was the leading question posed in Tuesday's vice presidential debate, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz arguing Trump was incapable of de-escalating tensions and did not put adequate nuclear protections in place when he pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, argued the Biden-Harris administration has supported Iran financially and that ""Donald Trump consistently made the world more secure."" Trump said on Oct. 4 at a campaign event in North Carolina that Israel should ""hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later."" When asked in a 60 Minutes interview on Oct.7, Vice President Kamala Harris responded that Iran was the U.S.'s greatest foreign adversary."

President Joe Biden addressed the country from the White House Tuesday morning and called Hurricane Milton ""a matter of life and death."" He encouraged Florida residents in the path of the storm to evacuate ""now"" and postponed a planned international trip to Germany and Angola ""in order to oversee preparations for and the response to Hurricane Milton."" Vice President Kamala Harris and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have been in a strange he-said-she-said about the incoming storm, with Harris accusing DeSantis of not taking her calls and ""playing political games"" Desanis said Harris ""has no role in this"" and that he's been communicating just fine with Biden, who also said he has been in touch. Biden said he gave DeSantis his personal phone number and told him to call if there is anything the federal government can do to help. Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said in an interview with CNN, ""I can say without any dramatization whatsoever: If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you're going to die.""

Tampa International Airport closed at 9 a.m. Tuesday with plans to reopen ""as soon as it is safe"" later this week and Orlando International Airport will close at 8 a.m. Wednesday. Almost 1,000 flights into and out of the United States were delayed as of Tuesday afternoon with another 700 canceled. More than 1,500 flights scheduled for Wednesday have been canceled, Reuters reported, and major airlines have told passengers they can change their plans without paying a fare difference. Walt Disney World Resort was open and running as usual Tuesday, and the company said it is monitoring the weather and will make adjustments as needed. Universal Resort Orlando announced Tuesday afternoon it will close at 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday and remain closed Thursday. Legoland Florida Resort and SeaWorld Orlando will both be closed on Wednesday and Thursday, and Busch Gardens Tampa is now closed through Thursday.

Milton will be the second major hurricane to hit Florida in two weeks. Hurricane Helene hit the state on Sept. 26, killing at least 20 in Florida, before going on to devastate parts of the southeastern United States. More than 220 people have died and hundreds more are still missing, with western North Carolina taking the brunt of flooding that the state's governor says wiped communities ""off the map."" In Florida, people are still working to clear debris from Helene as the next storm bears down. Ahead of Hurricane Milton, Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, ordered evacuations for areas near Tampa Bay and for all mobile and manufactured homes by Tuesday night. Lee County, home to Fort Meyers, issued a mandatory evacuation order for the island of Fort Myers Beach. Other mandatory evacuation orders have been issued in Pinellas County, Pasco County and Manatee County. DeSantis on Tuesday said he wasn't sure exactly how many people plan to evacuate for Hurricane Milton, but that he thinks those who saw Hurricane Helene will be particularly motivated to leave the area.

Federal Emergency Management Agency has said it is grappling with ""extremely damaging"" false narratives circulating about Hurricane Helene, which hit the U.S. two weeks ago. FEMA chief Deanne Criswell said misinformation about the storm and the federal government's response is the ""worst"" she's ever seen as former President Donald Trump and his allies slam the agency. Trump incorrectly claimed FEMA couldn't respond appropriately to the storm because it diverted so much money to helping migrants on the order of Vice President Kamala Harris. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the agency is ""meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have."" Other rumors include that FEMA has been withholding aid from areas that have historically voted Republican and that the agency is only giving $750 to disaster survivors to support their recovery."
What Working Millennials Of Color Are Feeling About Project 2025,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasminebrowley/2024/10/08/what-working-millennials-of-color-are-feeling-about-project-2025/,2024-10-08T20:16:05Z,"Project 2025, a manifesto created by the conservative organization The Heritage Project and a playbook of likely actions to be taken within the first 180 days in office if Donald Trump is elected (despite his protestations about the plan). Although the sweeping proposal touches on everything from critical race theory to abortion bans, one of the most immediately concerning parts of the plan is how will affect the future of work for millennials workers of color.

Some of the agenda focuses on proposed changes to workplace policies that could adversely affect workers' pay, security, and right to organize against grievances.

For instance, Project 2025 outlines a concerted slashing to overtime pay for workers' leaving with smaller take home pay. Data shows millennials are still the hardest working generation in comparison to Gen X and Gen z, the two age group millennials are sandwiched between.

The plan also proposed that eliminating the Biden administration-led rule that raised the salary threshold to $58,656 and expanded the protection to 4.3 million more workers. Project 2025 reads like it is aiming to help business owners and investors save money over time by skimping on employee protections, but the plan could make way for larger financial disasters.

Project 2025 includes details that rolls back post-crisis policies that protect consumers, investors, and the stability of financial markets by limiting regulators' ability to step in during periods of volatility. This includes putting a stranglehold on the Federal Reserve's ""lender-of-last-resort"" function in which failing banks are able to borrow emergency funds to stay solvent.

An example of this can be seen in the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) crisis in which the Federal Reserve and other regulators stepped in to ensure the bank's customers would have access to their funds by the next day - beyond just the $250,000 guaranteed by the FDIC. The bank's potential collapse could've devastated a number of Black businesses and employees since Silicon Valley Bank has been one of the most pivotal in aiming to help narrow the funding chasm for Black founders, as ESSENCE points out.

""We all know that young Black founders get a fraction of the business loans and venture capital their non-Black counterparts get,"" Shila Nieves Burney of Zane VC says.

Zane VC, a firm that boasts an investment catalog of young startups aims to address the health equity gap, in the most effective way it can, through infusions of much needed capital. Nieves Burney says that if Project 2025's proposed actions are implemented, already vulnerable Black and Brown workers could be in dire straights.

""I'm sitting on the side of the table where Black women typically aren't seated,"" she says. ""I get to push against the narrative that Black founders don't exist and ensure they get the funding they deserve but my job will be made harder if these proposed restrictions get implemented.""

Another lynchpin in the workforce section of proposed initiatives of Project 2025 is its plan to address DEI, which is often described as an attack on America's progress by conservatives.

""The next conservative President must make the institutions of American civil society hard targets for woke culture warriors,"" Project 2025 authors write. ""This starts with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (""SOGI""), diversity, equity, and inclusion (""DEI""), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.""

Dominic K. Hawkins, Vice President Of Communications at the NAACP says the proposed roll backs to DEI efforts will cause great harm to the country.

""Project 2025's policies will weaken civil rights protections, increase workplace discrimination, and ultimately set us back years,"" Hawkins says. ""As a Black professional who has worked across private and public sectors, I've seen how DEI practices only strengthen organizations and give opportunities that our community might be barred from due to the legacy of enslavement and systemic racism. If Project 2025 is enacted, what's to stop companies from blocking my application even when I'm more qualified? Nothing! And there would be no federally powered recourse.""

He adds, ""On top of that, it could create a dearth Black leaders at the top of organizations, who can't then help guide operations and they wouldn't be able to serve as role models and mentors for the next generation. As a Black executive, I wouldn't be where I am today with out sponsors at the C-level. Project 2025 would seek to wipe that out.""

The far reaching plan not only has the ability to touch business owners and corporate leaders, but content creator community as well. Quentin ""Funky Dineva"" Latham and Patrick ""Mr. Jones X"" Jones both expressed their fear for what's to come if the project is fully rolled out.

""It's terrifying, honestly,"" Latham says. He hosts a video podcast on his Youtube channel, which boasts more than 440k subscribers. Although he generates income from his broadcasts, Latham shares that government sanctions on DEI-driven initiatives could affect growth opportunities, including strict censoring rules that could impact the way he creates content.

Jones, on the other hand, shares fears of how his overall safety could be affected since he is a public figure that often comments on hot-button political topics. His combined social media pages boast more than 100k followers.

""Some people that existed on the TikTok platform that weren't very fond of my messaging {about Project 2025 potential ills} found out where I lived and sent the law enforcement to my house, which is where I work,"" Jones stated. ""I do believe that action is a direct manifestation of that group feeling emboldened by the conservative right's anti-DEI push.""

Overall, he says this is the apt time for working millennials like himself to empower and educate themselves about the future of work, and how the upcoming election could affect it.

""Be willing to learn more about the policies that can affect your life and do something about it,"" Jones advises. ""Use that as a motivation to stay the course. Never stop having the important conversations because it could be the difference between living the life you worked for, or having it shift in ways you could never imagine."""

Welcome back to The Prompt,

As Hurricane Helene wreaks havoc in North Carolina and Florida, AI-generated images of victims and first responders are spreading on platforms like Instagram, Facebook and X, Forbes reported. An AI-generated image of a young girl stranded in flood waters holding a drenched puppy in her hand has more than a million views on X, Kevin Guo, CEO of content moderation platform Hive confirmed with me. The image is being used to spread misinformation about the federal government's response to the disaster.

Other AI-generated images of Hurricane Helene's aftermath, such as a man wading through water while holding a dog, law enforcement officials providing relief and Donald Trump in a life jacket trawling through muddy water, are also circulating on social media. Experts say such fake images could hurt humanitarian efforts and make it difficult for victims to find support and trustworthy information.

Now let's get into the headlines.

AI unicorn Character AI briefly hosted a chatbot with the likeness of a teenage girl who was brutally murdered 18 years ago, Forbes reported. The girl's father, Drew Crecente, got a Google Alert on Wednesday morning that someone had used his daughter's yearbook photo and her name to create the bot. ""It shocks the conscience, and it's unacceptable behavior,"" he said. The company removed the chatbot from its platform for violating its impersonation policies.

This comes after the once-buzzy startup's CEO Noam Shazeer was hired by Google in a massive $2.7 billion deal and its interim leader announced that it plans to stop training cutting edge AI models and instead focus on its consumer product.

Two computer scientists, Geoffrey Hinton and John Hopfield, were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing techniques that allow computers to understand information in a way similar to the human brain -- teaching systems to ingest vast amounts of data and identify patterns. Hilton, known as one of the godfathers of AI, and Hopfield used concepts from physics to train artificial neural networks, laying a foundation for the development of machine learning systems like ChatGPT.

Last week, OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion funding round at $157 billion valuation -- the largest venture capital funding round of all time. Thrive Capital led the round with participation from giants like Microsoft, SoftBank and Nvidia among others, according to The Wall Street Journal. With 250 million people using its star product, ChatGPT, the AI giant plans to use the fresh funding to increase its compute capacity and launch more products.

Also notable: Braintrust, which offers software that evaluates how an AI product performs, has raised $36 million at a $150 million valuation, Forbes reported. Early adopters of AI like Notion and Figma use Braintrust to determine how well its AI integrations are responding to prompts.

On a warm night in San Francisco earlier this week, Elon Musk stood on top of a small round coffee table, bathed in purple light. Flocks of AI engineers and researchers gathered around him, some sitting on a nearby stairwell, as the billionaire pitched them on joining his fledgling AI company, xAI.

At the event, a recruitment party for prospective employees, Musk's main selling point was speed -- touting the company's pace in developing products, and creating AI tools in a fast and nimble environment, comparing xAI to an SR-71 jet. ""No SR-71 Blackbird was ever shot down and it only had 1 strategy: to accelerate,"" Musk said, according to one attendee.

The location was apt: The Pioneer Building in the city's Mission district, a 122-year-old former truck factory, and most recently, headquarters of OpenAI, the juggernaut maker of ChatGPT led by cofounder Sam Altman. xAI had just moved into the building, Musk said, attendees told Forbes.

Musk has not been shy about his beef with OpenAI. He cofounded the company with Altman and others in 2015, before leaving three years later after an alleged internal power struggle. Since then, Musk has sued the company twice, accusing the company of abandoning its mission to build artificial intelligence to benefit humanity. (His latest suit was in August, after withdrawing a similar one in June.)

""He really wants to be the antithesis to OpenAI,"" one attendee, Marvin von Hagen, told Forbes when asked about main takeaways from the evening. ""They really want to go on and say, 'Okay, we are the good guys now.'""

Musk's remarks -- as well as the office location -- illustrate the looming role OpenAI plays for xAI. Musk held the event on the same day as OpenAI's annual Dev Day, which some have speculated to be more than a coincidence. At the event, Musk joked about building ""BasedGPT."" xAI cleared out OpenAI's furniture from the office the day before the event, but at least one remnant still remains: A printed-out photo cutout of OpenAI president Greg Brockman is hanging on the ceiling of one of the rooms, two attendees said. (Brockman is currently on leave from OpenAI until the end of the year.) Von Hagen estimated that he saw about 10 current OpenAI employees in attendance.

ChatGPT and other chatbots in its class are prone to regurgitate certain constructions of phrases in its responses. ""Today's fast paced world"" and ""play a significant role in shaping"" are among the top 50 overused words by large language models, according to an analysis by AI content detection platform, GPTZero, Forbes reported. AI-generated text is particularly difficult to catch and such repetitive phrases are one way of spotting machine-written materials, as I reported with my colleague Alex Levine at the start of this year.

Inside Project 2025 And Its Connection To Donald Trump,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2024/10/08/inside-project-2025-and-its-connection-to-donald-trump/,2024-10-08T20:15:42Z,"There has been a lot of discussion about Trump's connection to Project 2025, a 922-page document, written by the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation. Is the Democrat's assertion that Trump is connected to the effort, correct? What does Project 2025 actually say? Project 2025 contains a multitude of items, more than we can cover in this article.

Is Trump connected to Project 2025? According to the slightly left leaning newspaper USA Today, this is a false assertion (read more here). The slightly right leaning NY Post also refutes the notion that Trump is connected to it. CNN has gone on record to say that Harris has made false claims about Trump and Project 2025. She said Trump, if elected, would cut Social Security. While the document says very little about Social Security, it does not propose cuts in the program (read more here).

Why then are Democrats claiming a Trump connection to Project 2025? In this hotly contested political race, each party is looking for ways to attack the credibility of the other and instill fear in the electorate to garner votes. To accomplish this, each party has made assertions about their opponent with the hope that it will resonate in the minds of undecided voters. While there may be several reasons to be hesitant about a second Trump presidency, his connection to Project 2025 or lack thereof, isn't one of them. What is true about Project 2025? Here's what I found after reading much of the 922-page document.

The Heritage Foundation published Project 2025 in 2023. There were 34 authors, 276 contributors, and 2 editors. Among the contributors, about 71% of them worked for the federal government during the first Trump administration. Some worked closely with Trump himself.

What prompted the creation of Project 2025? The premise behind it is that the federal government is far too powerful and too inefficient. This is a widely held belief among Americans. However, there are a few items in the document that run contrary to the Democrats agenda. For example, Project 2025 would restore the definition of ""sex"" as ""biological sex at birth"" instead of ""sexual orientation and gender identity."" According to a Pew research poll from May 2022, 60% of those polled believe gender is determined by the sex assigned at birth. Yet, Democrats continue to define sex as ones ""sexual orientation and gender identity."" Thus, the document states, ""The CDC should immediately end its collection of data on gender identity, which legitimizes the unscientific notion that men can become women (and vice versa)...""

Another example involves abortion. Liberals promote abortion as health care. The Project 2025 document (page 455) states, ""It should fund studies into the risks and complications of abortion and ensure that it corrects and does not promote misinformation regarding the comparative health

and psychological benefits of childbirth versus the health and psychological risks of intentionally taking a human life through abortion."" Conservatives see the issue as more than a woman's right to choose. They see abortion as the taking of life. In general, conservatives are against abortion but do believe exceptions to protect the life of the mother, rape, incest are appropriate.

Project 2025 also exposes some conflicts of interest in the federal government. One such conflict is found in the National Institute of Health (NIH). It states, ""In 2018, it was revealed that a $100 million NIH study on the benefits of moderate drinking was funded by the beer and liquor industry."" It also points out how the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) owns half of the patent for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, among thousands of other pharma patents. It goes on to say that several NIH employees personally receive up to $150,000 per year from Moderna vaccine sales.

Project 2025 does have some controversial items within the document, but its overarching theme is that government has become too large, too inefficient, and there are too many agencies whose actions go well beyond their charter. In short, the document makes suggestions that would reorganize the federal bureaucracy, returning agencies to their original mandates.

Democrats have suggested Trump will enact its provisions if elected in November. While Trump may indeed implement some of the provisions of Project 2025, many of them are standard conservative ideals and not something from a horror movie as Democrats have suggested."
Pennsylvania 2024 Trump-Harris Polls: Harris Has Less Than 1-Point Lead In Polling Averages,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/08/pennsylvania-2024-trump-harris-polls-harris-has-less-than-1-point-lead-in-polling-averages/,2024-10-08T19:37:17Z,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are nearly tied in Pennsylvania, according to two new polls this week in the battleground state, where a win for either candidate could pave the way to the White House.

No Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948. If Harris wins Pennsylvania, and the trend of also winning Wisconsin and Michigan holds, she's all but certain to win the White House.

82%. That's the share of registered voters in Pennsylvania who said the economy is a major factor in their 2024 vote, followed by inflation at 78% and the state of democracy at 70%, according to the CBS/YouGov survey. The results are on par with the national electorate, according to a recent Pew Research survey of registered voters that found 81% of registered voters rate the economy as ""very important"" in the election.

Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Harris over her previous endorsement of a fracking ban -- Pennsylvania is the country's second-largest natural gas producer. ""Fracking? She's been against it for 12 years,"" Trump said during Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. Harris, who said during a 2019 CNN climate town hall while she was running for president ""there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,"" has said she's since changed her stance. During Tuesday's debate, she said she made ""very clear"" in 2020 that she's against a fracking ban, presumably referring to her vice presidential debate with Mike Pence, and noted the Inflation Reduction Act opened new gas leases -- reiterating a stance she took in a CNN interview last month. Harris didn't actually say she changed her own position on the issue during the 2020 debate -- instead she said then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden ""will not end fracking.""

Pennsylvania has a divided state legislature. The state's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, is widely popular in the state. Democrats also control the House, but Republicans hold the majority in the Senate.

Harris leads Trump in four of seven battleground states, while Trump is ahead in North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling averages that show margins of less than two points in all seven battleground states (Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin). If Trump maintains his leads in Arizona and Georgia, and wins North Carolina, as he's expected to, he would need just one of the ""Blue Wall"" states (Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin) to win the White House.

President Joe Biden addressed the country from the White House Tuesday morning and called Hurricane Milton ""a matter of life and death."" He encouraged Florida residents in the path of the storm to evacuate ""now"" and postponed a planned international trip to Germany and Angola ""in order to oversee preparations for and the response to Hurricane Milton."" Vice President Kamala Harris and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have been in a strange he-said-she-said about the incoming storm, with Harris accusing DeSantis of not taking her calls and ""playing political games"" Desanis said Harris ""has no role in this"" and that he's been communicating just fine with Biden, who also said he has been in touch. Biden said he gave DeSantis his personal phone number and told him to call if there is anything the federal government can do to help.

Tampa International Airport closed at 9 a.m. Tuesday with plans to reopen ""as soon as it is safe"" later this week and Orlando International Airport will close at 8 a.m. Wednesday. Almost 1,000 flights into and out of the United States were delayed as of Tuesday afternoon with another 700 canceled. More than 1,500 flights scheduled for Wednesday have been canceled, Reuters reported, and major airlines have told passengers they can change their plans without paying a fare difference. Walt Disney World Resort, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando were all open and running as usual Tuesday, but each company said they were monitoring the weather and will make adjustments as needed.

Milton will be the second major hurricane to hit Florida in two weeks. Hurricane Helene hit the state on Sept. 26, killing at least 20 in Florida, before going on to devastate parts of the southeastern United States. More than 220 people have died and hundreds more are still missing, with western North Carolina taking the brunt of flooding that the state's governor says wiped communities ""off the map."" In Florida, people are still working to clear debris from Helene as the next storm bears down. Ahead of Hurricane Milton, Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, ordered evacuations for areas near Tampa Bay and for all mobile and manufactured homes by Tuesday night. Lee County, home to Fort Meyers, issued a mandatory evacuation order for the island of Fort Myers Beach. Other mandatory evacuation orders have been issued in Pinellas County, Pasco County and Manatee County. DeSantis on Tuesday said he wasn't sure exactly how many people plan to evacuate for Hurricane Milton, but that he thinks those who saw Hurricane Helene will be particularly motivated to leave the area.

Federal Emergency Management Agency has said it is grappling with ""extremely damaging"" false narratives circulating about Hurricane Helene, which hit the U.S. two weeks ago. FEMA chief Deanne Criswell said misinformation about the storm and the federal government's response is the ""worst"" she's ever seen as former President Donald Trump and his allies slam the agency. Trump incorrectly claimed FEMA couldn't respond appropriately to the storm because it diverted so much money to helping migrants on the order of Vice President Kamala Harris. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the agency is ""meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have."" Other rumors include that FEMA has been withholding aid from areas that have historically voted Republican and that the agency is only giving $750 to disaster survivors to support their recovery."

Trump Media executives were able to sell their shares in the company beginning on Sept. 19, when the lockup period -- a standard procedure for public companies aimed at preventing certain shareholders from selling shares for a period of time -- ended. But when the lockup period ended, Trump dispelled concerns that he would divest, which could drive down the company's share price, saying ""I'm not selling, I love it."" Shares are up almost 80% from their low in September. The company is still far below its peak of over $66 a share after it went public on March 26 by combining with blank-check firm Digital World Acquisition Corp. Trump Media has reported strikingly low revenue, but it has often been considered a highly volatile ""meme stock,"" or a stock that became popular through social media and has price changes in response to non-earnings developments, like the assassination attempts on Trump or his performance in presidential debates.

Last week, Trump Media revealed in a regulatory filing its chief operating officer, Andrew Northwall, resigned in late September. The company did not say why Northwall left but said it would be transitioning his duties internally. Northwall said in a post on Truth Social he was grateful to Trump and ""being part of TMTG has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career."" The same day his departure was announced, ProPublica reported the company was forcing out executives amid internal allegations of mismanagement."

FEMA recently launched a website dedicated to correcting misinformation about the response to Helene on which it corrects falsehoods, encourages people to be ""aware of rumors and scams and (to share) official information from trusted sources.""

Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida's Big Bend region on Sept. 26. It has killed at least 220 people across six states and caused extreme damage in a number of towns in the southeast, including Asheville, North Carolina, the AP reported. Millions of people were without power in the days following the storm, and more than 111,000 people were still without power in North Carolina as of Tuesday, according to poweroutage.us. The Biden administration mobilized 1,500 troops to assist National Guard and federal personnel in their recovery responses, and had given out more than $137 million in federal assistance as of Sunday. Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris visited the southeast last week to survey the damage and meet with leaders, and Trump visited Valdosta, Georgia, and said he brought ""truckloads of things"" like water and equipment to Georgia, Reuters reported. Trump almost immediately made the response to Helene political when he visited Georgia -- a key battleground state in November -- and alleged Biden had not called Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, despite Kemp saying earlier that day he had spoken to Biden. The president responded by saying Trump's lies were ""irresponsible"" and that the White House was doing everything it could to assist in recovery.

""It's un-American,"" Biden said Tuesday of political figures who spread misinformation about the hurricane response. ""It misleads people, it puts people in circumstances where they panic, where they really really really worry, they think 'I'm not being taken care of.'""

Harris criticized Trump for continuing to spread misinformation, saying on Monday it was ""extraordinarily irresponsible"" of him to push false information about what is available to survivors and those impacted by the storm, the Associated Press reported.

Harris also criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for not taking her calls about the incoming Category 4 Hurricane Milton, saying ""people are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations ... is utterly irresponsible."" DeSantis later pushed back on Harris' criticism, saying ""she has no role in this"" and that he has been in touch with President Joe Biden to prepare for Milton.

How misinformation spreads with Hurricane Milton. Milton is expected to make landfall in Florida on Tuesday as a Category 4 hurricane after being downgraded from a Category 5. Officials have warned ""Milton will remain an extremely dangerous hurricane when it reaches the state,"" and much of Florida was under hurricane warnings, hurricane watches or tropical storm warnings as of Tuesday afternoon."
"Trump White House Stopped FBI From Fully Investigating Brett Kavanaugh Claims, Senate Report Says",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/08/trump-white-house-stopped-fbi-from-fully-investigating-brett-kavanaugh-claims-senate-report-says/,2024-10-08T16:31:05Z,"The Trump administration blocked the FBI from conducting a thorough investigation into the sexual assault allegations that came out against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing, Democratic senators allege in a new report, claiming the Trump White House limited the probe's scope and left out potential corroborating evidence.

""The Trump White House controlled the scope and conduct of the supplemental background investigation, specifically engineering it to exclude evidence that could have corroborated the allegations against Kavanaugh,"" Whitehouse's report claims.

The Senate report cites communications showing FBI investigators were confused by public statements by Trump and members of his administration claiming that the agency had ""free rein"" to conduct its investigation and interview whomever was relevant, given the limited instructions the FBI received to only interview certain witnesses. When it comes to ""supplemental"" investigations into a nominee's background, the FBI can only investigate what the White House tells it to, the report notes, so the FBI could only have the flexibility that Trump claimed if his administration specifically told that to the FBI. FBI personnel asked the Trump administration if their directive had changed, given the then-president's public statements, but a Trump administration staffer said ""only that the White House would be in touch if it had additional guidance,"" the report alleges.

Attorneys for Blasey Ford and Ramirez criticized the FBI investigation in light of the new Senate report in statements Tuesday to The Washington Post, with Blasey Ford's lawyers Debra Katz and Lisa Banks saying it ""confirms what we long suspected: the FBI supplemental investigation of then-nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh was, in fact, a sham effort directed by the Trump White House to silence brave victims and other witnesses who came forward and to hide the truth."" Ramirez's attorney John Clune told the Post the report was ""really disappointing since our client was so candid about something that was a pretty awful experience."" Blasey Ford has maintained her allegations against Kavanaugh over the years, writing in her 2024 memoir she believes the justice ""must know"" what happened between them, ""even if it's hazy from the alcohol."" She also argued Kavanaugh ""categorically denying"" the allegations made Blasey Ford feel ""more certainty than ever"" that he ""had not gone on to become the consummately honest person befitting a Supreme Court justice.""

The Senate report calls for new protocols to be put into place so that any future investigations into political nominees won't face the same issues, arguing the Kavanaugh probe shows the current process ""can be easily manipulated to prevent a thorough investigation into potentially disqualifying allegations against a nominee."" Senators propose there should be more transparency in any supplemental FBI investigations, with ""clear, written procedures"" for how these kinds of probes should operate and the FBI required to inform the Senate of the exact investigative steps the agency took.

While senators began investigating the FBI's Kavanaugh probe in 2018, it took years to complete because of ""executive branch obstruction,"" the report claims, alleging the White House refused to provide information. Even after Trump left and President Joe Biden took office, ""complete answers to the Senators' questions were few and far between,"" the report alleges, suggesting the executive branch still either didn't provide requested information or gave only incomplete answers. Senators were finally given 600 pages of communications between the Trump White House and FBI only in Nov. 2023, the report notes, which it suggests is only because Whitehouse suggested he would withhold supporting the Biden administration's nominee to lead the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel until his requests were responded to.

Kavanaugh was narrowly confirmed to the Supreme Court in 2018 in a 50-48 vote as the sexual assault allegations became a national controversy. Blasey Ford came forward with her allegations in an interview with the Post in Sept. 2018, which quickly became the main focus of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing even as the then-nominee vehemently denied her claims. Senators backing Kavanaugh repeatedly pointed to the FBI's investigation and its lack of findings to justify supporting the justice, with the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee releasing a report in 2018 claiming ""there was no evidence to substantiate any of the claims of sexual assault made against Justice Kavanaugh."" Democrats have long raised concerns about how the FBI handled the claims against Kavanaugh, and Whitehouse's Senate report follows several years of news articles and reports suggesting investigators did not do their due diligence. Whitehouse slammed the probe as being ""politically constrained and perhaps fake"" in 2021 and called for the Justice Department to investigate it. The Rhode Island senator also asked FBI Director Christopher Wray about the investigation during a Senate hearing in August 2022, at which Wray confirmed the FBI had taken ""direction"" from the Trump Administration over who was interviewed in the probe."
North Carolina 2024 Trump-Harris Polls: Near Tie In The New 7th Swing State,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/08/north-carolina-2024-trump-harris-polls-near-tie-in-the-new-7th-swing-state/,2024-10-08T16:05:22Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris could become only the second Democratic presidential candidate to win North Carolina in more than 40 years as the state has slowly shifted more to the left over the past decade -- with polls showing her and former President Donald Trump in a dead heat in the state.

Whether scandals surrounding GOP gubernatorial candidate, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, could hurt Trump's chances in North Carolina. Trump endorsed Robinson prior to a CNN report revealing a string of racist and derogatory comments he allegedly made on a pornographic website chat forum before his entrance into politics, including referring to himself as a ""Black NAZI."" Polls taken after the Sept. 19 story show Democratic candidate Josh Stein has widened his lead over Robinson, to as many as 19 points in a recent Emerson College survey. A CNN/SSRS poll released Sept. 27 also found Robinson trailing Stein by 17 points and a tie between Trump and Harris, suggesting Robinson's scandals haven't affected Trump's standing there. Historically, the demise of down-ballot candidates rarely drag down the affiliated party's presidential candidate, CNN notes.

16. That's how many electoral college votes North Carolina has, after gaining a vote after the 2020 census. The state has the eighth most electoral votes in the country, tied with Georgia.

Despite the electorate's increasingly Democratic leanings, Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers of the legislature, giving it the power to override Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's vetoes.

North Carolina has only voted for one Democratic presidential candidate since 1980: Barack Obama in 2008.

Harris holds an advantage over Trump in almost all of the seven battleground states, according to the Bloomberg News/Morning Consult survey showing her leading among likely voters by seven points in Nevada, five in Pennsylvania, three in Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin, and two in North Carolina, with a tie in Georgia. Trump also trails Harris in most recent national surveys and now leads him by two points overall, according to RealClearPolitics' polling average. North Carolina was the only swing state where Biden lost to Trump (by one point) in 2020.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Saturday declared a state of emergency for 35 counties, including all of the Tampa Bay area, and warned of a ""flurry"" of evacuation orders. According to the Associated Press, Milton could trigger the biggest spate of evacuation orders in the state since 2017's Hurricane Irma -- where 7 million people were urged to leave their homes. Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, ordered evacuations for areas near Tampa Bay and for all mobile and manufactured homes by Tuesday night. Lee County, home to Fort Meyers, issued a mandatory evacuation order for the island of Fort Myers Beach. Other mandatory evacuation orders have been issued in Pinellas County, Pasco County and Manatee County. Volusia County has issued a curfew and enacted evacuation orders starting Wednesday morning and Marion County is under a mandatory evacuation order for mobile homes, RVs, and modular-type homes.

""I can say this without any dramatization whatsoever. If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you are going to die,"" Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told CNN.

Tampa International Airport closed at 9 a.m. Tuesday with plans to reopen ""as soon as it is safe"" later this week. Orlando International Airport will close at 8 a.m. Wednesday. Major U.S. airlines, including American, Delta, Southwest, United and JetBlue, are issuing travel waivers that will allow passengers flying through impacted airports to rebook without paying far differences. American Airlines' travel alert covers 12 airports in Florida, Delta's covers nine and Frontier covers eight. United Airlines' advisory covers travel to and from only five airports -- Key West, Orlando, Fort Myers, Sarasota/Bradenton and Tampa.

Walt Disney World Resort is currently open and operating as usual but Disney has announced some of its Orlando-area offerings will close Wednesday morning, including the Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground, Copper Creek Cabins at Disney's Wilderness Lodge and the Treehouse Villas at Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa. The company warned the attractions won't reopen until later in the week. Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando are also open and operating as usual, and both parks say they are monitoring the weather and will make adjustments as needed.

There is no such thing as a Category 6 hurricane. The National Hurricane Center uses the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale to classify storms, which ranks only up to a Category 5 and defines those storms as having sustained winds at or greater than 157 mph. Earlier this year, researchers with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Space Science and Engineering Center argued for adding a sixth storm category as climate change continues to intensify weather events. Under their proposal, Category 5 hurricanes would be redefined to encompass storms with sustained wind speeds between 157 and 192 mph and a new Category 6 would describe storms with wind speeds above 192 mph.

Milton is expected to arrive less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene, a major Category 4 storm, hit Florida on Sept. 26. Helene was the hardest hit for the Tampa Bay area from a hurricane in 103 years, according to the Associated Press. Despite staying offshore, Helene inundated parts of the area with several feet of storm surge. At least 20 people died in Florida from the storm, which then traveled 500 miles across the Southeastern U.S. and caused heavy flooding in the Carolinas, Georgia, Virginia and Tennessee. At least 230 people across six states died as a result of the hurricane, which was the deadliest to hit the continental U.S. since Katrina in 2005. Helene made landfall near Perry, Florida, approximately 160 miles north of Tampa, with winds of 140 mph before it was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved northward.

Milton will be the fifth hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. this year, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts 2024 will be one of the busiest hurricane seasons on record, estimating 8 to 13 hurricanes and between 4 and 7 major hurricanes.

In a shocking moment, Trump most recently bragged about his ""very good"" relationship with Putin in September while standing next to Putin's enemy Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Woodward's book also depicts the two remaining in touch after his presidency, with an unnamed aide saying calls between the two happened as much as seven times since 2021, according to the Post, citing the book. Trump has also publicly praised Putin, once calling him a genius, according to the New York Times.

Trump's relationship with Putin has become a prominent point on the campaign trail and at rallies, with Trump never saying that he wants Ukraine to beat Russia in the ongoing war and the former president repeating his claim of ending the Ukraine war before he gets into office. Vice President Kamala Harris mocked Trump during the debate in September for cozying up to dictators, saying that ""Putin would eat"" Trump for lunch if he returns to office. At the debate, Harris also criticized Trump for his relationship with other dictators."
America The Tax Haven? Exploring The U.S. Trade Deficit,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/taxnotes/2024/10/08/america-the-tax-haven-exploring-the-us-trade-deficit/,2024-10-08T15:38:08Z,"In this episode of Tax Notes Talk, Professors Kenneth Austin and Hillel Nadler discuss the policies that they believe make the United States a tax haven, and the resulting effects on the economy.

Tax Notes Talk is a podcast produced by Tax Notes. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

David D. Stewart: Welcome to the podcast. I'm David Stewart, editor in chief of Tax Notes Today International. This week: just like haven.

Tax havens and financial secrecy are regular topics of discussion in the tax world. We've previously looked at tax havens from an international perspective, and you can find those episodes in the show notes. But today, we're turning the lens around and considering if the United States is a tax haven.

Here to talk more about this are two authors who have recently considered this topic in-depth in the pages of Tax Notes. Kenneth Austin is a retired Treasury economist, and an adjunct professor at American University's International School of Service, and Hillel Nadler is an assistant professor at Wayne State University School of Law.

David D. Stewart: Let's start off with the big question of why should we look at the United States as being a tax haven?

Hillel Nadler: Well, there are really two aspects to this. One is that, on the U.S. side, in terms of the U.S. tax burden on financial inflows, foreign investors can hold U.S. financial assets while paying minimal U.S. tax on the profits from those assets, so that's one aspect of it. The second aspect of America being a tax haven in this sense is that the U.S. has a unique financial secrecy position, which means that foreign investors can not only avoid paying tax to the U.S., or pay minimal tax to the U.S., but they can avoid paying tax in their home countries on their profits from U.S. financial assets.

David D. Stewart: In your article about this subject, you talked about this affecting the trade deficit. Could you explain that?

Kenneth Austin: Yeah. Basically, the way it works in today's world, and particularly for the U.S., our trade deficit is equal to how much money we borrow net from the rest of the world. When I say borrow, it's not exactly like we go down to the People's Bank of China and fill out a loan application. It's just that any foreigner, or I guess in the tax code, nonresident alien, can simply buy U.S. assets on, say, the bond market, stock market, deposit it in a bank.

That's lending internationally. It may not be to a particular individual, and the money may already have been borrowed. Say the U.S. Treasury sells a bond, and that bond is sold to an American, but that American sells it to a nonresident alien, then we are borrowing internationally. That will affect the exchange rates. And as we borrow, the exchange rate appreciates, which causes the U.S. trade deficit to grow.

David D. Stewart: How did we start going down this road?

Hillel Nadler: These provisions have accumulated over time. These provisions that offer favorable tax treatment to foreign investment, many of them made sense in a different exchange rate situation, when the United States' financial situation was different.

If you start by addressing each provision, one provision that's favorable to foreign investors in the United States is that capital gains from the sale of most U.S. investment assets, including stock buybacks by U.S. corporations, aren't taxed at all to foreign investors. They pay no U.S. tax on those. Then in the early 1930s, all the way back then, the U.S. Treasury actually tried to collect tax on capital gains of foreign investors. If you looked at the code then, there was no specific exemption. But doing that was difficult because, if the foreign investor didn't actually file a tax return, Treasury had no way of knowing what they had earned. And Treasury was also concerned about discouraging foreign investment.

Eventually, Congress responded by introducing what we currently have now, which is an exemption for capital gains for foreign investors. I think this historical episode, the following historical episode illustrates our point nicely, which was that the exemption was actually broadened in the 1960s, by adding what's known as the securities trading safe harbor, which says that capital gains of foreign investors would be exempt even if they're present in the United States, they're trading in the United States, or acting through a U.S. agent.

Previously, doing so would have been considered engaging in a trade or business in the U.S. and would have subjected the foreign investor to U.S. tax. But this change was made explicitly to encourage foreign investment in the U.S.

The context was this was in response to the then balance of payments crisis. At the time, the U.S. was trying to prop up the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates and wanted to encourage foreign investment inflows into the United States. They wanted to encourage investors to turn U.S. dollars into longer-term investments. That's just one example, but a lot of these provisions were specifically designed to attract foreign investment into the United States.

Kenneth Austin: May I interject one thing? I know this may sound rather picayune. But in English, the word ""investment"" has more than one meaning. And words have multiple definitions, eventually they lose meaning. Because I say one thing, you hear another. You can talk about a foreigner buying a share of GM, and we'll call that an investment in the stock market. What congressmen tend to hear is creating some form of productive capacity, like plant and equipment, and something especially with an employee parking lot. When really, what they've done is made a bank deposit in the U.S. and then used that bank deposit to buy a stock. No real productive capacity was created.

As long as you say the word ""investment,"" I think a lot of people, and particularly politicians, will hear, ""We're going to have bigger employee parking lots."" That's just not necessarily true. Most of the money that's come into the U.S. in the last 30 years has not built productive capacity. Yeah, we have some Honda factories, and BMW factories, etc. But overwhelmingly, the money has just gone into the banking system. It's bank deposits. A lot of it winds up just financing dodgy consumer debt.

David D. Stewart: Now, is the U.S. unique in the way that it treats these foreign inflows? You're mentioning this nontaxation of capital gains.

Hillel Nadler: The U.S. isn't unique in the way it treats foreign financial inflows. At least, not now. But in some ways, the U.S. has been a leader on this.

If you go back to the 1980s, the U.S. introduces this exemption for interest income on portfolio debt. If you're a foreign investor, you hold a U.S. issued bond, then the interest on that bond is going to be, in most cases, going to be exempt from tax in the U.S. At the time when this exemption was introduced, the U.S. was alone, but other countries wanted to follow suit with the U.S., and other major economies, and they were worried about losing capital flows to the U.S., so they followed suit and also abolished their taxes on interest paid to foreign investors.

David D. Stewart: Now you mentioned this Bretton Woods, the fixed exchange rates. Since the collapse of that, what have been the results of the U.S. treatment of foreign investments since then?

Kenneth Austin: Well, I would say that there's really two periods. When the Bretton Woods system first collapsed, most of the Western countries, the advanced countries, whatever we want to call them -- Europe, the U.S., Japan -- just gave up on trying to control their exchange rates. The Japanese backtracked on that and it became a problem. But we backed up on that. We just let currencies move against each other. The Europeans didn't like that, and that started a movement towards the European Union.

A lot of other countries continued to control their exchange rate. The way you do that is you buy and sell foreign currency. Particularly, the U.S. dollar was very valued because we had big financial markets. You can move your money in and out quickly. If you wanted to make your own currency more valuable, you would buy it and pay for it in dollars, but you needed dollars to do that. Or if you want to depreciate your currency so you could run a larger trade surplus or smaller deficit, then you bought foreign currency. The price of foreign currency would go up, and that would encourage your exporters to earn more of the more valuable foreign currency, and discourage imports. If the price of foreign currency went down, it had the opposite effect. It was less valuable to you as an exporter, and it was cheaper to buy foreign goods.

That was a way to control your trade balance. For a long time, that mostly worked. I don't want to go in too much detail here, but things started to change when we had the oil crises of the '70s, because a lot of countries in the Middle East that had not previously had a lot of money to invest, they just started buying U.S. dollars. We allowed that. We actually encouraged that. Then the Reagan administration came along, did a lot of huge tax cuts, tried to cut the budget expenditures, but we still had a huge deficit. We were issuing a lot of U.S. government bonds, and that attracted more. Our interest rates went very high. A lot of people bought dollars around the world. Then that gradually tapered off.

By the late 1990s, America actually had a small fiscal surplus. But then, something new started to happen. There was what was called the global savings glut. A lot of countries, particularly in Asia, were growing very rapidly, and they were saving more than they were investing, actually finding uses for those savings. When the Asian financial crisis came, a lot of money came to the U.S. It also came from Europe, which was trying to reduce its budget deficits. So it all came here. The U.S. current account deficit, which is the trade deficit with some extras thrown in, basically tripled within about two, three years. Now all this money flowing into U.S. financial markets blew up the dot-com bubble, and we had a recession in 2000, two, three years after the Asian financial crisis.

Normally, that would have caused the trade deficits to shrink. It just shrank for a little bit. And then it started growing, because the rest of the world needed a place to put their money and it came to the U.S. That financed a larger and larger trade deficit. Because there are basically two ways you can get foreign currency. You can earn it by exporting; you can borrow it. Whether you want to borrow it or not, if you borrowed it, it causes your currency to become more expensive on world markets. That encourages trade deficit, because more is coming in than is going out.

Actually, what'll happen almost immediately is that the amount that you're borrowing and your trade deficit will be equal. It's actually to the penny because the balance of payments is a double-entry bookkeeping system, and that's the way it has to work.

David D. Stewart: What is the negative to the U.S. economy of having a lot of this money coming in?

Kenneth Austin: Well, one thing is our financial system can't always handle it. We just had a huge amount of money came in in the first decade of the 21st century. All of a sudden, you're watching all these TV ads, ""Don't have to fill out paperwork, get our mortgage."" A lot of these mortgages were bad. All sorts of ridiculous things happened in U.S. financial markets because interest rates started to go really low. People became desperate to find something they could actually put their money in. That led to a lot of the abuses that caused the great financial crisis.

At the same time, all this money was raising the price of the U.S. dollar. It was just not profitable to invest in U.S. production facilities anymore, because things could always be made cheaper elsewhere, particularly in China, and this was the China shock. There's some economic work that actually said this China shock, all these people who got thrown out of work in what are now the swing states -- Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, all across the Midwest, the old Rust Belt -- a lot of these people, the children and grandchildren of New Deal Democrats, they voted Trump because somebody had to help. And if you look at the areas where that trade impact was the biggest, where the most jobs were lost, not only in the factories but in the surrounding towns that depended on the factories for the money that would be spent there, they were terribly harmed by this. It's very tangible, particularly to the people who lost their job.

David D. Stewart: Turning back to the tax policy underlying this, you mentioned the treatment of capital gains. Are there other things that the U.S. government is doing that are allowing inflowing dollars to escape taxation?

Hillel Nadler: Yeah. The basic structure of the U.S. tax code, especially as it relates to inbound investment, or inbound financial flows if you don't like to use the word ""investment,"" is that it's very favorable towards passive investment by foreign taxpayers.

Your listeners are probably familiar -- there are basically two different tax regimes that apply to foreign taxpayers: one that applies to passive investment income, and another that applies to active business profits from an active business in the United States. Very broadly, foreign taxpayers, if there's income that's derived from a U.S. trade or business, or in the lingo of the tax code, effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, then on that income, they're going to be subject to the same graduated tax rates that apply to U.S. taxpayers. When it comes to passive investment income, nominally, that type of income is subject to tax at a flat rate of 30 percent on the gross amount of U.S.-sourced passive investment income.

But when it comes to that passive investment income, there are large gaps in that flat rate tax. For one, as we mentioned, capital gains from the sale of most U.S. investment assets, other than real estate, aren't taxed at all because they're not considered U.S.-source income. Also, interest from U.S. bank deposits, and most importantly, from U.S. portfolio debt, bonds, most other debt instruments, are also going to be exempt from U.S. taxation. And these two categories, capital gains and portfolio interest, account for the majority of passive income earned by foreign investors in the United States, and they're exempt from U.S. tax.

Kenneth Austin: Yeah. This is a bit I'm going to tread here on the tax part. But you can think of, if I own a Treasury bond, at the end of the year, I'm going to have some interest and a 1099 form. If I sell that bond to a German resident, then they get the interest on that bond, but it's disappeared from the U.S. tax base. And they pay nothing. And the U.S. isn't necessarily going to share the information with the German government that your resident or citizen earned this income on a U.S. bond. It's very hard for them to get it, and we made that system deliberate. Your choice is, ""OK, I could buy a German bond, but I'm going to pay interest on it. If I buy an American bond, I won't."" I could voluntarily pay some German taxes, but I may not.

If you look at, for example, a lot of Europe, you can find 40, 50, 60 percent marginal interest rates there. In the U.S., the worst you could do is pay the 30 percent withholding, but you don't have to. It's a much better deal from the tax point of view to put your money in the U.S. That is a result of U.S. policies designed to bring that money in. I think you can discuss what the politics is, but a lot of congressmen really believe that that money coming in is investment, in the sense it creates jobs and employee parking lots, when really it's just a bank deposit. What happens to that money after it gets here is anybody's guess, particularly the bankers.

Hillel Nadler: Just to add another wrinkle there, it's not just the statutory provisions of the code that offer favorable treatment, U.S. tax treatment, to foreign investment. The U.S. also has a network of bilateral tax treaties, which also exempt a lot of passive foreign investment from U.S. tax. But if you look at where financial inflows are coming, it's not just from those treaty countries. It's also from jurisdictions with which the U.S. doesn't have those bilateral tax treaties.

And that's because the other leg of the U.S. status as a tax haven, which is that the U.S., or U.S. financial institutions, can offer financial secrecy to their clients in a way that other jurisdictions can't, or other major economies and financial centers can't because other major economies signed up for the common reporting standard, which is reciprocal and provides for the automatic exchange of information between different jurisdictions and different tax authorities.

The U.S. has FATCA, which it adopted unilaterally, which provides the U.S. with a lot of information about U.S. taxpayers, but doesn't provide the same information to other jurisdictions and to other tax authorities. The U.S. financial institutions aren't required to collect and the U.S. isn't required to share information with other countries, for example, about the identity of controlling persons or beneficial owners of certain entities that are used to hold passive investments. Foreign investors can avoid tax reporting to their own tax authorities by holding U.S. accounts through U.S. entities, like LLCs or trusts, and things like that.

Kenneth Austin: If you'd spoke to the lobbyists behind a lot of these provisions, they'd say, ""We're just trying to prevent double taxation."" Double taxation isn't the issue. It's zero taxation.

If all the foreign financiers who bought these Treasury bonds paid tax somewhere, the full amount, particularly to their home government maybe in Denmark, or Switzerland, or Germany, they'd keep more of it at home, they'd be less inclined to bring it to the U.S. But the U.S. says, ""Bring it here, and there won't be double taxation. There won't any taxation.""

In some ways, double taxation might be unfortunate. But remember, nobody is forced to put their money somewhere else. They could always just keep it at home and pay their own taxes. They made a choice. Now I think one country collecting the tax makes sense. But to exempt these interest or other portfolio income from all taxes is a bit ridiculous. Since it's not symmetrical, it attracts more of that money here, which triggers a higher U.S. trade deficit.

David D. Stewart: It sounds like the policy of trying to get more money in was very effective. Maybe too effective. How would we go about unwinding that and making the U.S. less of a tax haven?

Kenneth Austin: We could theoretically eliminate the trade deficit overnight, but that would be a terrible idea. We want the economy to adjust. We don't want to shock it. We would have to rebuild an awful lot of factories and companies that were destroyed in the last 30 years. That would take time. Maybe four years, maybe 10 years. It's a guess now; we haven't started that project. We would want to do this gradually. Just gradually unwind this. We don't know how fast it would go, but as we get a little bit of experience, we should be able to do that. As long as we are, as I say, we want to do this carefully. It's not something we do overnight.

But during that period, we're going to be rebuilding all of these companies, all of these factories, and that will create a lot of jobs. That transition period will be a period of prosperity.

I'll let Hillel talk about how he would wind it down.

Hillel Nadler: Sure. I think, for starters, reversing some of these exemptions, the current exemptions for portfolio interest, for example, would be a first step towards making U.S. financial assets and foreign financial inflows less attractive. Providing reciprocal exchange of information so that, even if these foreign investors aren't paying tax in the U.S., we can at least help ensure that they're paying tax to their home governments.

But I do want to caution, our argument isn't that the only reason investors are holding U.S. financial assets is because of favorable tax treatment. There are a lot of reasons why someone outside the U.S. might want to hold a U.S. asset. This goes into the status of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, and all sorts of other reasons why people might want to hold U.S. financial assets. We just think the tax treatment is part of the picture. If we're trying to reduce foreign financial inflows, part of the solution is to start thinking about reversing some of the favorable tax treatment that foreign investors get.

Kenneth Austin: There are other things we could do. A few years ago, I think it was 2018, there was a bill introduced into the U.S. Senate, the Baldwin-Hawley Bill. That would have introduced, I think, the market access charge -- I think Hillel calls it a transactions tax -- which was a small payment every time you converted another currency into the dollar. Unfortunately, the bill went nowhere, but it was the right approach.

The thing is, you can't reduce the trade deficit by imposing tariffs. It doesn't work. It just results in same trade deficit, just at a more appreciated dollar. What you have to do is attenuate the financial inflows. I think ideally, we might want to bring those to zero. Now lots of people would still own dollars abroad, but they just on net wouldn't be buying more. If you got to that point, U.S. current account deficit, which is, as I said, a larger definition of the trade deficit, would go to zero.

David D. Stewart: The issue of extra money coming into this country doesn't seem to be something that is talked about as a negative. Why is it that you're viewing this as a negative, but we don't generally hear that from other people discussing the issue of trade imbalances?

Kenneth Austin: That's a very good question I ask myself. I say, ""Why am I one of the few economists that wants to do this?"" I am a retired Treasury economist, and nobody wanted to talk about it.

But I think part of it is, among mainstream economists, there seems to be an ideological taboo against this. One reason is mainstream economists hate the idea of what used to be called capital controls. It's still actually called capital controls, although once again, it's not little factories flowing across the world. It's just bank deposits.

They keep saying, ""Oh, well this is investment."" And actually, some pretty good economists confuse this flow of bank deposits with, they say, ""Real, productive capacity."" New factories, new electrical generation facilities, ships, transport, all this stuff. It's not. It's bank deposit. But by this verbal ambiguity, they convince themselves of it.

But they do know that this is really a question of financial flow. In 2016 Alan Blinder, who I think is probably almost the definition of mainstream esteemed economists, wrote an op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal on five important facts about trade. He said, ""A trade deficit isn't so bad because we're getting real goods and services, and the rest of the world is just getting our IOUs"" of bonds, stocks, corporate bonds, treasury bonds. ""It's just paper. It's just paper. Is that so bad?""

Well, that is ridiculous in the sense that it's something worthy of ridicule. And for an economist of his stature to say that, I don't even know if it's plausible he believes it. It's an astonishing thing to say. But I can give you other examples of economists just twisting themselves in knots, not to acknowledge that the U.S., if we stop borrowing -- the one exception that I find is when the other party holds the White House, then everybody comes really worried about the budget deficit, and blames all the borrowing and the budget deficit for the trade deficit. But that's not necessarily true.

When these large trade deficits began in the late '90s, the U.S. actually had a small fiscal surplus. But the rest of the world had the global savings glut. They just had a lot of money that they couldn't use at home. So it came here.

David D. Stewart: Well, this has been fascinating. Ken, Hillel, thank you so much for being here."
Trump's Tax Plan Will Be Fine,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanlewis/2024/10/08/trumps-tax-plan-will-be-fine/,2024-10-08T14:53:15Z,"The Great Depression got started with the passage of the Smoot Hawley Tariff in the United States, by the Republican Party, which immediately set off a cascade of retaliatory tariffs worldwide. This alone did not cause the Great Depression, but it did cause the initial downturn. This was followed by a long string of bad decisions in reaction to that downturn, such as Republican Herbert Hoover's 1932 tax increase which took the top income tax rate from 25% to 63%.

After World War Two, the whole world came to recognize that the Trade War of 1930 was a major contributor to the Great Depression. At the 1944 meeting in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, they began a long postwar movement toward Free Trade, with a proposal for an International Trade Organization, to go along with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank also established at the same time. The ITO was not passed, but evolved into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which then became the World Trade Organization in 1995.

Conservatives thus have some trepidation when they see a move by presidential candidate Donald Trump, representing the Economic Nationalist wing that includes Patrick Buchanan, move again toward tariffs and restrictions on trade. The reasons for this are well known, and include the corrosive effects on the US's middle class since China entered the WTO in 2001; or arguments that the US, as a continental superpower, needs to retain a large measure of self-sufficiency in key industries including electronics.

Tariffs are taxes; basically, they are a variant of sales taxes. Trump's proposals, mirroring those of Patrick Buchanan, are for a single-rate across-the-board universal tariff of 10% or perhaps later 20%, instead of the troublesome item-by-item and country-by-country approach of the past. This is actually no different than most countries in the world already have, as a component of their value-added-tax -- also of 10%-20% -- which also applies to imports.

Nevertheless, more taxes typically have a negative economic effect. This is offset, in the Trump proposals, with lower taxes on business.

The Corporate Income Tax rate would be lowered to 20% from 21%; possibly to 15% for businesses making their products in the US. This is the right idea, but certainly very small. A reduction in the Corporate Income Tax rate to 15% for everyone would be more effective at boosting the economy, and is not that far from the 19% corporate income tax rate now enjoyed by Britain. When you add Corporate taxes in some States, it would mirror Britain's rate. Forty-four States have their own Corporate taxes; the rate in Alaska, Illinois, Minnesota and New Jersey is nine percent or higher.

Much of the rest of Trump's tax proposals consist of extending his 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act -- which led to a noticeably stronger economy, particularly among the lower income brackets. Some tax technicians think that this would lead to some disastrous decline in revenue, compared to if the tax cuts were allowed to expire; but this assumes that these taxes would, in 2027, produce a much higher revenue/GDP figure than the exact same taxes produced before the reform, in 2016. The Congressional Budget Office thinks that revenue from the Individual Income Tax will reach 9.8% of GDP in 2027, with the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts -- a whopping 18% higher than the 8.3% actually received in 2016, before the TCJA, and a figure that has never been exceeded except for two years (2000 and 2022), when tax revenues were momentarily boosted by capital gains from huge stock market rises the year earlier. Not gonna happen.

My impression is that the smallish reductions in corporate tax rates would not provide much of an advantage, compared to the potential drag from higher tariffs, especially if they are matched with higher tariffs on US goods from other countries worldwide.

The best and easiest way to produce an economic advantage would be to eliminate all capital gains taxes. To this we could eliminate double-taxation of corporate income via dividends, which should be tax-free. An important distortion between debt and equity financing should be ameliorated by making corporate income taxable before interest, known as the ""VAT base."" Along with this, interest income should be untaxed at the personal level.

The main argument against eliminating capital gains taxes might be the categorization of some forms of income as capital gains. This is particularly true of investment funds. Income from fund management should be taxed as regular business income, when it is realized. This mirrors the tax treatment of employee stock options today, which are subject to the regular personal income tax (not capital gains) when they are exercised.

Many of the more successful countries in the world do not tax capital gains. These include Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Belgium, Germany, Malaysia, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Switzerland. It used to include Japan, which did not tax capital gains until 1989.

Trump also introduced the idea of a 60% flat-rate tariff on Chinese imports. Besides potentially providing relief for US workers from international wage competition, this is motivated by geopolitical concerns, with supply lines for key military and other industries compromised by dependence on Chinese and Taiwanese sources. Implementing such a plan would increase the need for more business and growth-friendly tax reductions elsewhere to compensate.

Trump even floated the idea of eliminating the Income Tax altogether, and replacing it with the Tariff as a revenue source. This was actually the regular state of affairs in the United States before the Sixteenth Amendment was passed in 1913. There was no Income Tax.

But, the Federal government was much smaller then. Today, a more realistic idea is to replace the Income Tax with a VAT, which is an indirect tax that resembles both the retail sales tax and various Flat Tax income tax proposals that have been made since the 1980s.

Since the flat-rate tariff is already an inherent part of the VAT found in most countries worldwide, I think Trump is testing the waters for a much more important reform -- eliminating the Federal Income Tax altogether, both Individual and Corporate, including a full repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment, and replacing it with a VAT, with a rate of probably around 15%.

For many decades, we've avoided the VAT because we don't want to have an income tax and VAT together, like high-tax European socialist governments. But, adopting a VAT is the best way to replace the income tax.

This resembles the ""FairTax"" national sales tax proposal popular among conservatives, but would be much better in my view. The VAT is a proven and effective system worldwide, while retail sales tax rates above 10% have been problematic. Replacing the problematic and destructive Income Tax with a VAT is actually the solution offered by President George W. Bush's economic advisor Lawrence Lindsey, in his 2013 book The Growth Experiment Revisited.

In the nineteenth century, the United States had high tariffs, domestic excise taxes (sales taxes), and no income tax. It was the most successful country of that century."
How Immigration Can Become A Strategic Solution For U.S. Housing Needs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2024/10/08/how-immigration-can-become-a-strategic-solution-for-us-housing-needs/,2024-10-08T13:11:57Z,"As the United States grapples with housing shortages, the influx of migrants and homelessness, the need for innovative, scalable, and humane solutions has never been more urgent. Traditional housing approaches prioritizing permanent solutions, often miss the mark. Whether it is young people seeking to buy their first home, individuals moving to new cities, immigrants who have just landed, migrants shuttled to a new state, or unsheltered homeless people in California, a flexible and forward-thinking housing model is essential. And Immigration may be able to contribute to such a solution.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have made housing a key issue in the current presidential race. Vice President Harris promises to ""cut the red tape that stops housing construction, take on corporate landlords hiking rental prices, work with builders and developers to construct 3 million new homes and rentals, and help first-time homebuyers with $25,000 down payment assistance."" On the other hand, President Trump focuses on deregulation, proposing the opening of federal land for housing development and reducing regulatory hurdles to speed up construction. He opposes rent controls and aims to preserve single-family zoning, framing it as protecting suburban communities.

While these proposals target housing shortages through construction and regulatory reform, neither candidate has sufficiently focused on a critical opportunity: using immigration policy to address U.S. housing needs.

When Congress passed the Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 (RIA) to reform the EB-5 investor immigration program, it created three priority areas for EB-5 funding: high unemployment areas, infrastructure, and rural development. The EB-5 program enables foreign investors to obtain U.S. residency by investing in job-creating projects. Historically, the program has been used for commercial developments, luxury housing, and large-scale projects. However, expanding the EB-5 program to include affordable housing projects could significantly benefit U.S. cities facing severe housing shortages. By directing foreign capital into affordable housing developments, investor immigration could become a key component in solving the U.S. housing crisis. What is proposed here is to add housing to the EB-5 program as a fourth priority. This expansion would encourage foreign investors to channel their investments into developments in cities with the most pressing housing needs, such as affordable apartments in urban centers or temporary housing for new migrants in need of immediate shelter.

To further enhance the program, the U.S. could introduce an Expression of Interest (EOI) system for selecting such EB-5 investors. Such a system is currently in use in Canada, for example, to avoid long backlogs in processing of applications. The system would allow the government to pre-select investors based on factors such as their language proficiency, integration potential, ties to the U.S., and the urgency of housing needs in specific areas. By prioritizing high-quality investors who align with U.S. housing goals, the government can ensure that projects are completed efficiently and in a timely manner. This approach adds flexibility, allowing the U.S. to target investors who are not only financially capable but also committed to contributing to the communities they are entering while preventing frustrating backlogs.

Apart from helping young people looking to buy their first homes and people moving across the country to locate a house they can afford, expanding the EB-5 program for housing, together with some innovative programs we will mention shortly, would also help ensure that migrants and refugees arriving in the U.S. have access to adequate living conditions as they settle into new communities. This approach could reduce the pressure on cities and states already struggling with limited housing availability and strained public resources.

As migrants and refugees continue to arrive in the U.S., the availability of immediate, safe housing is critical to their successful integration. Cities that experience sudden surges in migrant populations often face a severe shortage of affordable housing, leaving many new arrivals without a place to live. Traditional housing models, focused on permanent homes, can take years to develop, and temporary shelters are often overcrowded and unsafe.

A more flexible housing model is needed to address these immediate needs. The U.S. could adopt innovative solutions like those used by Dignity Moves, a California-based nonprofit that provides interim housing for homeless individuals. Dignity Moves constructs affordable, dignified prefabricated units on vacant or underutilized land, providing private, lockable spaces for individuals in need of temporary shelter. This approach could be adapted to house migrants and refugees, offering them a safe place to live while they go through the immigration process and work towards more permanent housing.

To make these solutions work, public-private partnerships will be essential. Local governments, private investors, and nonprofits must work together to ensure that new housing is built quickly and affordably. As already mentioned, the EB-5 program can serve as a key funding mechanism by incentivizing foreign investors to contribute to affordable housing projects in exchange for U.S. residency. Local governments can further support these efforts by offering tax incentives, zoning benefits, and streamlined permitting processes to developers focused on affordable housing. Additionally, philanthropic organizations and corporate social responsibility initiatives can play a role by providing grants and operational support to nonprofits working on innovative housing solutions.

The U.S. housing crisis demands bold and innovative solutions that go beyond traditional construction and regulation reforms. By integrating immigration programs like EB-5 with innovative housing development programs like those mentioned and incorporating an Expression of Interest system to select the most suitable investors, the U.S. can address both the immediate housing needs of migrants and refugees and the broader national shortage of affordable housing while avoiding long immigration backlogs. This could be a game-changing approach to solving the problem involving creative partnerships between governments, private investors, and nonprofits -- all working together to ensure that everyone, from young couples buying their first home, to newly arrived migrants, to homeless people, has a place to call home."
JPMorgan Has Quietly Tipped Bitcoin For A $7.5 Trillion Donald Trump And Federal Reserve Price Earthquake,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/08/jpmorgan-has-quietly-tipped-bitcoin-for-a-75-trillion-donald-trump-and-federal-reserve-price-earthquake/,2024-10-08T12:52:10Z,"Bitcoin has rocketed higher this year as perfect storm of Wall Street adoption, Federal Reserve rate cuts and surprise support from former president Donald Trump drive a price boom -- with further ""fireworks"" predicted.

The bitcoin price shot past its previous all-time high of over £70,000 per bitcoin this year before dropping back to around $60,000 as the U.S. and China begin what could become a crypto cold war.

Now, as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk warns the U.S. could collapse under the weight of its $35 trillion debt pile, JPMorgan analysts have predicted a so-called ""debasement trade"" could fuel a bitcoin price boom going into the U.S. election -- with Trump expected to add $7.5 trillion to U.S. debt.

""Rising geopolitical tensions and the coming U.S. election are likely to reinforce what some investors call the 'debasement trade' thus favoring both gold and bitcoin,"" JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients seen by Marketwatch.

Gold and bitcoin could be boosted by ""persistently high government deficits across major economies, to waning confidence in fiat currencies in certain emerging markets, and to a broader diversification away from the dollar,"" according to the analysts who said a Trump election win would likely reinforce the debasement trade.

Trump is forecast to increase the federal debt by around twice the increase expected if Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris is elected, according to a report from the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Trump would raise federal debt by $7.5 trillion by 2035 if he retakes the White House next month while vice president Harris is estimated to increase the debt by $3.5 trillion over the same period.

U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures.

JPMorgan analysts later wrote the bitcoin price has ""yet to see the 'pop' ... expected from lower rates since the Fed's September 18 cut,"" predicting in a note seen by The Block that the market may be waiting for more sustained stability before making a major move.

Despite Tesla billionaire Elon Musk's concerns about the out-of-control U.S. debt pile, causing him to warn last week the U.S. could collapse into ""bankruptcy,"" Musk has doubled down on his endorsement of Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of the first assassination attempt on Trump in July.

Trump now leads Harris by almost three percentage points in the crypto-powered Polymarket's election contract, with 52% to 46%.

Meanwhile, billionaire investor Mark Cuban has teased a plan floated by Trump to pay off U.S. national debt with bitcoin or crypto -- and the Doge Department of Government Efficiency backed by Musk.

""We don't know what Elon would actually do,"" Cuban said during an appearance on the All-In Podcast alongside fellow investors David Friedberg, Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis and David Sacks, responding to a question about how the U.S. could begin to tackle its huge debt pile.

""Maybe [he'll] put doge in the Treasury, who knows, and that's how we make it all up,"" Cuban joked, referring to Elon Musk's on-again-off-again relationship with the meme-based bitcoin rival dogecoin.

Earlier this year, Trump floated the possibility of using bitcoin to pay off the U.S.'s $35 trillion debt pile.

"" Crypto is a very interesting thing,"" Trump told Fox Business in August. ""Maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion, hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our $35 trillion."""
Markets In The Balance: Election Impact Hinges On Sweep Or Gridlock,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreyschulze/2024/10/08/markets-in-the-balance-election-impact-hinges-on-sweep-or-gridlock/,2024-10-08T12:40:55Z,"I write about financial market trends and recession risk indicators.

With a month to go before election day, the presidential race remains tight with Kamala Harris maintaining a slight lead over Donald Trump. Based on the prediction markets, the two most likely outcomes are either a Republican sweep or a Harris presidency with a divided government. This is due to races for the Senate favoring the Republicans.

Different presidential and congressional configurations will dictate how much legislation can be passed and ultimately how much an effect politics will have on stocks and the economy. A sweep scenario can lead to drastic changes in tax and spending policies. With a divided government, regulation and trade policy will come into play, because those are the areas where the president can act unilaterally.

Taxes

The new president will face a unique tax situation because major elements of the TCJA, the Trump tax cuts, are sunsetting in 2025. If nothing is done, almost every taxpayer will see a higher average tax rate. This should act as an incentive from both sides of the aisle to negotiate and extend some of these expiring provisions.

Kamala Harris recently released tax proposals to dramatically increase the tax rates on corporations and high-income households while leaving most Americans taxes unchanged, promising to protect households making under $400,000 from higher taxes. Her tax goals are unlikely to become reality, however, unless the Democrats retain control of the Senate and flip the House of Representatives.

Meanwhile Donald Trump would likely prioritize extension of the TCJA, including reinstating individual provisions that expired, including business depreciation allowances such as immediate expensing for equipment, property and research and development.

Regulation

From a regulatory standpoint, Harris is focused on prescription drugs, more affordable housing, a higher minimum wage, lower grocery costs and a supportive stance toward clean energy. She has also talked about accelerating Medicare negotiations on more drugs and cracking down on pharmacy benefit managers, creating more risk in health care.

Trump significantly dialed back regulation in his first term. Most of the former president's efforts on the deregulation front will likely be focused on labor, education, the environment and health care, with a slowdown in the transition to EVs. Energy production and fracking in particular should increase. A potential negative, at least from a labor market perspective, is more stringent immigration policies, which could hurt labor-intensive companies.

It's worth noting, however, that the expected election outcomes due to regulation are usually very different from what ends up occurring. The consensus thought energy would thrive under the Trump administration, yet it was one of the worst-performing sectors in his four years. Under Obama, health care was expected to be a tough sector, but it performed well on a relative basis. So, it's important not to read too much into higher regulation and what the impacts will be for these sectors.

Trade

Harris is expected to mostly maintain the status quo on trade policy from the Biden administration. Changes are expected to be more surgical compared to the broad brush approach Trump has discussed. Harris would likely remain firm on China to protect industries like solar and semiconductors.

From a Trump perspective, we expect a repeat of what we saw under his first term. He is proposing two types of tariffs: a 10% across the board tariff on all imported goods and increases on Chinese tariffs to 60%. According to a Tax Foundation analysis, a 10% tariff and retaliation from U.S. trading partners would be expected to contract the economy by 1%. From a trade perspective, equities would face more headwinds under Trump while a Harris win would continue the status quo.

Fiscal Spending

The most bipartisan view right now is that government spending will keep growing. Neither candidate wants to rein in spending. Deficits are forecast to be in the 6%-7% of GDP range for the foreseeable future and potentially even higher in a sweep scenario where more legislation gets passed. Harris would prioritize spending on health care, housing, childcare, clean energy and infrastructure.

Trump is expected to keep spending focused on defense and infrastructure. The fiscal thrust from a Republican administration will come in the form of tax cuts, while the Democrats will likely lead with more spending. We expect such policies to boost the economy in either scenario.

Impacts of a Trump Victory

In aggregate, we view a second Trump presidency under a sweep scenario as net positive for equities. The expectation is for a more favorable corporate tax regime and less of a regulatory burden, both of which should boost corporate profits. Conversely, there is the potential for increased tariffs and retaliation from U.S. trade partners. A gridlock scenario where the House is under Democratic control would be mildly negative as fewer provisions of expiring tax legislation would get extended.

We view U.S. stocks as best placed under Trump, with banks and capital markets, as well as the oil and gas complex, well positioned due to lighter regulation. Aerospace and defense is also likely going to benefit as well as biopharmaceuticals.

Impacts of a Harris Victory

We see a Harris win as mildly negative to equities should she preside over a divided Congress. It will be more of a headwind to the markets should we see a Democratic sweep as she will then be able to implement higher taxes on corporations and high-income individuals, as well as push a more ambitious regulatory agenda. However, tax credits for low-income individuals would provide an offset, creating an economic boost to this segment of the economy.

Tighter regulation could weigh on biopharmaceuticals, banks, capital markets, energy as well as mega cap technology. Areas to be bullish about under Harris would be consumer discretionary, specifically restaurants & leisure, home building and building products.

It's easy to categorize each candidate as bullish or bearish, but markets have gone up regardless of the party in control. In our view, economic momentum will be a bigger driver of equities over the medium to long term."
Hurricane Milton Now 'Extremely Dangerous Category 4' En Route To Florida -- Here's What To Know,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/08/hurricane-milton-now-extremely-dangerous-category-4-en-route-to-florida-heres-what-to-know/,2024-10-08T12:39:24Z,"Hurricane Milton has been downgraded to a Category 4 hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico but was still described by the National Hurricane Center as ""extremely dangerous"" Tuesday morning as it barrels toward the Florida Gulf coast, less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene killed at least 20 people in the state before causing devastating flooding across parts of the southeastern U.S.

""I can say this without any dramatization whatsoever. If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you are going to die,"" Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told CNN.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Saturday declared a state of emergency for 35 counties, including all of the Tampa Bay area, and warned of a ""flurry"" of evacuation orders. According to the Associated Press, Milton could trigger the biggest spate of evacuation orders in the state since 2017's Hurricane Irma -- where 7 million people were urged to leave their homes. Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, ordered evacuations for areas near Tampa Bay and for all mobile and manufactured homes by Tuesday night. Lee County, home to Fort Meyers, issued a mandatory evacuation order for the island of Fort Myers Beach. Other mandatory evacuation orders have been issued in Pinellas County, Pasco County and Manatee County. Volusia County has issued a curfew and enacted evacuation orders starting Wednesday morning and Marion County is under a mandatory evacuation order for mobile homes, RVs, and modular-type homes.

Tampa International Airport will close at 9 a.m. Tuesday with plans to reopen ""as soon as it is safe"" later this week. Major U.S. airlines, including American, Delta, Southwest, United and JetBlue, are issuing travel waivers that will allow passengers flying through impacted airports to rebook without paying far differences. American Airlines' travel alert covers 12 airports in Florida, Delta's covers nine and Frontier covers eight. United Airlines' advisory covers travel to and from only five airports -- Key West, Orlando, Fort Myers, Sarasota/Bradenton and Tampa.

There is no such thing as a Category 6 hurricane. The National Hurricane Center uses the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale to classify storms, which ranks only up to a Category 5 and defines those storms as having sustained winds at or greater than 157 mph. Earlier this year, researchers with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Space Science and Engineering Center argued for adding a sixth storm category as climate change continues to intensify weather events. Under their proposal, Category 5 hurricanes would be redefined to encompass storms with sustained wind speeds between 157 and 192 mph and a new Category 6 would describe storms with wind speeds above 192 mph.

Milton is expected to arrive less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene, a major Category 4 storm, hit Florida on Sept. 26. Helene was the hardest hit for the Tampa Bay area from a hurricane in 103 years, according to the Associated Press. Despite staying offshore, Helene inundated parts of the area with several feet of storm surge. At least 20 people died in Florida from the storm, which then traveled 500 miles across the Southeastern U.S. and caused heavy flooding in the Carolinas, Georgia, Virginia and Tennessee. At least 230 people across six states died as a result of the hurricane, which was the deadliest to hit the continental U.S. since Katrina in 2005. Helene made landfall near Perry, Florida, approximately 160 miles north of Tampa, with winds of 140 mph before it was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved northward.

Milton will be the fifth hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. this year, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts 2024 will be one of the busiest hurricane seasons on record, estimating 8 to 13 hurricanes and between 4 and 7 major hurricanes.

Forbes recently spoke with Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and an alternate member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which votes on the target federal funds rate. The Fed began hiking rates in March 2022, and then raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to over 5% -- the fastest interest rate increase in four decades.

Looking ahead to the second half of the decade, Goolsbee is keeping a close eye on growth in productivity, which he said would support an expanding economy without inflation.

Despite losses for its big tech peers, Nvidia's stock rallied Monday, leading it to eclipse Microsoft as the second-largest company in the world amid the AI boom. Nvidia registered its highest market cap since August at $3.19 trillion, trailing only Apple, valued at $3.4 trillion.

Influencers are touting egg donation as a cash cow to millions of followers on the internet. But while social media is helping to destigmatize fertility problems and procedures, some donor-conceived people and experts say the vast majority of content that lures donors with big payouts is doing more harm than good.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 suffered their worst days since early September following two new hurdles for investors that threaten to increase the cost of doing business and cut into profit margins. Crude oil prices and government bond yields, which influence borrowing costs as many loans are benchmarked against Treasury notes, both moved to multiweek highs Monday.

Andreessen Horowitz cofounder Ben Horowitz tweeted that he and his wife will make a ""significant"" donation to Vice President Kamala Harris, a notable reversal of his previous support for former President Donald Trump. Still, Horowitz said Harris' campaign has yet to formally state its intentions with their tech policies and that the ""Biden Administration has been exceptionally destructive on tech policy across the industry.""

Vice President Kamala Harris defended her economic plan in an interview with 60 Minutes on Monday, predicting Congress will go along with paying for her agenda, as the nominee has already called for an ""opportunity economy"" focused on the middle class and released plans that include lowering grocery and prescription drug prices and addressing the housing crisis. Harris' economic plan would increase the federal deficit by $3.5 trillion through 2035, according to an estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

One of Donald Trump's prized properties, the landmark building 40 Wall Street, now appears underwater. The remaining 35 years on Trump's leasehold in the Financial District tower is worth about $116 million, which is $2 million less than the estimated $118 million Trump owes on his mortgage, according to a Forbes analysis.

The Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge brought by social network X on Monday, after the Elon Musk-owned company sued the federal government for forcing it to turn over information about former President Donald Trump to Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team. Prosecutors asked the company, formerly known as Twitter, to sign a non-disclosure agreement barring them from informing Trump or his associates about the warrant.

As Hurricane Milton, now a Category 4 storm, is slated to make landfall in Florida this week, major U.S. airlines are issuing travel waivers allowing passengers flying in or out of impacted airports to rebook without paying the fare difference. Even if you're not traveling through Florida this week, your flight may be impacted, so monitor your airline's app for flight notifications.

The Supreme Court's new term kicked off Monday, and the justices are slated to hear cases on major issues like guns, transgender rights, vaping and environmental impact studies. The nation's highest court is likely to add a number of other key cases to its docket, including former President Donald Trump's criminal cases and challenges to the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness relief efforts.

TOPLINE Phoenix Capital Group, founded in 2019, says it's an oil and gas company, specializing in acquiring mineral rights and drilling independently. But its core competency seems to be raising funds from yield-hungry investors.

Mostly through advertising run on conservative radio shows like The Sean Hannity Show and webinars which it holds daily, founder Adam Ferrari reports that Phoenix has so far raised $700 million of a planned $750 million private high yield bond offering. Some 95% of its sales, says Matt Willer, head of Capital Markets, are to people above the age of 55, with half of the funds coming from 401(k)s and IRAs.

Phoenix is one of a growing number of little-known financial firms taking advantage of Congress's Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2012, which enabled companies to more easily sell unregistered securities, otherwise known as private placements, directly to individual investors.

From 2009 through 2020, $15 trillion of so-called Reg D offerings were sold, according to a 2023 study by SLCG Economic Consulting. During the same time period, fully SEC registered offerings, of stocks, bonds and ETFs trading on exchanges, tallied $16.4 trillion in sales.

As the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) movement gained traction, many banks and large institutional investors began withdrawing from fossil fuels, citing environmental concerns. This opened a window for sellers of unregistered securities, especially those with enticing offerings like Phoenix and its oil bonds yielding as much as 13%.

WHY IT MATTERS ""The private placement market is booming, offering a fast track for companies to raise capital,"" says Forbes senior reporter Brandon Kochkodin. ""Phoenix Capital Group has tapped into this trend, drawing mom-and-pop investors to its debt with promises of high yields and the opportunity to create 'generational wealth.' Yet, a recent deal between Phoenix and Fortress Investment Group, a Wall Street behemoth, suggests that smaller investors might not be getting paid enough interest for the risk they're taking.""

A lack of response, or ""ghosting,"" can be frustrating in the workplace, especially when it comes from your boss. First, assess whether their absence is out of character, and if so, give them leeway. Ensure your communication is concise and prioritized, establish regular check-ins and keep a detailed record of your communication attempts. If the behavior becomes a chronic issue, consider seeking advice on potential solutions from a mentor or senior leader.

Cybersecurity Risks: When AI Becomes A Tool For Evil,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2024/10/08/cybersecurity-risks-when-ai-becomes-a-tool-for-evil/,2024-10-08T11:22:05Z,"October marks Cybersecurity Awareness Month, a perfect moment to explore one of the most pressing challenges facing our digital world today: artificial intelligence being used as a weapon. The staggering power of AI and Large Language Models like GPT-4 has the potential to transform industries. But as with any powerful tool, it can be misused, and in the wrong hands, AI can become a cybercriminal's greatest asset. From deepfakes to phishing attacks and election interference, malicious actors are leveraging AI to wreak havoc on organizations and individuals alike.

This is the new frontier of cybersecurity -- an arms race where we're not just battling hackers, but also battling AI-powered machines that can think, adapt, and innovate faster than ever before.

Let's not mince words: AI is being weaponized. While the world marvels at how AI can write essays, code, and even compose music, hackers are using these very capabilities for far more sinister purposes. Election tampering, phishing schemes, and sophisticated man-in-the-middle attacks are just the beginning of how AI is being misused.

One of the most frightening examples is the rise of deepfakes -- hyper-realistic video and audio forgeries that can make it look and sound like anyone is saying anything. Deepfakes have already been weaponized to discredit political figures and spread disinformation. Recently, deepfakes of former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris went viral, spreading false messages that could have had real-world consequences. These AI-generated fabrications are blurring the line between reality and fiction, undermining trust and destabilizing our information ecosystem.

But it's not just deepfakes. AI is also being used to generate convincing phishing schemes. Remember when phishing emails used to be easy to spot with their broken English and suspicious links? That's no longer the case. With LLMs, hackers can create phishing emails so sophisticated they look like they were penned by your CEO. One notable case involved an LLM-generated email that impersonated a company's C-suite, successfully convincing an employee to transfer millions to a fraudulent account. By the time the scam was uncovered, the money had vanished, and the company was left reeling from the financial and reputational blow.

Perhaps even more concerning is how AI is being used to automate and scale attacks. AI tools can scan codebases and infrastructure setups at lightning speed, identifying vulnerabilities faster than any human ever could. In ransomware attacks, for instance, AI-driven automation allows hackers to deploy encryption faster than traditional security teams can react. This speed makes it nearly impossible to prevent the damage once an attack is in motion, leaving businesses locked out of their systems with no choice but to pay up or face the consequences.

It's easy to feel like we're losing the battle, but the good news is that AI is also our greatest defense. Just as hackers are using AI to attack, we can use it to help us defend against AI generated threats.

The most advanced AI-enhanced threat detection systems are learning to identify threats in real-time. These tools can process vast amounts of data in seconds, identifying patterns and anomalies that signal an impending attack. Unlike traditional security measures that rely on predefined rules, AI-powered systems learn and adapt, making them far more effective at catching new, never-before-seen threats.

AI-powered cybersecurity systems and automated monitoring agents are increasingly leveraging machine learning to detect subtle shifts in network behavior, flagging suspicious activity before it escalates into a full-blown attack. In a world where split-second delays can lead to devastating consequences, these AI-driven systems provide the speed necessary to respond swiftly and effectively, preventing hackers from inflicting serious damage.

Another powerful defensive use of AI is in endpoint protection, where AI analyzes device behavior rather than relying solely on predefined attack signatures. This approach enables AI to identify brand-new, previously unseen attacks based on abnormal patterns of behavior, stopping threats before they can do harm. These tools are particularly critical for defending against zero-day exploits, which target vulnerabilities that have yet to be discovered by traditional security systems.

AI is not going away. In fact, its influence will only grow. As cybersecurity professionals, we must accept that AI is here to stay -- and so too are the evolving threats. But there's a silver lining: By leveraging AI for defense, we can stay ahead of the hackers who use it for harm. However, success will not come from AI alone. It requires the collaboration of trained cybersecurity professionals working in tandem with AI. Human expertise combined with AI's speed and precision forms a powerful defense capable of adapting to new, sophisticated attacks. The key is constant vigilance, innovation, and an unwavering commitment to ethical standards.

This October, as we celebrate Cybersecurity Awareness Month, let's remind ourselves of the stakes. Cybersecurity has always been a battle of minds, but now it's also a battle of machines. As long as AI continues to evolve, the arms race will only intensify. Our challenge is to stay one step ahead -- combining the power of AI with human expertise -- before AI becomes a tool for evil."
What To Know About Kamala Harris' Economic Agenda As She Claims Congress Will Pay For It,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/07/what-to-know-about-kamala-harris-economic-agenda-as-she-claims-congress-will-pay-for-it/,2024-10-08T01:20:44Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris defended her economic plan in an interview with ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, predicting Congress will go along with paying for her agenda, as the nominee has already called for an ""opportunity economy"" focused on the middle class and released plans that include lowering grocery and prescription drug prices and addressing the housing crisis.

Harris was asked about how she'd pay for her economic plan in her ""60 Minutes"" interview on Monday, with correspondent Bill Whitaker noting that while she wants to make the richest Americans pay more taxes, ""We're dealing with the real world here."" Harris expressed optimism that Congress will be willing to pass her economic agenda, arguing, ""When you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about, 'cause their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about."" The vice president disagreed with Whitaker saying Congress ""has shown no inclination"" to back her economic plans, saying she knows ""the limitations of government"" and claiming, ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

$3.5 trillion. That's how much Harris' economic plan would increase the federal deficit by through 2035, according to an estimate released Monday by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget -- still far smaller than the $7.5 trillion Trump's plan would cost. The organization noted its estimate is subject to a ""wide range of uncertainty,"" and actual figures could range anywhere from not having any impact on the deficit to costing $8.1 trillion at most.

""I am a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets,"" Harris declared at a September event hosted by the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, pushing back against her opponent Trump's attacks classifying Harris as a ""communist.""

Harris told CNN host Dana Bash in an August interview that her priority on ""Day One"" as president would be to start implementing her economic agenda. The vice president said one of her ""highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class,"" arguing that while she believes the Biden administration has done ""good work"" on the economy, ""there's more to do.""

Harris' economic policy agenda is largely in line with Biden's economic platform, with some tweaks to emphasize causes that are more important to her, like the child tax credit. ""Same values, different vision,"" a Harris aide told The Guardian. ""She's not moving far away from him on substance, she will highlight the ones that matter most to her."" The initial plans from Harris' campaign also suggest the vice president plans to be more aggressive in her policy approaches than Biden, however, as polls have suggested voters hold dim views of how the president has handled the economy. While Biden has also opposed price gouging, Harris' proposal to enable the FTC and U.S. attorneys to go after companies that hike up prices goes beyond what the president has proposed, Politico notes, and her proposed $40 million investment in the housing crisis is double the amount the Biden administration spent.

Harris' economic agenda so far hasn't gone fully in depth about her proposals, which The New York Times reports is by design. The Times reported before Harris unveiled her agenda that the Harris campaign has adopted a ""strategic vagueness"" for her economic proposals, believing that being more of a ""blank slate"" will help ward off attacks and attract more support from business groups.

Trump's economic agenda is largely focused on raising tariffs on imported goods, which Harris has said she opposes. The ex-president has also called for cutting taxes and regulations in hopes of lowering inflation, including lowering the corporate tax rate, and has encouraged increasing oil production in order to lower energy prices. In addition to his ""no tax on tips"" proposal that Harris has also endorsed, Trump has called for ending taxes on Social Security benefits, which Harris has not yet responded to. Experts believe the ex-president's proposal could speed up Social Security and Medicare becoming insolvent, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projecting exempting taxes on benefits would result in Social Security and Medicare receiving $1.6 trillion less in revenue between 2026 and 2035. The Trump campaign opposed reports of Harris' economic proposals in September, with spokesperson Steven Cheung saying in a statement, ""Kamala Harris can't hide from her disastrous record of skyrocketing inflation ... Americans are struggling under the Biden-Harris economy, and now she wants to gaslight them into believing her bald-faced lies.""

41%. That's the share of voters who trust Harris more to handle the economy, according to an Associated Press/NORC poll conducted Sept. 12-16, versus 43% who trust Trump more. While Trump still maintains a narrow lead, recent polling has broadly shown voters are warming up to Harris on the economy, with polls on who voters prefer on the issue going from being strongly in Trump's favor to more of a toss up. A Washington Post analysis of five recent polls found that while Trump still leads on the economy by an average of six points, that's narrowed from a 12-point lead that the ex-president held against Biden before the president dropped out of the race.

Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in July after Biden stepped down suddenly from the presidential race, following weeks of pressure over mounting concerns about his mental fitness. While the vice president has quickly garnered Democrats' support and risen in the polls, Harris released few concrete policy proposals in the first few weeks of her campaign -- drawing some criticism as a result. The vice president has made releasing a platform on economic proposals her first priority, delivering a speech earlier in August laying out her economic platform that marked the most substantive remarks she had given on policy so far. Her focus on the economy comes as polling has repeatedly shown it's the most important issue to voters in this election cycle, with the vice president hoping to attract support amid low approval ratings for Biden's handling of the economy. Harris' August 16 speech also came days after news that inflation fell in July to its lowest point in more than three years, with federal data showing inflation at 2.9% in July, the first time it's been below 3% since March 2021."

Harris supports enacting gun control restrictions including universal background checks, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and implementing ""red flag"" laws that take guns away from people who are a danger to themselves or others. The candidate's website also notes she would invest in law enforcement to help combat gun violence and expand existing gun violence prevention programs.

Harris' ""60 Minutes"" interview came as the vice president has faced criticism from the media and Trump campaign for not doing more major interviews since becoming the Democratic nominee. Harris has sat down for an increasing number of outlets and podcasters as the election nears, however, speaking with CNN, local media and the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast among others. Polls continue to show the two candidates are neck-and-neck even as the Harris campaign has garnered a commanding lead in its fundraising, and Harris was asked about her policy positions Monday as the candidate has faced criticism for not being specific enough about her platform.

""60 Minutes"" told viewers it also invited Trump to sit down for an interview, but the ex-president backed out after initially agreeing to participate. The Trump campaign gave ""shifting reasons"" for canceling, correspondent Scott Pelley told viewers Monday, including objecting to the program's fact checking and demanding an apology for Trump's ""60 Minutes"" interview in 2020. Harris responded to Trump's cancellation in her interview with the program, saying, ""If he is not gonna give your viewers the ability to have a meaningful, thoughtful conversation, question and answer with you, then watch his rallies."" ""You're gonna hear conversations that are about himself and all of his personal grievances,"" Harris said, arguing that voters won't hear ""anything about you."""
Trump's Election Odds Spike On Polymarket As Musk Touts Election Betting Site,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/07/trumps-election-odds-spike-on-polymarket-as-musk-touts-election-betting-site/,2024-10-07T23:00:26Z,"Odds on one notable presidential election betting platform shifted majorly in former President Donald Trump's favor Monday, much to the delight of the world's richest man Elon Musk, though odd movements on other sites offering wagers were far less drastic.

What caused the swing in Trump's favor on Polymarket. Some social media users noted the movement came as one anonymous user by the name ""Fredi9999"" upped his bets on a Trump win to over $4 million. Polymarket does not limit individual bettors like PredictIt ($850 limit) or Kalshi ($25,000) as it operates as an ""offshore"" book and does not face the same federal regulations. So, it's possible that Trump's odds shifted on Polymarket as it was the result of buying activity from one or a handful of big-ticket bettors rather than a material shift in the election landscape.

Musk, who endorsed Trump in July and appeared at a rally with the Republican candidate Saturday, shared several posts on his X social media platform touting the Polymarket shift. Musk shared a post connecting the jump to his appearance at Trump's Pennsylvania rally, wrote betting odds are ""more accurate than polls as actual money is on the line"" and reposted a screenshot touting the ""collapse"" of Harris' election odds.

National polls show Harris holds a slight lead over Trump, and FiveThirtyEight puts Harris' odds of securing enough electoral votes for a victory at 55%.

""Polymarket effectively takes what otherwise would be an Internet yelling match and turns that into a market where the person who's right wins,"" Polymarket founder Shayne Coplan told Forbes in July."
Could Republican Ties To X Impact Voters? Here's What Experts Say As Trump Outspends Harris On The Site.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/10/07/could-republican-ties-to-x-impact-voters-heres-what-experts-say-as-trump-outspends-harris-on-the-site/,2024-10-07T21:40:26Z,"Elon Musk's X has become a major outlet for Republican campaigning as the party targets the site with ads, reportedly spending double that of Democrats on the platform amid Musk's endorsement of former president Donald Trump, which experts say won't swing undecided voters but is a strong way to boost campaigns from party members directly.

Democrats have outspent Republicans on digital ads by millions, and they have been outspending since early August, according to data analytics platform AdImpact, as reported by the Post. Democrats have focused spending on tech platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, according to the Post. Vice President Kamala Harris has not bought an ad on X, and Nu Wexler, a political strategist, told the Washington Post that Democrats don't view it as their audience.

Donald Trump -- the biggest buyer of political ads on X, according to the Washington Post -- has fueled an alliance with Musk in recent months. The billionaire Tesla founder publicly endorsed Trump in July after an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania. Musk has posted in support of the Republican candidate several times since and said he is committing tens of millions monthly to a pro-Trump super PAC. As Musk imprints his politics on the site, the uptick in Republican ad spending also represents a big shift in the platform from 2019 when it banned political ads and sought to retain nonpartisan governance, Kreiss said. In August, Musk hosted Trump on the platform to discuss political topics. Trump has said he plans to ""create a government efficiency commission tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government,"" mentioning that Musk has agreed to potentially lead the program. Musk sealed his July endorsement on Saturday by attending a rally in Pennsylvania -- his first time at a campaign event.

On Monday, Musk said his America PAC, the pro-Trump group he primarily funds, will pay $47 for each time someone refers a registered swing state voter to sign a petition to ""support for free speech and the right to bear arms"" in his latest attempt to boost support for Trump. The petition has a goal of 1 million signatures."
Kamala Harris' 'Call Her Daddy' Appearance Divides Podcast Host Alex Cooper's Listeners,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/07/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-appearance-divides-podcast-host-alex-coopers-listeners/,2024-10-07T19:54:16Z,"Podcast host Alex Cooper interviewed Vice President Kamala Harris on her popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, Spotify's second-biggest podcast which has a large audience of women listeners, drawing criticism from some of Cooper's conservative-leaning listeners.

""Call Her Daddy"" has ranked as Spotify's second-biggest podcast, only behind Joe Rogan's ""Joe Rogan Experience,"" for the past two years. Spotify also says it is the biggest podcast for women on its platform. ""Call Her Daddy"" ranked as the fourth-biggest podcast across all platforms for the second quarter of 2024, according to Edison Research, behind Rogan, ""Crime Junkie"" and The New York Times' ""The Daily."" Cooper also has a significant social media following, with 2.4 million followers on her ""Call Her Daddy"" Instagram account and 3.9 million followers on the podcast's TikTok. Cooper regularly hosts high-profile celebrity guests on her podcast, including Simone Biles, Post Malone and Katy Perry. Cooper has also raised her podcast's profile through media appearances, including a stint as a host at the Paris Olympic Games this summer for NBC. Her podcast has been highly sought after by streaming services: SiriusXM spent $100 million on the rights to her podcast in August, three years after Spotify paid $60 million for exclusive rights.

Though it's unclear how much of Cooper's listening base is made up of conservatives, Cooper said she has a ""very mixed audience when it comes to politics"" prior to her Harris interview, acknowledging she seldom talks about politics to make her podcast a welcome space for all listeners. Cooper, however, has previously spoken out in favor of abortion rights. In one ""Call Her Daddy"" episode released in October 2022, Cooper spoke with women who had to travel from states with restrictive abortion laws to other states to receive care, which she said was to highlight the impact of anti-abortion legislation on women. She also criticized the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Cooper's podcast also exploded in popularity after it was acquired in 2018 by Barstool Sports, the media company founded by Dave Portnoy known for its conservative-leaning audience that Politico called ""Barstool Republicans.""

Cooper released her interview with Harris on Sunday, in which she largely asked the vice president questions about women's issues, including reproductive rights. Harris slammed state laws she called ""Trump abortion bans"" and dismissed Trump's claim that he would be a ""protector"" for women as president. She also addressed comments made by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, last month in which she said Harris does not have biological children to keep her ""humble."" Harris said she feels ""sorry"" for Sanders, stating many women are ""not aspiring to be humble"" and ""have a lot of love in their life, family in their life and children in their life"" who lift them up.

""I couldn't see a world in which one of the main conversations in this election is women, and I'm not a part of it,"" Cooper said, defending her decision to interview Harris despite her politically mixed audience, as well as her choice to center their conversation around women's issues.

Cooper ranked No. 12 on Forbes' list of the top-earning creators of 2023, with estimated earnings of $20 million. She was also included on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in 2022.

Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview was one of several media appearances she has scheduled for this week. Also this week, Harris will appear on ""The View,"" ""60 Minutes,"" ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" and Howard Stern's radio show.

Trump's Tariffs Can't Pay For His Many Promises,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2024/10/07/trumps-tariffs-cant-pay-for-his-many-promises/,2024-10-07T19:54:13Z,"GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump's tariffs would raise a lot of money -- $2.8 trillion over 10 years, according to the Tax Policy Center. But even that would fall far short of paying for all the ambitious ideas he claims it would fund. Indeed, his campaign promises likely would add trillions of dollars to the federal debt.

At various times in the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump has said his tariff revenues would replace the income tax, finance an unspecified child care initiative, create a US sovereign wealth fund, eliminate the federal budget deficit, and even begin to pay down the $28 trillion public debt.

Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has her own list of costly promises that appear to be only partially offset by proposed tax hikes. But Trump's tariff revenue would fall far short of paying for all his promises, though it is impossible to know since they mostly are unspecified.

And Trump would inevitably be caught in the same fiscal trap that so many other policymakers have faced: Once you use revenues to pay for new programs or tax cuts, those funds are no longer available to reduce deficits. More often than not, the result is even higher deficits and debt.

Indeed, The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that Trump's campaign proposals would increase the federal debt by $7.5 trillion over the next decade.

How Much Would Tariffs Raise?

While the former president has pitched many different tariff plans over the course of the campaign, TPC analyzed one version he promotes often, a 10 percent tax on all goods imported into the US and a 60 percent levy on Chinese imports. It would raise about $3.7 trillion in gross tariff revenues over the next decade.

But the tariffs would increase net federal revenues by much less -- about $2.8 trillion. That's because they'd significantly raise prices of imported goods, which would mostly be passed on to consumers. The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates to offset those price increases. But that likely would reduce profits of US corporations and incomes of US workers, lower projected corporate and individual tax revenues, and offset nearly $1 trillion of increased tariff revenue.

How would Trump spend the added revenue?

Could tariffs replace the income tax? Not even close. They'd replace only about 8 percent of the $34 trillion in federal individual income tax revenue the Congressional Budget Office expects the Treasury to collect over the next decade. They'd even fall short of paying the $4 trillion cost of extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Could they fund other tax cuts?. Trump has promised many other tax cuts, including exemptions for tip income, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits, repealing the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent for some companies and 15 percent for others. All of those ideas would cost at least an additional $4 trillion, $1.2 trillion more than the income his tariffs would generate.

Could tariffs pay down the national debt? The public debt currently is about $28 trillion and CBO expects it to rise to $50 trillion by 2034. CBO projects the 2025 deficit will approach $2 trillion. By themselves, Trump's tariffs would lower this year's deficit by about $200 billion, or roughly 10 percent. They'd barely make a dent in the projected debt.

How about financing a sovereign wealth fund? Trump has provided no details on his idea to create a US government investment fund, but has promised it would be the biggest in the world. Currently, that honor belongs to Saudi Arabia, with a fund it values at about $925 billion. Trump could create a comparable US investment fund with about one-third of his tariff revenue. But that would leave less than $2 trillion for all his other initiatives.

Could tariffs fund child care? Trump has not specified what child-related programs he supports. But his running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) has endorsed a $5,000 Child Tax Credit (CTC) for all parents, regardless of income, which could pay for services such as child care. While Trump has not publicly commented on the plan, it is at least a hint of what his administration could do.

A Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calculator estimates a Vance-like credit would cost roughly $2.7 trillion over a decade, almost exactly what Trump's tariffs would raise. But that would leave almost nothing for his other initiatives.

Of course, Trump could try to raise more money with even higher tariff rates. But at some point, tariff-driven price increases will shrink demand for imports so much that tariff revenues would no longer offset the decline in corporate and individual income taxes caused by a slowing US economy.

Trump's use of tariff revenue to finance his many ambitious promises feels a bit like the stage magician who appears to be pulling countless rabbits out of a top hat. He's not the first politician to try that trick. But never forget, it is all an illusion."

15 million. That's how many people are under flood watches in Florida, and 11 million are at risk for tropical tornadoes Tuesday and Wednesday.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Saturday declared a state of emergency for 35 counties, including all of the Tampa Bay area and on said Sunday evening a ""flurry"" of evacuation orders would be issued over the next 24 hours. According to the Associated Press, Milton could trigger the biggest spate of evacuation orders in the state since 2017's Hurricane Irma -- where 7 million people were urged to leave their homes. Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, ordered evacuations for areas near Tampa Bay and for all mobile and manufactured homes by Tuesday night. Lee County, home to Fort Meyers, issued a mandary evacuation order for the island of Fort Myers Beach and further orders could still come.

Tampa International Airport will close at 9 a.m. Tuesday and plans to reopen ""as soon as it is safe"" later this week. Major U.S. airlines, including American, Delta, Southwest, United and JetBlue, are issuing travel waivers that will allow passengers flying through impacted airports to rebook without paying far differences. American Airlines' travel alert covers 12 airports in Florida, Delta's covers nine and Frontier covers eight. United Airlines' advisory covers travel to and from only five airports -- Key West, Orlando, Fort Myers, Sarasota/Bradenton and Tampa.

There is no such thing as a Category 6 hurricane. The National Hurricane Center uses the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale to classify storms, which ranks only up to a Category 5 and defines those storms as having sustained winds at or greater than 157 mph. Earlier this year, researchers with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Space Science and Engineering Center argued for adding a sixth storm category as climate change continues to intensify weather events. Under their proposal, Category 5 hurricanes would be redefined to encompass storms with sustained wind speeds between 157 and 192 mph and a new Category 6 would describe storms with wind speeds above 192 mph.

Milton is expected to arrive less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene, a major Category 4 storm, hit Florida on Sept. 26. Helene was the hardest hit for the Tampa Bay area from a hurricane in 103 years, according to the Associated Press. Despite staying offshore, Helene inundated parts of the area with several feet of storm surge. At least 20 people died in Florida from the storm, which then traveled 500 miles across the Southeastern U.S. and caused heavy flooding in the Carolinas, Georgia, Virginia and Tennessee. At least 230 people across six states died as a result of the hurricane, which was the deadliest to hit the continental U.S. since Katrina in 2005. Helene made landfall near Perry, Florida, approximately 160 miles north of Tampa, with winds of 140 mph before it was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved northward.

Milton will be the fifth hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. this year, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts 2024 will be one of the busiest hurricane seasons on record, estimating 8 to 13 hurricanes and between 4 and 7 major hurricanes.

Recent studies contradict claims that migrants in the U.S. illegally are committing crimes at higher rates than people living in the country legally. A 2023 Stanford University study found immigrants were 60% less likely than U.S.-born men to be incarcerated. The Cato Institute has also published several studies that show migrants in Texas who are in the country illegally have lower incarceration and lower homicide conviction rates than U.S. citizens.

Trump has ramped up his anti-immigration rhetoric and proposals during his most recent campaign, promising mass deportations of undocumented migrants if elected. In recent weeks, he has repeated the baseless claim that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are abducting and eating residents' pets despite city officials saying there are no verifiable reports of such incidents. He's also referred to the Biden-Harris immigration policies as a ""border bloodbath,"" while repeating a false claim he's made for years that other countries are sending ""prisoners, murderers, drug dealers, mental patients and terrorists"" to the U.S., he said in April. Trump has also falsely referred to Harris as the ""border czar,"" a mischaracterization of the role Biden appointed her to in March 2021 to work with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to address root causes of migration to the U.S.

Republicans control the state Senate, the House and the governor's office in Georgia and nine of its 14 representatives in Congress are Republicans. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has staved off challenges from former Democratic Rep. Stacy Abrams in both 2018 and 2022, and increased his victory from one to seven points in the most recent election.

2.5. That's how many points Harris leads Trump by nationally, according to FiveThirtyEight's poll tracker, while RealClearPolitics' poll tracker shows her up 2.1 points.

Georgia is one of seven swing states likely to decide who wins the presidential election. Poll trackers show Harris leading Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Nevada, while Trump leads in North Carolina and Georgia. The most likely path to victory for Harris runs through the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which have a combined 44 electoral votes. If she wins all three, plus all the other non-swing states Biden won in 2020, she would reach the 270 electoral-vote threshold needed to win the election. If Trump wins one of the Rust Belt states (most likely Pennsylvania, according to polls), and also carries Georgia and North Carolina, then he would likely break 270.

It's a very good time for unions right now. Last week, organized labor likely notched another victory, as 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association returned to work, reopening 36 East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports after a three-day strike.

Union members started striking at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, after their contract with ocean carriers and port operators represented by the U.S. Maritime Alliance (USMX) expired. The strike essentially shut down all cargo ports on the eastern side of the U.S., potentially roiling the economy and supply chains for everything from groceries to automobiles. Union members wanted a 77% wage increase over six years, as well as an agreement to ban automation in places where it could be used to replace workers. To end the strike for now, USMX offered a 62% wage increase over six years and extended the current union contract until January 15, 2025, to allow for further negotiation.

The contract extension means that the nation's ports will remain open for Q4 -- which includes the presidential election and the all-important holiday shopping season. But the new contract isn't even fully negotiated yet, so it's hard to say whether port workers will ultimately support it. Port automation hasn't been resolved, and as Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly notes, it's a huge issue for the union. The cranes used to remove containers from cargo ships and move them to wherever they need to go next can be automated, meaning fewer people are needed to do the work. Union members are essentially negotiating for their job security -- at least for now.

But cargo ships are getting bigger, global trade is increasing, and there is more demand for imports and exports. Proponents of automation say that it could make ports more efficient, which could help them handle higher volumes. Some ports in Europe and China, as well as a couple on the West Coast, are already automated. The California ports that use automation increased their employment numbers and wage hours after the machinery went in.

These numbers -- and what truly makes a port efficient -- will likely to be discussed at length as the union and USMX return to the bargaining table. It's unknown if the port workers will be willing to compromise on this point. Jim Kruse from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute told Marketplace he has seen forecasts of seaport trade volume doubling by 2050, meaning ports really should be striving toward more efficiency. But if there are no port workers, all of the automation in the world won't be helpful.

Last month, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs, a huge increase over economists' estimates of 150,000, according to government data released on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, an improvement of a tenth of a point over August. This level of job growth didn't just happen in September. The government revised its summertime job growth figures, adding 55,000 more jobs to July's total -- reaching 144,000 jobs -- and 17,000 more jobs to August, for a total of 159,000.

With the upbeat job data, the stock market turned upwards, too. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both rose close to a percentage point on Friday, while the Nasdaq was up 1.2%. ""The economy continues to show incredible resilience,"" Bolvin Wealth Management Group President Gina Bolvin said in comments emailed to Forbes.

While the jobs data and stock bounces are all good for the economy, economists say they're negatively impacting the chances for another big interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets early next month. According to CME FedWatch, 88.5% of economists now believe interest rates will be cut by a quarter percent, with the remaining 11.5% not expecting a rate cut at all. Forbes' Derek Saul talked with Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, an alternate member of the Open Market Committee, about what he'll be paying attention to as the Fed closes out the year. The unemployment rate going forward is important, he said. ""After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?""

Spirit Airlines stock dropped more than 30% on Friday after reports that the budget carrier may be exploring bankruptcy following a failed merger with JetBlue Airways. It was the deepest plunge of the airline's stock since January, when the Justice Department blocked the proposed $3.8 billion acquisition on antitrust grounds, sending prices down more than 50%. Spirit has been working toward improving its financial position this year, executing a restructuring plan that involves changing routes, deferring new aircraft deliveries, cutting 32 routes, and adding new premium tiers for passenger service and experience. Spirit Airlines CEO Ted Christie has said in the last two earnings reports that the company was discussing options with its bondholders for bills due soon. In the last earnings report, CFO Fred Cromer said updates would be provided ""when appropriate."" According to the Wall Street Journal, people familiar with the matter said any bankruptcy filing is not imminent, and recent talks have focused on reaching an agreement to support a Chapter 11 filing.

In today's business world, studies found most women are not at the levels where decisions are being made. Just 9% of CEOs at the largest U.S. companies are women, but there are few women in the other C-suite roles that can be seen as stepping stones to the top spot, according to a new analysis by executive search firm Russell Reynolds. Looking at the top 100 companies on the S&P, there are 74% fewer female executives on leadership teams than there are in the current U.S. population. Looking at the position-by-position breakdown, 46% of CMOs are women, the closest to the half of the population women represent. There are the most female CHROs -- 72% -- and the fewest CEOs and COOs -- 8%. Forbes senior contributor Kim Elsesser writes other recent studies show that the professional bias against women starts early. A recent study by McKinsey and LeanIn found that women represent 59% of all bachelor's degree recipients, but only represent 48% of entry-level corporate roles. For every 100 men promoted to manager, only 81 women get the same career advancement. Another study that interviewed 57 women CEOs found that two-thirds of them weren't aware the CEO role was in their grasp until someone else suggested it.

Thousands of companies across the globe use Atlassian's collaboration tools -- which include Jira, Confluence, Trello and Loom -- to work together and manage projects. I talked to President Anu Bharadwaj about how Atlassian serves companies' tech and AI needs, the culture at the 22-year-old company -- which is still founder-led, and its growth prospects.

This interview has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here.

How do you figure out which problems Atlassian should be solving next with AI, and how do you go forward doing it?

Bharadwaj: We are a company of product builders. Our philosophy is: Create the things that you want to use yourself. A lot of our product heritage has been we build products for ourselves and then figure out [if] this is interesting for other people, and how can we make it more generalized and applicable in different industries and contexts?

Or we go off and acquire a product. Loom is a great example of a company we acquired last year that we used heavily inside Atlassian. We are a 12,000-person company distributed across 13 countries. [At] the beginning of the pandemic, we made the decision to go fully distributed. We said to employees, we will not ask you to come into an office for any number of days a week, but we will set some guidelines around how many working hours overlap you have with your team. When we compose a team of people on the West Coast and East Coast, that's okay. But if you take people on the East Coast, West Coast, Australia and Singapore, it becomes a problem because there are not enough working hours overlap. A lot of the tools that we use are really our own tools for collaboration and for teamwork. And one of the tools we heavily relied on was Loom, which really helped, creating video snippets that would help disseminate information so that people can then consume it at their own pace. We decided to buy the tool ourselves and integrate it with our product suite because it really helped with asynchronous communication and distributed teamwork.

Scott Farquhar, one of the founders of Atlassian, recently stepped down from the co-CEO spot. While this may not signify a huge transition for the company, since cofounder Mike Cannon-Brookes is assuming the sole CEO role, what does it mean symbolically for Atlassian?

I have been at Atlassian for 10 years, and the big reason for me staying this long has been Scott. Scott's a personal friend and has been a great supporter and champion. Personally, I feel bittersweet about it. I feel very happy for him that he is now going on to the next phase of life. He has the energy and the bandwidth to focus on some of the things that he has started, like Pledge1%. He has a number of well-defined philosophical philanthropy projects that he's rallied the company around.

Operationally day-to-day, it's not that much of a change for us because he's been very thoughtful about this transition. He has set up the requisite systems and leaders. I personally have been doing a lot more on the go-to-market, which Scott used to run.

Mike, our CEO, [and Farquhar] have been co-founders and co-CEOs for 20-plus years, which is very unusual in software. Mike staying on as the founder CEO means that even symbolically for Atlassian, it's really not that much of a step change, because we continue to be founder-led. We continue to have the 20-year context continue.

One of the staggering things about Atlassian is we have a lot of tenured people in the company. We have a Slack channel called Old Timers, which seems to keep growing each day. It's mostly people who have 10-plus years, and I recently joined. Because we have a lot of tenured people, the culture, the ethos of the company, beliefs, values, they all tend to be strong. We are lucky that we have that cohort of people where this continues to be a defining way of how we run the company.

In Atlassian's most recent earnings report, some investors reacted negatively to slower growth prospects than they were hoping. Where do you see Atlassian's growth going? What is your vision for the next six months?

It's interesting because I've been here since we were $100 million in revenue. We are about $4.5 billion dollars in revenue, and we've been a growth company throughout. We are committed to a 20% CAGR over multiple years. [A] 20% CAGR on a $4.5 billion base is substantial, and it's quite rare for a company of our scale. I continue to be excited and grateful that we have a business where the opportunities are so big that we can confidently talk about 20% CAGR over multiple years.

Why do we think that that is the case? Because we operate in three fundamental markets where I think the opportunity is going to grow, because more and more people are poised to be creators. Thanks to gen AI and redefining of the software development lifecycle, more people can do what only technical people used to be able to do before. That's a good thing for Atlassian because we serve the full cycle, not just the coding part of a developer's life. That means more software gets created and more opportunity to grow in that business.

Our second business is the IT service market, which is fundamentally service request handling. This is a market that stands to greatly benefit from the AI wave. Even outside of the AI wave, this is a market that continues to grow at a very healthy clip. We just put out the numbers for each of our business lines for the first time back in April. Service management has been our fastest growing business, close to $500 million. We are priced super competitively, and we are just getting started. That's really at the early phases of the market capture, and that's several billion dollars that is open opportunity for us to go after.

The last market is for knowledge workers. We can democratize that with an open philosophy of saying companies can use any number of tools for knowledge management applications they require, but we want to be the backbone that connects all of those things in one single place through a connected data platform, and offers customers the choice to use multiple tools, but have a single knowledge backbone across their organization such that they can make the maximum use of their own data and deliver the most insights based on what their own employees are doing. That is definitely the largest market we are addressing, and has the most promise, and we are also the earliest in that market.

Booming artificial intelligence company OpenAI announced a massive funding round last week.

$6.6 billion: Size of the newest round, which was led by Thrive Capital and saw participation from SoftBank, Nvidia and Tiger Global, according to the Wall Street Journal

Business leaders need to be decisive, but that's easier said than done. Here are some ways that top entrepreneurs can make big -- and tough -- decisions in five minutes.

It's officially Q4, and many executives are looking to the future: finishing 2024 strong and starting 2025 off right. Here are four priorities to focus on to bring this year to a successful close.

Presidential candidates are busy racking up endorsements and promoting them to try to sway undecided voters. Former President Donald Trump touted a big endorsement last week on social media, but that person quickly contradicted it, saying they had not endorsed any candidate. Who is it?"
Supreme Court Rejects Elon Musk's Lawsuit Against Jack Smith Over Trump Investigation,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/07/supreme-court-rejects-elon-musks-lawsuit-against-jack-smith-over-trump-investigation/,2024-10-07T16:20:48Z,"The Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge brought by social network X on Monday, after the Elon Musk-owned company sued the federal government for forcing it to turn over information about former President Donald Trump to prosecutors investigating him, without being able to tell the ex-president about the warrant.

The criminal case against Trump over trying to overturn the 2020 election is still playing out in federal court, though it's unclear when or if it will go to trial. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has to determine which charges against Trump, if any, can move forward, after the Supreme Court ruled Trump can't be prosecuted for anything based on his official acts as president. Smith filed a sweeping document laying out the government's case against Trump, which was made public last week, which broadly accuses Trump of illegally trying to overturn the 2020 election despite knowing his election fraud claims were false. Trump has denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty, and is expected to hire Justice Department officials who would drop the charges if he's elected president.

X's case against the federal government over its Trump investigation comes as Musk, who owns X, has increasingly aligned himself with the ex-president. The billionaire is a major donor to America PAC, which has become one of the top super PACs supporting Trump in the election, and has been outspoken in Trump's favor on X. After the two had a livestreamed conversation on X in August, Musk appeared alongside Trump at a campaign rally on Saturday, where he said he was ""dark MAGA"" and claimed Trump ""must win to preserve democracy in America.""

News of X -- then known as Twitter -- playing a role in the Trump investigation first emerged in Aug. 2023, when court filings were unsealed following X's secret court battle trying unsuccessfully to fight the warrant. The government's case against Trump repeatedly cites the ex-president's tweets, arguing Trump used the social platform as one of his ""tools"" to further his alleged conspiracy to overturn the results. Prosecutors also analyzed Trump's phone data to allege the ex-president was looking at Twitter while his supporters were attacking the Capitol on Jan. 6."
Elon Musk's PAC Is Paying $47 For Each Solicited Petition Signature From A Swing State Voter -- Here's Why It's Controversial,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/10/07/elon-musks-pac-is-paying-47-for-each-solicited-petition-signature-from-a-swing-state-voter-heres-why-its-controversial/,2024-10-07T16:01:35Z,"Elon Musk announced his America PAC will pay $47 for each successful referral of a registered swing state voter to sign a petition ""to show support for free speech and the right to bear arms,"" as he ramps up his support of former president Donald Trump's campaign less than a month before the election.

$23.5 million. That's how much the America PAC would pay out if 500,000 -- half the goal number of swing state signatories -- came from successful referrals.

Yes. It is legal to compensate signature gatherers, or circulators, who collect petition signatures, though the exact laws vary by state. Some states, like Arizona, Florida and Utah, have made it illegal for campaigns or other employers to pay based on the number of signatures gathered -- known as pay-per-signature compensation -- but it is almost always legal to pay by the hour for time spent soliciting signatories. The America PAC is based in Texas, where there are no specific laws about pay-per-signature compensation.

While pay-per-signature compensation is legal in some states, some warn it could increase petition signature fraud. NPR's Ashley Lopez covered a Michigan gubernatorial primary in 2022 that saw more than 68,000 invalid signatures submitted on candidate nomination petitions, some of which were attributed to fraud as canvassers used fake names, or those of dead voters, to fill out petition sheets. While not all invalid signatures can be attributed to fraud, Lopez did say there is an industry-wide opinion that paying people per signature, as opposed to per hour, to solicit petition votes can lead to more fraudulent activity. ""What experts are saying is if you pay workers by the hour, there's...less of an incentive for them to commit fraud,"" Lopez said last year. Tammy Patrick, CEO of programs with the Election Center, told NPR that being compensated by signature also ""incentivizes getting signatures to the degree that the voter doesn't understand what they are signing or they are misrepresenting what's being signed or they are encouraging people to sign even if they are not eligible."" Former Republican state Sen. Vince Leach of Arizona, who sponsored a bill to ban pay-per-signature petition soliciting that was upheld by the state's supreme court last year, also told the Associated Press that compensating workers per signature increases the likelihood of petition fraud.

No. Federal law prohibits anyone from paying or offering to pay someone to vote or register to vote, but, like paying petition circulators, it is legal to pay people to encourage others to do so. The America PAC, for instance, pays $30 per hour to people working to increase voter turnout. Earlier this year, the Biden Administration said it would pay college students to help register voters through the Federal Work-Study Program.

Musk, co-founder of Tesla and owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, created the America PAC in May. Musk said he was committing around $45 million per month to the group, which also includes backers like Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale and the Winklevoss twins. The PAC's website says it was created to support ""secure borders, safe cities, free speech, sensible spending, self-protection and a fair justice system."" As of September, the PAC had about 400 employees in each of seven battleground states, the Guardian reported, and has spent heavily on get-out-the-vote efforts.

Musk officially declared his support of former president Trump in the 2024 election in July, after an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Since then, Trump has said he wants to create a ""government efficiency commission"" and said Musk has agreed to lead it, and Musk made his first campaign appearance over the weekend at a repeat of the Butler rally. Musk called Trump the only candidate ""to preserve democracy in America"" and encouraged his supporters to vote next month."
Is It 'Irrefutable' That The Economy Performs Better Under Democrats?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/10/07/is-it-irrefutable-that-the-economy-performs-better-under-democrats/,2024-10-07T15:02:38Z,"Responding to the failures of Enron and Worldcom within six months of each other, failures that didn't spook the markets much at all, President George W. Bush zestily signed into law Sarbanes-Oxley (legislation that most certainly did spook the markets), thus criminalizing failure in an economy that had long derived its dynamism from - you guessed it - a lack of barriers to the decline of corporations no longer meeting or leading the needs of customers.

Even though government spending is the ultimate tax on growth (this is not a comment on deficits, which both sides needlessly waste time on when the other Party is in power), was allergic to government-spending vetoes, he reversed the Reagan-Clinton emphasis on a strong, stable dollar that had been such a major driver of economic vitality in the '80s and '90s, plus when banks and investment banks began to go belly-up in 2008 (arguably symptoms of the Bush Treasury's confusion about dollar-price stability), the rhetorically ""free market"" Bush claimed the markets weren't working on the way to bailouts that logically caused the ""financial crisis,"" as opposed to staving off market mayhem.

Bush's unsuccessful presidency always comes to mind every four years, and when Republicans and Democrats claim the economy does much better when their party controls the White House. It's a discussion that elevates neither side, and not because policy doesn't matter. The reality is that good and bad individuals with good or bad ideas occupy the White House, after which part of the success or failure of individuals has much to do with how cooperative (or rather crucially, uncooperative) Congress is toward the president in office. Bush can be given a little leniency here with the latter in mind.

While his awful dollar policy was all his, Sarbanes-Oxley was passed near unanimously in the House and Senate. Considering TARP, the bank bailout bill that morphed into so much more, many more Democrats voted for it than Republicans.

This is important in consideration of the economic portion of Barack Obama's presidency that followed Bush's. The economy had limping qualities much of the time. One anecdote supporting the previous truth comes care of Republican-leaning Wall Street Journal columnist Mary O'Grady. O'Grady has noted that from 2009-2014, more Mexicans crossed the southern border back into Mexico than came into the U.S. However, looming large in the weakness of the Obama economy were the bailouts signed into law by George W. Bush, but that were overwhelmingly supported by Democrats in Congress.

Obama had his own errors, including the passage of the misnamed Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), but the stock market did pretty well as his presidency wore on. Was this Democratic policy? Arguably no. Lest readers forget, the legislative portion of Obama's presidency (2009-2017) largely ended in 2010 after the electorate, presumably chastened by Obama's lefty lurch (after running a centrist campaign), handed control of Congress back to the Republicans. In 2014, the GOP took control of the Senate too.

Obama's presidency is useful to think about when making comparisons between Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Using the charitably worthless measurement that is Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Reagan economy averaged annual growth of 3.5%, while Clinton was near 4%. The stock market soared under both too, but more under Clinton. Ok, so both GDP and the stock market favor Clinton and the Democrats? Not so fast.

It's easily forgotten that Clinton, like Obama, lost Congress in the mid-term elections, and after tax increases in concert with an attempt to nationalize healthcare. Clinton later admitted regret about the tax hikes, plus famously proclaimed subsequent to the GOP's taking of Congress that ""the era of big government is over."" As Democratic historian Richard Reeves observed about Clinton's presidency, it was Reagan's third term.

With Republicans in control of Congress while Clinton was in the White House, welfare reform was signed into law, a capital gains tax cut was passed, after which divided government invariably keeps a lid on major legislation meant to expand government. It's worth adding that to Clinton's everlasting credit, he replaced weak-dollar Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen with Robert Rubin. This was a big deal.

Still, it's useful to consider a Clinton presidency that in so many ways mimicked Reagan's in the eyes of Democrats, all the while considering the role of GOP's takeover of Congress in Clinton's makeover. What if Reagan had similarly enjoyed a GOP congressional majority?

It's worth asking mainly because in judging the individual in the White House, you can't judge them solely on their actions. What about the Congress in opposition or supporting them? Democrats like Clinton and Obama plainly prospered more than they otherwise would have thanks to Republicans in majority opposition.

Pivoting to Donald Trump, stocks and the economy generally did well during his presidency with a mix of good (de-regulation, exiting of the Paris Accord, ok tax cuts) and bad (tariffs) decisions, only for stocks and the economy to plummet in March of 2020. Think the lockdowns following political panic over the coronavirus. It was then that Trump went against type and supported freedom, economy, and logic-trampling government control. The collapse under Trump towards the end of his presidency obviously compromises the numbers leading up to March of 2020, at which point Trump and Republicans are awful at economic policy? Not so fast once again. Without excusing Trump's mindless actions for even a second, let's never forget that Democrats supported this hideous lurch from sanity exponentially more than allegedly virus-denying Republicans.

This is important in consideration of the Biden presidency that followed. While Democratic governors were only too happy to oversee lockdowns in the states they ran, and while mouthbreathing Republican governors locked down late while ""unlocking"" early to the disdainful horror of double-masked Dems, the total discredit of lockdowns in GOP-led states set the stage for eventually all U.S. states ending what was so inhumane, unhealthy, and inimical to growth. Yet it's ""Biden's"" economic growth now?

Hopefully readers see the point. Prosperity under Democratic presidents was so often aided by the GOP's more routine embrace of limited government and freedom, while horrendous errors by GOP presidents (2008 bailouts, 2020 lockdowns) were embraced much more by Democrats than Republicans. Which means it's overwhelming fallacy for Democrats to claim a ""clear"" relationship between their policies and growth.

At the same time, Republicans should be looking inward too. As evidenced by the not-infrequent economic success of Democratic presidents, there's a case to be made that the GOP does the most for freedom and for growth when they're out of the White House, and aggressively restraining the Democrats from being - yes - Democrats."
New Supreme Court Term Starts Today: Here Are The Biggest Cases To Watch -- So Far,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/07/new-supreme-court-term-starts-today-here-are-the-biggest-cases-to-watch-so-far/,2024-10-07T15:02:28Z,"The Supreme Court's new term kicks off on Monday, with justices already slated to hear major cases on such topics as transgender rights and guns -- and other huge cases could still be added, including on the 2024 election and former President Donald Trump's criminal cases.

The Supreme Court's term begins on Monday and will run through the end of June. It's unclear when rulings in the court's major cases will come out. Decisions are usually released a few months after the court hears oral arguments, meaning rulings will come out quicker for cases heard earlier in the term, though the biggest decisions of the court's term are often released in June.

The Supreme Court is likely to add a number of other major cases to its docket this term. The court has already been asked to hear such cases as a lawsuit seeking damages for oil companies' impacts on climate change and a challenge to a school's race-neutral admissions practices, but has not yet ruled on taking those up. A number of gun-specific challenges have also been filed with the court, including cases regarding Maryland's assault weapons ban, the ban on people convicted of felonies possessing guns, whether states can ban 18-to-20-year olds from purchasing guns and whether people under felony indictment can buy guns. Lawsuits taking issue with the Biden administration's new efforts on student loan forgiveness are also winding through the courts, and while the Supreme Court already upheld a block on a student debt relief effort in August, it could be asked again to consider the issue more fully. The Supreme Court punted last term on abortion when it ruled challengers trying to restrict abortion drug mifepristone didn't have standing to bring the case and dismissed a challenge against Idaho's abortion ban, but both cases are still moving forward in lower courts as plaintiffs try to make the cases work, and could return to the high court.

After ruling last term that Trump and other ex-presidents have some immunity from criminal prosecution -- ruling he can't be charged for anything he did that was an ""official act"" as president, but can be prosecuted for actions outside his official duties -- justices could be asked this term to weigh in on the issue for a second time. The Supreme Court directed Trump's criminal case for trying to overturn the 2020 election to go back to the lower court, and U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan now has to decide which charges against Trump comply with the Supreme Court's ruling and can proceed to trial. Trump is all but certain to appeal whatever Chutkan decides, however, and it could be up to the Supreme Court to make the final determination on the issue. Special Counsel Jack Smith is also now trying to revive the federal case against Trump for allegedly mishandling White House documents, after Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon threw it out because she found Smith had been unlawfully appointed. That appeal could also go to the Supreme Court to determine whether Smith and other special counsels have the appropriate authority.

The Supreme Court is also likely to play a role in the November election, as it did in 2020. Justices were repeatedly asked to weigh in on cases challenging the election results in that election, which could happen again this year should Trump lose the election. There are also lawsuits challenging various voting rules that could still make their way to the Supreme Court before Election Day or become a factor while ballots are being counted, most notably regarding whether ballots must be received by Election Day.

The Supreme Court's term kicks off as Americans have become increasingly dissatisfied with the 6-3 conservative bench, amid a series of ethics scandals and controversial rulings. The court ended its last term with a slew of major rulings, including the Trump immunity case, striking down a ban on bump stocks for guns, killing Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy settlement, allowing a ban on ""public camping"" that targets the homeless, limiting charges for Jan. 6 rioters and overturning a longstanding precedent that gave broad power to federal agencies. Justices have also refused to enact a binding ethics code amid a series of controversies involving potential conflicts of interests, particularly by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. A Gallup poll conducted in September found 51% of Americans now disapprove of the Supreme Court as its new term begins, versus 44% who approve of the job justices are doing. Results broke heavily along party lines, with 83% of Democrats disapproving of the high court versus only 19% of Republicans."
"The Tax Man Comes For Fast Fashion, Part 3: The U.S. Leads The Way",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/taxnotes/2024/10/07/the-tax-man-comes-for-fast-fashion-part-3-the-us-leads-the-way/,2024-10-07T14:23:49Z,"This is the third article in a series. The first provided an overview of how fast fashion companies are taxed globally and potential solutions moving forward. The second discussed rivalries within the growing fast fashion industry, focusing on how this growth has been influenced by tax policy.

Temu's parent company, PDD Holdings, has had a rough several weeks.

In August the company's stock price plunged nearly 30 percent after its second-quarter earnings fell short of analysts' expectations. Despite this, PDD is performing astonishingly well in the market, making the steep sell-off a bit surprising. In the second quarter, PDD earned $13.6 billion in revenue -- an 86 percent jump over its same-period earnings from the previous year, the company reported. PDD should be celebrating, but instead it is assuaging the nerves of Wall Street analysts who had forecast an overly optimistic $14 billion for the quarter, according to CNBC.

PDD is in a bit of a delicate spot. Yes, revenue is high, but the company is also aware that its boom may be nearing its end. In its second-quarter release, PDD acknowledged that it's likely to face pressure amidst ""intensified competition"" from other low-cost e-commerce retailers.

Investors are clearly skittish. PDD's stock price took a mini tumble in mid-September after the Biden administration announced that it intends to close a customs exemption that allows low-value imports to enter the country duty free.

In the statement, the White House left little question about who it is targeting:

The majority of shipments entering the United States claiming the de minimis exemption originate from several China-founded e-commerce platforms, putting American consumers at risk, undercutting American workers and businesses, and resulting in the importation of huge volumes of low-value products such as textiles and apparel into the U.S. market duty-free.

In the United States, importers are exempted from paying customs duties on packages valued under $800 under section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. The problem is that the number of exempt packages is accelerating at such a high rate that some lawmakers and industry analysts suspect the system is being gamed. In 2023 the United States received 1 billion de minimis packages -- a 57 percent increase compared with 2020. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says de minimis imports have jumped by 88 percent over the past six years.

The de minimis exemption was not meant to become a point of controversy or exploitation. Rather, it was meant to ensure that Americans who purchase goods abroad can buy a certain amount duty free. The exemption amount used to be much lower: Until 1994 the de minimis threshold for low-value imports was $5, but it gradually increased until it hit $800 per person per day in 2016. Congress landed on $800 because it wanted to align the de minimis threshold with the duty-free exemption that applies to international travel.

It turns out that this exemption, which was meant to help U.S. consumers, may be helping foreign e-commerce retailers as well. Lawmakers specifically say fast fashion retailer Shein and PDD's Temu are taking advantage of the exemption. In June 2023 a U.S. House committee released a report saying that the two companies alone accounted for nearly 30 percent of the 685 million de minimis shipments that entered the United States in 2022. Although the companies are doing heavy business in the United States, they aren't shipping their products in bulk. Instead, they mostly send their packages as direct-to-consumer shipments. Because their products are ultra-low value, the direct-to-consumer shipments are typically worth less than $800 and can enter the country duty free.

The Biden administration says it will issue proposed rules ensuring that products subject to tariffs under sections 201 or 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, or section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, will not qualify for the de minimis exemption. That spells bad news for Chinese e-commerce apparel operators, because 70 percent of Chinese textile and apparel imports are subject to section 301 tariffs. However, the de minimis threshold shielded many e-commerce apparel shipments from the tariffs.

Biden is building on policy from his predecessor, former president Donald Trump.

Between 2018 and 2019 the Trump administration imposed an escalating series of section 301 tariffs on Chinese imports, including a wide array of textiles, fabrics, and apparel. The decisions subjected those goods to additional tariffs ranging between 10 and 25 percent. The Biden administration decided to keep those tariffs, and now it plans to ensure that they will be fully applied.

The White House also announced that it wants more information about de minimis shipments entering the country's borders, including a shipment's 10-digit tariff classification number and information about the person claiming the de minimis exemption.

Although the White House is ready to use its executive power, it wants Congress to reform the de minimis exemption within the next few months. Specifically, it wants Congress to exclude textiles and apparel from the de minimis exemption and formally exclude products covered by section 301, section 201, or section 232 trade enforcement actions.

It's not an unreasonable request -- the de minimis issue is one that has bipartisan alignment in a polarized Congress.

The White House's proposal -- which should be released soon -- is similar to the End China's De Minimis Abuse Act (H.R. 7979), introduced in April by Rep. Gregory F. Murphy, R-N.C. That measure would prevent firms from applying the de minimis exemption to any goods subject to section 301 trade enforcement tariffs.

The White House's announcement has pleased Republicans and Democrats alike. House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo., said he, too, wants bipartisan legislation on the issue. ""They say imitation is the highest form of flattery, so I am pleased Democrats in Washington are once again acknowledging that Republicans' tough-on-China trade policy works,"" he said in a statement. ""Given that the Biden Administration has finally embraced Republicans' common sense reforms to prevent China's abuse of the de minimis threshold, I am hopeful that House Democrats will work with us to codify this policy into law.""

Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who in August introduced similar legislation under the Fighting Illicit Goods, Helping Trustworthy Importers, and Netting Gains (FIGHTING) for America Act, also praised the White House's announcement.

The United States is moving quickly on the matter, but other jurisdictions aren't far behind. The European Union is facing a similar de minimis issue, even though it applies a much lower €150 ($162) customs exemption. Germany -- the EU's largest market -- is being ""inundated"" with up to 400,000 low-value imports per day, according to member of European Parliament Engin Eroglu. The country's finance minister, Christian Lindner, thinks the bloc needs to scrap the exemption, according to Reuters.

The European Commission agrees; it actually called for the €150 exemption to be removed last year, but the proposal went nowhere. Some lawmakers think the bloc should revisit the issue. In March MEP Maximilian Krah asked the commission how it planned to address the rising number of de minimis imports, noting that ""customs duties are . . . paid on around one in every thousand packages.""

""Asian suppliers in particular, such as Temu, undermine this requirement by no longer sending large consignments on pallets -- instead, they package and ship goods individually in small packages and parcels. If a single product costs more than €150, it is -- if possible -- disassembled into its constituent parts, which are then shipped separately. This way, none of the individually shipped items costs more than €150,"" he said. ""The EU's Supply Chains Directive does not seem to have any effect.""

Krah asked the commission to divulge the amount of customs duties the bloc has lost because of the €150 customs exemption and further asked the commission to outline its response to the environmental burdens that high volumes of individual shipments present.

Paolo Gentiloni, European Commissioner for the Economy, didn't quite answer those questions, but he responded that risk management is ""essential"" for determining whether packages truly fall below the €150 threshold. The commission, he said, will ""use all available instruments to accelerate the EU customs reform and to coordinate and strengthen the enforcement activities against goods that pose health, safety and environmental risks, in cooperation with different EU enforcement-related bodies.""

Krah added that even if the customs exemption applies, e-commerce packages should be subject to an import turnover tax, and potentially to sales tax.

""In practice, however, these two taxes are paid only in exceptional circumstances,"" Krah said in another written question. ""First of all, non-EU traders like Temu only enclose a delivery note. Invoices showing the applicable taxes are hard to come by in practice, even upon repeated request. What is more, given the sheer volume of packages and parcels (approximately 900,000 per day), it is virtually impossible to levy charges. No import service has the capacity for this.""

Krah asked the European Commission to explain how it is addressing the issue and to provide member-state-level estimates of the amount of revenue they are missing.

Gentiloni responded that the commission wants e-commerce platforms to charge VAT and duties at the time of sale and share that information with customs. In the meantime, the European Parliament is reportedly looking at a new commission proposal to remove the customs duty exemption, according to the Guardian.

South Africa charges tariffs of up to 45 percent on clothing, but officials say foreign e-commerce companies are paying a fraction of that rate by shipping clothing in smaller packages. That's because the country allows importers to pay a 20 percent rate on shipments values at less than ZAR 500 ($28.90) and does not apply VAT to those parcels.

In August the South African Revenue Service announced that it is changing this system. In a release, the revenue authority said it ""noted legitimate concerns that have been expressed in the importation of several . . . goods, especially clothing, via e-commerce by a number of importers who have not been paying the obligatory customs duties and VAT on these imports, resulting in unfair competition with other industry players.""

There will be no more exemptions. Starting September 1, VAT is applied to low-value e-commerce shipments, in addition to the 20 percent customs duty. By November 1 SARS will apply a new set of reconfigured VAT rates to e-commerce shipments."

""If you're on that west coast of Florida, barrier islands, just assume you'll be asked to leave,"" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday.

Hurricane Helene was the hardest hit for the Tampa Bay area from a hurricane in 103 years, according to the Associated Press. Despite staying offshore, Helene inundated parts of the area with several feet of storm surge. Twelve people died in the Tampa area due to the surge, AP reported.

Milton will be the fifth hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. this year, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts 2024 will be one of the busiest hurricane seasons on record, estimating 8-13 hurricanes, including 4-7 major hurricanes.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Saturday declared a state of emergency for 35 counties, including all in the Tampa Bay area.

DeSantis said Sunday evening a ""flurry"" of evacuation orders will be issued over the next 24 hours. ""I don't think there's any scenario where we don't have major impacts at this point,"" DeSantis said, adding that people have ""all day Monday, probably all day Tuesday"" to ensure they have a hurricane preparedness plan in place. According to the Associated Press, Milton could trigger the biggest spate of evacuation orders in the state since 2017's Hurricane Irma -- where 7 million people were urged to leave their homes.

Milton is expected to arrive less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene, a major Category 4 storm, hit Florida on Sept. 26 and traveled 500 miles across the Southeastern U.S., causing heavy flooding in the Carolinas, Georgia, Virginia and Tennessee. At least 230 people across six states died as a result of the hurricane, which was the deadliest to hit the continental U.S. since Katrina in 2005. Helene made landfall near Perry, Florida, approximately 160 miles north of Tampa, with winds of 140 mph before it was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved northward.

The Election Will Change Things But What About Housing?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogervaldez/2024/10/07/the-election-will-change-things-but-what-about-housing/,2024-10-07T13:33:26Z,"Nothing lasts forever, especially republics. If you're a glutton for punishment, you can read my take on Trump and the mania associated with him (Destroying the Constitution to Save It: A Warning from the Roman Republic), a post written well before the assassination attempts. Like it or not, how the country handles Trump is an indicator for how much longer the American ""experiment"" will continue. Republics are fleeting historical exceptions - glitches not a feature - in government. The upcoming election is an indicator in how much longer the American republic will last. But does the election matter for housing for people who make less money and struggle to cover housing costs?

In engaged Kurt Carlton, president at New Western, a platform that helps real estate investors find buyers. New West says it is ""the largest national source of residential investment properties."" As I've said before, real estate investors large and small, are not bad. Criticizing ""outside"" investors or ""greedy investors"" and blaming them for the housing ""crisis"" is vogue these days but the product of naivete or plain ignorance of how housing works. The Keebler Elves don't build housing; someone has to pay for it, whether it's one person building their own house, or people trying to create housing for a return on their investment in building or renovating. If you're reading this inside an office or a house or a building of some kind, I'm pretty sure some investors were involved.

Carlton and I have engaged before on why investor capital is important to activate housing that otherwise would be abandoned or underutilized. What does Carlton think of the upcoming election? I asked him whether he thought either candidate would address the central issues. Regardless of who wins, what's the answer to rising housing prices and rents?

""The real solution is under our noses and it's simple and cost effective. The challenge with current housing policies is that they focus on increasing supply without addressing the underlying causes of the inventory crisis.""

Agreed. I asked him about each candidate's plans for housing.

How would you summarize Harris' housing policies? How would those affect rental and ownership for consumers, investors, and those that develop housing.

""Harris' housing policies are crafted to appeal to voters, but their effectiveness in addressing the housing supply crisis is questionable. The $25,000 down payment assistance program, while well-intentioned, risks further inflating demand in an already constrained market, driving up home prices, and exacerbating the shortage of affordable homes. The $40 billion innovation fund, intended to reform zoning and regulatory frameworks, may overwhelm local governments that lack the capacity or infrastructure to implement meaningful changes. Meanwhile, the focus on Wall Street landlords appears misplaced, as institutional ownership represents a small and shrinking share of the housing market. Restricting these entities is unlikely to have any noticeable impact on the broader homebuyer landscape.""

How would you summarize Trump's housing policies? How would those affect rental and ownership for consumers, investors, and those that develop housing

""Trump has yet to outline specific housing policies in the detailed manner that Harris has, leaving uncertainty around his approach. However, he has indicated a broad focus on restoring economic stability, with the goal of moderating mortgage rates, alleviating supply chain disruptions, and reducing high construction costs caused by excessive regulations. Additionally, he proposes utilizing federal land for new housing developments. In our view, tapping federal land is not the priority. The U.S. already has approximately 15 million vacant homes, many located in areas where housing is desperately needed. Rehabilitating existing housing stock should be the central focus of any housing policy aimed at addressing the current crisis.""

It's true. The Harris housing plan is full of regulatory intervention and questionable programs that seem to just pile more money on the mountain of money that hasn't made a dent in the problem. Here's a take from the National Housing Conference (pro) and from the Hoover Institution (con). Her plan dumps more cash into the mortgage market which won't help prices and her pursuit of illusory ""price fixing"" will only increase risk of operating rental housing and thus make rents higher.

""Overall, I believe Trump has a solid understanding of the real estate market and the economic adjustments needed to rebalance housing supply and demand"" says Carlton. If he was well advised, Carlton says, ""he would likely support local, small-scale investors who are working to rehabilitate vacant and distressed properties."" Maybe. But when has Trump ever taken anyone's advice. He was the single worst actor in the Covid eviction band fiasco, ordering the CDC to solve the problem. Their solution was to make up facts (people evicted because of Covid would drive all over the country looking for housing) and add fuel to local bans on eviction rather than cash relief.

I wouldn't trust Harris or Trump to organize a one car funeral. Harris is an ambitious climber in the tradition of many of her predecessors both historical and fictional (see Being There), and Trump is an endless source of entertainment for me, but anything good he does will be entirely accidental (see Mr. Magoo). We're in trouble. But the truth is that whatever the outcome, the reforms needed at the federal level can only happen with the support of Congress, a body that rounds out the branches with perfect incompetence (see the Three Stooges). The good and bad news is that neither candidate nor the Congress is capable of any big moves in the next two years.

Alright. Yes. I'm pretty cynical. But let's go back to Carlton's more cogent thoughts. Harris wants to build 3 million homes.

""Building three million new homes would require new land, relaxed regulations, changes to zoning codes, and long-term subsidies for builders, who often find it more profitable to construct larger homes than affordable starter homes. Meanwhile, America already has millions of vacant properties in desirable, well-established communities -- properties that are zoned, platted, and ready to be revitalized by local investors. These investors are the ones taking on the risk of renovating homes that most individual buyers neither have the means nor the desire to tackle.""

I'm glad someone is paying attention. I haven't looked at the Drudge Report or Real Clear Politics in months. I feel the same way about this election that Angry Grandma feels about the car wash: I hate it. But either way, I hope that people in a new administration might feel the same frustration I've felt for the last decade and be willing to try something new. If that happens, I'm on board with that no matter who wins."

Today marks one year since Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, leading Israel to retaliate and catalyzing the war in Gaza. Nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians.

Despite calls for a ceasefire from the U.S. and allies, the Middle East is on the precipice of a broader war as tensions escalate between Israel and Iran. About 31% of Americans believe Israel's military operations in Gaza are going too far, a slight increase from last December, according to a new Pew Research Center poll.

Meanwhile, the share of Americans who believe Israel is doing enough or should be doing more has fallen in the last 10 months.

The U.S. added far more jobs than expected in September, and the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%. The Labor Department data delivered good news for investors on edge after July and August saw far weaker labor market expansion than expected.

MORE: Leading stock indexes saw gains Friday on the heels of the jobs report: The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 0.8%, the S&P 500 climbed as much as 0.9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq bounced as much as 1.2%. But labor market resilience dampened hopes for a second aggressive interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month.

Tencent Holdings is considering acquiring Ubisoft Entertainment with the Guillemot family, which founded the French video game publisher, sending Ubisoft's stock soaring Friday after it falling to a decade-low in late September. Rumors about a takeover of Ubisoft, behind video games like Assassin's Creed and Just Dance, have swirled for years, and private equity firms like Blackstone and KKR & Co. have previously considered buying out the company.

Compare price/earnings to a growth rate and you get PEG, the classic formula for measuring the price tag of a growth stock. But PEG has deep flaws. The superior Super PEG measures how much you pay now to get a certain level of earning power down the road, and then compares that to what you pay to get future earning power from the S&P 500 index.

The ultra-swank Yellowstone Club, located on a remote patch of Montana wilderness, is one of the world's most exclusive clubs: Those who want to be admitted must buy land, a home or a condo, which will set you back $10 million, even for the least expensive undeveloped plot. The club has fewer than 900 homeowners, worth more than a combined $290 billion, including Melinda French Gates and hedge fund tycoon Bill Ackman.

The Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest people has been published every year since 1982, and out of the total 1,739 featured, just 11 have made the list every year. They include Warren Buffett, worth $145.5 billion; Charles Koch, worth $67.5 billion; and Nike's Phil Knight, with a net worth of $36.5 billion.

Alphabet's self-driving car venture Waymo, the only commercial robotaxi service in the U.S., signed a ""multiyear"" agreement with Hyundai Motor to add electric Ioniq 5 hatchbacks to its Waymo One fleet starting next year. Currently, its U.S. fleet includes at least 1,000 electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs, and reducing costs is critical for Waymo to reach profitability, as it is quickly expanding its service area.

At a recruitment event for his fledgling AI company xAI, billionaire Elon Musk pitched the firm as the anti-OpenAI, calling the ChatGPT maker ""closed"" and profit-obsessed. Musk cofounded OpenAI with Sam Altman, but he has since left and sued the company twice, accusing OpenAI of abandoning its mission to build artificial intelligence to benefit humanity.

Out of office and back on the campaign trail, former President Donald Trump earned an estimated $218 million in operating income last year, roughly double what he made during his final year in the White House. Trump's golf portfolio now generates huge profits, with his golf-connected properties generating $74 million more in operating income last year than they did in 2020.

Perpetua Resources is set to resurrect a shuttered Idaho mine that will once again supply the Pentagon with vital weapons-grade antimony, bust a Chinese monopoly, and underwrite the rehabilitation of 20 miles of backcountry salmon streams. The surge in the price of gold since the pandemic is also propelling Perpetua, which expects to produce an average 300,000 ounces of gold per year at an average all-in cost of $650/oz and eventually generate hundreds of millions of dollars in annual profits.

Shares of Spirit Airlines fell 26% Friday after reports indicated the low-cost airline was exploring bankruptcy. In January, a federal judge blocked a $3.8 billion merger between Spirit and JetBlue, ruling it would eliminate the airline industry's popular discounted flight options and drive up prices.

If you need to renew your passport, now is the time: The average wait time is the shortest it's been in decades. The State Department said Thursday that the average processing time for passports has dropped to four to six weeks, which is a third as long as it took in 2021 during the pandemic backlog.

TOPLINE Over the last several months, joint state and federal task forces have raided more than 100 vape and smoke shops, hemp product manufacturers and distributors in North Carolina, alleging that they are selling marijuana disguised as hemp.

The 2018 Farm Bill allows the production of hemp and all its derivatives so long as it contains 0.3% of THC or less. In 2022, hemp-derived cannabinoid product sales hit $28 billion overall, while legal marijuana products generated $26 billion in sales during that same period, according to cannabis data firm Whitney Economics.

But hemp farmers, Whitney Economics estimates, have lost about $3.1 billion in annual sales due to the state bans and legal confusion that has followed.

Despite what the Farm Bill states, there is plenty of debate about whether hemp-derived THC products are legal under federal law. That's because hemp-derived cannabinoids -- including delta-9 THC and delta-8 THC (a less potent compound that is affectionately called ""weed lite"" or ""decaf kush"") -- are legal under the Farm Bill if those compounds are found naturally in the plant.

Yet most intoxicating hemp products on the market are made by converting hemp-derived CBD isolate into delta-9 THC or delta-8 THC using a chemical process.

North Carolina's crusade against hemp is not the only front in this war on drugs. Late last month, California Governor Gavin Newsom banned hemp-derived THC through an emergency order. Newsom said that the move was to prevent the sale of intoxicating hemp products to children.

But California also views hemp products as a threat to its struggling $5 billion legal marijuana market.

WHY IT MATTERS ""What's going on in the hemp industry right now shows how complicated and nuanced the legalization of cannabis can be,"" says Forbes staff writer Will Yakowicz. ""Even though marijuana and hemp are variations of the same plant -- Cannabis sativa L -- marijuana is still illegal at the federal level while hemp is legal.""

It's important not only to save for retirement but also to plan for the non-financial aspects. For instance, if you enjoy what you are doing or the social aspect of your job, consider working part-time to transition to full retirement. Take the time to build social connections outside of work, join community groups and develop hobbies. And don't wait until you retire to start traveling: Go when you can, because no one's health is guaranteed.

Making Crypto Bitcoin Less Cryptic,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/07/making-crypto-bitcoin-less-cryptic/,2024-10-07T12:16:35Z,"The buzz around cryptocurrencies is back with Bitcoin prices getting a boost this year and investors and the media renewing their interest. To a retail investor though, the question of particular interest is: What has changed fundamentally in the cryptocurrency arena to help Bitcoin prices swell more than 120% in the last twelve months?

The Bitcoin growth story does not end here. There is growing chatter about Bitcoin potentially breaching the $100K mark. Which, given the current price around $61,000, that would be a move of over 60% over several years. What remains to be seen is whether this story plays out the same way oil prices did during the 2008-09 financial crisis (the number 100 does tend to spook investors), or if the Bitcoin story has an altogether different ending.

The Bigger Picture

In general, investment assets are difficult to price using static demand-supply models. This is particularly true for cryptocurrencies. But, as in the case of any investment asset, expectations about demand and supply positions could help point in the general direction. Notably, Bitcoin prices over the years have primarily been driven by the perception of how a particular piece of news boosts or hurts the potential number of Bitcoin users and their transaction volume in the long run.

In this context, Bitcoin's demand position is primarily driven by two factors:

On the supply side, the number of available Bitcoins is capped, and almost 94% of the capped number is already mined. With limited supply side upside, it is sensible to focus on the demand - both in terms of users and transaction volumes.

Have any of the demand side factors really changed?

Several of them have!! The market has been making the right noises that paints a positive picture for crypto demand over the long term.

The first factor is the renewed belief that Bitcoins are a real substitute for the US dollar as a dependable exchange currency as well as asset class - especially with the uncertainties and doomsday stories surrounding the strength of the US dollar.

Renewed support of the political class is a close second factor, with both Trump and Harris coming out openly in support of new technologies and digital assets. This strengthens the belief that US government policies are likely to remain favorable for Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies going forward. In fact, over the last few years, adverse government actions and statements were key constraining factors in the movement of crypto prices. Additionally, it seems that major economies around the globe are slowly coming to terms with the crypto movement as there has not been any major adverse policy action in the recent past.

The third factor is the risk psychology of retail investors who find comfort in a new asset class when larger institutional investors take positions in it. In this aspect, the introduction of Blackrock's spot Bitcoin ETF is believed to have been a game changer with the fund being one of the fastest growing ETFs in the last few months. This has helped retain investor perception in 2 key ways:

Does Bitcoin look attractive now?

Overall, the performance of Bitcoin over the years has been extremely volatile. Returns for the asset were 60% in 2021, -64% in 2022, and 155% in 2023. In fact, consistent returns - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for any single asset class. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Given the current demand-supply dynamics, could Bitcoin be relegated to being a promising but underperforming asset class over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump to scale $100K?

Why the $100K mark is of interest

Interest on Bitcoin options at around the strike rate of $100K has been enormous as indicated by the jump in open interest at this strike. Any position is a two-way traffic where someone is willing to sell and someone is willing to buy. But increasing strike positions definitely signals an upward momentum.

Some of the positions are bound to be speculative in nature and such speculations would keep Bitcoin prices volatile and risky for short term investments. However, if the demand for Bitcoin holds up, it is a matter of time before Bitcoin prices cross the $100K barrier."
Helene Busts The Myth Of Climate Havens,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2024/10/07/helene-busts-the-myth-of-climate-havens-nuclear-ai/,2024-10-07T11:02:21Z,"Plus: Nuclear power gains favor -- but won't replace fossil fuels soon; Washington's Jay Inslee on AI and energy

or years, the clearest impacts of a warming climate across the U.S. were seen in bigger and more frequent western wildfires, droughts and heatwaves in the Southwest, coastal erosion and increasingly powerful hurricanes hammering Florida's low-lying coastline. But the monster storm generated by Hurricane Helen that dumped more than 40 trillion gallons of rain across the Southeast, killed hundreds, destroyed roads and infrastructure and left millions without power has dramatically reframed things.

The destruction caused by the worst U.S. storm since Hurricane Katrina was notable not simply for the scale but where it was concentrated: communities like Asheville and surrounding towns in North Carolina that are far inland, at a higher elevation, are more temperate and generally perceived as less prone to extreme weather events. Just as Canada's vast and brutal wildfires demonstrated in 2023, the effects of hotter, drier weather and intense, stronger and wetter hurricanes fueled by warming oceans that take longer to dissipate over land mean that no region is safe from a changing climate.

In the current presidential election, there's been far too little discussion about the climate crisis and need for the U.S. to accelerate the transition to zero-carbon energy, with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris offering no new plans to build on or expand the work done by President Biden through the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Meanwhile, Republican nominee Donald Trump talks mainly about boosting production of carbon-spewing oil and gas and suggesting rising sea levels are good because they create more ocean-front property (seemingly unaware his beloved Mar-a-Lago sits in a flood zone on Florida's porous bedrock).

Whether it's Asheville or Palm Beach, there are no climate havens.

Microsoft's recent announcement that it has inked a 20-year deal to buy power from a retired nuclear reactor at the notorious Three Mile Island site graphically illustrates a seismic shift in political attitudes toward nuclear power. Three Mile Island, of course, is where a nuclear reactor experienced a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries and no permanent damage.

Nonetheless, the accident freaked out the public, and the construction of new nuclear power facilities became politically radioactive. Attitudes are changing, in no small part because high tech -- once a font of antinuclear sentiment -- is a power hog and needs all the juice it can get. However, this segment of What's Ahead cautions that the realities of suffocating regulation and the time it takes to construct such facilities mean that no rapid energy rescue is in the offing.

What's your view of the conjunction between AI and climate and its benefits and risks?

I'm a lot more worried about natural stupidity than artificial intelligence because there's way too much of that going on right now. This is a double-edged sword because AI in many ways will help the clean energy revolution. It's going to help us decide what's the most effective silicon anode battery. It's going to help develop fusion. And by the way, I'm bragging about my state: we have three of the leading fusion companies in the United States within 10 miles of each other near Seattle, Washington.

AI can really help in the development of these things. To stop the development of a system that can help you develop clean energy technologies is probably not a really good idea.

But if you look at the [energy] numbers, they are massive. They are absolutely massive. One major company in our state had a reduction of about 30% of their goals just because of the AI requirements. We're facing this big time because I'm having trouble siting facilities for wind, storage and solar just to feed the AI centers.

It's not hard to site an AI center. Nobody objects to them. It's a black box. There's hardly anybody in the parking lot. They just sit there. But people do object to some of these other technologies. So we've got to find a way to cite these, the clean energy projects, in my book.

We're not going to stop the use of technology in my view.

How Donald Trump Earned $605 Million Over The Last Three Years,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2024/10/07/how-donald-trump-earned-605-million-over-the-last-three-years/,2024-10-07T10:34:24Z,"Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton made boatloads of money after leaving office -- yet still nowhere near as much as the richest president in American history.

onald Trump makes more money today than he has in years. Out of office and back on the campaign trail, the former president earned an estimated $218 million of operating income last year, roughly double what he made during his final year in the White House. What changed? Trump's golf game, mostly.

No longer just a diversion, the president's golf portfolio now generates huge profits, lifting his club business, hotel collection and licensing ventures. Trump's golf-connected properties generated an estimated $74 million more in operating income last year than they did in 2020. Add Mar-a-Lago, a private club with no course, and the increase rises to $91 million -- equal to 84% of Trump's overall jump in income.

Further padding profits, Trump also made money the way most former presidents do -- selling books and delivering speeches. He earned an estimated $5 million from such endeavors in 2023, up from just a couple hundred thousand while he was president. Another $5 million or so came from peddling NFTs.

Not every asset performed well. Trump's office and retail properties mostly flatlined, and his new social-media venture bled cash, though his stake in the unprofitable business is still worth $1.9 billion. The real-estate mogul's overall operating income totaled an estimated $605 million over his first three years out of office, from 2021 to 2023, far more than the $445 million he earned during his first three years as president, according to an analysis of tax returns, financial disclosures, bond filings, credit reports, regulatory filings and internal records.

Below, Forbes offers a business-by-business breakdown of the most lucrative post-presidency in U.S. history.

Trump's hotels, which lost an estimated $23 million in Covid-infected 2020, generated roughly $11 million of profit in 2021 -- all attributable to Trump National Doral, a golf resort in Miami. The four-course property earned an estimated $13 million, while the rest of Trump's hotel portfolio appears to have lost money. Trump also collected $6 million of appearance fees during his first year out of office, including $2.5 million for providing commentary on a fight featuring 58-year-old Evander Holyfield.

The company that runs Truth Social, Trump's Twitter knockoff, lost $23 million on an operating basis in 2022. That would have seemed like a significant amount if the former president, who owned 90% of the venture, weren't making so much money elsewhere. But profits at Trump's golf properties continued to climb, and his licensing business got a one-time bump from a property in Hawaii, which provided $13 million, possibly a breakup fee for a doomed deal.

As initiation fees at Mar-a-Lago approached a rumored $1 million, estimated operating profits reached a new high of $23 million in 2023. Trump's 10 U.S. golf clubs, meanwhile, hauled in an estimated $48 million, triple their average when Trump was in the White House. An extra boost came from Trump's 30% interest in 555 California Street, a San Francisco property that appears to have collected a tenant settlement of more than $20 million, propelling profits to an all-time high."

""The NOAA Hurricane Hunter crew reported that an eyewall has formed on the last center fix, suggesting that this system is ready to intensify quickly,"" the National Hurricane Center noted in its 11 a.m. EDT advisory. ""Given the track over the very deep warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and little shear for the next couple of days, rapid intensification is explicitly forecast.""

Helene was the hardest hit for the Tampa Bay area from a hurricane in 103 years, according to the Associated Press. Despite staying offshore, Helene inundated parts of the area with several feet of storm surge. Twelve people died in the Tampa area due to the surge, AP reported.

Milton will be the fifth hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. this year, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts 2024 will be one of the busiest hurricane seasons on record, estimating 8-13 hurricanes, including 4-7 major hurricanes.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Saturday declared a state of emergency for 35 counties, including all in the Tampa Bay area.

Milton is expected to arrive less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene, a major Category 4 storm, hit Florida on Sept. 26 and traveled 500 miles across the Southeastern U.S., causing heavy flooding in the Carolinas, Georgia, Virginia and Tennessee. At least 230 people across six states died as a result of the hurricane, which was the deadliest to hit the continental U.S. since Katrina in 2005. Helene made landfall near Perry, Florida, approximately 160 miles north of Tampa, with winds of 140 mph before it was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved northward.

What Presidential Candidates Can Teach Business Leaders About Branding,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardsegal/2024/10/06/what-presidential-candidates-can-teach-business-leaders-about-branding/,2024-10-06T15:09:33Z,"The strategies, tactics, and techniques that presidential candidates use to whip up and sustain energy, enthusiasm and support among voters can be employed by business leaders to successfully brand themselves and their companies.

Corporate executives can learn several lessons about effective branding by paying close attention to what the men and women who run for the White House say -- and how and why they say it.

Unless people can understand what you are saying and why, nothing else matters.

""One significant lesson is the importance of a clear message. Barack Obama's 2008 campaign with its crisp slogan 'Yes, we can!' is a powerful example. It encapsulates his mission and passion, much like companies need to crisply communicate their mission, vision, and values to resonate with their target audience,"" Greta Maiocchi, the head of marketing and recruitment at the Open Institute of Technology, said in an email interview.

""Clarity is the ultimate example of things CEOs and brands can learn from presidential candidates that follow that rule. Who remembers Donald Trump's slogan from 2016? Yup, you know the one -- and it's still being used by his campaigntoday. What about Hillary [Clinton's ] from back then? No idea. I am sure she had plenty of important things to say, but it wasn't clear enough for any of us to remember,"" Jo Caruna, founder and CEO of Finesse group, observed via email.

Make it as easy as possible for consumers to remember your messaging.

""The right marketing will be so simple that your clients can repeat it back to you -- rather than you having to constantly repeat it to them. Today Kamala Harris' is 'We're not going back' -- clear, easy to remember/repeat, and exactly what her target voter wants to hear,"" Caruna pointed out.

Coming across as fake and insincere can sink any branding campaign.

""Authenticity matters. Voters can see through manufactured personalities and disingenuous promises. Companies should build transparent brands that match their true values and mission,"" branding and expert Haiko de Poel noted out via email.

To ensure success, branding efforts need to stay current and in sync with those they are trying to reach.

""Politicans' methodsof staying relevant to their voters parallellshow brands must constantly evolve to stay relevant to their consumers. Politicians often adapt their strategies based on audience feedback and show agility and responsiveness, reinforcing the importance of being attuned to customers' evolving needs -- a lesson every brand should adopt,"" according to Maiocchi.

""As an example, take Elizabeth Warren's 2020 campaign which did [extensive testing] of slogans and messages to see what resonated with voters. This reflects an approach commonly used by brands and marketers to refine their messaging,"" she observed.

Telling stories will help to hold the attention of consumers, and avoid the risk of boring them.

""Politicians are masters of storytelling. They share powerful stories and testimonials to create an emotional connection with voters. Companies should do the same by highlighting customer success stories and sharing authentic experiences,"" according to branding expert Haiko de Poel

The more you know about your audience, the more likely it is that your messages will resonate with them.

""Deeply understanding your target audience is the cornerstone of branding. Trump has a laid-back, informal campaigning style, which resonates with his voters,"" Emily Williams, a content strategist and CEO of Web Copy Collective, pointed out via email.

By contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris ""has a disciplined, structured approach to campaigning, which connects more to her demographic. Policies aside, each does a great job of staying on brand and using that on their campaign,"" she noted.

""The most successful campaigns don't just broadcast a marketing message -- they create a movement that people feel compelled to join. For example, the Harris campaign has inspired voters to build their own diverse coalitions, like Win With Black Men, Beyhive for Kamala, Military Families for Kamala, Swifties for Harris, Republicans for Harris, and even White Dudes for Harris,"" Lakesha Cole, principal publicist at she PR, observed via email.

""These grassroots groups bring together people from different backgrounds, united by their shared belief in the candidate's vision and values. From a marketing perspective, these voter-led coalitions show the power of community-driven marketing,"" she said.

Build an identity that ""resonates so deeply with various audiences that they become advocates and feel personally invested in the brand's success,"" Cole advised.

""It's about turning customers into fans who will spread your message because they believe it represents them. The Harris campaign has shown that by embracing the unique identities and passions of these groups, you not only strengthen your core base but also expand your reach and impact. That's a powerful lesson for any CEO looking to build a brand that truly connects,"" she concluded.

The ability to quantify the impact and success of your branding campaigns is critical.

""Data-driven decisions are key. Politicians constantly analyze polls and metrics to optimize their messaging. Companies must analyze metrics like customer satisfaction, retention, and lifetime value to make strategic branding choices,"" Haiko de Poel suggested.

""An essential lesson comes from Barack Obama's campaign of 'Hope and Change.' He reinforced this message at every opportunity, silently affirming it through his demeanor, speeches, and the cultural zeitgeist he embodied. Corporations can learn the importance of consistency -- every touchpoint a customer has with your brand should uphold the key messaging and brand ethos,""Sarah Mitchell, marketing director for Relyir, said via email

Make sure that your branding efforts are in sync with what people know about the products or services you are marketing to them.

'""Politicians embody their branding -- every action and every statement aligns with their brand image. You can't dispute the fact that Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' and his bold, direct approach fed seamlessly into each other. Corporate leaders should similarly live their brand, fostering an authentic connection with consumers. "" according to Mitchell.

Don't zig and zag.

""Candidates who succeed do so by consistently communicating their values and vision across every platform, whether it's social media, TV, or live events. This is exactly what strong brands do -- they maintain a clear, unified message that resonates with their audience,"" Nikkia Adolphe, founding partner and head of media strategy at Tenet Consultancy, counseled via an email interview.

""A recent example is how President Biden's campaign consistently used the themes of 'restoration' and 'unity' to differentiate him from opponents, which created a strong emotional connection with voters,"" she concluded."
Trump's Wall Street Tower Appears To Be Underwater,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacheverson/2024/10/05/donald-trump-wall-street-tower-40-building/,2024-10-06T10:33:44Z,"At one of Trump's biggest buildings, profits are down, expenses are up and the mortgage is about to come due. It's all enough to push 40 Wall Street into the red.

ne of Donald Trump's prized properties, the landmark building 40 Wall Street, is 63 stories high but now appears to be underwater. The remaining 35 years on Trump's leasehold in the Financial District tower is worth about $116 million. That's $2 million less than the estimated $118 million Trump owes on his mortgage, according to an analysis of loan documents, real-estate records, financial disclosures and appraisals.

The building is simply not earning enough money to cover the loan: 40 Wall Street's annual net operating income has dropped from about $20.7 million in 2018 to $12.8 million last year, as the building's occupancy rate plummeted from 94.3% in early 2018 to 73.9% in June, thanks in part to the distressed post-pandemic commercial real estate market.

Adding to the headaches: Trump, who doesn't own the land on which the building sits, has just nine years left until his ground rent escalates dramatically, due to an agreement with the building's German owner. There is a good chance that if net operating income doesn't rebound that the new terms could potentially wipe out all of his profit.

Things could come to a head soon. Trump's debt is due in July but -- with an estimated $566 million of legal liabilities hanging over him and just $413 million of cash -- he does not have the funds to comfortably pay it all back. Refinancing will be hard, too, because any new lender would likely balk at the math behind the deal. That leaves the Republican presidential candidate in a tough spot as the November election approaches, short on funds to save one of his prized possessions.

riginally named after its primary tenant, the Manhattan Company, a bank whose founders included Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, 40 Wall Street was expected to be the tallest building in the world when construction began in 1929. But shortly after the 927-foot-tall Manhattan Company Building was finished 11 months later, it was bested by midtown's Chrysler Building, boosted by its massive spire that had been built in secret, according to New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission.

The business model for 40 Wall Street didn't work out according to the original plan either. Opening just months after the 1929 stock market crash that kicked off the Great Depression, would-be tenants backed out of their commitments, the commission wrote when designating the property a landmark decades later. Nine years after opening, the owners defaulted on interest, taxes and payments, lenders foreclosed on the building, and it was on the auction block, bought by bond holders for the outstanding principal on their loans, the New York Times reported in 1939.

As the American war-time economy ramped up, though, so too did 40 Wall Street, with some of the country's most-reputable tenants including Westinghouse and the Navy taking up quarters there in the 1940s. By 1944, the building was completely occupied for the first time, according to the Times.

The Manhattan Company merged with Chase Bank in 1955. While the new entity was headquartered at Chase's offices, it still maintained a bank and offices at 40 Wall Street, according to the landmark commission. But Chase sold its stake in the building in 1959, when a real estate firm consolidated ownership of 40 Wall Street, paying $32 million for the leasehold and the three separate parcels of land on which the building sits. The following year though, the development was split up again, with Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. buying the land and a London-based real estate company picking up the leasehold. In 1966, it sold the leasehold to the partners of a brokerage firm that was the building's largest tenant.

In 1982, Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda secretly invested in the building. That same year, a group of investors led by members of the reclusive Hinneberg family, a Hamburg, Germany-based shipping dynasty, bought the land from MetLife for $70 million, according to the Landmarks Preservation Commission. After Marcos was deposed, his assets were frozen and 40 Wall Street was auctioned off, again, seven years later. With downtown real estate in the dumps and the building reportedly in disrepair, in 1995, Trump picked up the building and its 1.1 million square feet of office from Citicorp, who had been stuck with it, for a mere $1.3 million. He also inked a 64-year ground lease with the Hinnebergs. Through five companies and a revocable trust of which he is the only beneficiary, Trump is the sole owner of the lease.

With a $5 million loan payment to Capital One coming due, in 2015, Trump refinanced the building, borrowing $160 million from Ladder Capital. Almost immediately the lender sliced up the debt into four separate notes and bundled it up with dozens of other properties that were then sold to investors. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for those four notes, Trump still owes a total of about $118 million of his original $160 million mortgage. That loan comes due in 10 months. Meanwhile, after speaking with experts in NYC commercial real estate, Forbes estimates Trump's leasehold is worth an estimated $116 million. That means Trump's equity could be worth less than zero, quite a drop from an estimated value of $80 million a year ago.

Wells Fargo, the bank servicing the commercial mortgage pass-through certificates that include Trump's loan, had enough concerns about his debt that it has been on a watchlist since December. The bank's accompanying note cites New York state's civil fraud verdict against Trump, 40 Wall Street's occupancy rate and the building's declining operating income to debt service ratio as reasons why.

When Trump took out that loan in 2015, 40 Wall Street's occupancy rate was 94.5%, about one percentage point higher than comparable rental properties, according to Ladder Capital. Up until 2019, the building's rate was pretty stable, ranging from 91% to 98%, per loan servicer reports. But then the Covid-19 pandemic hit, tanking the commercial real estate market, and 40 Wall Street's occupancy rate began dropping: 89.1% in 2019, 86.1% in 2021, 82.9% in 2022, 74.2% last year and 73.9% in June. One notable departure: retail pharmacy Duane Reade, which occupied 6.8% of the building, cleared out of 40 Wall Street in 2023, 4.5 years before its lease was set to expire, according to Morningstar.

Right now, the building's website advertises 73,000 square feet of ""select"" rental space available. The actual figure seems to be much higher according to the loan servicer's report: a 73.9% occupancy rate in a building with 1.2 million square feet of rentable space means that unoccupied area should be closer to 300,000 square feet. It's not clear if the information on the 40 Wall Street website was inaccurate or if new tenants have committed to moving in. Spokespeople for the Trump Organization did not respond to inquiries.

Not surprisingly, the decline in occupancy rate has coincided with a drop in the building's income, which fell from $41.7 million in 2019 to $30.9 million in 2022. An increase in the rent Trump collected last year, however, caused it to bounce back to $33 million (it's not immediately clear why the rent increased while occupancy decreased in 2023). Even still, when Trump signed the loan, Ladder Capital projected 40 Wall Street's annual gross income to be about $43.1 million. Not once has it reached that figure.

The building's annual operating expenses, meanwhile, have exceeded estimates. While Ladder Capital projected them to be $20.6 million a year, they've surpassed that figure every year since 2016, ranging from $20.9 million in 2017 to $23.6 million in 2019. Driven by repairs and maintenance costs that doubled Ladder Capital's estimates, operating expenses last year totaled $23.2 million.

Putting it all together, 40 Wall Street's net operating income in 2023 was $12.8 million. But leasing commissions, tenant improvements and other capital expenditures along with the annual $9.8 million payment to service his debt, resulted in 40 Wall Street putting just $1.2 million in Trump's pocket last year-a far cry from the $11 million Ladder Capital expected him to be raking in.

The future doesn't look any better. The lease Trump signed in 1995 requires him to pay the landowner about $2.5 million of annual rent right now. That is set to change dramatically, assuming he doesn't dump the leasehold or renegotiate. His payments on the ground lease are set to skyrocket in 2033, escalating to at least 6% of the value of the land, according to a lending prospectus. That shift would cause Trump's ground rent to soar from $2.8 million in 2032 to $16.3 million the following year, predicted Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate firm, in 2015 (the latest available). If the rest of 40 Wall Street's financial picture remained the same as it is today, that would leave Trump with a negative $5 million in net operating income in 2033.

Trump will likely struggle to find someone to loan him enough to pay off the entire principal when the mortgage comes due, given the shaky outlook of the real-estate market, the onerous terms of his lease, and the fact that he's likely underwater on his investment. Using his own money to pay off part of the principal and borrowing to cover the rest is still an option. Trump could also declare bankruptcy on 40 Wall Street (it would be his seventh bankruptcy, although it'd break new ground for him by being his first not involving a hotel). Unless Ladder Capital retained a stake in the loan, it will be in the clear, said Amiyatosh Purnanandam, a professor of finance at the University of Michigan. ""The losses will be borne by investors who own these certificates,"" Purnanandam said. ""They can range from banks to insurance companies to hedge funds.""

If Trump does stick around, he could renegotiate his leasehold with the German shipbuilding magnates, right around the time he is either beginning a potential second term as president or figuring out his next move."
Sense And Nonsense About Taxes,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngoodman/2024/10/05/sense-and-nonsense-about-taxes/,2024-10-06T01:51:36Z,"As we draw closer to the November elections, there is an inordinate amount of attention being paid to ""disinformation,"" and a great deal of fact-checking of candidates' statements.

Yet here are four surprising facts: (1) the subject on which there is the most disinformation is ""taxes""; (2) almost all the disinformation comes from the left; (3) it is spread to the general public by the mainstream media; and (4) it is almost never fact-checked.

Most of the benefits of the 2017 (Trump) tax cuts went to the rich.

The tax code today is just as progressive (if not more so) than it was before the tax cuts went into effect.

Surprisingly, both these statements are true. The first statement is true but misleading. The second statement is simply true.

What is rarely said in policy debates is that for the most part, half the population isn't paying income taxes at all. Specifically, the top one-half of taxpayers are paying 97.9% of all income taxes, while the bottom half pays a paltry 2.3%. So, it's hard to think of a tax cut that wouldn't confer most of the benefits on the top half of the income distribution.

Progressivity is a different matter. Suppose we cut everyone's taxes by 1%. For a millionaire, that would be $10,000. For a $30,000-a-year worker, that would be $300. That's a big difference in raw numbers. But from an equality standpoint, everyone's share of the country's after-tax income would be the same both before and after the tax cut.

If we define the rich broadly (to refer to the upper half), their share is already approaching 100% and that is as high as it can go. But even if we are talking about the really rich, their share is quite high.

The top 1% (people who earned more than $682,577 in 2021) paid 45% of all income taxes collected that year. The top 10% (earning more than $169,800) paid three-fourths of all income taxes.

This reflects the fact that the United States has the most progressive tax system in the world. We tax the rich proportionally more than any other country.

Why is our income tax system so progressive?

Although they don't like to talk about it, Republicans are the main reason. Going all the way back to Ronald Reagan, every Republican tax bill threw more and more people off the income tax rolls. Through this and other provisions, Republicans have been shifting the tax burden to the rich every time they have legislated on taxes.

Both private and government analyses confirm that the same is true of the 2017 tax reform law. In 2018, the top 20 percent of the income distribution faced a lower tax rate, but they paid a larger share of the total tax burden than the year before.

Had Democratic opponents had their way, the share of the tax burden would actually be lower for the rich and higher for low- and moderate-income families than it is today.

What about corporate taxes?

Although corporations send checks to the U.S. Treasury, economists do not regard corporate entities as bearing the real burden of taxation. That burden is borne by people in their role as shareholders, workers, customers, etc.

The Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimates that 20% of the corporate income tax is paid by labor in the form of lower wages and 80% is paid by capital (lower dividends and interest payments, for example). For certain types of tax changes, the TPC assumes a 50/50 split. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assumes that 25% is paid by labor, and it is the official score keeper for Congress.

When Joe Biden and Kamala Harris say that raising the corporate income tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent will not result in a tax on anyone earning less than $400,000, almost no economist will agree with that assertion. If members of Congress vote for the measure, they will be instructed by the CBO that they are voting to take one out of every four dollars of increased government revenue out of the pockets of ordinary American workers.

Also, remember that workers are also shareholders through their pension plans, 401(k) plans and IRA accounts. So, to the extent that corporate taxes fall on capital, workers bear part of that burden as well.

The most sophisticated model of international capital flows and corporate taxes ever developed has been produced by Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff and his colleagues. Their finding: the burden of corporate taxation is almost entirely shifted to labor. If Kotlikoff and his colleagues are right, then almost all of the Biden/Harris proposed increase in corporate taxes will come out of the pockets of people who make less than $400,000 a year.

Taxing capital gains

Last time I checked, the stock price of Microsoft was $416. That's what investors have to pay for the right to share in the company's earnings indefinitely into the future, as long as they hold the stock. The world ""future"" is key. If a sell my share after a rise in price, I will have a capital gain. But that gain does not reflect any increase in income to Microsoft. It merely reflects a change in the market's expectations.

Eventually the future will arrive, Microsoft will experience real earnings, and investors will pay taxes on those earnings. That's why we don't need a capital gains tax on the trading of Microsoft stock. Eventually, all of Microsoft earnings will be taxed by regular income taxes.

It is noteworthy that capital gains are not included in the calculation of GDP. They are nowhere to be found in our national income accounts. Ditto for capital losses.

If there were a logical reason to tax capital gains, there would be an equally compelling reason to allow the full deduction of capital losses. But were that allowed, the government would probably get no net income in the process. By way of analogy, the only reason the government collects any money by taxing the winnings of gamblers is because it doesn't allow them a full deduction for their losses.

Taxing unrealized capital gains is even harder to justify. It would be like taxing the gambler -- not at the end an evening of gaming, but after each time a roll of the dice produces a win, while ignoring each time there is a loss.

What is wrong with taxing investment to pay for consumption?

Take the progressive $5 trillion plan for cradle-to-the-grave benefits, including child care, elder care and everything in between. Like the idea of taxing unrealized capital gains, almost all progressive ideas for new revenue involve confiscating funds that are now in the capital market and using those funds to pay for current consumption.

But less investment means slower economic growth. And that means our children and grandchildren will have a lower standard of living. And since economic growth is the greatest anti-poverty program ever discovered, slower growth means more people will continue to live in poverty for a longer period of time.

That's why many economists - on the right and the left - advocate a progressive consumption tax, with no tax on saving and investment. That would be a fairer tax. It would tax the rich for what they take out of the economy by consuming, but not tax them on what they contribute to the economy by saving and investing."

Horowitz, who said in his email Harris was a friend to his venture capital firm in its early days, planned to support Trump just three months ago, when The Information reported he and Andreessen told employees they were going to donate to PACs supporting Trump. The co-founders pledged their support for Trump before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and later posted a podcast explaining their rationale for backing Trump. Horowitz and Andreessen's support for Trump was rooted in anticipation for the loosening of regulations in cryptocurrency.

How Will The 2024 Election Impact Your Job? Changes To Expect At Work,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianehamilton/2024/10/05/how-will-the-2024-election-impact-your-job-changes-to-expect-at-work/,2024-10-05T14:51:37Z,"The 2024 election could bring major changes to your workplace -- whether you're in HR, a team leader, or an employee. Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have very different approaches to labor laws, unions, diversity programs, and technology in the workplace. These shifts might impact you directly, so here's what you can expect and what you can do to stay ahead.

If Trump Wins: Expect fewer regulations. Companies may have more flexibility with how they classify employees (think freelancers vs. full-time staff). For gig workers, this could mean changes in benefits or job status, so it's important to stay informed.

If Harris Wins: Stronger worker protections could come into play, including a higher minimum wage and expanded family leave. While this could mean more benefits for you, companies may need time to adapt, so changes might not happen immediately.

Something To Consider: When California introduced new gig worker laws, companies like Uber and Lyft had to rethink their worker classifications. You might see similar shifts at your own company, depending on how the election goes.

If Trump Wins: Union activity might decrease, especially if fewer regulations are put in place to support organizing. This could mean less pressure to unionize, but companies will still need to focus on employee satisfaction to avoid workplace issues.

If Harris Wins: Expect more union influence. This could lead to stronger job protections, particularly if you're in a unionized industry. You may see more negotiations around wages, benefits, and working conditions.

Something To Consider: Companies like Amazon have faced increasing pressure from workers to unionize, especially during leadership changes. Depending on the election results, you might see more -- or fewer -- attempts like this at your own workplace.

If Trump Wins: DEI initiatives may receive less government support, but most companies will likely continue these programs. DEI is a key factor in attracting top talent, so you can expect companies to stay committed to fairness and inclusion, even without a regulatory push.

If Harris Wins: There may be stronger government oversight on DEI programs. Policies around pay equity, anti-discrimination, and diversity could become more visible, and companies might have to follow stricter guidelines for reporting and transparency.

Something To Consider: When Starbucks faced backlash over its handling of diversity issues, the company responded by doubling down on DEI efforts. Regardless of political changes, many companies will take similar action to protect their brand and reputation.

If Trump Wins: With fewer regulations on AI, companies might adopt technology more quickly to streamline hiring and performance management. While this could lead to greater efficiency, it's essential to understand how AI might impact your job and how decisions are made.

If Harris Wins: Expect stricter regulations around AI, especially when it comes to fairness and preventing bias. You may see more transparency in how AI tools are used to make hiring, promotion, and performance decisions.

Something To Consider: Large companies like IBM and Google have been early adopters of AI in their HR practices. Depending on how the election goes, your company might follow suit -- either with more freedom or under stricter oversight."
Tax Breaks: The There's No Crying In Baseball Edition,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2024/10/05/tax-breaks-the-theres-no-crying-in-baseball-edition/,2024-10-05T14:08:01Z,"This is a published version of our weekly Forbes Tax Breaks newsletter.

My grandfather worked his entire life. By the time he reached what we would consider ""retirement age,"" he was still working. Farming and other manual labor had taken their toll on his body, so in his mid-70s, he would suit up in his uniform as a security guard and work nights at the local hospital. He was gone a lot. But on those hot, sticky summer afternoons in the south, when he had a free moment, he and I would sit and watch baseball on the old TV in the family room (for the record, he was a Cubs fan). Those are some of the most special memories of my life, and I suspect they are why I love baseball to this day.

I'll bet you have a similar story. For many, especially those of us in the U.S., baseball is synonymous with childhood summers and evening games of catch.

Baseball has been on the minds of many folks this week -- and not just because of the World Series. Earlier this week, baseball great Pete Rose died at age 83. I noted (☆) that if you asked ten people what they think about Rose, you'd likely get ten different answers. Rose's resume dazzles on paper -- he still holds several baseball records, including the major league record for games played (3,562) and plate appearances (15,890). He racked up multiple awards, including two Golden Gloves (1969 and 1970), Silver Slugger (1981), and World Series MVP (1975). But he had his vices and polarized the baseball community. He admitted to cheating on his taxes -- for which he did jail time -- and betting on baseball. The latter is why he died without seriously being considered for the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Those hot, sticky summers? I spent them in my native state of North Carolina. The stories coming out of western North Carolina -- and neighboring states -- are heartbreaking. Recovery will be slow and expensive. If you can be generous and help, please do (here's how). Many Americans donate even if they can't claim a tax deduction. But some of the tax rules that apply are good to follow even if you're not claiming a tax deduction.

The IRS acted quickly (☆) to announce relief for individuals and businesses affected by the storm, including the entire states of Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina and parts of Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia. These taxpayers now have until May 1, 2025, to file various federal individual and business tax returns and make tax payments. That date is particularly noteworthy as it's after the traditional tax filing deadline of April 15, 2025. Additionally, some of the areas hit by Helene were already extended because of Hurricane Debby -- those due dates have also been pushed forward to May 1, 2025.

The recent damage to communities caused by natural disasters has renewed discussions about climate change. According to the United Nations, as greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sun's heat, leading to climate change. As a result, the world is warming faster than ever in recorded history. As policymakers seek to curb greenhouse gas emissions through taxation, the star of the show has always been carbon dioxide, but methane emissions are a significant challenge that also require attention. So why is it essential to address methane emissions, and what policy tools are we seeing in this area? Tax Notes contributing editor Nana Ama Sarfo tackles this issue in the latest episode of the Tax Notes Talk (transcript available).

Another controversial topic in the tax world is also getting a new look -- whistleblowers. Earlier this year, the annual report to Congress issued by the IRS Whistleblower Office (WBO) suggested more taxpayers than ever (☆) are blowing the whistle on bad tax behavior. The IRS paid whistleblowers 121 awards totaling $88.8 million in 2023 -- those amounts correspond to information that resulted in tax collections of $338 million. That's a significant increase from the total whistleblower awards paid in 2022 when just $37.8 million were distributed.

The WBO has recently announced some significant awards (details on two can be found here). The WBO has also revised its part of the Internal Revenue Manual and provided guidance on when the WBO will ""disaggregate"" claims, i.e., make partial awards. This issue of partial awards has been a significant one. A classic example involves a criminal tax case that has been settled and all dollars collected, but there is an open civil tax matter. The WBO has historically waited for the civil matter to be resolved before paying. Whistleblowers, writes Dean Zerbe, have been in Mudville -- with no joy (a bonus baseball reference).

Much of coming forward with a whistleblower claim -- or defending an action based on such a claim -- relies on having great records. Many people face the dilemma of what to do with old tax returns and supporting paperwork, often wondering when it's safe to discard them. However, determining the right time can be tricky, especially for taxpayers with foreign assets. Those with overseas financial interests must pay particular attention for many reasons, including expanded statutes of limitation that permit an indefinite IRS audit timeline and problems in retrieving records from foreign institutions, which can often be more challenging.

Speaking of records, it's possible that a few could be broken in the coming weeks. I know the extended tax deadline is just days away, but the World Series postseason heats up this weekend. Let's hope your team wins (and hopefully, your team will also be the Phillies).

Most taxpayers opt for the standard deduction -- but not all taxpayers understand why that happens. For most taxpayers, it comes down to numbers.

If your total deductions on Schedule A exceed the standard deduction for your filing status, you can claim that amount instead -- these are your itemized deductions. Itemized deductions include, among other things, the home mortgage interest deduction, medical and dental expenses, taxes paid (including up to $10,000 of state and local income taxes), and charitable gifts. If the total of those deductions exceeds the standard deduction for your filing status, you will (in most cases) want to claim itemized deductions instead of the standard deduction. If the total of those deductions is less than the standard deduction for your filing status, you will want to claim the standard deduction.

If you're not sure whether you'll want to take the standard or the itemized deduction, and the math in your head makes it seem too close to call, run the numbers and see which is the most beneficial. If you're using tax software, that should be pretty simple, ditto if you're using a tax preparer.

As with almost everything tax-related, there are some exceptions. You cannot use the standard deduction if you file as married filing a separate return and your spouse itemizes deductions; you are a nonresident alien or a dual-status alien during the year; or you are filing a tax return for less than 12 months because of a change in your annual accounting method.

The 2017 tax reform changed the game for many taxpayers -- the much larger standard deduction, together with limits on mortgage and SALT deductions and the elimination of other deductions (like unreimbursed job expenses, including the home office deduction for employees), made itemizing deductions less appealing. The overwhelming majority of taxpayers now claim the standard deduction -- for 2021, nearly nine out of ten taxpayers (88.2%) claimed the standard deduction.

For the tax year 2024, the standard deduction is $14,600 for individuals and married couples filing separately, an increase of $750 from 2023. Married couples filing jointly can claim $29,200, a boost of $1,500 from 2023, while heads of household can claim $21,900, an increase of $1,100 from 2023.

You are entitled to a higher standard deduction if you are age 65 or older at the end of the year (for this purpose, you are considered 65 on the day before your 65th birthday). If you are blind on the last day of the year, you are also entitled to a higher standard deduction.

For 2024, the standard deduction amount for an individual who may be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer cannot exceed the greater of $1,300 or the sum of $450, and the individual's earned income (not to exceed the regular standard deduction amount).

I'm buying a house. I am married. How much can each of our parents, three in total, give us in gift money before taxes?

Each year, you can make gifts up to the federal gift tax exclusion amount to as many people as you like without any gift tax consequences. For 2024, that number is $18,000, up from $17,000 in 2023. That means that any person can gift you $18,000 without gift tax consequences -- or they could gift 10 people $18,000 without gift tax consequences.

(The annual exclusion for federal gift tax purposes is predicted to increase to $19,000 in 2025.)

So, doing the math from your question, your three parents can gift you and your spouse a total of $108,000 ($18,000 limit x 3 donors x 2 recipients).

Here's where it gets tricky. If a gift exceeds the $18,000 limit for 2024, most taxpayers don't automatically pay gift tax. Instead, the amount of the gift over the $18,000 limit ""chips away"" at your available federal estate tax exemption -- for 2024, that's $13,610,000 per person.

Let's assume your father gifted you $1,018,000 -- that amount is $1 million over the annual gift tax exclusion. Instead of paying gift tax on the $1 million, your father would file a gift tax return (Form 709) notifying the IRS that his exemption is reduced by $1 million. At death, he would only be able to pass $12,610,000 to his heirs, federal estate tax free (assuming he died in 2024-the federal estate tax exemption can vary from year to year due to inflation and, of course, any changes in the law).

The reality? Most taxpayers are not subject to the federal estate or gift tax.

The IRS has announced that the number of states offering Direct File will double for the 2025 tax filing season to 24. For the next filing season, Direct File will be available in Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. That means 62% of Americans will live in states offering Direct File.

In addition to expanding the number of participating states, Direct File will now cover additional types of income, credits, and deductions. It's estimated that more than 30 million taxpayers will be eligible to use Direct File in the 2025 filing season.

With about a month left before the elections, the highly critiqued ""no tax on tips"" proposal promoted by both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is still a talking point. Tax experts appear to hate everything about these proposals -- Steve Rosenthal of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center spoke for many with his list of complaints. ""In tax policy, we evaluate proposed reforms by how well they promote equity, efficiency, and revenue,"" he wrote in a recent piece for Forbes. ""'No taxes on tips' fails all three tests by singling out certain taxpayers for relief but not others similarly situated; distorting compensation arrangements and labor markets; and losing substantial revenue, potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in the first 10 years.""

And, one of the worst things about the proposals is how ineffective they would be at actually helping tipped workers. The Budget Lab at Yale University noted in a recent report that ""about 4% of families report tips to the IRS, and those who do are disproportionately young, unmarried, and lower-income. This means that many tipped workers do not pay income tax to begin with and would not benefit from a new deduction.""

A little history, writes Tax Notes' Joseph Thorndike, can illuminate today's rush to exempt tips from taxation. Here's more.

Here's what readers clicked through most often last week:

While the official numbers are generally available at the end of the year, estimates suggest that the New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, and my own Philadelphia Phillies will be subject to the luxury tax for the 2024 season.

By rule, teams that exceed the payroll threshold are subject to the luxury tax -- for 2024, that number is $237 million. The tax is figured on each dollar that payrolls are above the threshold, and the tax rate increases based on the number of consecutive years a club has exceeded the threshold (for the first year, there's a 20% tax on all overages, for the second consecutive year, the tax is 30%, and for the third consecutive year or more, it's 50%).

Tops on the list for the season will likely be the New York Mets, who are paying more money to players no longer on their roster ($70.3 million) than the entire total the A's are paying for players on their team ($60.5 million).

'Doge In The Treasury' -- Mark Cuban Teases Wild Donald Trump And Elon Musk Plan To Pay Off $35 Trillion Of U.S. Debt With Bitcoin And Crypto Amid Price Boom,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/05/doge-in-the-treasury-mark-cuban-teases-wild-donald-trump-and-elon-musk-plan-to-pay-off-35-trillion-of-us-debt-with-bitcoin-and-crypto-amid-price-boom/,2024-10-05T12:19:47Z,"Bitcoin and crypto traders have been told to ""expect fireworks"" this month as BlackRock's chief executive issues a ""crazy"" Federal Reserve warning.

The bitcoin price has roared back after plummeting below $60,000 per bitcoin this week as former U.S. president Donald Trump's China nightmare suddenly seems to be coming true.

Now, after Tesla billionaire Elon Musk warns the U.S. could collapse into ""bankruptcy"" due to its debt spiraling out of control, billionaire investor Mark Cuban has teased a plan floated by Donald Trump to pay off U.S. national debt with bitcoin or crypto -- and the Doge Department of Government Efficiency proposed by Elon Musk.

""We don't know what Elon would actually do,"" Cuban said during an appearance on the All-In Podcast alongside fellow investors David Friedberg, Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis and David Sacks, responding to a question about how the U.S. could begin to tackle its huge debt pile that's rocketed to over $35 trillion this year.

""Maybe [he'll] put doge in the the Treasury, who knows and that's how we make it all up,"" Cuban joked, referring to Elon Musk's on-again-off-again relationship with the meme-based bitcoin rival dogecoin.

In July, Cuban called the growing support among Silicon Valley founders, investors and executives for Republican 2024 White House hopeful Donald Trump a ""bitcoin play,"" predicting a bitcoin price boom if Trump wins next month's election.

Cuban, who's an outspoken Democrat, supporter of U.S. president Joe Biden and famously said in 2018 he'd rather have bananas than bitcoin, became a bitcoin and crypto convert through the Covid pandemic and has warned that Trump could win the 2024 election due to president Joe Biden's opposition to crypto.

Earlier this year, Trump floated the possibility of using bitcoin to pay off the U.S.'s $35 trillion debt pile.

""Crypto is a very interesting thing,"" Trump told Fox Business in August. ""Maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion dollars, hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our $35 trillion.""

Earlier, during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, Trump promised to create a ""strategic national bitcoin reserve"" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold's $16 trillion market capitalization.

Speaking in September at the Economic Club of New York, Trump proposed creating a government efficiency commission and said Elon Musk had agreed to ""head that task force"" -- with Musk branding it the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge.

Both Musk and Cuban have helped dogecoin -- a tongue-in-cheek fork of bitcoin -- become one of the world's largest cryptocurrencies over the last few years.

The dogecoin price rocketed along with bitcoin and the wider crypto market in 2021 before crashing back but holding on to far more of its value than most of its critics predicted."
5 Questions For The Fed's Austan Goolsbee -- Including: Did They Move Fast Enough On Inflation?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/05/5-questions-for-the-feds-austan-goolsbee-including-did-they-move-fast-enough-on-inflation/,2024-10-05T12:09:41Z,"It's an unusually tense time at the Federal Reserve as Democrats and Republicans -- including former President Donald Trump -- target the central bank as it starts cutting rates in its most significant monetary policy in decades. Forbes spoke with Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, an alternate member on the highly watched Federal Open Market Committee and a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Obama, about how ""super serious"" central bankers feel about becoming a political football ahead of the election, how the Fed is adjusting to easing inflation and growing recession angst, and what he'd change about the ""behind the curve"" policy leading to the worst inflation crisis in the U.S. since the early 1980s.

Forbes: Have there been any discussions at Federal Open Market Committee meetings about pressure from both sides of the political aisle to act in a certain way heading into the election? Context: The FOMC is the U.S. central bank panel that votes on the target federal funds rate, which heavily influences interest rates on loans across the country, impacting inflation, economic growth and unemployment. The Fed is under heightened scrutiny after rolling out the first interest rate cuts since early 2020 last month. The reaction function refers to how a central bank responds to one event, like lowering rates when inflation rises.

When you become a sworn member of the Federal Reserve, you're out of the election business. Everybody takes that super seriously. The things that determine our decisions are: What are the economic conditions and what are the forecasts. What would we need to see to stop raising? What would we need to see to hold? What do we need to see for stuff to come down? We've been laying out the criteria, and now we're just seeing come to pass the stuff that we've been forecasting, and so the reaction function is pretty well established.

Forbes: What are the data points in the labor market that you are paying the closest attention to meeting to meeting? Context: We interviewed Goolsbee two days before the September jobs report surprisingly revealed the strongest job growth since March, decelerating bets on continued aggression from the Fed on lowering rates and throwing another wrench into the central bank shift as borrowing costs look less likely to tumble.

Goolsbee: The unemployment rate, but everybody knows that. A little bit less, the payroll, job employment numbers. There was a time when, if you had asked me ""what's the single most important number?"" I probably would have said that, but not now, with the uncertainty about immigration and the uncertainty about these [revisions to jobs data].

This has been such a strange, unprecedented moment of new firm creation and self employment and different work arrangements. I think that's why we're having such major revisions on these [data points]. All of those things make me put a little bit less weight [on monthly nonfarm payrolls] since there's more of a question mark around [them]. All the measures that we tend to look at as economists to track the labor market - the ratio of vacancies to the number of unemployed, the employment-to-population ratio of prime age workforce, the quit rate, hiring rate, all of those things, plus the the new unemployment claims - I feel like they're all kind of saying the same thing.

The rate of change is all in the direction of cooling. And if you look in the past, it's quite rare that you see cooling labor markets that just settle into full employment. Usually, when things start to go bad, they keep getting worse. And so that's our challenge now: After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?

Forbes: Let's imagine we have that crystal ball and we're able to look forward to the end of next year. We officially stick the landing, core PCE runs right in that sweet spot of about 2%, and the federal funds rate falls to right around the median forecast around 3%. What risks for the second half of the decade are you most worried about? Context: Core PCE is the Fed's favored inflation metric as it tracks how much Americans spend monthly on goods and services outside of more volatile food and energy categories. Projections shared at the FOMC's latest meeting indicate officials have a median forecast of 3.4% at the end of 2025.

Goolsbee: It's productivity growth.

For productivity growth, the [data] matters the most over the long run, and in the short run, it's one of the most noisy [data points] there is. So that's why it's kind of hard to take that into account in the meeting-to-meeting monetary policy decisions. We saw wild swings in that over Covid...but in the last year-and-a-half, that growth rate of productivity has been averaging well higher than the trend before Covid.

Is that a sign that technology has changed, or is it AI? Is it something else? Is it hybrid work? Is it the business dynamism that we've had all these startups? Because if the productivity growth rate is going to be higher, even if not permanent [but] for the medium term, then the second half of the decade we're going to have a bunch of discussions like the second half of the 1990s, where there was an extended increase in the productivity growth rate. The implications for the economy are that you can grow faster and have more job growth without inflation in a world like that.

And income, wages are going to go up. Nobody needs to be nervous about wages going up at fast rates, because productivity growth will justify it. To me, that's an overwhelmingly important factor that we're going to have to think about in this second half.

Forbes: You're allowed to time travel back to mid-to-late 2021, right before inflation skyrocketed, and you can change one policy within relative reason. What do you choose? Context: After a decade of sub-3% inflation, prices began rising rapidly in 2021, and consumer price index inflation peaked in June 2022 at a 41-year high of 9.1%. The Fed didn't raise rates, the most common response to inflation, until March 2022, and raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to a two-decade high of over 5% in a 16-month span.

Goolsbee: I think looking back, if you had one thing to change, if you could know that the supply shocks were not going to be transitory in the three or four months sense, you would have started moving earlier.

You would not have been raising with this kind of rapidity that the Fed engaged in, 500 basis points in one year. That's about as fast as it's ever gone up. You would have started earlier but also realistically, I think it's worth considering how much lower you think inflation would be if they had done that. If you could have a crystal ball and have perfect timing and recognize it's not going to be a temporary supply shock lasting three months, it's going to be a temporary supply shock lasting two years, how much less would inflation be?

There were a lot of countries that tried both monetary and fiscal policy a lot of different ways, and, for the most part, they basically had the same inflation experience. It is instructive that there are limits to what the Fed could have done. But if I had one thing to do over - I wasn't on the FOMC at that time - but looking back, they were behind the curve, slow to move.

Forbes: I know you're a big fan of ""The Simpsons"" - what do you think Mr. Burns would want the FOMC to do now? What's the conversation like at Moe's tavern when CNBC comes on after the last FOMC meeting? Context: Goolsbee often references ""The Simpsons,"" the animated comedy which features curmudgeonly nuclear power tycoon Mr. Charles Burns and the pub ""Moe's Tavern,"" where Homer Simpson and his more working class drinking buddies congregate.

Goolsbee: Mr. Burns has, in various episodes, lots of cash, lots of equity and/or lots of bonds. So does he want high rates or low rates? I would like to think Mr. Burns, just out of his own pure self-interest, wants whatever is good for the economy. Financial stability seems like it is the order of the day for him. At Moe's Tavern, there's one of the episodes where they're showing old presidential debates, and Kennedy's like, 'I'd like to express my fondness for Duff beer,' and Richard Nixon's like, 'I would also like to express my fondness for that particular beer,' and it cuts Moe's Tavern. And they're like, 'That guy never drank a Duff in his life!' And I fear that Moe's Tavern, they would not be super enamored of the FOMC, but they should be. We're not the bad guys. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

[Goolsbee revised his Burns response in an email: ""Burns is a notorious gold bug that's still complaining that the Coinage Act got rid of the ha'penny in 1857. He's had it out for the Fed since we tipped off authorities in season 9 that he was the one who stole the 1 Trillion dollar bill after WWII.""]"
Perfect Streaks: These 11 Billionaires Have Never Missed The Forbes 400 List,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahyoung/2024/10/05/perfect-streaks-these-11-billionaires-have-never-missed-the-forbes-400-list/,2024-10-05T10:39:03Z,"Making, and staying on, Forbes' ranking of the richest people in America is no easy feat. Only 11 out of 1,739 have made it every single year since inception.

ver the 43 years Forbes has published The Forbes 400, a total of 1,739 moguls, heirs and celebrities have made the ranking of America's richest people. Economic booms, busts, good old fashioned competition -- and, of course, father time -- have ensured that the list has never featured the exact same 400 people two years in a row. A few flashes in the pan only make the grade for a year. Many others spend a decade or two in the ranks before dropping off or passing away. But a lucky few -- the legendary 11 -- have had staying power, managing to earn a spot on The Forbes 400 every year since its 1982 inception.

In all, they are worth an estimated $342.3 billion today, up from $3.8 billion all the way back in 1982 when they first appeared on Forbes' ranking (equivalent to $12.2 billion in today's dollars), meaning they have grown their wealth by some 8,900%, more than double the 4,200% growth of the S&P 500. Their average age is 88.

When Forbes first published The Forbes 400, Warren Buffett was the 52-year-old chairman of a $1.5 billion (assets) Berkshire Hathaway. ""Lives modestly,"" we wrote. ""Estimated net worth: $250 million."" Four decades later, Berkshire's assets have surpassed $1 trillion and Buffett is the fifth-richest person in America, and the wealthiest ""billionaire streaker"" never to miss The Forbes 400. His $150 billion net worth is 187 times his 1982 stash, even after adjusting for inflation. (He'd be even richer but for the fact that he's also America's most generous philanthropist.)

Only 4 of the 11 are self-made. In addition to Buffett, two retail and fashion tycoons earned their way onto the lists thanks to their world-renowned brands: Nike's Phil Knight and Les Wexner, the disgraced L Brands founder behind Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. The fourth self-made icon is Donald Bren, the richest real estate developer in the nation, whose Irvine Co. owns 129 million square feet of real estate, mostly in Southern California.

The remaining seven all got started with substantial help from their families though all but one were able to turn millions into billions. Among them: the 17th-richest person in America Charles Koch; Leonard and Ron Lauder, sons of Estée Lauder; and media giant Donald Newhouse, whose family has investments in Conde Nast, Warner Bros. Discovery and social news site Reddit.

Four other members of the inaugural 1982 ranking made the list in 2024 but fell off at least once along the way. Star Wars billionaire George Lucas dropped off in 1983 due to a divorce settlement, but rejoined in 1996 during the planning stage of the franchise's prequel trilogy. Former president Donald Trump disappeared from the ranks amid his 1990s bankruptcies, and again in 2021 and 2023, but is back among the top 400 this year thanks, largely, to his Truth Social platform. Oil heir Sid Bass didn't make the cut in 2021, while FedEx founder Fred Smith spent a total of 6 years off the list.

Many of the original 1982 Forbes 400 listees have since died. That includes comedian Bob Hope (d. 2003), who only made the list once; mobster Meyer Lansky (d. 1983); Steve Jobs (d. 2011); and shipping tycoon Daniel Ludwig (d. 1992), the richest person in America in 1982, worth $2 billion ($6.4 billion in today's dollars). Others who made the original minimum net worth of $100 million (equivalent to $320 million today) -- including musician Yoko Ono and heir Timothy Mellon -- have either transferred their fortunes to heirs or were simply overtaken in worth by the likes of tech moguls, social media stars and crypto bulls."
Barack Obama Joining Harris Campaign Trail In Final Election Stretch: What To Know About His Campaign Strategy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/10/04/barack-obama-joining-harris-campaign-trail-in-final-election-stretch-what-to-know-about-his-campaign-strategy/,2024-10-04T22:45:01Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign hopes to get a boost as former President Barack Obama sets out to stump for her in swing states, adding a Democratic heavyweight to campaign events with a history of success in grassroots outreach and digital focus.

Harris' campaign has hired key Obama pollsters, speechwriters, aides, strategists and advisers like David Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager; Stephanie Cutter, a former deputy campaign manager and strategist; and Mitch Stewart, an organizing operative, among others. The two politicians differ, but the buzz around Harris' campaign compares to Obama's 2008 campaign by promoting a positive outlook, Jamal Simmons, a former Harris adviser, told Reuters. Simmons is pointing to Harris' campaign promotion of ""a new way forward"" with joy and positivity, while Obama's campaign became associated with hope and change, a winning message considering the sweeping victory it brought. ""This is already a sharp contrast to the Clinton 2016 and Biden 2020 campaigns, which did not have the same authentic groundswell of enthusiasm,"" McKenna said. Other similarities exist in the campaigns through the mass training events called ""Camp Kamala,"" reminiscent of ""Camp Obama"" programs from 2007. But the Harris campaign has operated for far less time, so ""Camp Kamala"" is focused on last-minute mobilization tactics such as phone calls and door knocking, while the ""Camp Obama"" events were dayslong sessions held a year before the election to teach about grassroots organizing and leadership, McKenna said. The Harris campaign's efforts on TikTok and with online jokes reaching younger audiences (even if the memes have often been user-generated and Trump has a substantially larger social media command) garnered significant attention after she launched her campaign in July.

After endorsing Harris in July and calling her the successor of his movement and coalition (""Now the torch has been passed,"" he said in his Democratic National Convention speech), Obama's support in fundraising events and content has raised more than $76 million for Harris' campaign. Obama, in some ways a mentor to Harris, will expand his involvement in campaign efforts in the coming days, according to adviser Eric Schultz, who said the former president plans to ""do everything he can"" to help Harris win. Even before joining the trail, Obama played a role in Harris' campaign by offering campaigning advice (occasionally unsolicited), according to reporting by Reuters.

Harris and Obama met two decades ago, and Harris went on to support Obama's 2008 campaign by knocking on doors and helping fundraise before the Iowa caucuses, the BBC reported. Obama later supported Harris during her campaign to be California's attorney general in 2010 and her Senate bid in 2016."

Vance again refused to say who he believed won the election in 2020 during a rally in Michigan this week, telling supporters he is focused on the upcoming election, according to the Associated Press, marking an apparent split between him and Trump, who has campaigned on doubting the legitimacy of the 2020 election.

Biden has previously expressed concern over the peaceful transfer of power during the upcoming election, telling CBS News he was ""not confident at all"" about peace if Trump loses again. Biden also referred to a comment made by Trump this year in which the former president said there would ""be a bloodbath for the whole country"" if he is not elected, though Trump, who was talking to supporters in Ohio about insulating the U.S. auto industry from competition abroad, later said his comment was referring to the auto industry. Biden's skepticism of Trump and a peaceful transfer of power is rooted in the former president's attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the four felony counts against him in his federal election interference case, which ramped up this week after Special Counsel Jack Smith' set of new allegations against the former president were released in a redacted filing. Smith accused Trump of knowing his own claims about a fraudulent election were false and said Trump allegedly planned to claim victory before votes were completely tallied.

Trump Campaign Thinks Abortion Ballot Measures Might Actually Help Him,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/04/trump-campaign-thinks-abortion-ballot-measures-might-actually-help-him/,2024-10-04T20:11:04Z,"Battleground states' ballot measures on abortion could benefit former President Donald Trump in the election, the Trump campaign's political director told The Washington Post Friday, as polling suggests Republicans are willing to turn out to support abortion rights but still back Trump, despite Democrats trying to use the ballot measures to their advantage.

Polling shows Trump is leading in battleground states even as respondents trust Harris more on handling abortion. A 56% majority of Fox News' Arizona poll respondents said they trusted Harris to do a better job on abortion -- though the respondents still preferred Trump overall -- as did 53% of Arizona respondents in the Times/Siena College poll. Fox News' polling in August found 58% of voters from Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina preferred Harris on abortion, but only 48% overall said they'd support her (compared with 47% who backed Trump).

Politico reports abortion ballot measures may also impact voters in subsequent elections, noting that Democrats are reporting pro-abortion rights voters in Michigan -- where abortion was legalized via ballot measure in 2022 -- aren't as fired up this year because they think their reproductive rights are safe. A KFF poll found in July that 60% of Michigan women believe abortion's legality is now a ""settled"" issue in their state, with Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow telling Politico there's a ""false sense of comfort"" among voters that abortion is no longer under threat. Democratic candidates have had to argue to voters that their rights could still be taken away if Trump wins, Politico reports, as candidates claim Trump would enact national restrictions if elected that would override any state measures.

Democrats have continued to insist they expect their candidates will be buoyed by abortion ballot measures. They hope it will help them in the presidential election and key Senate races, as Democrats face close races in states with abortion ballot measures like Montana, Florida and Arizona. ""Wherever they've been on the ballot, we've had a significant turnout of folks who care deeply about reproductive freedom,"" Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., who leads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told The Post. ""Folks who turn out understand that the Republican candidates tend to be diametrically opposed to that -- and so they vote for the referendum and they vote for the Democratic candidate.""

Harris and Trump are still neck-and-neck in the polls. While polling has largely been in support of abortion ballot measures coming out in favor of reproductive rights -- and no ballot measure since the Supreme Court's ruling has yet come out against abortion rights -- it remains to be seen how the measures in this year's election will fare. Florida's ballot measure will require 60% of the vote in order to pass, meaning it will have to clear a particularly high bar compared with other states that only need a simple majority.

What Trump would actually do on abortion if elected. Though the ex-president has repeatedly said he does not support a national abortion ban, Democrats have been highly skeptical. Anti-abortion advocates have reframed their rhetoric to push for ""national minimum standards"" on abortion rather than ""bans"" -- phrasing restrictions differently to get around the unpopularity of abortion bans -- and the Trump campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment on if he supports a ""national minimum standard."" Anti-abortion groups have continued to push for Trump to enact national restrictions even as the ex-president has said he wants to leave it up to the states, and while the GOP's national platform doesn't call for a national ban, it does call for giving constitutional rights to fetuses, which would ban abortion by default.

The Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022 has made abortion into a key electoral issue, with Democrats relying on abortion rights as a tool to galvanize the party's base. Abortion ballot measures have been a key part of that strategy, emerging as the primary way for abortion rights advocates to harness public support and protect access even in states with Republican leadership. Republicans have downplayed their anti-abortion views in elections that have taken place since the Supreme Court's decision, with candidates editing their websites and toning down anti-abortion rhetoric so as to not alienate voters who support the procedure remaining legal. Trump said in April he supported abortion being left up to states after previously suggesting he could endorse a 15-week national ban, and has continued to insist he won't restrict abortion and tried to downplay the issue. His running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, has backed a national abortion ban in the past, but has more recently toned down his views, saying he supports Trump's view of leaving the issue to the states and falsely claiming at Tuesday's vice presidential debate that he never supported a national ban. The Harris campaign has continued to insist voters should not take Trump at his word, believing the ex-president would still listen to his anti-abortion base and take steps to ban or restrict the procedure if elected."
JPMorgan's Billionaire CEO Didn't Endorse Trump -- Despite Trump Saying He Did,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/04/jpmorgans-billionaire-ceo-didnt-endorse-trump-despite-trump-saying-he-did/,2024-10-04T19:59:50Z,"Donald Trump shared on social media Friday he scored a potentially pivotal endorsement from Jamie Dimon, the billionaire chief executive of the nation's largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, but there's one problem: The Wall Street titan has not endorsed Trump.

""You guys can elect the president. We have to deal with it as a business,"" Dimon said at a panel hosted by The Atlantic event last month.

Dimon's public record on Trump is mixed. ""He was pro business, and it was good for business,"" Dimon said last month about Trump's policies during his 2017-2021 presidency, and he briefly served in an advisory role to Trump in 2017. But Dimon has rebuked Trump several times, including following the 2017 Charlottesville white supremacist rallies and after the 2021 Capitol riots. JPMorgan is by far the largest U.S. bank by assets and market value. Though Dimon, one of the most powerful bankers in the world, has avoided endorsing a candidate, in an August essay in the Washington Post he encouraged Americans to elect a ""president who is dedicated to the ideals that define and unite us, and who is committed to restoring our faith in America and our indispensable role in the world."" Trump told Bloomberg in June he ""would consider"" making Dimon his Treasury Secretary, though he later denied making the comment."
Bruce Springsteen Endorsed Harris -- But Bill Murray Didn't Endorse Trump,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/04/bruce-springsteen-endorsed-harris-but-bill-murray-didnt-endorse-trump/,2024-10-04T19:32:54Z,"Just weeks after Vice President Kamala Harris received the endorsement of pop superstar, rock legend Bruce Springsteen threw his support behind her as well. In a video post on Instagram, the 75-year-old rocker -- who is known simply as ""The Boss"" -- suggested this is ""one of the most consequential elections in our nation's history.""

The ""Born in the USA"" singer further offered a critique of former President Donald Trump, while he lamented the fact that the nation is as ""politically, spiritually and emotionally divided"" as at any time since the American Civil War.

""It doesn't have to be this way,"" Springsteen added.

The endorsement wasn't entirely surprising, as Springsteen has a long history of backing Democrats. He previously endorsed Barack Obama in 2008, and in the 2020 U.S. presidential election provided a narration for a Joe Biden campaign ad while the song ""My Hometown"" played in the background.

Whether Springsteen's endorsement will move the needle in this year's razor-close election isn't clear, it likely could cost him some fans due to the deep political divide he warned about.

""Steve Van Zandt was quoted recently as saying Bruce's political views had cost the band a lot of fans,"" explained Bruce Barber, professional in residence at the University of New Haven and general manager of radio station WNHU. ""He's probably right -- but that to me is what a true artist is all about, the ability to speak truths, in words and song, regardless of the consequences. Springsteen's support for Kamala Harris is definitely not a surprise, but it's another example of his undying commitment to being genuine in his art and his personal life.""

Just as Springsteen released his endorsement of Harris, it was another celebrity that went viral on Thursday -- namely, What About Bob? actor Bill Murray for his alleged backing of Trump.

Internet personality Bo Loudon posted a clip of Murray from 2016 ""praising"" some of the former president's policies, and suggested ""Who needs Taylor Swift when you have BILL MURRAY?""

The clip, which was seen nearly six million times, seemed to convince many that the Ghost Busters star had endorsed Trump. However, as of Friday afternoon, Bill Murray has been silent on the issue and hasn't endorsed either candidate. According to Vanity Fair, Murray had campaigned for the Green Party's Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential race -- but perhaps that was ""lost in translation.""

Murray would just be the latest celebrity to see his/her/their endorsement of a candidate -- even if it wasn't made. Such endorsements might barely move the needle, but given how close this race is every single vote is going to matter.

""Celebrity endorsements are very important in today's political world,"" said Dr. Julianna Kirschner, lecturer at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California.

""Taylor Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz has made notable political, cultural, and social waves. Likewise, other celebrities endorsing candidates can have a similar ripple effect,"" added Kirschner.

A video clip from eight years ago is hardly an endorsement, but it was enough for many to believe that Murray was a Trump supporter.

""Without any corroborating evidence, the comment's validity appears dubious at best,"" suggested Kirschner. ""News organizations verify facts from several sources before broadcasting them, which is the likely reason for a lack of reporting on the subject. All we have right now is conjecture, a premise through which misinformation on social media thrives.""

These faux endorsements are just the latest form of misinformation that we've seen this election cycle. In this particular case, the video is just enough to make the story seem credible.

""Misinformation booms when information cannot be validated. In this case, Murray's position is unclear,"" added Kirschner. ""Users may double down when presented with contrasting information is presented to them. There is plenty of research that would support the likelihood of such an outcome. Given the high chances of users doubling down, the possibility of celebrity endorsements moving the needle would be small but not insignificant. In the tight race we are in, everything, no matter how small, makes a difference.""

The other side of this story is that Swift and Springsteen could receive some backlash from fans, but as Barber noted, the Boss likely knew it going in. In Murray's case, he could face scrutiny for something he didn't even do.

As an A-lister, he likely won't be impacted; yet, we could see the careers of up-and-comers affected -- perhaps running afoul of a casting director, movie producer, publicist, etc.

""From the celebrity's perspective, they should be concerned with how they are politically represented online. This can affect their reputation and potential support from fans, which inevitably allows them to continue to do their work,"" Kirschner continued.

And the problem could get worse. Murray may have actually offered his past comments in an interview, but advances in deep fakes could soon put words into the mouths of celebrities -- living and dead alike!

""As AI becomes more advanced, it is likely that comments, images, and videos of what appears to be celebrities endorsing a candidate may be outright false,"" warned Kirschner. ""As cases like Murray's attributed comment come up in the future, it will become increasingly challenging to discern fact from fiction."""

ou're forgiven if you missed it amid the barrage of news about escalating violence in the Middle East, the vice presidential debate, the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Helene and a historic dockworker strike that could have had significant economic implications, but this week marked the release of the annual Forbes 400 list, the definitive ranking of the richest of the rich in the U.S.

As my colleagues on the wealth team note, America's 400 richest individuals are ""having a rollicking time in the roaring 2020s; in all, they are worth a record $5.4 trillion, up nearly $1 trillion from last year."" And while the gender wealth gap among this cohort remains wide -- there are only 67 women among these 400 people -- it is narrowing, at least a little. Women now account for 17% of the list, up from 15% last year, and they hold 15% of the 400's total wealth, up from 14% in 2023. They are worth a combined $839 billion, up from the $621 billion that the 60 women on last year's list held.

The richest woman on the 400 is Alice Walton, a spot she's held for nine out of the last ten years. What IS new and notable about Walton is her charitable giving. According to a recently-released tax return -- which showed that her foundation distributed $390 million in the year ending on September 30, 2023 -- Walton reported her largest known philanthropic gift to date, $249 million in funding for a new medical school to be built in her name. This medical school is still seeking accreditation, but if all goes to plan, the school will open in 2025 and welcome an inaugural class of 48 students.

Cheers!

P.S. I'm pleased to say that the newest episode of ""The One Who Changed Everything"" came out this week and features author T.J. Newman! T.J. told us about how she went from being a bookseller and flight attendant into a three-time NYT bestselling author -- and how it all comes back to a manilla envelope she sent to agent Shane Salerno. I loved this conversation and hope you do, too!

Hurricane season runs through Nov. 30 with September and October usually the busiest months, the Associated Press notes, so it's possible another hurricane could strike by the end of the month that FEMA would struggle to respond to with its present funding levels. It remains unclear whether lawmakers will return to Washington to pass more funding before their recess ends in November. While even some Republicans have advocated for doing so -- including Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., all from Helene-hit states -- House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told The New York Times ""there's no necessity for Congress to come back.""

$34 billion. That's approximately how much Hurricane Helene's devastation could cost, according to a projection Moody's Analytics made Thursday, based on estimated property damage costing up to $26 billion and an estimated $5 billion to $8 billion in resulting economic losses. Those estimates are still early and are likely to change as there's a clearer sense of the scope of the damage, Moody's noted.

Another claim made by Trump and his allies is that Vice President Kamala Harris and the Biden administration are giving only $750 to victims of Helene's devastation and not doing anything else. That is also false, with FEMA noting on its website that the $750 figure is specifically for Serious Needs Assistance, which is immediate aid that disaster victims can receive to pay for essential items like food, water and emergency supplies. Victims can still apply for and receive additional support from FEMA on top of that, however, such as money for temporary housing and repairs.

Hurricane Helene has brought widespread devastation to parts of the South including North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida, with an estimated death toll so far of 215. The natural disaster has also become a political debate ahead of the presidential election, as Trump has criticized the Biden administration's response to the disaster, often by making up false accusations. Trump claimed Monday that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp was ""having a hard time getting the president on the phone"" and that the ""federal government is not being very responsive,"" for instance, even as Kemp clarified he had spoken with Biden and the president told Kemp to call him directly if he needed further assistance. Trump has also claimed Biden and Harris ""have left Americans to drown"" -- which is false, as the government has sent significant supplies and federal troops to affected areas -- and Trump allies have pointed to the FEMA's equity efforts to claim the agency's ""#1 goal is to be woke."" The Biden administration has strongly denounced Trump and his allies' claims: FEMA spokesperson Jacklyn Rothenberg said the agency ""help[s]

It's unlikely Musk would be able to serve in a public position due to his vast private business interests. Entrepreneurs looking to take government jobs usually divest their shares and holdings to avoid conflicts of interest, but Musk is unlikely to be able to divest his massive stakes in companies like Tesla, SpaceX and X without causing major disruption. And, because his business interests touch so many sectors, he'd likely find himself forced to recuse regularly to avoid the appearance of any conflict.

Trump was often criticized in his presidency for his own conflicts of interest after deciding not to divest his business empire before entering public office. The ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington says he committed more than 3,400 violations while in office, including visits by foreign officials and political events held at Trump-owned properties, dozens of foreign trademarks granted to Trump businesses and more than 100 events by special interest groups held at Trump properties. A report from American Public Media found that more than half of Trump's 20-person Cabinet during his presidency had engaged in ""questionable or unethical conduct,"" including in relation to their business holdings and investments.

The relationship between Musk and Trump has not always been an amicable one. In the leadup to the 2016 election, Musk said Trump was ""not the right guy"" to be president before going on to join -- and later quit -- two of the president's business-advisory councils. In 2022, when Musk was attempting to buy Twitter, Trump called him a ""bullshit artist."" He said Musk would never be able to buy Twitter, and said Musk claimed he'd never voted for a republican after privately telling Trump he voted for him before. In response, Musk said it was ""time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset."" At the time, he said Trump was too old to run for the presidency again in 2024 and said he was supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. That same year, Musk reinstated Trump's previously banned Twitter account. The two have been linked a few times since -- the New York Times reported the pair met in March and the Washington Post reported they'd discussed a potential buyout of the Truth Social platform last year -- and in July of this year, Musk endorsed Trump for the presidency. Since then, Trump returned to Twitter for a live interview, Musk has repeatedly attacked his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris and Musk claimed he helped start the pro-Trump America PAC.

Musk, who founded Tesla, SpaceX and other companies, is ranked as the richest person in the world as of Friday with an estimated net worth of $258.7 billion, more than $50 billion more than Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the second-richest person. Trump has an estimated $4 billion net worth as of Friday thanks to his stakes in Truth Social's parent company, the Trump Media and Technology Group, his real estate investments and other assets."
Here Is What A Government Efficiency Commission Should Look Like,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesbroughel/2024/10/04/here-is-what-a-government-efficiency-commission-should-look-like/,2024-10-04T13:53:51Z,"Elon Musk has floated the idea of a government efficiency commission aimed at addressing wasteful spending and regulations in Washington. Former President Donald Trump embraced Musk's idea, stating that if re-elected he would establish such a commission with Musk at the helm. While government efficiency commissions can indeed be powerful tools for reform, they are also easy to ignore or sideline, particularly when their recommendations are controversial or if they are set up merely for political optics rather than substantive change. The success of such a commission therefore lies in its structure and its role within a broader policy mandate to overhaul government, such as through an explicit government-wide goal of reducing regulation.

Musk and Trump can learn from the past, starting with looking at commissions that have offered valuable recommendations that went unheeded. A prime example is the 2010 Simpson-Bowles fiscal commission, which was formed during the Obama administration to address the federal deficit. The commission's recommendations were well-researched and pragmatic, tackling tough issues like Medicare and Social Security reform. Despite the balanced and informed nature of its suggestions, Congress ultimately chose not to act on them. The commission's failure was largely due to the politically sensitive nature of its proposals and a lack of consensus within Congress, underscoring the importance of not just having good ideas but having the political will and bipartisan cooperation to see those ideas through.

Similarly, some commissions are formed to create the illusion of action without any genuine intention to make changes. This is similar to how Congress sometimes requires a study of a particular problem instead of addressing the problem itself. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's Georgians First Commission made thoughtful recommendations on how to reduce regulatory burdens in the state, yet they remain unimplemented. This suggests the creation of the commission was more of a political maneuver than a substantive effort to reform government bureaucracy.

To be effective, therefore, Trump and Musk's proposed commission should seek to avoid these pitfalls and instead build upon models that have yielded tangible results. One example comes from New Jersey under former Governor Chris Christie. During Christie's tenure, New Jersey created the Red Tape Review Commission. The commission was proactive, met regularly, and included members from different political backgrounds and sectors.

The New Jersey commission also produced regular reporting, which was impactful in part because it included powerful stories illustrating how problematic regulations were interfering with the daily lives of people. These were stories of business owners, workers, and residents struggling to jump through government-created hoops in their efforts to improve their stations in life. The commission's recommendations were acted upon multiple times by the legislature. Although an effort to make the commission permanent ultimately failed, it had broad support, with only one opposing vote in the legislature. The failure was due to Governor Phil Murphy's veto and his reluctance to hand a political win to former Governor Christie.

Trump and Christie may have their differences, but regulatory reform could be an area of productive collaboration. It might even make sense for Trump to consider involving Christie in the proposed commission.

A key challenge for any efficiency commission is that it inherently lacks enforcement power. It can make recommendations, but it cannot compel anyone to act. This is why commissions are easy to ignore, particularly in the face of competing interests within government. Federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency or the Securities and Exchange Commission operate independently and have their own priorities. Even if a commission led by Musk were to identify a regulatory problem, there is little reason to believe agency heads would prioritize it. Most prefer to spend time cementing their legacies with new initiatives, rather than revisiting the work of their predecessors.

The effectiveness of such a commission will also depend on its ability to produce recommendations that are driven by consensus and backed by evidence. This is why a bipartisan makeup is important. Musk may ultimately lead the commission, but it should include representatives and stakeholders from both major parties. Without bipartisan participation, any recommendations risk being dismissed as political -- by Congress, by agency staff, and even in some cases by members of Trump's own cabinet. A broad coalition of support will help guarantee that recommendations are seen as pragmatic and in the public interest.

Like in New Jersey, the commission should produce regular reports -- annually, if not more often -- identifying programs and regulations in need of reform. It should engage with nonpartisan offices like the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office to collect data and ideas. Academic research should be gathered and summarized, ensuring that recommendations are well-supported by empirical evidence. The more rigorous and transparent the commission's work, the harder it will be for its findings to be ignored.

The proposed commission should also work in tandem with other regulatory reform mechanisms, such as a regulatory budget and reduction goals -- both of which were features of Trump's first term. Setting a regulatory budget limits the total cost that regulations can impose on the economy, forcing agencies to prioritize eliminating outdated and inefficient regulations rather than adding new rules to the pile. A regulatory reduction goal similarly incentivizes agencies toward achieving a desired outcome. A goal of, say, cutting the Code of Federal Regulations by 25,000 pages or reducing annual compliance and paperwork costs by $200 billion, is realistic and actionable, and would give the commission an idea of its intended purpose.

In Trump's first term, his administration also appointed ""deregulation officers"" within agencies. These were people whose role was to make sure that the regulatory reduction agenda was being implemented. Individuals who are empowered within agencies to advocate for reform from the inside could be powerful allies to an efficiency commission. Their roles should be reinstated to complement the work of the commission.

The idea of an efficiency commission, particularly one led by Elon Musk, is an exciting prospect, but it must be implemented wisely. It has to be more than just a symbolic gesture. Every recommendation should be backed by evidence and presented in a nonpartisan light, forming part of a comprehensive plan to streamline the federal bureaucracy and foster greater accountability in government. A government efficiency commission is a good idea, but how it gets set up matters."
The Latest Employment Numbers And The Presidential Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2024/10/04/the-latest-employment-numbers-and-the-presidential-election/,2024-10-04T12:44:31Z,"The Employment Situation Report for the month of September was released this morning. It showed what everyone expected: very little change in the unemployment rate. At 4.1%, it was actually slightly lower than that for August (4.2%). One open question was the impact of Hurricane Francine on jobs, but ""Our analysis suggests that Hurricane Francine had no discernible effect on national payroll employment, hours, and earnings from the establishment survey, or the national unemployment rate from the household survey.""

As important as these releases are in normal times, they take on extra significance in the lead up to an election. In fact, experts claim that the economy is particularly important to voters this year. It has consequently been a running theme for both parties, with Democrats focusing on low unemployment and robust growth and Republicans on the recent spike in inflation.

What's curious about this campaign is the fact that the Democrats are having to scramble to defend themselves. You'd think that theirs was the high ground given that:

Meanwhile, though it is true that inflation accelerated temporarily, there is little question that this was related to factors outside of the US and has calmed down considerably.

Despite this, however, voters have a very dim -- and flawed -- view of the state of the economy:

""Nearly everything Americans believe about the economy is wrong, according to a recent Harris-Guardian poll...The poll, conducted earlier this month, found that perceptions of the U.S. economy are often at odds with reality. For instance, most Americans (55 percent) think the economy is shrinking, with about the same share saying we're in a recession.""

Unfortunately for the Democrats, perceptions are more important than reality in situations like this.

There are three more key indicator announcements before the November 5th election:

If any of these is out of line with what we have been experiencing of late, it could have an impact on voters.

That said, economists do not expect any significant deviation from our current low unemployment, solid GDP growth, and moderating inflation. Even if the dockworkers' strike (now resolved) and recent flooding were to raise prices, the October 10 CPI announcement only covers September. It simply wouldn't show up yet.

What this suggests is that the releases will include very little new information and both parties will simply recycle their earlier talking points. If the outcome is going to be affected by the state of the economy, it is going to be because one party did a better job of spinning than the other. And while there is evidence that Kamala Harris' economic message may be gaining ground on Donald Trump's, a lot can happen in a month.

Everyone will be watching these numbers closely."

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin and director Ken Burns hrew their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name. Rapper Cardi B, who in May said she wouldn't be endorsing Biden, tweeted ""AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate...."" Pop musician Kesha said she plans to support Harris in November and, when asked how she felt about Vance, responded ""f -- - that man."" Beyoncé has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyoncé's mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention. Nick Offerman, Jane Fonda, Ben Stiller, Kathy Griffin, John Stamos, Ed Helms, Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz were among those who appeared on a ""Comics for Harris"" virtual rally via Zoom, which reportedly raised close to half a million dollars for the Harris campaign. Over Labor Day weekend, a fundraiser for the Democratic ticket in Southampton, New York was hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and fashion designer Tory Burch, among others. Actors Matt Damon and Lin-Manuel Miranda will attend fundraiser in New York City in September -- for which tickets are listed at $25,000 per person -- to support the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket, Bloomberg reported. Actress Aubrey Plaza posted a photo of herself on Instagram holding Grumpy Cat -- the face of a famous meme -- with the caption ""HARRIS 🇺🇸 WALZ. Mel Brooks said he was ""all in"" for the Harris and Walz ticket in a post to social media holding his dog, adding ""I don't have a cat, so a dog will have to do!"" Stevie Nicks did not name a particular candidate when she encouraged her followers to vote in an Instagram post this week, but signed her message ""Childless Dog Lady."" Billionaire pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post minutes after a debate between Harris and Donald Trump wrapped up, with a photo of her holding her cat that has since been recreated by several other celebrities. After declining to endorse a candidate in 2020, Martha Stewart said at the Retail Influencer CEO Forum she will supporting Kamala Harris in the election because she wants a president ""who doesn't hate New York"" and ""doesn't hate democracy,"" the Daily Beast reported. Pop star Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas, a songwriter and producer, made a video about National Voter Registration Day and Billie said they would both be voting for Harris and Walz ""because they are fighting to protect our reproductive freedom, our planet and our democracy."" Famous television scientist Bill Nye, in a video posted to the Kamala HQ TikTok account, called Trump a ""climate change denier"" and encouraged viewers to ""vote with the climate in mind."" Nye participated ""Geeks & Nerds for Harris"" fundraiser on Sept. 28 hosted by ""Wonder Woman"" star Lynda Carter that will also feature ""Star Trek"" actors LeVar Burton and Anthony Rapp, actor Misha Collins of ""Supernatural,"" Star Wars actor Mark Hamill and others.

Former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt while on stage at the Republican National Convention last month to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath, and called Trump his ""hero"" and the ""greatest president of the United States."" Musician Kid Rock has been vocal about his support of Trump in the past and at the RNC revamped his song ""American Bad Ass"" to include references to Trump. UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer."" Public-facing billionaires like Elon Musk and Steve Wynn have also supported the former president. Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Rapper Azealia Banks last year said she would vote for Donald Trump in Novemebr and she appeared at a rally in Florida this summer. Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio. Trump thanked Brittany Mahomes, wife of NFL superstar Patrick Mahomes, for her ""defending him"" after she lashed out at social media users who criticized her for liking several pro-Trump posts last month (Mahomes has not formally endorsed a candidate). At a rally in Las Vegas, Trump thanked reggaeton star Nicky Jam for his endorsement, but apparently thought he was a she -- saying: ""Do you know Nicky? She's hot. Where's Nicky?"" -- before correcting himself after Jam climbed to the stage, saying, ""Oh, look, I'm glad he came up.""

Notable names missing from the list of public supporters include billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who called the decision ""too important to rush."""
Stitch Golf Buoyed By Bryson DeChambeau's Big Year,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellore/2024/10/04/stitch-golf-buoyed-by-bryson-dechambeaus-big-year/,2024-10-04T12:04:51Z,"There were a number of significant beneficiaries when Bryson DeChambeau won the 2024 U.S. Open in June at Pinehurst No. 2. Most notably, the winner himself took home $4.3 million, while his victory was another proud feather in the cap for LIV Golf, which continues to draw varied reactions from those in and around golf.

Not only did DeChambeau and LIV reap the rewards from the 31-year-old's dramatic finish over Rory McIlroy, but Stitch Golf saw significant upticks in site traffic, revenue and social media engagement as their brand ambassador hoisted the U.S. Open trophy for the second time in his career.

Add in DeChambeau's seven top-10 finishes out of 13 LIV events this season, his Crushers GC team finishing atop the regular-season standings with three team wins and DeChambeau's dominance on golf YouTube, it's been a banner year for the brand that began in 2012 by making vintage motorsports-inspired headcovers.

""I would be sitting here being completely dishonest if I didn't say that this hasn't been a fantastic year of exposure for Stitch,"" Stitch Golf CEO Brad King said. ""It has. A key contributor to that has been Bryson DeChambeau, and the Crushers.""

DeChambeau's win resulted in a 60% increase in site traffic and a 200% increase in social media engagement for Stitch, which recorded one of its top-10 revenue days of the year the Sunday he won the U.S. Open.

While witnessing a welcomed boost in awareness, engagement and revenue as a result of DeChambeau's performance at Pinehurst, Stitch has continued to benefit from their star man's performances on the course and social media.

With a lighter tournament and travel schedule since joining LIV on a 4.5-year contract worth a reported $125 million in June 2022, DeChambeau has taken advantage of his free time by building his brand on YouTube.

Showcasing his personality as much as his golf abilities, DeChambeau has amassed 1.52 million followers on the platform -- recently surpassing the PGA Tour's 1.49 million -- through his Random Club Challenges and Break 50 series. His Break 50 episode with former President Donald Trump has garnered 12 million views.

""I always knew there was an audience for it,"" DeChambeau told GOLF.com in August. ""Look at Dude Perfect and the success they have had. I just slapped myself on the head and said that's what I need to do. That's what the kids are watching these days, and that's how you interact with them.""

As DeChambeau continues to build his brand, so has Stitch. In the midst of a multi-year strategic plan implemented in May 2017, the brand is focused on engaging avid golfers via direct to consumer online as well as growing its green-grass presence to the top 3,000 golf clubs in the U.S. With approximately 25% of those clubs conquered so far, Stitch instituted a high-density sales model by beefing up its sales reps on the ground.

To complement that, the brand launched into the United Kingdom this year with its sights set on the top 90 clubs across the pond.

""We're executing a plan we started a little over seven years ago,"" King said. ""We're sticking to that plan and it's working. ... We're focused on (avid golfers) right now but as we mature and grow as a company, obviously we will expand and try to capture more of that audience.""

Entering the market with headcovers and golf bags, Stitch expanded into travel gear with its Ultimate Garment Bag, which is the brand's No. 1-selling item. From there, customers requested they get into apparel, which they did as well.

King said Stitch boasts a ""nice balanced mix"" from its three product categories with apparel comprising 40% of the business, while travel and golf bags/headcovers at 30% apiece.

Sponsoring players across all of the major tours, Stitch can even be found supporting players it doesn't have a direct relationship with, including 2024 FedExCup champion and world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who utilizes the brand's align stick cover.

""We wanted to come into this market and the entry point was to disrupt the golf bag space,"" King said. ""And we've done that.

""We're pretty excited about what's going on with the brand."""
Democrats Mobilize Crypto Voters To Counter Trump's Bitcoin Appeal,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2024/10/04/democrats-mobilize-crypto-voters-to-counter-trumps-bitcoin-appeal/,2024-10-04T10:05:16Z,"As the 2024 election approaches, cryptocurrency is no longer a fringe topic. Once dismissed as a niche concern, crypto asset and blockchain policy has rocketed to the forefront for millions of Americans who recognize the critical role of crypto in driving future economic growth and innovation. This shift underscores a broader divide among voters, particularly within the crypto space, with some leaning towards the Democratic Party, while others rally behind former President Donald Trump, positioning him as the so-called ""champion"" of their bitcoin holdings. In response, Suite View PAC has launched Crypto Rides, a direct effort to mobilize Democratic-leaning pro-crypto voters in a way that counters the GOP's bitcoin-only voter narrative.

Crypto Rides represents a dynamic example of how Democrat-leaning voters for this election are reclaiming crypto support by focusing on balanced and responsible regulation. Offering Uber ride vouchers to pro-crypto, pro-tech voters in New York, this initiative seeks to boost turnout for those committed to advancing thoughtful, nuanced oversight of digital assets -- especially in stark contrast to the ""bitcoin maximalism"" embraced by Trump's base.

The Rise Of The Single-Issue Bitcoin Voter

Trump's transformation from bitcoin skeptic to crypto advocate has been one of the most notable shifts in his political stance as he vies for the presidency in 2024. Once dismissive of bitcoin -- calling it a ""scam"" in 2021 -- Trump now positions himself as a champion of cryptocurrency, promising to turn the U.S. into the ""crypto capital of the world."" His pledges to dismantle the Biden administration's war on crypto, and his purchase of a meal with bitcoin, has endeared him to a growing segment of bitcoin maximalists and crypto entrepreneurs who see his return to office as a potential boon for deregulating the industry.

The allure of Trump's pro-bitcoin stance is hard to ignore for many in the crypto community. Despite what some described as his ill-timed and questionable DeFi project for accredited investors, Trump has attracted millions of dollars in donations from crypto founders and investors, and his promise to make bitcoin a centerpiece of his economic policy has galvanized a bloc of voters solely focused on this issue. However, while Trump's campaign may appeal to single-issue bitcoin voters, a broader group of Democratic and independent crypto enthusiasts are concerned about what his broader policies under Agenda 47 (based on Project 2025) could mean for the industry's future stability and inclusivity.

The Democratic Crypto Agenda: More Than Bitcoin

While Trump courts the bitcoin vote, many Democrats are focusing on a more nuanced approach to crypto regulation. Rather than pushing for the wholesale deregulation of digital assets, Democratic crypto voters are calling for policies that balance innovation with consumer protection, financial inclusion, and economic equity.

This difference in approach was highlighted in a recent letter sent to Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign by leaders in the Web3 and DeFi communities. Industry stalwarts like Olayinka Odeniran, Founder and Chairwoman of Black Women Blockchain Council, emphasized the importance of ensuring that Black, Latino, AAPI, and Indigenous communities -- early adopters of cryptocurrency -- are included the regulatory conversation. She, and other diverse Web3 and DeFi leaders, advocated for policies that foster capital formation and financial access for these groups, while also protecting consumers from fraud and ensuring transparency in the industry. For these voters, the stakes are high -- not just for bitcoin's survival but for the entire ecosystem of emerging technologies that could reshape the global economy to be as inclusive and democratizing as its promise, and as articulated in Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper. And according to a recent Morning Star poll, crypto voters are evenly divided.

Resetting The Democratic Stance On Digital Assets

In addition to voter mobilization efforts like Crypto Rides, the Crypto4Harris initiative has emerged as a key movement aiming to reshape the Democratic Party's stance on digital assets. This group of cryptocurrency advocates, which includes high-profile figures like Mark Cuban, Anthony Scaramucci, and Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA), is rallying behind Harris's campaign with a clear agenda: influence future regulatory direction for the crypto industry.

One of the most notable developments within the Crypto4Harris group is the backing of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who participated in a virtual rally hosted by the initiative. Schumer expressed strong support for pushing through crypto legislation this year, warning that if the U.S. does not take a proactive approach to regulate digital assets, the industry could move overseas. Schumer's involvement indicates that key Democratic leaders are becoming increasingly receptive to the crypto community's concerns.

Additionally, Jonathan Padilla, CEO of Snickerdoodle Labs and a leading organizer for Crypto4Harris, confirmed that the group has been in early discussions with the Harris campaign, aiming to shape policy and influence regulatory appointments. However, skepticism remains due to Harris's obvious connection to the current anti-crypto administration as the Vice President.

Despite the limited constitutional role of a Vice President to preside over the Senate, break ties in case of a 50/50 vote, to serve at the pleasure of the Chief Executive (the President), and to replace the President in times of crisis, vice presidents are inextricably linked to policies advanced during their time in office. Nonetheless, Harris has begun the challenging and nuanced task of separating herself from the current anti-crypto policies in favor of a pro-digital asset and blockchain stance in alignment with her Opportunity Economy policies to bolster the middle and working classes. She even went so far as to be the first Democratic presidential candidate to publicly declare support for pro-digital asset innovation and reasonable regulations, a stark contrast from Biden's approach.

If the Crypto4Harris movement succeeds in resetting the Democratic Party's stance on digital assets, it could lead to increased investment and innovation in the U.S. digital assets industry and broader Web3 economy. However, the outcome may turn on how willing the Harris campaign is to engage with the ""proof of pivot"" demands of the crypto industry and push back against more stringent regulatory measures of the current administration.

Polling Data Shows Crypto's Growing Importance In The Election

New polling data from Consensys and HarrisX reveals just how much cryptocurrency has risen in importance as an election issue. Nearly 49% of U.S. voters now consider a candidate's stance on crypto to be ""important"" when deciding their vote. This is a massive shift from previous elections and highlights the increasing relevance of digital finance in shaping the political landscape.

The 2024 election is shaping up to be pivotal for the crypto community, with 92% of crypto holders planning to vote -- a striking statistic that makes them a demographic both parties are keen to win over. Yet, the crypto community is anything but monolithic. Recent data shows that 40% of respondents favor the GOP's stance on crypto, while 38% align more with Democrats. This split highlights an opportunity for Democrats and independents to connect with voters who, while perhaps skeptical of the GOP's bitcoin maximalist approach, are seeking a more balanced and inclusive regulatory framework.

Swing States: Crypto as a Deciding Factor

Swing states could very well be where the crypto vote makes the most significant impact. A poll by DCG and The Harris Poll reveals that 26% of voters in these crucial states are actively considering candidates' positions on digital assets when deciding whom to support. With crypto emerging as a key issue in these battlegrounds, initiatives like Crypto Rides are essential in rallying Democratic crypto supporters.

Crypto Rides: Mobilizing the Democratic Crypto Vote

This is where Crypto Rides enters the fray as a direct counter to the GOP's single-issue bitcoin voter. By offering Uber ride vouchers to pro-crypto, Democratic-leaning voters in New York, Crypto Rides ensures that voices advocating for innovation, consumer protection, and financial equity are heard at the polls. ""Crypto Rides isn't just about turnout,"" says founder Will Schweitzer, ""it's about turning out the right votes."" While Trump may have rallied a faction of the crypto community around bitcoin, Schweitzer emphasizes that initiatives like Crypto Rides focus on a more inclusive and responsible approach to digital finance.

The Importance Of Down-Ballot Voting

Though much of the spotlight is on the presidential race, it's crucial to recognize that lasting regulatory reform comes from Congress. Lawmakers across the country will be pivotal in shaping the future legal framework for digital assets, whether in a swing issue or one with a clear party leaning. Initiatives like Crypto Rides remind voters that real change happens up and down the ballot, ensuring that representatives pushing for smart crypto regulation are elected to Congress.

As we approach November 5th, the race for the crypto vote is intensifying. Trump may have energized the bitcoin vote, but Democrats, independents, and never-Trump voters are expanding the tent and the conversation with initiatives like Crypto Rides and Crypto4Harris. The outcome of this election will undoubtedly have lasting implications for the future of digital assets. Whether through ride vouchers, grassroots efforts, legislation or shaping regulatory appointments, the Democratic crypto vote is making its presence felt -- and it could well tip the balance of power in Washington."
"One Year In, Amy Pope's Plan To Reshape The Conversation on Migration",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniefillion/2024/10/03/one-year-in-amy-popes-plan-to-reshape-the-conversation-on-migration/,2024-10-03T19:55:25Z,"When Amy Pope became director of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) one year ago, she took an unconventional route to leadership.

A Biden administration official, Pope had been IOM's deputy director general for management and reform and since 2021. When the time came to choose the organization's next leader, she decided to run against her boss, António Vitorino, a high-level Portuguese lawyer and politician

""I feel like within our organization, there was a real interest in having someone bring fresh ideas and fresh perspective made from silly things,"" Pope said in an interview on the sideline of the UN General Assembly in September, ""like bringing a style of leadership that's more inclusive, seeking the input of various IOM workers from around the world wherever they are... Being unafraid to be human, doing things like dancing with migrants when we go out and they're presenting to us or showing us things they've learned, or sitting down and talking to people one to one.""

Vitorino had been leading the organization since 2018, but in her campaign, Pope insisted IOM needed a new type of leadership because Vitorino had an ""older generation approach."" She also said the organization's leader should spend more time traveling to talk to communities served by IOM.

But in her campaign, Pope was not only bringing a new generation of leadership to the organization, she was also returning a top job to American hands. At the UN, some leadership jobs are dominated by specific, powerful countries, and in the case of the IOM, the United States had occupied the top job for 50 years until the Trump administration brought forward Ken Isaacs, a Christian charity executive with a history of anti-Islam comments. Vitorino then got the job, and Pope joined IOM as a deputy director shortly after Biden took office. With the support of the Biden administration, Pope ran a six-month campaign while on unpaid leave, visited over 40 countries, and ended up getting the job.

One year in, Pope said she has executed on many of her campaign promises. On the organizational front, she has pushed for more visits on the ground and closer work with IOM teams around the world. ""I felt it was really important to demonstrate to our workforce and to our member states that IOM work is out in the world,"" she said. ""It's not in Geneva.""

Pope has also appointed a new executive team; the organization's leadership is now mostly women, ""all representing different parts of the world, all who travel, and all who I hope will amplify the work we're doing,"" she said.

Pope herself has also implemented her campaign promise to spend more time in the field. So far, she's traveled to over 40 countries in a year and said she has visited 90 countries overall since campaigning for the top job. She believes that her leadership and generation are already proving successful in the organization's ""new"" culture. She also believes that being the first woman to lead IOM brings something different to the table.

""Wherever they are, from being unafraid to be human, doing things like dancing with migrants when we go out... they're presenting to us or showing us things they've learned, or sitting down and talking to people one to one,"" Pope said. ""So, I feel like what was maybe missing, or what has been welcomed, is just this very human perspective, which I think is more typical of a new generation of leaders. I also think, frankly, being a woman means I'm not afraid to be emotional.""

More than anything, Pope wants to focus on communications. With hard-right political parties becoming increasingly popular around the world, the topic of migration is often at the forefront of political debates and scapegoated by those parties.

In her own country, former President Donald Trump controversially repeated in the presidential debate a baseless story about Haitian migrants eating pets. While she won't get involved in specific political debates, Pope wants to emphasize the benefits of migration in many U.S. cities and throughout the world.

""If you look at the election politics, you would think migration is just this huge problem, and it has to be stopped,"" she said, ""but if you widen the scope a little bit, and you look, for example, at post- Covid economic recovery, the United States' strong economic recovery is in large part due to the fact that there has been a continued number of migrants who are coming in.""

Pope is also trying to change the way people talk and think about migration and wishes to make it more central to policy discussions.

""I think the mistake has always been to keep migration as an afterthought, as opposed to really bringing it into the strategic conversation,"" she said. ""That's what we're trying to do, whether it's how do we build more sustainable solutions to climate change, how do we deal with the demographic changes that are happening around the world. How do we deal with globalization of skills and labor?""

A year in, Pope feels good about how she's carried out her vision, but she's unsure if she can maintain the same pace for the rest of her term.

""It was really critical to just get out and hear from the members, to hear from the migrants themselves, to talk to our workforce, and it was critical in terms of setting my own agenda and priorities and the organizational reform,"" she said, ""I don't know that I need to do another 40 next year."""
Elon's No Batman,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gautammukunda/2024/10/03/elons-no-batman/,2024-10-03T19:29:40Z,"""Batman has no limits."" That's one of the (many) iconic lines in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. It's not just a line in a comic book movie. It reflects both our vision of the capabilities of billionaire business leaders (like Bruce Wayne) and, all too often, their own self-images as well. But outside of comic books and the movies they inspire, real people - no matter how brilliant or successful - have limits. Fidelity's announcement that X's value has dropped by 79% since its purchase by Elon Musk - costing Fidelity alone almost $15 billion - is the clearest possible demonstration of the penalties for forgetting that simple truth about the world.

Any analysis of lessons we can draw from what's happened at X must begin with the scale of Musk's achievements with other companies. Revolutionizing one industry is an astonishing achievement. Doing it twice is more than twice as impressive. Tesla has likely advanced the electrification of the automotive industry by a generation; SpaceX may well be the single most impressive company in the world.

His results with X have been dramatically different. The damage done there stretches far beyond the economic. Twitter was likely the single most expensive thing ever purchased by any individual - but Musk is so wealthy that even if its value drops to zero, he will still be among the richest people not just in the world, but in the history of humanity. What buying X cost Musk was far more valuable than $44 billion - it's the reputation for far-sighted and public-spirited genius that he had carefully built over the course of his career. The damage is done less by his endorsement of Donald Trump - although that's certainly not helping given Tesla's customer base of wealthy, well-educated people who are concerned about climate change - and more by his adoption of an astonishing array of conspiracy theories, defending the ""QAnon shaman"" who helped storm the US Capitol on January 6, and even tweeting a false story about the attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband.

Twitter - a social network - is profoundly different in every possible way from Tesla or SpaceX. So why did Musk believe that he could be just as successful there as he was with his previous companies? For that matter, why would Fidelity, among many other enormously sophisticated institutions, put tens of billions behind Musk's purchase of a social media company - especially when he only made that purchase under threat of a lawsuit?

The failure in judgment both made stems basically from a comic book view of genius. In Iron Man Tony Stark is the greatest weapons designer who has ever lived. Designing weapons is, in and of itself, a multi-disciplinary task. Modern weapons require huge teams, not just individual geniuses. But okay, let's say that's possible. By the final Avengers movie, Stark is also a physicist so brilliant he can, literally, invent time travel. He's hardly the only example. Bruce Wayne is a better athlete than most Olympic Gold medalists, but also better at forensics than the Gotham police department and better at coding than the engineers employed by Wayne Enterprises. Bruce Banner has seven PhDs (maybe the radiation isn't what turned him into a giant green rage monster).

Genius in the real world doesn't work that way. Real scientists, no matter how brilliant, have one, or at most a small number, of specialties. The scientist who is an expert in, for example, both biology and physics, simply does not exist. A century ago, that might have been possible. Today, the state of the art in both fields is so great that mastering the literature in either one is a lifetime's work for even the most gifted researcher. Jackie Robinson was likely a professional caliber athlete in four different sports. But Jackie Robinson played baseball a long time ago. A generation ago, Bo Jackson, Deion Sanders, and Brian Jordan could play in both the NFL and MLB. Today, the number of professional athletes who do anything similar is, quite simply, zero.

What's true in science and sports is just as true in business. Research by my friends and colleagues Boris Groysberg and Nitin Nohria showed, for example, that from 1989-2001, former GE executives hired to be CEOs of other companies only succeeded when their new company was similar to the parts of GE they had previously run. Elon Musk might often be compared to a comic book character - and even have cameoed in Iron Man 2 - but he's just as human as the rest of us. And so, like the rest of us, he has limits. The skills required to successfully run a social media company that derives most of its revenues from advertising have essentially no overlap with those needed to run a car company, and certainly nothing in common with those needed to run a company that builds and launches rockets. Had Musk and his investors realized that, they would all surely be in a far better situation than they are today"
Trump Calls Jack Smith Filing 'Election Interference' -- As He Tees Up Dispute Of Potential Loss,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/03/trump-calls-jack-smith-filing-election-interference-as-he-tees-up-dispute-of-potential-loss/,2024-10-03T17:05:28Z,"Former President Donald Trump repeated his baseless claims that the federal election subversion case against him amounts to ""election interference"" in the wake of the unsealing of a new filing Wednesday -- foreshadowing one of the ways he and his allies are gearing up to dispute the results of the 2024 election if he loses to Vice President Kamala Harris.

The unsealing of Smith's filing revealed new details in his case against Trump accusing him of attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Smith alleged in the new filing that Trump acknowledged the claims the election was rife with fraud and stolen from him had no merit and that he planned to declare victory before the votes were tallied. Trump also hired former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to lead the legal team fighting the election results in court because he couldn't find any other lawyers who were willing to take the case and he knew Giuliani ""was willing to falsely claim victory,"" according to the court papers. Trump also allegedly reacted with apathy when he was alerted that former Vice President Mike Pence had to be moved to a secure location during the Jan. 6 attack, responding ""So what?"" when an aide told him. Trump, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, argued Tuesday on Truth Social the documents shouldn't have been released before the election. He also accused the Justice Department of unveiling them to distract from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's performance in Tuesday's vice presidential debate.

Democrats and Democrat-aligned groups have also filed a series of election-related lawsuits challenging rules in Republican-led states, generally arguing that the laws are too restrictive, could hinder voter access and unnecessarily delay the election process. The Georgia state and national Democratic parties sued Georgia last month, arguing new rules from the Georgia State Election Board could allow county election officials to reject the results. The rules require county election officials to conduct a ""reasonable inquiry"" into possible fraud and misconduct. Democrats argue the county election officials don't have the authority to refuse certification of the results and that any allegations of fraud and misconduct should be handled in court, not by county elections officials.

Trump has said he will accept the election results if it's a ""fair and legal and good election,"" he said during the June CNN debate with President Joe Biden. At the same time, he has repeatedly said on the campaign trail he believes the only way Democrats can win is if they cheat. Trump also said recently in an interview with the radio program ""Full Measure,"" he wouldn't run again in 2028 if he loses.

Some Republicans in Congress have echoed Trump's stance that they will only accept the election results if it's a fair election without any evidence of fraud or misconduct. Congress is charged with certifying the results of the electoral college, typically a routine, ceremonial process that was upended in the wake of the 2020 election as Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to prevent Congress from approving the results. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who helped draft legal arguments some Republicans in Congress used to support their decision to vote against the certification of the results, told reporters last week ""of course if we have a free, fair and safe election, we're going to follow the Constitution, absolutely.""

Trump's legal efforts to contest the results of the 2020 election by claiming various types of fraud and mismanagement resoundingly failed. Of the 64 cases Trump and his allies filed in the six battleground states (Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada), only one -- in Pennsylvania -- was successful, according to a 2022 report, ""Lost, Not Stolen,"" by a group of eight conservative legal experts. The cases included allegations of improper ballot counting, voting machine malfunctions, irregularities in absentee ballot processes and voter ineligibility. The cases were dismissed by both Republican and Democratic state and federal judges, including some appointed by Trump.

Chutkan released Smith's wide-ranging filing laying out prosecutors' case against Trump on Wednesday, after ruling on what should be redacted in the public filing. The document uses new evidence to help argue why the government's charges against Trump comply with the Supreme Court's ruling giving the ex-president immunity from charges based on his ""official acts"" in office, with prosecutors alleging all the conduct at issue was Trump acting as a political candidate and private citizen, rather than as president. Chutkan will now have to decide based on the filing which charges, if any, comply with the Supreme Court's decision and can move forward. The filing includes a number of new allegations regarding the ex-president's post-election efforts, detailing how Trump pushed fraud claims despite being repeatedly told and seemingly knowing they were false -- allegedly saying he has to ""fight"" regardless of ""if [he] won or lost the election"" -- and that those around him similarly didn't believe his fraud claims but pushed them anyway. The filing also details Trump's efforts to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify the election and his anger at Pence when the vice president refused, with prosecutors alleging that when an aide told Trump that Pence had to be moved to a secure location during the Jan. 6 attack, Trump's response was, ""So what?""

Trump's legal schedule won't slow down after Election Day through the end of the year. In addition to Chutkan's pending decision on how the federal election charges comply with the immunity ruling and the ongoing appeal in the documents case, Trump will also be sentenced after he was convicted in Manhattan on 34 felony counts. That's scheduled to take place Nov. 26, after New York Judge Juan Merchan moved the date back until after the election to avoid any appearance of partisan bias. Trump is also waiting on a ruling from a New York appeals court on whether the ruling finding Trump and his associates liable for fraudulently misstating the value of assets will hold, after appeals judges expressed skepticism of the ruling and the more than $450 million fine Trump's been ordered to pay. It's unclear when that ruling will come out, but it's likely to be a few months after the court heard arguments last week.

How the election will affect Trump's cases -- since if Trump wins in November, these next few months will likely be the end for at least some of his criminal proceedings. A future President Trump would likely have the federal charges against him dismissed in the election case and the separate criminal case for allegedly withholding White House documents, if the appeals court revives it, which he could do by appointing DOJ officials willing to drop the charges. He would not have any power over state prosecutions against him, though they could be paused until Trump leaves office.

Trump's criminal case in Georgia for trying to overturn the 2020 election isn't expected to have any activity between now and November, as the case remains on hold while an appeals court considers whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified over her romantic relationship with former prosecutor Nathan Wade. The appeals court won't hear arguments on that until December, meaning the case will remain paused until at least early next year.

Trump has faced a slew of legal issues in recent years after his presidency, including four criminal cases and numerous civil lawsuits. The ex-president has broadly opposed the cases against him, pleading not guilty in his criminal cases and generally denouncing allegations as ""witch hunts"" designed to hurt his political campaign. While the criminal charges against Trump were all brought last year, only the ex-president's Manhattan hush money case has gone to trial so far, as Trump and his attorneys have succeeded in delaying criminal proceedings in other cases. Trump's federal election case started moving forward again in August after the Supreme Court ruled in July that Trump and ex-president's can't be criminally charged for ""official acts"" in office, disagreeing with district and appeals court judges who said he's not entitled to immunity. That ruling has further upended the cases against Trump and resulted in his sentencing in the hush money case getting delayed, in addition to its impact on the election case."
How Americans Think The Election Will Impact Their Personal Finances,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/presidential-election-personal-finance-impact/,2024-10-03T16:32:49Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

The economy is the top issue on the minds of voters heading into the 2024 presidential election, and Americans are divided on which candidate will improve their personal finances, according to a Forbes Advisor and Talker Research survey of 2,000 registered voters. Of these, 48% were Democrats, 39% were Republicans and 10% were independents.

For instance, 48% of respondents said Vice President Kamala Harris would deliver a better economy compared to 44% for former President Donald Trump.

However, 52% said their personal finances were healthier four years ago, when Trump was in office, compared to less than a quarter who said they're doing better now during the Biden Administration.

Voters want the eventual winner to focus on bringing down prices; 60% cited inflation as the top priority for the next administration.

A look at the topline figures paint a positive picture of the public's appetite for a potential Harris Administration.

Nearly half (48%) of respondents said the economy would improve under her presidency, compared to 36% who said it would worsen. Another 16% said it wouldn't change.

Meanwhile, 44% said that a Trump Administration would bode well for the nation's economic future, while 42% believed the economy would suffer. A seventh (14%) replied that the economy wouldn't change much in a second Trump Administration.

But when you drill down on the specific issues that affect personal finances, including borrowing costs and the stock market, Americans seemed to have a better appreciation for a Trump victory.

More than half of respondents (52%) said their finances are worse than four years ago, compared to just 23% who think they're better off. Another 20% said they were about the same, while another 5% weren't sure.

Republicans (70%) and independents (65%) were far more likely to think they're finances have gotten worse over the past four years than Democrats (35%).

This finding jibes with a series of data points and sentiment surveys.

For instance, median household income adjusted for inflation was higher in 2019 ($81,210) than in 2023 ($80,610), according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Just 31% of Americans believe the economy is getting better, according to Gallup, which is down from 51% at the end of 2019.

High prices continue to plague the American consumer.

Even as the rate of inflation has come down, prices are still growing much faster than the Fed's preferred target of 2%.

The personal consumption expenditures (core PCE) price index that strips out volatile food and energy prices, which is the Fed's preferred gauge, rose by 2.7% in August over the previous 12 months.

That's why 60% respondents in our survey think that easing the cost of living should be the top priority of a future Harris or Trump administration.

The next most important issues, lowering income taxes and creating more jobs, were each selected by just 10% of respondents.

Those results dovetail with what Americans say is impacting their decision this November.When asked to name the two biggest economic issues in the election, nearly three-quarters (74%) identified inflation. The second most popular response was healthcare expenses at just 33%.

This is a bipartisan issue: 79% of Republicans and 69% of Democrats selected inflation as one of their biggest concerns.

Americans are likely taking their vote seriously since 68% of respondents either somewhat or strongly agree that the president has a tangible impact on their financial situation.

Meanwhile, 54% think macroeconomic events, such as inflation or stock market performance, have the biggest impact on their financial health, compared to just 20% who say their personal choices are more important.

That makes sense given the massive events American consumers have faced over the past four years, from pandemic-era business and school closures to stimulus checks to sky-high inflation.

While folks believe that the outcome of the election will impact their personal finances, few will wait for a winner before making financial decisions.

In 2016, while President Barack Obama, a Democrat, was finishing his final year in office, those with a Democratic party identification were optimistic about the economy (+18), according to Gallup's U.S. Economic Confidence Index, while Republicans were gloomy (-31).

In 2017, when Obama was replaced by Trump, a Republican, the two sides flipped. Republicans (+46) were now ecstatic, while Democrats (-20) were miserable.

Independents were even-keeled throughout.

Obviously, these voters were viewing events through their partisan lens; people's fortunes didn't radically shift overnight.

This can have real consequences.

A Democratic voter who believed Trump would bring a market collapse missed out on years of stock market gains, for instance.

While your political passions may run hot, don't let them influence how you operate your personal budget.

Of course, big events impact your personal finances. Anyone who has lived through the past four years may have seen wild fluctuations in the value of their home, the interest rate on their high-yield savings account or the annual percentage rate (APR) on their credit card.

Where you run into trouble, though, is believing that these events have a bigger impact on your financial health than your own actions.

Research shows that financial self-efficacy, which is the belief that you're in control of your fate, is key to financial success.

Yes, big stuff happens. But big stuff always happens. The 2000s, for instance, were bookended by two recessions that led to a lost decade for stocks and a housing bubble burst.

You can thrive by learning how to navigate rough waters.

Trump has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him in the federal election case and strongly opposed Smith's filing, claiming Tuesday on Truth Social the document is ""PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT"" that should not have been released before the election and alleging the DOJ released it to distract from Gov. Tim Walz's performance at the vice presidential debate. (The document was made public by the court and prosecutors had no involvement in when it was unsealed.) Trump's lawyers unsuccessfully tried to keep the document from being filed at all, decrying it as a ""180-page false hit piece"" even before seeing it.

More evidence could be released in the coming weeks, as an appendix to Smith's filing -- which would contain more complete transcripts and other evidence that's only excerpted in this document -- still remains under seal. Trump's attorneys have until Oct. 10 to respond to Smith's proposed redactions of the appendix, and U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan could make the document public soon thereafter. Trump then has until Oct. 29 to respond to Smith's filing, though the ex-president asked Wednesday for an additional five weeks to file his response, which would push the deadline until after Election Day. Chutkan has not yet ruled on that request.

How long the case will take to play out. After Trump files his response to Smith's filing, it will be up to Chutkan to determine which charges against Trump, if any, comply with the Supreme Court's ruling and can proceed to trial. Trump is likely to appeal Chutkan's ruling if it leaves any charges intact, however, meaning the dispute could stretch on for months and possibly go back to the Supreme Court for a second time. The case's fate will also depend heavily on the outcome of the presidential election, as if Trump wins, he's likely to appoint Justice Department officials who would drop the charges against him.

Trump faces four felony charges of conspiracy to defraud, obstruction and conspiracy against rights for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, one of four criminal cases that have been brought against the ex-president. (He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.) Smith's filing has been hotly anticipated since the case started moving forward again in August, after being paused for months while the Supreme Court deliberated on whether Trump was immune from the charges. With the immunity debate delaying the trial in the case indefinitely -- it was originally slated for March -- Smith's filing has been viewed as the main way for prosecutors to lay out their case and evidence against Trump for voters ahead of the election. Prosecutors filed the document with the court last week but it was only made public on Wednesday, after Trump's lawyers unsuccessfully tried to have more of the filing redacted. Chutkan rejected their request in a ruling Wednesday and slammed Trump's repeated claims in legal filings that prosecutors have a partisan bias against him. Those claims ""continue a pattern of defense filings focusing on political rhetoric rather than addressing the legal issues at hand,"" Chutkan wrote, adding the arguments are ""unresponsive and unhelpful"" and ""unbefitting of experienced defense counsel."""
Trump Vs. Harris 2024 Polls: Harris Leads In 4 New National Surveys -- Amid Virtual Tie In Swing States,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/03/trump-vs-harris-2024-polls-harris-leads-by-2-points-in-latest-survey/,2024-10-03T14:38:46Z,"The race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is close to a dead heat less than five weeks before the election, according to a string of surveys this month -- the latest four showing Harris with leads ranging from two to five points.

2.2. That's how many points Harris leads Trump by in RealClearPolitics' latest polling average. Meanwhile, FiveThirtyEight's average shows Harris with a 2.8-point lead.

Harris leads Trump by one point overall in the seven battleground states likely to decide the election: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia, according to Cook Political Report survey released Wednesday. Harris leads Trump in five of the states, Trump is up by two points in Georgia, and they're tied in North Carolina.

A poll from NBC News released Sept. 29 found that while Harris still leads Trump among Latinos, the lead is shrinking. The NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC poll -- which was conducted Sept. 16-23 among 1,000 registered Latino voters -- showed 54% supported Harris compared with 40% who supported Trump and 6% who said they were unsure who they would vote for. The support for Harris is higher than it was when Biden was running against Trump, NBC said, but is still significantly lower than past leads Democratic candidates have had, including a 36-point lead in 2020 polling and 50-point lead in 2016 polling. The poll had a margin of error of +/-3.1 percentage points.

Pre-debate surveys found Harris' polling surge appeared to plateau, including a NPR/PBS/Marist survey of registered voters taken Sept. 3-5 that showed Harris leading Trump 49% to 48%, down from a three-point lead in August. Harris was up by two points, 47% to 49%, in a Sept. 3-4 Emerson College survey of likely voters, a slight decline from her four-point lead in Emerson's August poll. Most post-debate surveys show the majority of respondents believe Harris won the debate, but not enough to significantly impact the horserace between the two. A New York Times/Siena poll of likely voters released Sept. 19 found the majority of voters in every demographic gave positive reviews of Harris' Sept. 10 debate performance, with 67% overall saying she did well, compared to 40% who said the same about Trump (Trump led Harris 48%-47% in Times/Siena surveys from early September and late July). The poll also found Harris and Trump are tied at 47%. Two other polls from Sept. 19 show Harris with a slight edge: She's up by four points (49%-45%) in a YouGov/Economist survey of registered voters, and two points (50%-48%) in Fox News' likely voter survey, a small shift after Harris trailed by one point in an early August Fox poll and led by just two points in an early September YouGov poll. Harris was up 52%-46% among likely voters and 51%-47% among registered voters in an ABC News/Ipsos poll taken days following the debate on Sept. 11-13, essentially unchanged from her six-point leads with likely voters in late August and early August ABC/Ipsos surveys -- even though 63% of Americans said Harris won last week's debate.

Harris has narrowed Trump's lead in Iowa over Biden from 18 points in June to four points in a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll conducted Sept. 8-11 by longtime pollster Ann Selzer, known for her accuracy.

Biden dropped out of the race on July 21 after resisting calls from within his own party for weeks to end his reelection bid in the wake of his disastrous performance in the June 27 debate. He immediately endorsed Harris and she announced plans to seek the nomination. The party quickly coalesced around her, with 99% of Democratic delegates voting to officially nominate her in a virtual roll call prior to the Democratic National Convention in August. Harris tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, weeks after Trump announced Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his pick for vice president. ABC News hosted the first debate between Harris and Trump on Sept. 10 from Philadelphia. Pundits, including former Fox News anchor Chris Wallace and NBC News presidential historian Michael Beschloss, widely considered Harris to be the winner of the debate, as she repeatedly needled Trump, causing him to veer off topic. Harris' rise in polls is coupled with an increase in Democratic enthusiasm for the election, which has nearly doubled since Harris' entrance into the race, from 46% in June to 85% now, while enthusiasm among Republicans has stayed stagnant at 71%, according to a Monmouth University poll released Aug. 14.

Will Israel Attack Iran's Nuclear Program? Here's What To Know About Iran's Nuclear Capacity,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/10/03/will-israel-attack-irans-nuclear-program-heres-what-to-know-about-irans-nuclear-capacity/,2024-10-03T14:29:30Z,"While Iran does not yet have nuclear arms, analysts believe the country's nuclear development program might be a prime target for Israeli retaliation -- despite U.S. opposition -- following Iran's missile launches at Israel.

In April, top Iranian general Ahmad Haghtalab threatened that the country could revise its nuclear policies if Israel hit its nuclear sites, saying such an attack could incite Iranian counterattacks targeting Israel's own nuclear facilities, according to reporting by state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

Israel (alongside the U.S. and the U.N.) has been concerned with Iranian nuclear progress since Iran started its weapons program in the late 1990s and early 2000s and has seemingly spent the decades since targeting the program to prevent nuclear development through Israeli-connected clandestine attacks like sabotaging explosions, sophisticated cyberattacks and theft of nuclear secrets. While Israel never took responsibility, Iran accused them of assassinating top Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020. Iran has enough weapons-grades nuclear fuel to make three bombs and is one of the only countries without nuclear weapons that can produce 60%-enriched uranium, a quality of enriched uranium close to the 90% needed for weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal. Reuters reports that Russian ties to Iran have deepened in recent years, and Bloomberg has reported that the U.S. is concerned about the sharing of information and technology between the two countries -- a potential boon to Iran's nuclear interest. Israel is considered an undeclared nuclear weapons power because it is believed to have nuclear arms but has not confirmed possession of them, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.

In mid-2018, former President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Under the Obama administration deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities and permit U.N. inspections, and in return, economic and financial sanctions set by the EU, U.S. and U.N. were lifted. The deal outlined three main points: reducing Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium (a key ingredient in making bombs) by 98%, stopping production of higher-grade enriched uranium for 15 years and removing two-thirds of its more than 19,000 centrifuges (machines that enrich uranium). Under the deal, it would take Iran about 12 months to make a nuclear weapon. Trump was outspoken against the deal, calling it ""too much in exchange for too little."" Since 2018, Iran has significantly advanced its nuclear program, and while there is no evidence of nuclear-armed missiles, officials are concerned about metallurgy and computer modeling research related to weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Iran's nuclear capacity is playing out as a point of contention in the 2024 presidential campaign and was the leading question posed in Tuesday's vice presidential debate, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz arguing Trump is incapable of de-escalating tensions and did not put adequate nuclear protections in place when he pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, argued the Biden-Harris administration has supported Iran financially and that ""Donald Trump consistently made the world more secure."""

Voters will soon cast their ballots to decide which party controls Congress -- now they will be able to bet on it, too.

A federal appeals court lifted a ruling Wednesday that had blocked Americans from betting on the outcome of congressional elections through the prediction market Kalshi. Federal regulators had sought to ban the wagering, arguing it would ""threaten election integrity.""

Kalshi is far from the only market for predictions on politics and other topics. In July, Forbes reported that some $446 million was being wagered on the outcome of the presidential election on Polymarket.

Shortly after the court's decision, 63% of bettors on Kalshi's website predicted Democrats would take the House, while 37% said the Republicans would be victorious.

OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion funding round that valued the booming AI company at $157 billion, nearly double what the company was valued at earlier this year as it is set to transition to a for-profit firm. The company said the funding, from Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Nvidia and longtime backer Microsoft, will go toward its AI research, products and services, and computing capacity.

Crude oil prices, which heavily influence gas prices, rose again Wednesday amid heightened concerns about violence in the Middle East. Oil prices remain far cheaper than they were this summer, with international benchmark Brent crude down 14% from its July peak.

Tesla's stock slumped Wednesday after reporting third-quarter car deliveries that just barely exceeded analyst projections, but failed to meet the most bullish of Wall Street expectations. Still, the 6% year-over-year quarterly delivery growth was a ""mini step in the right direction,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

IT entrepreneur David Steward, the majority owner of World Wide Technology alongside partner Jim Kavanaugh, is the wealthiest Black person in America, and is one of just four Black members on the 2024 ranking of the wealthiest Americans. Steward initially put up $250,000 in capital to start WWT in 1990, according to a 2019 Forbes profile, and has gone on to nab top corporate clients like Apple, Citi, Microsoft and the federal government.

Former shoe salesman Mitchell Morgan's firm Morgan Properties has become the third-largest owner of apartments in the country, landing him on the Forbes 400 for the first time with a net worth of $5.5 billion. He's earned his success by investing in older apartment buildings in midsize cities and quickly renovating them to boost rental income.

In a break from some House Democrats, President Joe Biden is expected to sign a bipartisan bill that will limit federal oversight on qualifying semiconductor projects in the U.S. The legislation comes in response to concerns that ""unnecessary delays"" could stifle the construction of domestic microchip facilities.

Drew Crecente's daughter was murdered 18 years ago, but on Wednesday, he found out someone made a chatbot using her name and yearbook photo on the Character AI platform. ""A grieving father should not have to find out that his dead daughter is being used to try and make money as a chatbot on some website,"" he told Forbes. Character AI said it has since removed the chatbot from the site for violating its policies.

Former President Donald Trump fired his attorneys after the 2020 election and replaced them with Rudy Giuliani because he would be willing to ""spread knowingly false claims of election fraud,"" Special Counsel Jack Smith alleged in a filing on Trump's efforts to overturn the election. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung denounced Smith's filing as ""falsehood-ridden"" and ""unconstitutional.""

New York City Mayor Eric Adams will ""likely"" face additional charges, prosecutors said Wednesday, less than a week after he was indicted on federal charges of bribery and fraud. Adams, who appeared during a hearing Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

A federal judge paused a new California state law that cracked down on the use of AI-generated deepfakes targeting political candidates, weeks after the creator of an AI-altered campaign video mocking Vice President Kamala Harris sued to block the legislation. In his ruling, the judge wrote that while fear of deepfakes may be justified, the law likely violates the First Amendment.

President Joe Biden directed 1,000 active-duty soldiers to assist in delivering food, water and other services to communities impacted by Hurricane Helene, which decimated the South over the weekend.

TOPLINE The deadly Switchblade is central to AeroVironment CEO Wahid Nawabi's ambitions to make the drone maker a multibillion-dollar company in the next three to five years, up from $717 million in revenue in its fiscal 2024.

Switchblade is a loitering munition, an expensive type of one-way kamikaze drone designed to circle the battlefield, awaiting a good opportunity to obliterate its target. Both the Russians and Ukrainians are using them in a war where dense networks of antiaircraft systems have pushed fighter jets and bombers to the margins.

Starting in 2022, the U.S. supplied Ukraine with 700 Switchblade 300s, a $50,000 missile small enough to be carried in a soldier's rucksack and launched with minimal effort. It was quietly used by U.S. special forces in Iraq and Afghanistan in the past decade to take down ""high-value"" insurgents at a distance of as much as 6 miles.

The Ukraine war has been a buzzing laboratory for unmanned aircraft, where makers test and improve their designs. AeroVironment's got off to a rough start against Russian electronic warfare, which reportedly has hampered many sophisticated Western drones, but the company is now looking like one of the winners. (Nawabi says modifications to overcome jamming and better training have pushed Switchblade's effectiveness rate north of 80%.)

Plenty of companies are chasing the opportunity: A study last year by the Vertical Flight Society counted 123 entities in 32 countries that were producing one-way attack drones. But AeroVironment, which has quietly been the Defense Department's main supplier of small drones for the past two decades, may have the relationships, technology and industrial experience to better satisfy the U.S. military's sudden desire for unmanned systems en masse.

WHY IT MATTERS ""The Ukraine conflict has changed the way war is waged, and countries around the world are rushing to acquire loitering munitions,"" says Forbes senior editor Jeremy Bogaisky. ""AeroVironment seems poised to meet the demand from the U.S. military and allies.""

Trump Immigration Plan May End Deportation Safeguards For 2.7 Million,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2024/10/03/trump-immigration-plan-may-end-deportation-safeguards-for-27-million/,2024-10-03T12:04:45Z,"Up to 2.7 million people will lose protection from deportation in a second Trump administration if Donald Trump ends current immigration safeguards. New data show individuals in Temporary Protected Status and other immigration programs could see their legal protection expire in the next two years. Trump officials could add millions of people to potential deportation rolls by allowing immigration safeguards, such as TPS, to end. Immigration enforcement personnel in a second Trump administration could find targeting long-time residents and workers an advantageous way to boost deportation numbers.

""Protection from deportation may expire for up to 2.7 million people within the next two years,"" according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis. ""The vast majority face dismal prospects if forced to return to their birth countries, and obstacles in Congress mean legislation may not rescue even the most sympathetic groups.""

NFAP gathered the data from the Department of Homeland Security and other sources. The immigration programs and categories include Temporary Protected Status, humanitarian parole programs for Cubans, Venezuelans and others and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. Some individuals paroled into the United States, such as Ukrainians, could also hold TPS. The 2.7 million does not include individuals on Deferred Enforced Departure from Liberia, Hong Kong and elsewhere, participants in smaller parole programs or people who received parole at ports of entry.

Donald Trump stated he intends to implement mass deportations of immigrants without legal status that include ""sprawling camps."" Some have argued the plans will be difficult to implement. However, the existence and likely known whereabouts of millions of people who would lose protection from deportation during a second Trump administration adds credibility to the threat. Many of the up to 2.7 million people have lived in the United States for one to two decades or longer.

Economists have warned that reducing the supply of available workers through deportations or new immigration restrictions will harm U.S. workers and the economy. According to an analysis for the Peterson Institute for International Economics by George Mason University economics professor Michael Clemens, it is likely that for every one million unauthorized immigrant workers removed from the United States, 88,000 U.S.-born workers will be ""driven out of employment."" Deporting three million unauthorized immigrant workers per year ""would mean 263,000 fewer jobs held by U.S. native workers, compounded each additional year that mass deportations continue.""

Entrepreneurs will invest in fewer new businesses when ""hit by sudden reductions to labor supply,"" writes Clemens, and business owners will ""invest their capital in other industries and in technologies that use lower-skill labor less intensively, reducing demand for U.S. workers too."" Fewer immigrant workers will also shrink the demand for U.S.-born workers due to less consumer spending on ""grocery stores, leasing offices and other nontraded services."" According to the American Immigration Council, ""Due to the loss of workers across U.S. industries, we found that mass deportation would reduce the U.S. gross domestic product by 4.2% to 6.8%.""

Today, 863,880 people live in the United States under Temporary Protected Status, notes the Congressional Research Service. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, ""During a designated period, individuals who are TPS beneficiaries . . . are not removable from the United States; can obtain an employment authorization document; [and] may be granted travel authorization.""

TPS will expire in 2025 for 13 of the 16 countries, while the TPS designations for Haiti, Somalia and Yemen will end in 2026 unless extended. ""The Trump administration is likely to terminate most if not all new TPS designations in addition to not renewing prior designations,"" according to Elizabeth Carlson and Charles Wheeler, attorneys with CLINIC. Courts blocked attempts by Trump officials to eliminate TPS for at least 300,000 beneficiaries. However, the Ninth Circuit later vacated a lower court injunction, and legal avenues for helping people whose TPS designation has expired might prove fruitless in a second Trump administration.

Donald Trump has denounced Haitians as pet eaters and Venezuelans among migrants ""attacking villages and cities all throughout the Midwest,"" so expect the 200,005 Haitians and 344,355 Venezuelans currently living in America with TPS to be high priorities for deportation. In an interview with NewsNation (October 2, 2024), Trump said he would ""absolutely"" revoke TPS for Haitians and ""bring them back"" to Haiti. ""The Venezuelan government is unlikely to accept the return of its nationals, which would put the Trump administration in an unusual position if it ended the legal status of over 300,000 people but could not remove them from the United States,"" notes the NFAP analysis. More than 180,000 Salvadorans have lived in America with TPS since February 2001.

Trump has promised to end the humanitarian parole programs for several countries. According to data NFAP obtained from DHS, 528,000 individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela arrived in America after the Biden administration approved them for the CHNV humanitarian parole program. As of August 31, 2024, there are 110,000 approvals for humanitarian parole for Cubans, 210,000 for Haitians, 92,000 for Nicaraguans and 116,000 for Venezuelans. The numbers represent differing migration patterns.

DHS has received more applications than the 30,000-monthly allotment, resulting in a selection process, which may have limited the program's effectiveness in reducing illegal immigration. Still, even with these restrictions, after the humanitarian parole programs began, Border Patrol encounters declined by 92% for Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans as a group between December 2022 (the month before the parole programs started) and November 2023 compared to an 18% increase for nationals of non-parole countries, according to an NFAP analysis. Illegal entry also declined for Venezuelans, although that was shorter-lived, likely due to the greater demand and other factors affecting Venezuelans.

Eliminating the humanitarian parole program will likely increase illegal entry, in part because of the expected response from Mexico. The Mexican government agreed to accept 30,000 migrants a month from the four countries if expelled after unlawfully entering America. ""Normally, these migrants would be returned to their country of origin, but the U.S. cannot easily send back people from those four countries for a variety of reasons that include relations with the governments there,"" noted PBS.

After the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Biden officials granted humanitarian parole to Ukrainians under a new program called Uniting for Ukraine. The United States also paroled Afghans following the fall of Kabul.

According to DHS, 651,000 Ukrainians have been approved for humanitarian parole in the United States: 221,000 from Uniting for Ukraine and an additional 430,000 other Ukrainians. Under Operation Allies Welcome, 77,000 Afghans came to America and were approved for humanitarian parole, along with approvals for an additional 56,000 Afghans. If a future administration does not allow them to remain paroled in the United States, the 651,000 Ukrainians and 133,000 Afghans could be subject to deportation unless they can live legally in the United States through other means, such as TPS or asylum.

The Biden administration provided a ""re-parole"" process for Ukrainians in February 2024 and Afghans in June 2023. If Kamala Harris wins in November, her immigration team could use a similar process for individuals in the CHNV program.

Voters have heard little lately about Dreamers, young people without legal status brought to America by their parents. According to DHS, there are 535,030 DACA recipients in the United States as of June 30, 2024. DACA recipients could be deported should the U.S. Supreme Court rule against them. The Biden administration has sought alternative ways for Dreamers to remain in the United States, such as qualifying for H-1B status. A Supreme Court ruling stopped Trump officials from removing current DACA recipients from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

During the vice-presidential debate on October 1, 2024, GOP candidate JD Vance said a second Trump administration would prioritize criminal aliens when attempting to deport millions of people living in the United States without legal status. Analysts point out that is unlikely to be the case and belies how bureaucracies work: Once numerical targets are set, immigration agents will go after the easiest people to find and deport.

Shaul Schwarz, a filmmaker on the six-part Netflix documentary Immigration Nation, had unprecedented access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during the Trump administration. ""I think we repeatedly saw a desire to get numbers,"" he said in an interview in 2020. ""I think anybody who works in ICE knows it, because it was kind of everywhere we went. . . . We definitely saw a lot of agents wanting to hit numbers.""

In other administrations, under normal practice, ICE agents focus on criminal aliens due to limited resources. Yet once an administration decides all undocumented immigrants should be deported, the priority on criminals will fade. ""We thought a number of times during this administration that the priorities had shifted to be that it's no longer just detaining egregious criminals, but there was a wider mandate to say that anybody here illegally could potentially be a target,"" said Schwarz.

Economists note that deporting individuals who have lived in America and worked for years will harm U.S. workers and the American economy. It would also upend the lives of millions of people who sought and were granted protection in the United States."

Last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed three laws targeting election-related deepfake images and videos. The law temporarily blocked by Mendez Wednesday was Assembly Bill 2839, which made it illegal to distribute ""materially deceptive audio or visual media of a candidate"" 120 days before an election and in some cases, 60 days after. The law also allowed targeted candidates to seek a court order to pull down any deepfake ads and also sue the person who distributed them -- although parody and satire deepfakes disclosed as such were exempted. The two other laws, AB 2655 and AB 2355, are focused on online platforms and campaign groups' handling of such content respectively. However, unlike AB 2839, they will go into effect next year.

The judge said: ""While California has a valid interest in protecting the integrity and reliability of the electoral process, AB 2839 is unconstitutional because it lacks the narrow tailoring and least restrictive alternative that a content-based law requires under strict scrutiny.""

Shortly after the court's ruling, Elon Musk tweeted, ""California's unconstitutional law infringing on your freedom of speech has been blocked by the court."" Musk also congratulated Kohls, saying: ""Score one for the people's right to free speech."" In July, Musk -- who has endorsed former President Donald Trump's candidacy for the White House -- boosted Kohls' deepfake campaign video, which used AI-generated audio clips to mimic Harris' voice and described her as the ""ultimate diversity hire"" and a ""deep state puppet."" Musk's post promoting the video garnered more than 135 million views on X. The post drew an immediate reaction from Newsom, who vowed to sign legislation to crack down on political deepfakes, prompting a mocking response from Musk saying: ""parody is legal in America."" After Newsom passed the laws, Musk reshared the video and wrote: ""You're not gonna believe this, but Gavin Newsom, just announced that he signed a LAW to make parody illegal, based on this video.""

Donald Trump, who made conservative appointments to the Supreme Court resulting in the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, has supported states determining their own abortion policies. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned, 20 states have banned or restricted abortion earlier in the stages of pregnancy than what was established by Roe v. Wade, according to The New York Times. However, the former president stopped short of supporting a national ban on abortion after being coy about the matter, saying in a Truth Social post this week he ""would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances."" Melania Trump's stance on abortion was largely unclear prior to her memoir. The memoir will dive into details about the former first lady's private life, which she said in a video last month ""has often been the subject of public scrutiny and misrepresentation."" The book will also cover the assassination attempt against Donald Trump and his loss in the 2020 election.

Monday's debate between Vance and Walz was largely considered civil and policy-focused. The candidates touched on topics including the economy, the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot, health care, the southern border and abortion rights. Microphones were only cut once in a heated exchange after the moderators fact-checked Vance and he went on a tangent about the process for applying for an asylum appointment online following a discussion about migrants in Springfield, Ohio. An early poll from after the debate showed there was no clear winner: Forty-two percent of respondents to a CBS and YouGov poll said they felt Vance won and 41% felt Walz won, while 17% said it ended in a tie.

"The Strange Story Of 'Megalopolis,' Explained",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2024/10/02/the-strange-story-of-megalopolis-explained/,2024-10-02T19:31:33Z,"The story behind the making of Francis Ford Coppola's Megalopolis might be more interesting than the film itself, a passion project funded by the great director that comes across as somewhat muddled, but deeply sincere.

Megalopolis plays with too many ideas, a ball of plot threads that are difficult to follow, but the message of the story is fairly simple.

Warning -- Spoilers Ahead

Adam Driver stars as Cesar Catilina, a visionary architect who wants to build a utopia out of a semi-magical metal he invented called Megalon, which flows like liquid and boasts a golden glow.

Cesar is locked in a fierce rivalry with Franklyn Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito), the corrupt mayor of New Rome. New Rome looks like a vaguely futuristic New York, with a hint of Rapture from Bioshock, blended with the gaudy interiors of Trump Tower.

The aesthetic of this CGI dreamscape is wildly inconsistent; sometimes New Rome is genuinely stunning, and sometimes it looks like it was shot in a parking lot with a greenscreen.

Cesar is introduced as having the power to stop time, but he never does anything with it, because it's not a literal power; it's a visual metaphor for his artistic talents. All Cesar wants to do is build his ""Megalopolis"" out of Megalon, but the city's power players are determined to crush his ambitions.

The story is modeled on the fall of Rome, focusing on the corruption and stagnation of the rich and powerful, who are too busy planning coups and accepting bribes to think of the future, or the plight of the working class.

Cesar is also rich and powerful, but his ideas prove threatening to his peers; essentially, the film is about how everyone should follow his vision. Or rather, it's about embracing the future and moving past nostalgia, about empowering artists to show us a path ahead.

Cesar's cousin, Clodio Pulcher (Shia LaBeouf), hates Cesar and plots his demise -- he spends most of the runtime wearing drag, and in the final act of the film, becomes a very on-the-nose metaphor for Donald Trump.

Clodio's father Hamilton Crassus III (Jon Voight), is one of the most powerful men in the city, and soon becomes involved with Cesar's ex-girlfriend, a Fox News-esque reporter named Wow Platinum (Aubrey Plaza).

After being rejected by Cesar, who is still pining over the memory of his dead wife, Wow Platinum is determined to become filthy rich, but she repeatedly shows throughout the film that she would give it all up for Cesar, if he would only take her back (he doesn't).

Cesar has fallen for the mayor's daughter Julia (Nathalie Emmanuel), who impresses him after noticing his ability to stop time; she can see his artistic talents, and seems to truly understand his vision.

Cesar and Julia have something of a forbidden love affair, and their union frustrates Mayor Cicero, who is uncomfortable with his daughter making her own decisions. However, Julia's love inspires Cesar to move on from his mourning period and accept the death of his wife.

Throughout most of the runtime, Cesar is haunted by a smear campaign orchestrated by Mayor Cicero, who wants the public to believe that Cesar murdered his wife.

Cesar also faces many trials and tribulations, but they are always resolved very quickly; he is accused of having sex with a minor, which is later revealed to be a deep-fake video; he survives an assassination attempt, and is miraculously healed by Megalon.

These events cause Cesar to lose faith in himself, and thus, lose his ability to stop time, but he regains it in the final scene of the film. Generally, the events of the film move through a haze, like a meandering dream, with little regard for traditional story structure.

Eventually, Wow Platinum seduces Clodio, and the two make a brazen attempt to steal Hamilton Crassus's business empire from him, but the old man has the last laugh, murdering Wow with a bow and arrow and hitting his son with a couple, just for good measure.

Clodio is later murdered by the angry mob that he was attempting to rile up against Cesar, and dies in the same manner as Mussolini, while Crassus pledges to fund Cesar's vision.

The city is bombarded by the fragments of a Soviet satellite, but we don't see much of the aftermath; the destruction paves the way for Cesar to give a rousing speech to the citizens, impressing Mayor Cicero and empowering him to finally build Megapolis.

Cesar and Julia have a baby, and Megapolis is built, but it is never explained what the innovation of the structure actually is.

The final shot of the film shows their child, and Cesar once more freezes time, but his child continues to move, unaffected.

Megapolis is an unfocused tale, but the point of the film is that innovation is stifled by the wealthy and powerful, who seek to keep the world frozen in time.

Coppola seems to be saying that the artistically inclined and ambitious should be allowed to achieve their goals, without being stifled by the selfish concerns of old, rich men. Many times, the film highlights the corrosive effect of money and nostalgia.

However, the film is somewhat contradictory in its message; Megapolis seems to disregard the concerns of the working class, which it depicts as a blindly angry mob, and entrusts wealthy individuals like Crassus to fund great works of art.

The film clearly states that corruption and stagnation is bad, but shows that the wealthy are capable of creating great things, if so inclined; Cesar is shown as being unambiguously correct, most of the time.

However, he is only able to succeed once he moves on with his new love, rather than pining over the dead.

The final shot of the film is optimistic, communicating that the future lies in the hands of the next generation, that Cesar's artistic gifts are being passed on, and no longer belong to him.

It's worth arguing whether Francis Ford Coppola successfully achieved his vision while making this film, but his earnestness is undeniable."
"Hats Off To You, Gentlemen - And Ladies - A Real Debate.",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliamdur/2024/10/02/hats-off-to-you-gentlemen--and-ladies--a-real-debate/,2024-10-02T19:04:38Z,"Last night, we got something we've long waited for: a real debate between two major candidates for national office, in this case, for vice president of the United States.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Democrat and running mate of Vice President Kamala Harris, squared off against Ohio Senator JD Vance, Republican and running mate of former President Donald Trump. Although they couldn't be more divergent in their positions, views, and political stances - none of which I will discuss here - they both seemed committed to a respectful debate. I've watched every debate since the first one - JFK versus Nixon in 1960 - and was more than delighted to see a return to civility on the debate stage, as rare as that has become.

Maybe it's just me, but I appreciate a good formal debate rather than a couple of combatants slinging around sound bites, platitudes, and bromides at will, with no or little respect for the rules and procedures, thinking that the one who screams the loudest ingest wins. That's reminiscent of the food fight in Animal House.

As a member of my high school debate club and intermural debate team¸ I've been watching - election after election for 64 years with hopes of seeing a good mutually respectful debate. There were some but not enough. Last night we got one.

Casting off, for a moment, the larger issues of rhetoric, context, and presentation because brevity rules here, making a winning argument that can be fairly adjudicated involves your claim 9what you are contending), warrants (reasons for your claims, and proof (evidence and logic to support your position). Both Walz and Vance complied, thereby precluding a brawl that erupts when one boxer fights by Marquess of Queensbury Rules and the other one doesn't - or if neither does.

Of course, strong enforcement of the rules of engagement is crucial, and with two brief but noticeable moments, Nora O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, both of CBS, provided exactly that. In one, Vance just wouldn't stop talking over an instruction to stop (time elapsed), and in the other, both candidates refused to give way. But in a 90-minute debate, we had 89 civil, respectful minutes.

By agreement on both sides, there was to be no fact checking going on, and it was glaring at times. But in keeping with my promise not to discuss politics, suffice to say it would have been nice - and practical.

But in the meantime, hats off. We had a real debate. It could have been more substantive at times, but it was a real debate"
Vance Suggests Health Insurance Changes Could Raise Premiums For Those With Pre-existing Conditions,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2024/10/02/vance-suggests-changes-to-health-insurance-that-may-raise-premiums-for-those-with-preexisting-conditions/,2024-10-02T18:24:55Z,"Update, Wednesday, Oct. 2: This article has been updated to include comments from the Oct. 1 vice presidential debate.

Memorably, former President Trump mentioned ""concepts of a plan"" when asked about his proposal to reform healthcare at last month's presidential debate. But in the days leading up to and during Tuesday's vice presidential debate, Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, says there is a plan to ""fix healthcare,"" specifically with respect to the Affordable Care Act.

Vance has argued that the health insurance market needs to be deregulated. He has spoken of placing people with chronic conditions into separate insurance pools. But this could lead to insurers charging higher premiums for individuals with pre-existing conditions.

During the Oct. 1 vice presidential debate, Vance appeared to walk back his previous statement a bit by saying he was referring to reinsurance, or a way in which the government could insulate itself from the risk of high-cost claims. He went on to state that Trump favors the idea of permitting ""states to experiment a little bit on how to cover both the chronically ill and non-chronically ill.""

Kamala Harris' campaign released a report on Monday that maintained that millions of people with preexisting conditions could lose protection guaranteed them by ACA rules if the changes Vance and Trump are proposing go through. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, emphasized that point at Tuesday's debate.

Vance responded that he and Trump plan to keep in place the existing laws and regulations protecting those with preexisting conditions. He did not, however, explain that those laws are within the ACA.

At the debate, Vance also defended Trump as having ""saved"" the ACA. But, as Walz pointed out, during his term in office, Trump sought to undo ACA by executive action, legislation and lawsuits. The law survived. And during Trump's bid to secure a second presidential term, he has wavered on the idea of whether to repeal the ACA.

Perhaps given the fact that the ACA is popular and growing in terms of enrollment and the uninsured rate is at an historic low, rather than do away with the ACA, Trump is now calling for what he describes as improvements in the law.

However, Vance is proposing substantial changes to ACA health insurance coverage that could lead to the elimination of the ACA's protection against insurers levying higher premiums on individuals in poor health.

Vance has spoken of deregulating the insurance market so that ""people can choose a plan that actually makes sense for them,"" as reported in The Hill. On the campaign trail in North Carolina last month, for instance, Vance suggested getting rid of the ACA's single-risk pool which enables community rating and introducing separate risk pools for people with chronic health conditions. This would disrupt one of the ACA's guiding principles which states that health insurers may not charge people higher premiums based on their health status.

KFF estimates that 27% of adults have a condition that would have led to denied coverage by an insurer in the individual market before the ACA. Prior to the law's passage, insurers were able to deny coverage for a wide range of diseases and conditions or charge substantially higher premiums for individuals with preexisting conditions.

Vance has said he wants to leave decisions on how to regulate what insurers do with the aforementioned high-risk insurance pools up to individual states. Subsequently, if certain states permit premium surcharges based on health status, people with preexisting conditions would theoretically have access to health insurance, but it could be unaffordable.

State high-risk pools could provide access to coverage to people with preexisting conditions as an alternative to the private insurance market. But whether such pools would be effective depends on adequate funding, which did not occur in the states that had instituted them before the ACA was enacted. And so these insurance pools were not a feasible option for many due to exorbitant premiums.

On the stump, Vance has also said ""we're going to actually implement some regulatory reform in the healthcare system that allows people to choose a healthcare plan that works for them. If you only go to the doctor once a year, you're going to need a different healthcare plan than somebody who goes to the doctor 14 times a year because they've got chronic pain or they've got some other chronic condition.""

Though it's unclear what in particular Vance has in mind for healthier individuals, maybe he's referring to short-term insurance plans, which the Trump Administration promoted and made more accessible. These options do not offer coverage as comprehensive as ACA plans. Some healthy people might have an incentive to opt for short-term insurance, which can be renewed every three to 12 months, as a way to lower premiums.

The problem is that this may drive up costs considerably for the sicker folks who remain on ACA exchange plans. Moreover, the idea of offering healthy individuals a cheaper plan with far less complete coverage tacitly presumes that people's health needs are static, which they often are not. Perhaps the most important aim of having health insurance is to provide financial protection from unforeseen events. The fact that a person only sees a doctor once now has no bearing on the future, whether that's next year or later.

Only 39% of survey respondents polled by KFF in February of this year were aware that the ACA prohibits insurers from denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions, and only 31% knew that the ACA also prevents sick people from being charged higher premiums than healthy individuals. In light of Vance's statements on ACA reform, it would seem important that the electorate be better informed about what the proposed changes could entail."
How JD Vance Distanced Himself From The False Pet-Eating Conspiracy In Springfield He Helped Spread,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/02/how-jd-vance-distanced-himself-from-the-false-pet-eating-conspiracy-in-springfield-he-helped-spread/,2024-10-02T18:01:08Z,"Republican vice presidential nominee Ohio Sen. JD Vance has distanced himself in recent weeks from the debunked viral conspiracy he helped spread that Haitian migrants are eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, pivoting at Tuesday's vice presidential debate to focus on blaming the migrant influx for increasing housing costs and straining local services.

Vance claimed in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sept. 9 that Haitian migrants -- incorrectly claiming they are in the United States ""illegally"" -- are abducting and eating pets in Springfield, citing ""reports,"" though he did not specify what reports. His post was viewed more than 11 million times. The next day, Vance claimed in another post his office has received ""many inquiries"" from Springfield residents who ""said their neighbors' pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants,"" though he acknowledged the claims could be false. In that post, he said a ""child was murdered by a Haitian migrant who had no right to be here"" -- possibly referring to an incident last year in which migrant Hermanio Joseph collided with a school bus in a car accident that killed one child. Joseph was charged with involuntary manslaughter. Trump later repeated the false pet-eating claims in a widely mocked moment in his Sept. 10 debate against Harris: ""They're eating the dogs. They're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there,"" he said, to which Harris laughed and called his comments ""extreme."" On Sept. 13, Vance made two posts on X referencing Springfield, though he did not mention the pet-eating claims in either post. In both posts, he claimed housing prices, communicable diseases and crime rates are rising in Springfield, blaming the increase in migrants to the city. Though Springfield does face a housing affordability problem, reports indicate infectious disease in Springfield declined between 2022 and 2023. Local officials also disputed a claim Vance made that murders increased 81% in Springfield under Biden and Harris -- though murders did increase from five to nine from 2021 to 2023, data shows there were more murders in Springfield under Trump's presidency compared to Biden's, and prosecutors said zero murders have involved Haitians. Vance has since regularly discussed Springfield at campaign rallies, though he no longer uses the false pet-eating anecdotes -- but he does continue to incorrectly label Springfield's Haitian migrants as ""illegal."" On Sept. 17, Vance said in Sparta, Michigan, the migrant influx has ""caused an incredible stress"" on local services. In a Sept. 18 rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, Vance claimed Springfield residents ""won't even drive"" because they fear Haitian migrants on the road. A reporter asked Vance in North Carolina last week if he would change how he spread the false pet-eating rumors, to which Vance said he will ""listen to the people that I serve and not a biased media.""

The influx of about 20,000 Haitian migrants to Springfield over the past several years has put a strain on local hospital services, The New York Times reported, citing a 13-fold increase in Haitian patients at the local clinic between 2021 and 2023. The school district and local clinic have hired Haitian Creole translators, increasing expenditures on translation services. Springfield's housing authority executive director, Michelle Lee-Hall, told The New York Times housing affordability problems have been aggravated by landlords pivoting to migrants willing to pay higher rent. But the influx of migrants has also helped revitalize a declining manufacturing town, with Haitian migrants opening restaurants and businesses and taking manufacturing jobs.

Springfield Police investigations commander Mike Kranz told Forbes in September there have been ""no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community."" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, wrote in a New York Times op-ed he is ""saddened by how [Trump and Vance] and others continue to repeat claims that lack evidence and disparage the legal migrants living in Springfield,"" calling the community a ""refuge for the oppressed"" and a ""place of opportunity.""

Biden announced the 1,000 soldiers just before he is set to visit North Carolina and South Carolina to survey the damage and meet with local leaders. Vice President Kamala Harris will visit Georgia on Wednesday.

Trump criticized the Biden administration's response to the hurricane Monday, alleging Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp was ""having a hard time getting the president on the phone"" -- despite Kemp saying he had spoken to the president -- leading Biden to say Trump was lying, and calling him ""irresponsible."" Trump also accused Harris of staging a photo on social media of her being briefed by FEMA about the storm because her headphones were not plugged into her phone. Forbes has reached out to the Harris campaign for comment on the allegation.

Hurricane Helene made landfall as a Category 4 storm in the Big Bend region of Florida on Thursday before moving northward. It brought ""historic and catastrophic flooding"" to the southern Appalachians. North Carolina had the most reported deaths from the storm of any state -- about 90 -- followed by South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, though there were also deaths in Tennessee and Virginia."
Does Project 2025 Plan A 'Registry Of Pregnancies'?

Tim Walz claimed at Tuesday's vice presidential debate that the right-wing policy agenda Project 2025 calls for a ""registry of pregnancies,"" repeating claims he's made on the campaign trail -- but that mischaracterizes the conservative proposal, which wants states to report detailed abortion, though not pregnancy, information to the government.

Vice President Kamala Harris described Project 2025's proposal more accurately in her speech at the Democratic National Convention, decrying that Republicans want to ""force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions.""

In addition to monitoring abortions in a more comprehensive way, Project 2025's proposal also calls for the CDC to stop collecting data on gender identity -- part of a broader move away from the federal government supporting transgender rights -- claiming that collecting that data ""legitimizes"" arguments in favor of transgender rights ""and encourages the phenomenon of ever-multiplying subjective identities.""

Project 2025's policy agenda -- which broadly calls for a total overhaul of the executive branch if former President Donald Trump wins the election -- is overwhelmingly opposed to abortion, proposing a total focus by the federal government to push a pro-family agenda that rejects abortion rights. The agenda says HHS should be known as the ""Department of Life"" by ""explicitly rejecting the notion that abortion is health care"" and having a mission statement that protects Americans' well-being ""from conception to natural death."" Project 2025 broadly calls for restricting abortion, suggesting the Food and Drug Administration should rescind its approval of abortion drug mifepristone and the federal government should start enforcing the Comstock Act, a long-dormant 19th century law that would ban abortion pills and any abortion equipment from being sent through the mail.

It's unclear if Trump would take up Project 2025's proposals on abortion or other issues if he's elected. The ex-president has sought to distance himself from Project 2025 and its policy proposals as they've come under controversy, though he does have ties to the Heritage Foundation -- the group spearheading the agenda -- and could always take up its proposals if elected regardless of what he says while campaigning. Trump has said he wants to leave abortion up to the states and said he opposes a national abortion ban, but has not commented on any federal reporting of abortions in states where it is allowed. Vance, who has strong links to the Heritage Foundation, said only at the debate that ""certainly we won't"" create a ""federal pregnancy monitoring agency,"" but did not comment beyond that on any increased surveillance of abortions. Vance has called for banning abortion nationwide in the past -- even as he denied doing so at Tuesday's debate -- but has more recently said he backs Trump's view that it should be left to the states.

625,978. That's the number of U.S. abortions that were reported to the CDC in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available. The CDC already requests data including the pregnant person's age, state of residence, gestational age of the fetus, race, marital status, method of abortion and number of previous births and abortions, though Project 2025's proposals would add more data like why people got abortions and impose consequences if states don't report the data. The CDC's most recent data is from before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and states started banning the procedure, though reports from non-governmental organizations suggest abortion rates have actually gone up despite the restrictions.

Polling shows that most Americans are broadly in favor of abortion rights and the issue has historically galvanized voters since the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling, with a series of ballot measures all breaking in favor of abortion rights and races in which abortion has been a big focus often breaking in favor of Democrats. Trump has tried to minimize the issue and said he now supports leaving abortion rights up to states after previously floating support for a national 15-week ban, and Vance, who previously touted his anti-abortion views on his website prior to becoming Trump's nominee, has downplayed them since getting on the ticket. The senator said Tuesday he acknowledges Republicans have ""to do so much better of a job at earning the American People's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us."" Democrats and the Harris campaign have also used Project 2025 as a key argument against Trump, repeatedly pointing to its extreme proposals as a key reason for voters to oppose the ex-president and insisting he will carry out its plans even as Trump has tried to distance himself."
Tim Walz-JD Vance Polls: Both Candidates' Favorability Increases Post-Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2024/10/02/tim-walz-jd-vance-polls-both-candidates-favorability-increases-post-debate/,2024-10-02T16:06:15Z,"Polling after the the likely only vice presidential debate between Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz showed that, despite there being no clear winner, both candidates increased their favorability -- though more viewers still hold Walz in higher regard than Vance.

Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text ""Alerts"" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.

The candidates faced off in their first, and likely only, vice presidential debate on Tuesday on CBS. Heading into the debate, both candidates remained relatively unknown, with 25% of registered voters in the September AP poll saying they don't know enough about Walz and 21% saying the same about Vance.

42%. That's how many debate viewers in the CBS poll thought Vance was the winner of the debate, compared to 41% who thought Walz won. Seventeen percent of viewers said the debate ended in a tie.

Walz was the only candidate on either the Democratic or Republican party ticket who had more supporters than detractors among the likely electorate of Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, according to the Sept. 28 New York Times/Siena College poll.

In the past, experts have been skeptical of whether vice presidential picks have much influence on an election's outcome, but with November's race expected to be highly contested, even small boosts from vice presidential picks could be game changers. In the latest FiveThirtyEight averages, Harris had virtually erased the growing lead Trump had on President Joe Biden and is now ahead by nearly three points. Both campaigns have cast their vice presidential picks as politicians who can speak to voters in key midwestern swing states, though Vance is also seen as a Trump loyalist and an appeal to his MAGA base, and some parts of the Democratic base pushed for Walz due to his support for some progressive priorities. Joel Goldstein, professor emeritus at Saint Louis University and an expert on vice presidencies, recently told Minnesota Public Radio that while most people are going to vote on their perception of the presidential candidates, the vice presidential picks provide insight into how they make decisions, which can help voters decide who to support. Running mates can also make differences in their home states, Goldstein said -- though in this case, both Minnesota and Ohio are unlikely to be key swing states.

We estimate Vance is worth about $10 million, while Walz has an estimated net worth of just north of $1 million. Vance has made his money on his best-selling memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" along with real estate investments that we estimate total about $4 million. Walz, on the other hand, owns no property, stocks or bonds and his wealth is based on his and his wife's pensions for their work in teaching and government."

2. That's how many points Harris leads Trump by Real Clear Politics' national polling average, while FiveThirtyEight's average shows her up by 2.7 points.

Harris is receiving more support from younger, non-white and female voters -- demographics who showed indecision over their support for Biden before he dropped out -- according to a recent New York Times survey, which noted Harris had support from 84% of Black voters in the polls, a higher share of support than Biden had before withdrawing from the race in July.

Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, despite insisting he would continue his campaign amid an intraparty revolt in the wake of his June 27 debate performance. He immediately endorsed Harris, she announced plans to seek the nomination and officially became the nominee in the first week of August when 99% of delegates voted for her in a virtual roll call. Prior to Biden dropping out of the race, polls consistently found Trump would beat him in most battleground states, despite Biden winning six of the seven (with the exception of North Carolina) in the 2020 election.

Bitcoin: What Next? Three Things To Watch Out For.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/02/bitcoin-what-next-three-things-to-watch-out-for/,2024-10-02T14:49:35Z,"The best charts to read are the simplest. Bitcoin's chart right now could be on the first page of a book called Technical analysis 101:

It is faintly bearish. It is bearish because the sideways trend is dropping down a little, which suggests beyond the high volatility the tendency is for the price of bitcoin to fall. It's not a big tendency, but down is not up.

You can also see the range of this trend is wide and that simply indicates uncertainty. The bigger the range, the greater the factor of the price being heavily influenced by indecision or noise or uncertainty or rise, or however you want to think of volatility. Before this move the price was much more settled but now there is a polarization between the bull and the bears and the result is large swings of consensus.

So what now?

Interestingly, statistically it takes on average five attempts for a breakout and we are now on move five. Anyone who has a basis in stats will tell you that means nothing to us in this instance, but you don't have to be a killjoy to take note. Also a breakout in this case can go both ways.

For swing traders this is a gift but frankly I've never been comfortable selling tops and buying dips in these kind of trends because the bend in the end can rip the shirt off your back.

To me there are three things to watch out for:

To me it's a lot about next month's election. Crypto calculus is simple: Trump up, Harris down. We know the U.S. government hates crypto, that the democrats dislike it and that Trump likes it or at least has issued his own NFTs.

However, what might really spike crypto far beyond the U.S. election is Russia/Ukraine and the Middle East. Both these situations have a big audience for flight capital and any meltdown will see big money head for bitcoin on the way to the airport. If bitcoin price spikes its ""heads up."""
Collapse Of Reproductive Rights In America On Exhibit In Dallas,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chaddscott/2024/10/02/collapse-of-reproductive-rights-in-america-on-exhibit-in-dallas/,2024-10-02T14:04:32Z,"Artists from around the South brought together to share stories of a national healthcare crisis.

Tens of millions of Americans found themselves asking that question in spring 2022 when news leaked that the Supreme Court would be throwing out 50 years of supposedly settled law and overturning the Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing women access to abortion nationwide.

Dallas-based curators Emily Edwards and Sara Hignite were among those in disbelief.

Is it Real? Yes It Is! (1969), the title of Juanita McNeely's multi-panel painting depicting her harrowing illegal abortion experience in the permanent collection and presently on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.

The feeling and artwork gave name to an unprecedented exhibition from Edwards and Hignite, the first organized and mounted in the American South directly addressing abortion access and reproductive rights. The pair has assembled more than 30 artists, most from or connected to the South-where reproductive rights have suffered their greatest assault-most representing marginalized communities-those most at risk from the politicians' and judges' anti-woman cruelties.

Like 28-year-old Amber Nicole Thurman, a Black woman from Georgia who died during childbirth from a preventable infection after being denied life-saving healthcare by the state's draconian abortion laws. Art curators work their entire lives hoping shows intersect with current events, capturing lighting in a bottle, drawing crowds and media attention. Not in this case.

In the case of ""Is It Real? Contemporary Artists Address Reproductive Freedom,"" it's ""ripped from the headlines"" feel represents tragedy. Ongoing tragedy. Needless tragedy.

""The United States is experiencing a reproductive care emergency across the board, and the worst states are in the South, and that's why this exhibition is based in the South,"" Hignite told Forbes.com. ""That's why we're featuring and focusing on artists who have connections to the southern states. If you look at the numbers, potentially every state in the South has a ban on abortion because you've either got total bans or six-week bans. We're living it every single day.""

""Is it Real"" opens at Lagoon Studio in Dallas (1105 Lagoon Drive, Dallas, TX, 75207) on October 5 and runs through October 26, 2024, nine days before Election Day in America.

The symbolism of debuting the presentation in Dallas-where Roe v. Wade was first argued in 1970 before reaching the Supreme Court in 1973-and in Texas-where dogma and control trump safety for pregnant women-is not lost on the curators.

""Is it Real"" examines strategies contemporary artists employ to address the topic of reproductive freedom. Leading with empathy and fact, and challenging often deeply rooted misinformation, the exhibition seeks to destigmatize and humanize reproductive care.

""By transporting people who are experiencing the show into so many different perspectives, into, quite literally, the shoes of some of the experiences, (visitors) are able to see how multifaceted this reproductive freedom crisis is,"" Edwards told Forbes.com. ""(The artists) help foster empathy by rooting (issues) in emotion and in beauty.""

That's what artists can do. They can't wave a magic wand and change laws, but they can change minds.

""Sarah and I both believe in the soft power of art,"" Edwards added. ""If someone comes in and they want to protest the work, they're likely not leaving being like, 'I'm going to vote blue,' but there's a softening that happens, and I think that's the hope for everyone who comes in here who is either on the fence, isn't sure, maybe is not an activist, maybe is just not informed on these issues. I've seen people soften, including my own parents who do not view this topic the same way I do. They've come to every show, and I see them soften, and I see them care, and I see them ask questions, and those questions turn into people changing their minds over time.""

Minds do change. Ballot initiatives related to abortion access nationwide since the repeal of Roe have overwhelmingly gone in favor of more access.

""I have had conversations with people who have started having conversations with family members and friends or people in their community who didn't believe in the right to abortion and maybe we're moving the needle now as they're hearing about this project,"" Hignite said. ""I don't want to overstate it. Obviously, this exhibition is not changing the landscape of abortion access in the country, but if we can just start cracking the window to the idea of coming around to believing in everyone's right to self-determination and bodily autonomy, then we will be so proud.""

While abortion access draws most of the headlines in the contemporary struggle for reproductive rights in America, it's not the only issue, nor the only issue approached in the exhibition.

""It's about the mortality rate of pregnant women, particularly Black women,"" Edwards said. ""It's about rape and sexual assault. It's about trans men who are also experiencing these experiences, and so having these different stories coming together in the show that really all interwoven to show how widespread this is, how this impacts everyone.""

Maternal mortality is on the rise in America. Black women, Native American and Alaska Native people suffer disproportionately. The South, of course, leads the way. Restrictive abortion policies have always gone hand-in-hand with higher maternal mortality. Not that anywhere in America can brag. America ranks 55 globally for maternal mortality, worst of any developed nation.

Broadly speaking, the U.S. is experiencing a reproductive care emergency. From proposed total bans on abortion-including in the case of rape and incest-to threats against birth control, Plan B, and IVF. Abortion access serves as the flash point for a frightening regression of not only reproductive care in America, a subject always impacting women more gravely, but also a frightening regression in how women are viewed, treated, and respected societally.

In November, 70 million or so Americans will vote for Donald Trump for president. He was found liable for rape. His running mate J.D. Vance has verbalized insulting, denigrating, dehumanizing opinions related to women across a spectrum of subjects over many years that would have been cringe-worthy in the 1960s. Comments that would have immediately disqualified a candidate for local office, let alone national office, just 10 years ago.

""Is It Real?"" exposes the harsh realities of the current political climate and envisions a more just country in which every human has the basic right to control their own body and determine their own future.

That hardly seems radical, but in 2024, in Dallas, in Texas, across the South, it is. An advertising poster for the show featuring a Guerrilla Girls Broadband artwork was banned from Dallas Rapid Transit rail stations.

That's why Edwards and Hignite chose to finance and present their project themselves, not in a museum.

""We didn't have to worry about any of the institutional challenges and bureaucracy,"" Hignite explained. ""We wanted to make sure that we could fully realize our curatorial vision, and we decided early on that the best way to do that was to do it independently.""

They've bootstrapped all the fundraising themselves, every penny, grass roots style. They've been supported by The Goss-Michael Foundation, ACLU of Texas, Texas Abortion Advocacy Network, and more than 100 individual donors. ""Is It Real?"" will also be raising funds for Texas Equal Access Fund and The Afiya Center, two Texas-based mutual aid organizations providing essential support to people needing reproductive care and related services.

Programming will include a film series organized in partnership with Spacy DTX; wellness workshops; panel discussions; Get Out the Vote initiatives; a resource library; and a reflection space organized by Make Art with Purpose. Admission to the exhibition and related programs are free and open to the public.

The collapse of reproductive rights in America and its resulting consequences represent a tragedy. In the face of tragedy and crisis and inequality and barbarity, artists make work. Curators bring that work to the public. The public's role is to vote."

The betting markets declared Vance the winner of the debate. On the crypto-based betting platform Polymarket, bookmakers believe Vance has a 73% chance of being judged the winner of Tuesday night's debate in post-debate opinion polls, compared to Walz's 27%. This is a complete inversion from before the debate, when bettors gave Walz a 70% chance of being declared the debate winner.

Bookmakers on the election betting markets gave former President Donald Trump's chances of winning a slight boost on Tuesday, but most of the shift occurred a few hours before the debate -- likely as a result of some favorable polling for the Republican in Georgia and North Carolina. Vice President Kamala Harris, however, holds a slight lead, with bookmarkers giving her a 50.3% chance of winning in November compared to 48.9%.

Trump Claims Harris 'Just' Requested Another Debate -- But Says Again He Won't Do It (Forbes)"
Bipartisan Support Builds For Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/02/bipartisan-support-builds-for-strategic-bitcoin-reserve/,2024-10-02T11:10:10Z,"So declared Senator Cynthia Lummis at Bitcoin Nashville in July when she unveiled legislation to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. Senator Lummis' bill would use existing funds at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to purchase 1 million bitcoin. The move would cement the United States' position as the largest nation-state holder of bitcoin, granting it five percent ownership of the entire network -- on par with the country's stake in the global gold supply.

Lummis' comparison to the Louisiana Purchase resonated with the pro-crypto crowd. In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson made an asymmetric bet by buying the Louisiana Territory -- one that paid asymmetric returns. Now in 2024, innovation-friendly policymakers see a similar opportunity in bitcoin.

On the same day Lummis released the details of her bill, former President Donald Trump outlined his own policy to create a ""national bitcoin stockpile"" and to ""never sell"" the roughly 200,000 bitcoin currently owned by the US government. President Trump also likened bitcoin to ""the steel industry of 100 years ago"" and vowed to make the United States ""the crypto capital of the planet.""

At the same conference, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. -- who has since suspended his presidential campaign and endorsed President Trump -- fleshed out an alternative strategic reserve plan to acquire 5 million Bitcoin, or approximately 25 percent of the global supply. Kennedy is now acting as an advisor and surrogate for President Trump on the campaign trail.

Support for a strategic bitcoin reserve has now crossed party lines. In a recent episode of the Unchained Podcast, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, threw his support behind the idea: ""We want to make sure that we have the openness to having bitcoin as part of the Federal Reserve and as a reserve asset because of its potential for appreciation and because of its potential to allow America to set the financial standards.""

The bulk of bitcoin owned by the United States was confiscated from illicit actors. Typically, the US government would sell these funds back into the market. But in the case of bitcoin, Representative Khanna believes Uncle Sam should hold onto it. In a statement from the Congressman's office, he said, ""Bitcoin that has been seized by the US government should be used as a strategic reserve asset given its potential for appreciation.""

Representative Khanna has an outsize voice on crypto issues in the Democratic Caucus. In July, he helped spearhead a letter to the Democratic National Committee, which urged leaders to shed the ""perception that the party holds a negative view on digital assets."" In the same letter, Democrats encouraged party leaders to enact what has since been dubbed ""the crypto reset"" by including pro-digital asset language in the party platform, engaging with industry experts, and selecting a pro-innovation chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (translation: Someone who isn't Gary Gensler).

But short of replacing the current SEC Chair, some advocates believe there is an even easier way to enact a ""crypto reset"" -- by supporting a strategic bitcoin reserve.

Dennis Porter is the CEO and co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to educating lawmakers on the benefits of bitcoin. According to Porter, ""Supporting popular policy initiatives such as a strategic bitcoin reserve or the 'right to self-custody' would go a long way in helping Democrats secure the support of the new and rapidly growing Bitcoin voter base.""

Porter believes bitcoin partisanship is temporary and will subside as the asset matures. ""Across the political spectrum, there is consensus on the importance of a strategic gold reserve,"" said Porter. ""There is equal agreement on maintaining a strategic oil reserve. Now, both sides are recognizing the need for a strategic bitcoin reserve.""

Representative Khanna expressed a similar sentiment. ""You can't be against bitcoin or crypto,"" said the California Congressman. ""It's like saying 'I'm against the iPhone' or 'I'm against the laptop.' It's just a technology.""

Representative Khanna has been especially influential in encouraging Vice President Kamala Harris to adopt a pro-innovation stance on cryptocurrency. Thanks in large part to his advocacy, the Harris team recently released a policy document stating the campaign's desire to ""encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets."" And in a recent episode of the Coin Stories Podcast, Khanna said he is confident that -- in contrast to President Biden -- Vice President Harris will champion Bitcoin if she wins the White House in November.

Cody Carbone, the President of The Digital Chamber, considers a strategic bitcoin reserve to be a crucial component of the Democrats' ""crypto reset."" In an interview, Carbone said, ""There is an opportunity here for Democrats to shift from opposing bitcoin to leveraging its success and potential to advance party goals in financial equity and sustainable energy policy. And supporting a strategic bitcoin reserve is a good place to start.""

Like Carbone and Representative Khanna, Senator Cynthia Lummis also sees a bipartisan future for bitcoin. That's why she is urging both Republicans and Democrats to support her bill to create a strategic bitcoin reserve.

In a statement from her office, Lummis said, ""Although the Republican National Committee and President Trump have come out strong in support of bitcoin and digital assets, I would expect my colleagues across the aisle to join us in supporting digital assets, especially as it has become an incredibly important focus of the 2024 election.""

As I have written previously, the data shows that backing bitcoin is a good bet for members of both political parties. From an electoral perspective, there is massive upside to embracing digital assets and virtually no downside -- which makes it all the more likely that bipartisan support for a strategic bitcoin reserve will continue to grow."
Project 2025 Offers A False Choice: Climate Action Vs. Economic Growth,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/margooge/2024/10/02/project-2025-offers-a-false-choice-climate-action-vs-economic-growth/,2024-10-02T10:14:04Z,"When Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for a future Trump administration, came up in the presidential debate, Donald Trump equivocated, calling some of the ideas ""good"" and others ""bad.""

It's impossible to say exactly what policies a second Trump administration would pursue, but Trump embraced The Heritage Foundation's ""A Mandate for Leadership"" proposal in his first year in office. And in April 2022 he said Heritage was ""going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do.""

One of Project 2025's most alarming proposals targets public health as it would strip the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of its authority to set and enforce environmental standards. Before EPA was created, our country suffered pollution so bad that rivers caught on fire and our cities were choked by smog. EPA protections have cleaned up our air and water for 50 years and saved countless lives - the Clean Air Act alone prevented an estimated 230,000premature deaths in 2020.

These environmental protections are particularly important for low-income and marginalized communities that have historically borne the brunt of pollution and environmental degradation. Biden's EPA climate policies focus on public health and environmental justice by strengthening emissions standards and regulating air pollution, and are on track to save 200,000 lives by 2050.

Rolling back these protections, as Project 2025 proposes, would reverse these gains and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable Americans, causing 2,100 early deaths by 2030 by increasing air pollution - nearly as much as the total U.S. military deaths in the Afghanistan war.

Project 2025 targets climate initiatives implemented under the Biden administration. The authors falsely claim that EPA regulations are ""burdensome"" and stifle economic growth, particularly in transportation and energy. But that's not true. EPA policies drive innovation and growth.

In reality, the very rules Project 2025 seeks to dismantle have catalyzed unprecedented economic growth across America. EPA's climate policies -- combined with incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act -- have sparked unprecedented investment, particularly in clean energy and transportation. As of 2024, annual investment in new manufacturing hit $225 billion, a record high even after adjusting for inflation.

The electric vehicle market is a prime example. EPA vehicle tailpipe emissions standards, along with IRA incentives, have spurred $312 billion in EV and battery manufacturing, making the United States a global leader in clean transportation investments. Fueled by the incentives, the U.S. EV market grew 40% in 2023, to 1.4 million units.

These investments have tangible economic impacts, making the shift to clean technologies an engine of job creation and economic revitalization. EV and battery manufacturing has created 195,000 high-paying jobs from factories in Michigan and Ohio to tech development in California, directly boosting local economies in areas hit hardest by the decline of traditional manufacturing.

The IRA's economic benefits are so obvious that in July, 18 Republican Members of Congress wrote the Speaker of the House urging him not to repeal IRA provisions, saying ""energy tax credits have spurred innovation, incentivized investment, and created good jobs in many parts of the country.""

Biden administration policies have also supercharged job growth in the renewable energy sector, cutting fossil fuel dependence and reshaping the energy landscape to benefit our environment and economy. The solar industry added nearly 16,000 jobs in 2023 to hit 280,000 total jobs, the highest level in history, and wind turbine service technician is the fastest-growing occupation in America. Meanwhile utility-scale solar and onshore wind are the cheapest forms of electricity generation in the U.S., at $27-$29 per megawatt-hour. Compare that to oil and coal products, which along with oil and gas extraction have the highest indirect impact on inflation of any commodity in the U.S. economy

By 2023, renewables accounted for 21% of U.S. electricity generation, outpacing coal, which dropped to 16%. The Biden administration's policies, which include federal tax credits for solar and wind projects, are ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in the global clean energy transition.

Clean energy is the future: It's cheaper and cleaner than fossil fuels, providing long-term economic benefits that far outweigh the short-term profits of oil, gas, and coal. Failing to recognize this will drive our economy into economic stagnation - Moody's Analytics forecasts Project 2025 would trigger a recession in less than a year. That's not even considering Project 2025's climate change impacts, which would add 4.9 million metric tons of annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, about the same as Germany emits every year.

Today, the United States' global economic competitiveness is at stake, more than ever. Following Project 2025's prescription risks the future of EVs, renewable energy, and green jobs. That would cede America's progress on national climate goals and hand over the global energy economy to China and Europe.

Clean energy accounted for 10% of global GDP growth in 2023, and global clean energy investment hit $1.8 trillion last year. America can tap this potential -- unless we let Project 2025 derail our progress.

China is already the world's biggest EV producer with about 60% of global sales and is also the largest EV exporter, accounting for 19% of EU sales. In clean energy, China invested $890 billion in clean energy in 2023, almost as much as total global fossil fuel investment. Falling behind in the clean economic race means losing out on trillions of dollars in future market opportunities and millions of lost jobs in booming industries.

The core environmental argument of Project 2025 -- that we must choose between climate action and economic growth -- is a false choice. It simply doesn't hold up.

Between 1970 and 2019, the Clean Air Act reduced air pollution from vehicles, factories, and other sources by 77%. If Project 2025's authors were correct, those historic environmental gains should have cost grave economic contraction. Instead, during that same time, U.S. GDP grew 285% and job growth rose 223%. By comparison, implementing Project 2025's energy provisions would cost 1.7 million lost jobs by 2030 while imposing $32 billion in new energy costs on American households.

Biden's climate policies are not a burden -- they are the foundation of America's - and the world's - green future. These policies have driven innovation, created jobs, improved public health, and ensured America remains at the forefront of the global clean energy transition.

Project 2025's attempt to dismantle these critical protections and reverse decades of progress is wrong - we cannot afford to turn back the clock on climate action. The economic stakes are too high, the environmental risks too great, and the opportunities for growth and prosperity too vast to ignore. The future belongs to those who invest in clean energy, transportation and manufacturing, innovation, and sustainability.

Biden's climate policies have laid the foundation for that future, and we must embrace it, not scrap it."
Where America's Richest People Live: Forbes 400 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicahunter-hart/2024/10/02/where-americas-richest-people-live-forbes-400-2024/,2024-10-02T10:14:02Z,"Almost a quarter of all the wealth on The Forbes 400 is held by residents of one state. Two others tie for second for the first time ever.

alifornia is a symbol of wealth, famous for the luxuries of Hollywood and the riches of Silicon Valley. So it's perhaps no surprise that the world's fifth-largest economy is home to more of the 400 wealthiest people in the U.S. than any other state by far -- and has been for 34 years, since overtaking New York in 1991.

The Golden State is home to 83 members of this year's Forbes 400 list, four fewer than last year and nine fewer than a decade ago, but the state is still home to more than one out of five 400 members. As a group, these Californians are worth around triple the $489 billion the state's 92 members were worth a decade ago. But it's not the only hub for the three-comma club. Ranking behind California are New York and Florida, with 54 list members each, followed by Texas, with 43. Those four states are the most populous in the country, holding a third of all Americans -- but nearly 60% of the richest ones. The combined fortune of their 234 billionaires totals $3.3 trillion.

California's days at the top may be numbered. Florida's rise continues; the Sunshine State has eight more Forbes 400 members this year -- enough to tie the Empire State for the first time. Some of the recent gains are due to folks leaving their higher-tax hometowns for Florida's lower rates, like former Seattle resident Jeff Bezos and onetime Chicagoan Ken Griffin. Five New Yorkers have moved to Florida in the past decade. Those transplants include the state's most famous resident, Donald Trump, who returns to the 400 list this year thanks to Trump Media & Technology Group, the social media company he took public in March. New York, meanwhile, has eight fewer 400 members than last year as the state's richest couldn't keep up. Among the drop-offs: Wesley Edens and Richard LeFrak.

A handful of states have only one Forbes 400 member, including Maine (Susan Alfond), Oregon (Phil Knight) and Kentucky (Tamara Gustavson). Ten states aren't represented at all on the 400, including Alabama, Minnesota and Vermont. It was harder than ever to make the list this year due to a record-high cutoff of $3.3 billion, up from last year's $2.9 billion and eons away from the median American family's net worth of $192,900, per the U.S. Federal Reserve. That was enough to bump Mississippi off the map as its richest residents, James and Thomas Duff, though richer than last year, barely missed the cut with net worths of roughly $3.25 billion each.

Net worths are as of September 1, 2024

Ernest Garcia II, the largest shareholder of online used car sales platform Carvana and Arizona's richest resident, wasn't born in the Grand Canyon State, but his ties there stretch back decades. He attended the University of Arizona and developed real estate in Phoenix in the 1980s (a job that later brought him a criminal fraud conviction, thanks to his small role in the scandal surrounding the collapse of one of his lenders, Lincoln Savings & Loan). Other prominent Arizona listees include U-Haul heir Mark Shoen ($5.2 billion) and Arturo Moreno ($5 billion), who owns the L.A. Angels baseball team in neighboring California.

Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual fund behemoth, is responsible for three members of The Forbes 400: CEO Abigail Johnson, the state's wealthiest resident and America's sixth-richest woman, and her siblings Edward and Elizabeth Johnson. Their family frequently donates to Boston-area charities and to Harvard, where Johnson got an MBA. Other prominent Bay State listees include telecom billionaire and Massachusetts philanthropist Robert Hale Jr. ($5.8 billion) and Robert Kraft ($11.8 billion), who found fortune in paper and packaging, and fame as the owner of the NFL's New England Patriots.

S. Truett Cathy (d. 2014) founded Chick-fil-A in an Atlanta area mall in 1967; it's now spread to 48 states and his three children are Georgia's richest residents. The Peach State is also home to Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank ($8.9 billion), private equity mogul and 400 newcomer Neal Aronson ($4.1 billion) and two more notable heirs: Gary Rollins ($6.8 billion), who chairs the pest control company his family founded in 1948, Rollins, Inc.; and Jim Kennedy ($6.6 billion), who chairs the media and automotive conglomerate his grandfather founded in 1898, Cox Enterprises.

The Silver State's highest roller hails, fittingly, from the Las Vegas Strip: Miriam Adelson, whose fortune comes from the Las Vegas Sands casino company that her late husband founded in 1988. Two other Nevada listees who hail from the gaming industry are brothers Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta, the UFC cofounders who also inherited their father's casino business Red Rock Resorts in 1993 and took it public in 2016. The state also boasts fortunes in sectors like aerospace-defense (Sierra Nevada Corp.'s Eren and Fatih Ozmen, $4 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively) and fast food (Panda Express' Andrew and Peggy Cherng, $3.7 billion each).

The richest Pennsylvanians are together worth $126 billion, roughly equal to the Keystone State's total annual government spending. Wealthiest resident Jeff Yass cofounded trading firm Susquehanna International Group, headquartered on the Main Line. It owns an estimated 15% of TikTok parent company ByteDance. Yass is a Republican megadonor who often opens his wallet for state and local elections, everything from county judicial races to Philly's city council election. His Susquehanna cofounder Arthur Dantchik ($12.3 billion) is also a Pennsylvania resident on The Forbes 400 list, as is Victoria Mars ($11.9 billion), heir to the Mars candy and pet food empire, and Jeffrey Lurie ($5.3 billion), owner of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles.

Chicago is home to the youngest member of The Forbes 400, Lukas Walton, who is one of the eight grandchildren of Walmart cofounder Sam Walton. Aged 38, he's one of two listees under 40 (the other being New York-based venture capitalist Josh Kushner). Several list members from the Hyatt hotel brand's Pritzker family are also breezing around the Windy City, including J.B. Pritzker ($3.7 billion), the state's billionaire governor. Others in Illinois made their riches through industries like meat processing (Steve Lavin, $5.4 billion, and Joseph Grendys, $4.2 billion) and finance (Byron Trott, $3.7 billion, and Mark Walter, $6 billion).

Musk -- the richest person in the U.S. for the third year in a row -- is all-in on the Lone Star State, announcing this year that he's moving his companies SpaceX and X there from California. Texas is increasingly seen as a swing state, but Musk made his own political allegiances clear in July when he endorsed Donald Trump for president in a post on X. Texas produces more oil and natural gas than any other state, so perhaps unsurprisingly, nearly a third of its listees made their fortunes in energy, including Randa Duncan Williams ($8.6 billion; Enterprise Products Partners) and Kelcy Warren ($6.7 billion; Energy Transfer).

The Sunshine State keeps attracting big wealth. When Bezos recently relocated from Washington state, he spent $234 million on three homes on Indian Creek, the gated man-made island in Miami Beach dubbed the ""Billionaire Bunker."" Nearly 30% of Florida's listees made their fortunes in finance and investments, including the second-richest Floridian, Ken Griffin ($43 billion), who made headlines in 2022 for moving his family and the headquarters of his hedge fund Citadel there from Chicago. The second-most common industry that enriched the wealthiest Floridians is food and beverage, from which hails Subway's Elisabeth DeLuca ($8.6 billion) and LaCroix sparkling water's Nick Caporella ($4.1 billion).

The world's financial capital is still a finance billionaire hub. Nearly two-thirds of the Empire State's listees made their fortunes in the sector, including Michael Bloomberg, the former NYC mayor who started his career on Wall Street in 1966 at the investment bank Salomon Brothers, then made billions through financial information and media company Bloomberg LP. The state's second-richest resident, Julia Koch ($74.2 billion), is originally from Iowa and owes her fortune to Kansas-based conglomerate Koch, Inc., but has lived in the Big Apple for four decades. In June, she and her children bought a 15% stake in the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and WNBA's New York Liberty for nearly $700 million. Other notable New Yorkers on The Forbes 400 include George Soros ($7.2 billion), Ralph Lauren ($9.4 billion) and Bill Ackman ($9.1 billion).

Hollywood and Silicon Valley have made many Californians rich, but none more than Mark Zuckerberg, who officially resides in Palo Alto, though these days spends plenty of time at his 1,450-acre compound in Kauai, Hawaii. Nearly half of California's Forbes 400 wealth stems from tech moguls like Zuckerberg, including Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin ($136 billion and $130 billion, respectively), Nvidia's Jensen Huang ($104 billion) and Broadcom's Henry Samueli ($16.9 billion). But entertainment moguls like David Geffen ($8.5 billion) and Steven Spielberg ($5.3 billion) also call the Golden State home, as do real estate barons such as Donald Bren ($18.9 billion) and Edward Roski Jr ($7.8 billion), and private equity moguls like KKR cofounder George Roberts ($15.5 billion) and Jim Coulter ($4.9 billion)."
I Doubt Mr. Trump's Plan For A Bitcoin Hoard Will Sway Voters,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2024/10/02/i-doubt-mr-trumps-plan-for-a-bitcoin-hoard-will-sway-voters/,2024-10-02T09:10:17Z,"I do not feel particularly well-qualified to comment on American politics, and I certainly do not want to make any political points, but I cannot help but be interested in the relationship between politics and fintech in general, and cryptocurrency in particular. While presidential candidate Kamal Harris has been quiet on the topic, one of the proposals that former president Trump has put forward is some kind of strategic bitcoin reserve. Will this swing US voters in the November election?

First of all, I must say that I am reluctant to label a government's bitcoin holdings as a ""reserve"" at all. A reserve is a store of something that has utility, such as oil, but bitcoin has no utility beyond speculation. You cannot really do anything with it. Unlike cheese. The US government's one billion plus pounds cheese reserve can, for example, be given out to welfare recipients to have on toast.

(While you may have never heard of government cheese, and I certainly had not before I heard about in on a podcast, it features in popular culture. Jay Z sings ""After that government cheese, we eating steak"" and Kendrick Lamar sings about eating ""cheese from the government"".)

My view is therefore that bitcoin holdings are not a reserve but might more properly be labelled as stash, and it is fair to observe that economists consider a bitcoin stash of little value to taxpayers but of great value to the crypto ""whales"" who hold most of it. Given that the cryptocurrency market is manipulated by those whales, who are able to move relatively large volumes almost at will with zero overview by regulators, it is no surprise that their sentiment is for the stash and against regulation.

(After all, the regulations around securities and so on were brought in the 1930s precisely to protect retail investors from exploitation.)

There is an excellent episode of Laura Shin's ""Unchained"" podcast in which she discusses the various proposals for a government stash with the economist George Selgin. These proposals come not only from Mr. Trump but also Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Senator Cynthia Lummis. George, who is a thorough scholar of the history of money, expresses a certain amount of scepticism about each of their proposals and concludes (wisely, in my view) that the government should not be investing in bitcoin or any other crypto currencies for that matter.

Whether the proposal for a stash, or any other positions around cryptocurrency, will make any difference to the outcome of the US presidential election is unclear, but I do not see any evidence that it will. While cryptocurrency podcasts may think that they are discussing the key to the presidency, political researchers have a very different perspective, suggesting cryptocurrency will not be a decisive issue even as ownership increases. Justin Esarey, a politics and international affairs professor at Wake Forest University says that he cannot recall interest in cryptocurrency ""being something that a large bloc of voters have ever expressed"".

Meanwhile is it not clear how much the two presidential candidates care about crypto, as evidenced from their debate. Nick Beauchamp (associate professor of political science at Northeastern University) puts it this way: ""The crypto 'voting block' is not voters but donors. Crypto appears on almost no one's list of important issues, and most people are either unaware of it, or have rudimentary opinions.""

Unaware? Yes. You might get the impression from certain social media that a great many people are fascinated by cryptocurrency an spend all day discussing their holdings. The figures, however, tell a different story. Two Federal Reserve surveys put US adult crypto ownership in the range 8-10% respectively in 2022, while Nielsen Homescan data has it a little higher (around 12%). Pew had American crypto ownership at 11-12% in early 2023. The Bank of Canada calculates bitcoin ownership there similarly around 10% in the same timeframe, while the Ontario Securities Commission put it at 13% before the crypto winter. There are more than 50 million Bitcoin wallets out there but nearly half of all crypto owners have less than a couple of hundred bucks worth and fact remains that the public are not using bitcoin for transactions.

(Insofar as the average American thinks about cryptocurrency at all, it is probably in the context of crime because while cryptocurrency-related complaints to the FBI were just 10% of all financial fraud complaints last year, they accounted for half of the total losses. Cryptocurrencies are used in a host of different frauds, although investment scams dominate, accounting for three-quarters of the losses.)

The number of people with substantial cryptocurrency holdings does not seem that great to me and the idea that there is a constituency of crypto voters who are focused on making sure that exchanges and other companies are lightly regulated is, as noted in the Financial Times ""fanciful"".

On the other hand the amount of money that crypto donors are piling in to the election is anything but fanciful. Take a look at the US Senate election in Ohio, where political action committees (PACs) have devoted $40 million to support Republican Bernie Moreno against Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and a well-known cryptocurrency sceptic.

Whether there are enough crypto votes out to make difference remains to be seen, but the fact is that crypto money has already proven helpful."

JD Vance, R-Ohio, spread about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, led CBS News to cut Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's mics in one of the more tense moments from Tuesday's face off.

Vance doubled down on his claims, insisting on CNN that constituents reported to his office directly that their pets were being taken and eaten and accusing the media of downplaying the incidents. Vance has acknowledged the incidents might not be true, but has said they're indicative of a broader problem with the Biden administration's immigration policies: ""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do,"" Vance said.

Both Springfield Mayor Rob Rue and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine rejected the claims in interviews in the days after Vance and Trump made the false allegations, which led to a series of threats against city officials and facilities, including a bomb threat that forced city hall to close and schools to evacuate. The bomb threat was one of 33 Springfield received in the weeks after Trump and Vance amplified the false rumors. The claim appeared to originate from a post in a Springfield Facebook group, according to the Springfield News-Sun, which reported that some viral posts in the Facebook group erroneously linked Springfield to an incident in August in Canton, Ohio, in which a woman was arrested and charged with killing and eating a cat.

A Haitian advocacy group, the Haitian Bridge Alliance, filed private criminal charges last month against Trump and Vance, asking a judge to order their arrest for allegedly disrupting public services and making false alarms for repeating the claims.

"Vance-Walz Debate: Vance's 'Stolen Valor' Attack Against Walz's Military Record, Explained",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/01/vance-walz-debate-vances-stolen-valor-attack-against-walzs-military-record-explained/,2024-10-01T20:34:16Z,"Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has accused Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz of leaving the National Guard to avoid being deployed to Iraq -- a years-old claim that may resurface during Tuesday's debate, even though it lacks evidence and has long been disputed by Walz and some of his fellow guardsmen.

""When the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,"" Vance, a former Marine who was deployed to Iraq, said previously. ""When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq ... he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.""

""After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform - and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,"" the Harris-Walz campaign said in statement.

In a New York Post interview published in August, Behrends suggested Walz falsely inflated his military rank by calling himself a command sergeant major throughout his political career, despite his rank being reduced to master sergeant since he retired before completing the terms of his promotion. Harris referred to Walz as ""Sgt. Maj. Walz"" while praising his background during their first campaign event together in August, hours after she announced him as her running mate. Minnesota National Guard spokesperson Capt. Holly Rockow told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018 it's fair to say Walz served as sergeant major since that was his rank at the time of his retirement in 2005, though it was retroactively reverted back to master sergeant because he retired before completing requirements associated with his promotion. Vance also criticized Walz for saying he carried a gun ""in war"" when there is no evidence Walz served in a combat zone. ""He said 'we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets,'"" Vance said of Walz. ""Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?"" Walz, while calling for gun controls in 2018 said ""we can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war."" Walz was never deployed to a combat zone, but he would have carried a gun when he was deployed to Italy in 2003 to support U.S. operations in Afghanistan after 9/11. Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt told multiple outlets when the 2018 remarks resurfaced in August that Walz ""misspoke"" when he said he carried weapons ""in war.""

Walz -- a Nebraska native who later moved to Minnesota -- joined the Nebraska Army National Guard in 1981 and retired in 2005 as a master sergeant, according to Military.com, citing his military records and a statement from the Minnesota Guard. Walz responded to natural disasters and received several awards, including Nebraska Citizen Soldier of the Year in 1989. Walz simultaneously worked as a high school teacher and football coach during his time as a guardsman prior to his run for Congress in 2005.

Walz and Vance are set to face off Tuesday in their first debate hosted by CBS from New York City. The debate could be the last of the 2024 campaign cycle as Trump has said he won't debate Harris for a second time. Harris selected Walz after a rushed process to choose her running mate in the weeks following her entrance into the race, hoping he can appeal to midwestern voters in the crucial swing states of Wisconsin and Michigan. While the GOP has described Walz as a ""far-left lunatic,"" he developed a reputation as a centrist in Congress while representing a deep-red district for 12 years. He bucked his party to vote to hold former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress and to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, though he signed legislation often championed by progressives during his second term as governor.

In a motion asking to file both unredacted and redacted versions of the document with the court, Smith suggested the government's redactions don't identify witnesses as Trump's lawyers claim. He told the court prosecutors redacted all names of witnesses that haven't already been made public in the indictment, including when quoting public information like tweets. Smith noted that releasing names of witnesses ""could lead to identified witnesses being intimidated and threatened,"" and said the government's proposed redactions ""mitigate that risk while making substantially available to the public the evidence and argument in support of its motion.""

What new information could be released before Election Day. Chutkan will now have to rule on what redactions are adopted, and it's unclear when that ruling will come out. The judge has also asked for Trump's lawyers to respond by Oct. 10 to proposed redactions in the appendix to Smith's filing -- which would include full transcripts of things like witness interviews, while the main document just has excerpts -- but it's possible she could release just the first part of the filing without the appendix before then. Smith has said the filing is expected to be approximately 180 pages long including the appendix and include information from sources including grand jury transcripts and witness interviews.

How long the federal election case against Trump will take to play out. Chutkan has to rule on what charges against Trump are still valid in light of the Supreme Court's immunity ruling before the case can go forward to trial, as the high court ruled ex-presidents only have immunity from charges based on their ""official acts"" and can still be charged based on ""unofficial"" conduct, but were vague on what in the indictment falls within that ""unofficial"" scope. There's no timeline yet on how quickly Chutkan could rule, though it won't be until October 29 at the earliest, when the last filing on the issue is due. Whenever she does rule, Trump will likely appeal it and try to get a higher court to throw out the case entirely. That means the case could go back to the Supreme Court a second time and get dragged out further before going to trial. If Trump wins the election, it's also likely the litigation will go away entirely, as he can appoint DOJ officials who would drop the charges against him.

Trump faces four federal felony charges in the election case, which is one of four criminal cases that have so far been brought against the ex-president. The indictment accuses Trump of committing conspiracy to defraud, obstruction and conspiracy against rights in his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, pointing to his efforts to pressure state lawmakers and officials to reject the election results and stop Congress from approving the vote count on Jan. 6, including by pressuring then-Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify the results and orchestrating a ""fake elector"" scheme in which state GOP officials submitted false slates of electors to Congress. The case started moving forward again in August after being on hold for months while the Supreme Court considered the immunity issue, indefinitely postponing a planned March trial date. The litigation is one of several criminal cases against Trump that the ex-president has successfully managed to keep from going to trial ahead of the election, and though he did go to trial in Manhattan -- where he was convicted on 34 felony counts -- his sentencing won't take place until after Election Day."
Kamala Harris And Capitalism: What The Polls Say,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bowmanmarsico/2024/10/01/kamala-harris-and-capitalism-what-the-polls-say/,2024-10-01T19:48:07Z,"In her economic speech in Pittsburg last week, Vice President Kamala Harris declared, ""I am a capitalist."" Earlier, she had told Wall Street and fashion titans (capitalists all) in the Hamptons that ""I believe in capitalism, but capitalism is not working for most people."" Her supporters are touting a new ""middle-class capitalism."" Harris' recent declarations are no doubt intended to answer Donald Trump's repeated claims that she is a Marxist. But they also are intended to reassure the business community that she has shed her more progressive views about capitalism and free markets.

We're barely a decade removed from the infamous 59-day Occupy Wall Street demonstration in 2011, when protestors told us America's capitalist system was irretrievably broken. Yet polls taken before and after Occupy show Americans have been remarkably steady -- and modestly more positive than negative - in their opinions of capitalism.

A new NBC News poll provides strong evidence. In their September poll, 51% of registered voters had positive feelings about capitalism, virtually indistinguishable from their 2020 (52%), 2019 (50%) and 2018 (52%) polls. Between 18% and 25% said their views were negative and around two in ten were neutral. Hardly a full-throated endorsement, but positive nonetheless -- what Irving Kristol described in his 1978 book with the title Two Cheers for Capitalism.

There were familiar partisan and demographic differences in the poll, conducted by the bipartisan team of Public Opinion Strategies and Hart Research. Registered Republicans were much more positive about capitalism than Democrats (67% to 39%). Men were more supportive of capitalism than women, and older people much more so than younger ones, a familiar pattern in all recent polls. In the poll, 18-29 year old split roughly evenly, 38 to 35%. A larger 18-34 subgroup were slightly more positive, 40% to 33%. Sixty-one percent of those 65 and over were positive. Forty-three percent of white working-class voters compared to 60% white middle class had positive feelings.

In a 2022 Pew Research Center survey, 57% had a positive impression of capitalism and 39% a negative view, a modest decline from their 2019 poll. In 2022, 74% of Republicans and 46% of Democrats did. There were also significant disagreements about capitalism's strengths. More than twice as many Republicans as Democrats (56% to 21%) said the phrase ""gives all people an equal opportunity to be successful"" described capitalism extremely or very well. Conversely, Democrat were much more likely (62%) than Republicans (38%) to disagree that capitalism makes sure everyone's basic needs are met.

In six Gallup polls between 2010 and 2021, there was also little movement in views about capitalism. In 2010, 61% of Americans had a positive image of capitalism, as did 60% in 2021. A solid majority of Republicans in the 2021 poll had a positive image compared to a bare majority of Democrats. The Millennials/Gen Z subgroup's view of capitalism had slipped from 66% positive in 2010 to 51% eleven years later. In a compilation of their five polls between 2010 to 2019, solid majorities of Gen Xers and Boomers/Traditionalists gave it solid majority support. It's unclear whether this skepticism is permanent for young people or whether they age out of their more negative views.

In 2022, Fox News asked registered voters if the US was moving away from capitalism and toward socialism. Fifty-four percent said it was, while 38% disagreed. Those results were in line with their 2021 poll (51% to 39%) and their 2010 one (56% to 34%).

Another question asked whether it be a good for bad thing for the US to move away from capitalism and toward socialism. In 2010, 23% said it would be a good thing and 65% a bad thing. The ""good thing"" response has been inching up, with around a third agreeing in both 2019 and 2022. In the 2022 poll, 53% of Democrats, 24% of independents, and 14% of Republicans said this would be a good thing.

Given extensive discussions of inequality, wealth concentration, and government expansion in recent years, the steadiness of the modest positive opinions about capitalism may seem surprising. Kristol argued that giving three cheers for any social, economic, or political system was a ""misplaced enthusiasm"". He argued that a capitalist order needs to have a ""keen sense of its own limitations."" The public seems to agree."
"Tuesday, October 1. Russia's War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/katyasoldak/2024/10/01/tuesday-october-1-russias-war-on-ukraine-news-and-information-from-ukraine/,2024-10-01T19:09:12Z,"On Tuesday, October 1, the Russian military attacked residential areas and infrastructure facilities in Zaporizhzhia. In the evening, the estimated number of victims raised to 32, including three children aged 9, 10, and 12, with one person confirmed dead.

Russian forces unleashed 10 glide bombs on residential areas in the city of Zaporizhia on September 29, wounding 16 civilians. The region continues to suffer frequent attacks. Two years ago, Russian forces killed 32 people in a strike on convoys of cars near a checkpoint to the occupied territories, the deadliest attack in the region's recent history.

Sumy region. On the morning of September 28, Russia launched a brutal two-step strike on yet another medical facility, this time in Sumy, killing 10 and wounding 22. As rescue teams responded to the initial hit, Russia struck the site again, killing a police officer. In July, Russian forces attacked Okhmatdyt, one of Eastern Europe's largest children's hospitals specializing in cancer treatment.

Kharkiv region. A Russian FPV (first-person view) drone strike on September 28 killed 61-year-old Supreme Court judge Leonid Loboyko in the village of Kozacha Lopan, just two miles from the Russian border, as he was delivering humanitarian aid. Three women in the car were also wounded in the attack. In the past month, Kharkiv has suffered a record number of airstrikes since 2023, with 53 attacks recorded, marking the most intense period of bombardment by Russian forces this year.

Kherson region. On October 1, Russian forces launched a deadly strike on a bus station near an open-air market in the region, killing at least six civilians and wounding six others. The incident follows another strike just two days earlier that killed four civilians and left 10 wounded.

Donetsk region. Russian forces in the Donetsk region reportedly have captured two villages and are close to taking Vuhledar, a hilltop town considered a vital stronghold for Ukraine. Ukrainian troops in the town, which had a pre-war population of 14,000, are surrounded and have been attempting for days to slip away in the face of heavy Russian artillery and drone attacks that have prevented the arrival of reinforcements.

World.

Following recent meetings with U.S. leaders, President Zelenskyy asserts that Ukraine is making progress toward receiving Western approval for long-range strikes into Russian territory. In an interview with Fox News, Zelenskyy expressed optimism about the ongoing discussions, stating that Ukraine has presented a victory plan to U.S. President Joe Biden and also spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. ""We are closer to obtaining this permission,"" he said, emphasizing that the decision now rests with Ukraine's international partners.

Germany, which also has long-range weapons, currently refuses to provide Ukraine Taurus missiles, which have a range of 300 miles. Although German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock supports Ukraine's request for these missiles, Chancellor Olaf Scholz remains opposed.

Ukraine has requested such weapons as an essential element in making a breakthrough in the war. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently acknowledged that the Biden administration is ""closely evaluating"" Zelenskyy's proposed victory plan while considering ""additional options"" to bolster Ukraine's efforts against Russian aggression.

Ukrainian president retains ambassador to the U.S. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has declined to discuss the immediate dismissal of Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, following a request from U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson. In an interview with Fox News, Zelenskyy said that such discussions can be held only with the speaker of Ukraine's parliament, not foreign politicians.

Ukraine's constitution, cited by Zelenskyy in support of his stance, gives the President the authority to appoint or dismiss ambassadors upon the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Johnson called for Markarova's removal last week for her alleged role in organizing Zelenskyy's visit to a Pennsylvania munitions plant, where Democratic officials, but no Republican representatives, were present.

Denmark is set to invest nearly $650 million in Ukraine's military industry, with more than two-thirds of the funding derived from profits from frozen Russian assets. Denmark in April was the first country to commit to allocating almost $30 million for purchasing weapons from Ukrainian manufacturers for Ukraine. Although the national state budget amounts to only $6 billion, the Ukrainian military industry is capable of producing weapons worth $20 billion per year. That is why Ukraine seeks to attract an additional $10 billion for domestic arms procurement through the ZBROYARI program, according to Forbes Ukraine. Several nations, including the Netherlands, Canada, the United Kingdom and Lithuania,, as well as the European Union, have joined Denmark in supporting the initiative with contributions of $750 million to the program.

New Russian draft. Russian President Vladmir Putin has ordered the conscription this autumn of 133,000 servicemen. The new troops, aged 18 to 30 years, will serve a standard term of 12 months. According to the head of the national draft service, the latest conscripts will serve only in Russia, not in Ukraine.

National.

In September alone, Russia launched a record-breaking 1,339 long-range Iranian Shahed drones, of which Ukrainian defenses shot down nearly 1,100. Russian forces just last week launched 900 glide bombs, 300 Shahed drones and more than 40 missiles. Russia produces more than 500 Shaheds per month, according to Forbes Ukraine.

The cultural effects of the war have been devastating: Russia has destroyed or damaged nearly 1,000 libraries, leading to the loss of more than 200 million Ukrainian books. On May 23, a Russian missile struck Vivat's Faktor-Druk printing house, which printed almost 40% of the books in Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of seven workers, injuries to 22 others and approximately 50,000 books burned. Despite the losses, the printing company resumed production in mid- September. During an official visit to the U.S. last week, Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska presented books damaged in the attack, as a symbol of Ukraine's cultural losses in the war, to the Harvard University library.

Ukrainian artist Petro Antyp has set a new national record with Cosmogony, the largest painting in Ukraine, displayed at the Korsak Museum of Contemporary Ukrainian Art in Lutsk. Spanning more than 215 square feet and consisting of more than 500 pieces, the artwork carries viewers into a universe of existential reflection, symbolizing the birth of stars and galaxies, while raising a question of humanity's place within the boundless cosmos.

More than a masterpiece of artistic expression, Antyp's work is a symbol of cultural resilience. Originally from the Donetsk region, the artist was forced to move both in 2014 and eight years later from the small town of Vasylkiv near Kyiv. Following Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, he co-founded SaveCultureUA to protect Ukraine's cultural heritage, ensuring that the spirit of Ukrainian art will endure even in times of conflict."
JD Vance's Ties To Project 2025 Explained Ahead Of Tonight's VP Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/01/jd-vances-ties-to-project-2025-explained-ahead-of-tonights-vp-debate/,2024-10-01T17:24:45Z,"Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, is likely to be grilled about his associations with the controversial policy agenda known as Project 2025 at Tuesday's vice presidential debate, as the nominee has close ties to the group behind it that have complicated former President Donald Trump's efforts to distance himself from the controversial policy agenda.

Vance will debate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in Philadelphia Tuesday night. The debate comes after the Harris campaign and Democrats have repeatedly brought up Project 2025 and its extreme proposals on the campaign trail, pointing to it and Vance's support for the Heritage Foundation as a key reason to vote for Harris. ""No matter what Vance tries to say tonight on the debate stage, he and Trump have already shown us who they are when it comes to their close ties to Project 2025's wildly unpopular agenda,"" Democratic National Committee spokesman Alex Floyd said in a statement Tuesday.

When approached for comment, Vance's Senate office pointed Forbes to a July 7 ""Meet the Press"" interview in which the senator said he ""guarantee[s] there are things that Trump likes and dislikes about"" Project 2025, ""but he is the person who will determine the agenda of the next administration."" When asked about the 2017 report he was involved with, Vance spokesperson Luke Schroeder told The New York Times the now-senator has ""long made clear that he supports IVF and does not agree with every opinion in this seven-year-old report, which features a range of unique views from dozens of conservative thinkers,"" and criticized the publication for ""attacking Senator Vance for the views of other individuals."" The Trump campaign and Heritage Foundation did not respond to requests for comment on Vance's ties to the organization, though the organization told The New York Times Vance had ""no role in producing or approving the contents"" of the 2017 report.

The Heritage Foundation ""is going to play a major role in helping us figure out how to govern, at the White House, at the Senate, at the House and all across our great country,"" Vance said in an April 2023 speech at a Heritage Foundation event. CNN notes his speech took place one day before Project 2025's policy proposals were unveiled.

Project 2025's proposals touch every aspect of the executive branch, and the guidebook broadly calls for an overhaul of the federal government centered around values of dismantling the ""administrative state,"" prioritizing the nuclear family, defending the U.S. against global threats and securing ""the blessings of liberty."" Its most sweeping proposals include reshaping the federal workforce to replace career bureaucrats with political appointees and abolishing many agencies entirely, including the Department of Education, Department of Homeland Security, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The proposals take a broad stance against transgender rights and other ""woke"" policies and would get rid of much of the federal government's efforts to combat climate change, alongside other moves like ending all student loan forgiveness and imposing baseline tax rates and getting rid of most deductions and benefits. It also proposes overhauling the Federal Reserve by either getting rid of the government's control over money entirely or returning the U.S. to the gold standard.

Vance has also been a major proponent of a key proposal in Project 2025 that Trump should overhaul the federal workforce to replace many career civil servants with political appointees. He said in a 2021 podcast appearance that Trump should fire ""every civil servant in the administrative state,"" telling ABC News in February he wants to ""replace the mid-level bureaucrats with people who are responsive to the administration's agenda.""

What Trump and Vance will do in office if elected. Trump is under no obligation to follow Project 2025's policies, though much of the agenda his campaign released shares similar goals. While Trump has distanced himself from Project 2025 in this election, he did follow a similar policy proposal that the Heritage Foundation crafted for Trump ahead of his 2016 election win. The organization boasted two years into his tenure that Trump had already followed 64% of its recommendations, CBS News notes.

93%. That's Vance's score from Heritage Action for America, the Heritage Foundation's political arm, based on how much his beliefs line up with the organization. That's much higher than the 61% average among Senate Republicans.

Trump named Vance as his running mate on the first day of the Republican National Convention in July, ending months of speculation over who his pick would be as the Ohio senator beat out other competitors like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Vance initially gained national attention as the author of ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" a memoir recounting his working-class upbringing, and was an outspoken Trump critic in 2016 before he ultimately changed his public stance and backed the ex-president, earning his endorsement when Vance ran for Senate in 2022. While its policy proposals were first released last year, Project 2025 has come under increased scrutiny in recent months, particularly after Trump publicly distanced himself from the policy. Democrats have frequently pointed to the policy proposal as a key reason to oppose Trump's candidacy, particularly as President Joe Biden came under criticism following his poor debate performance."
How The Accountant Shortage Impacts CFOs And Financial Hires,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/10/01/how-the-accountant-shortage-impacts-cfos-and-financial-hires/,2024-10-01T16:48:57Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

Driving technology, embracing of the strategic importance of a company's financial functions and an emphasizing corporate sustainability are all transforming the CFO's job. But they're also reshaping other jobs in a company's financial operations. A new report from EY zooming in on the financial controller's position found that 86% of people in that role expect significant changes in their career in the next five years. The majority of controllers told EY they expect their role to shift from one focused on value protection -- paying attention to internal controls and regulatory compliance -- to one that looks for value creation -- using technology, strategy and data to find new opportunities and recommend new policies.

""The controller of the future will be a trusted partner to the CFO right across the transformation spectrum,"" Mike Verbeck, EY Global deputy vice chair for Assurance, said in the report. ""They will create value in their capacity as analysts, collaborators, innovators, storytellers and leaders of talented teams, as well as in their capacity as accounting and compliance experts.""

The report makes clear that this is seen as a natural evolution of the controller's role, fitting with how most companies utilize their financial teams in the foreseeable future. But it's also clear that the report found technology -- including AI -- gives the controller the ability to pivot toward more of a focus on strategy and opportunity. The report found that nearly nine in 10 controllers already use AI, which is powerful on two fronts. It can do many of the basic tasks controllers spend their time on now, and also leverage data to find powerful insights.

EY suggests that controllers take advantage of the opportunity to look for value-creation opportunities by embracing data and AI and inspiring team members to see themselves as problem solvers. CFOs should empower their controllers, and also provide training in future-focused skills that build on technology use and responsibilities to climb the ranks at a company. And the CFO should also focus on an innovative and transformational spirit in potential new hires to work under the controller.

Regardless of how financial roles are created and recruited, the entire financial sector is struggling to find talent. Many college students today aren't pursuing accounting degrees, and even fewer are becoming CPAs. That makes recruiting for any financial position harder, from junior-level to CFOs. I spoke with Keith Giarman, president of the private equity and principal investing practice at executive search firm DHR Global, about how this shortage is impacting things right now. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are now open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Unionized port workers on the East Coast began their first strike in more than 45 years at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, stopping trade traffic at ports in Baltimore; Boston; Charleston, South Carolina; Jacksonville, Florida; Miami; Houston; Mobile, Alabama; New Orleans; New York/New Jersey; Norfolk, Virginia; Philadelphia; Savannah, Georgia; Tampa, Florida; and Wilmington, Delaware. About 45,000 union members represented by the International Longshoremen's Association want a wage increase of 77% and a ban on new automation as part of their new contract with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX), the organization that represents shipping companies. West Coast port workers earn over $30,000 a year more than their East Coast counterparts. Union members are refusing to meet with the USMX until their wage demands are met.

The strike could have fast and far-reaching impacts on the U.S. economy, with some analysts projecting it costing $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion a day. If the strike continues for long enough, it could impact consumer prices and the availability of goods. President Biden has urged the two sides to resolve the issue quickly and fairly, sending Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard to meet with USMX on Monday. While Biden can defer the strike for 80 days through the Taft-Hartley Act, he said over the weekend he will not ""because it's collective bargaining.""

While West Coast ports remain open, Boeing machinists remain on strike. The 33,000 unionized employees at the aerospace manufacturer's Pacific Northwest facilities rejected Boeing's ""best and final offer"" last week. From the union's social media posts, the sticking point appears to be the reinstatement of Boeing's pension plan, which the company did away with in favor of a 401(k) plan in 2014, according to Quartz. It's unclear from media reports what's happening currently with negotiations, but according to KING5, Boeing released a statement Monday saying it is ""committed to resetting our relationship with our represented employees and negotiating in good faith and want to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We are prepared to meet at any time.""

The interest rate cut that everyone was waiting for happened last month. And yet there's already lots of talk about how big the next one will be at the Federal Reserve policy-making committee's next meeting in November. (According to CME FedWatch, as of Tuesday morning, 38.4% of economists project another half-percentage point cut.) This isn't just a case of impatient analysts and investors, writes Forbes' Derek Saul. After the rate cut was announced, yields on the 10-year Treasury note increased. These notes are the basis for interest rates on things including mortgages, auto loans and corporate borrowing -- meaning financing might not be getting cheaper after all.

There are many reasons for Treasury yields to be increasing, some benign and some ominous. Some analysts say investors had already priced in the rate cut, especially since its yields are down compared with earlier this summer. But CNBC spoke with analysts who see uncertainty through the federal deficit and the Fed's willingness to cut interest rates, even with inflation a bit higher than the 2% it sees as tolerable. On Friday, reports showed the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index -- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- to be at 2.2% in August.

The stock market on the whole is responding well, however. The first nine months of 2024 were the S&P 500's best start to a year since 1997, writes Forbes' Derek Saul. The S&P's year-to-date gain is 20.3%, and the other markets have also fared well this year: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 12% in the first three quarters of 2024, and the Nasdaq is up 20%. Buoying the markets so far are last month's interest rate cuts -- insurers, home builders and utilities saw some of the best returns in recent months -- and optimism-fueled AI stocks.

Last week, the Chinese government announced several broad measures to boost its economy, which has been sputtering and looks unlikely to meet its government's annual growth target. The multi-pronged effort includes an interest rate cut from China's central bank, a potential capital injection into its biggest banks to increase lending capacity and governmental economic stimulus, reports Forbes' Derek Saul. Chinese stocks traded on U.S. markets rallied on the news and have continued to trade higher.

However, the rally -- and any benefit to China-based businesses -- may be short-lived for those in the U.S. In a note on Monday, JPMorgan Chase strategists said that if Donald Trump wins the presidential election, it's likely to slow down. Trump has campaigned on strict trade policies toward China, including a tariff of 60% or more on all Chinese goods, phasing out imports of essential goods and revoking China's most favored nation trade status. Vice President Kamala Harris has said in her campaign that she wants to enact policies that ensure the U.S. keeps its economic foothold above China, but she has not presented anything specific that is as restrictive. Analysts believe Harris will continue the Biden administration's approach of more targeted Chinese economic policies, including limiting imports and exports from high-tech industries.

As the nature of work has changed and new fields related to finance have cropped up, there's been a shortage of accountants on all levels -- especially with fewer young people opting for accounting degrees, and even fewer choosing to work at traditional firms and pursue the CPA path. This has immediate and potential long-term implications for finance departments and CFOs. I talked to Keith Giarman, president of private equity and the principal investing practice at executive search firm DHR Global, about what it means. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

It's hard to find the right talent today. What are companies doing to keep the talent they have?

Giarman: A lot of the compensation has gone north. It is a different level skill set that [companies] are asking for. There are a few [qualified employees], and they know that. They know that their price tag and their market value have gone up. Especially in private equity, where they've got a hopefully three-year timeline to improve operations and sell a company, they have to have the absolute best and invest in that role. They're working with the CFO more than the CEO.

For everybody else [in finance], if you accept my logic, there's fewer of them. Whether it's somebody running FP&A or somebody lower down in the organization, you've got to pay up.

That doesn't fix it, though, because people come for more than money. [Companies] have to create great working environments and be more flexible, including remote [work]. As a company, we have the same challenges. We've tried to create an environment for our research and associate staff where we emphasize things like wellness and the things that the younger generation wants to focus on and feel good about in terms of the community they're building around them. If you're not doing those other soft HR things, all the money in the world isn't going to make a difference. They'll stay for a couple of years, and they'll go.

Much of the attention of the accountant shortage is focused on lower-level employees. Are you seeing related challenges with recruiting CFOs?

The answer is a very loud yes, with an exclamation point. The CFOs who will make the cut, where the client will not bend on the requirements, seems like [there are] fewer and fewer as we move along.

It's also dependent on the cycle of the market. CFOs have been in assets in private equities for a while. We're finally starting to see the Fed lower interest rates. There could be some exit liquidity opportunity in a year or two. If more transactions are getting done, there's more folks who have proven themselves: They're able to flourish in these environments and get the job done. We haven't been in that for the last 12 to 24 months.

When we do a CFO search today, something that might've taken 90 days can take 180. There's a timing issue with candidates. There's a compensation issue. There's a flexibility issue in terms of where they are in the investment cycle, too, because if you're going to sell the company in two years, are you going to expect somebody to move their entire family on a plane three hours away?

The good news is at that level, you're thinking about wealth creation and longer-term things that take care of your family and your career. You're even more disposed to the financial element of the opportunity, and you're willing to put in the hard work to get it. If [companies] can make the numbers work and people can see a path to the end zone, there's a better chance you're going to land those bigger fish, and they're going to stick.

What does the future look like for this shortage?

The thing that's going to make it better is selling a bunch of companies, where good people free up. There's $8 trillion of private equity money floating around out there, and a lot of that's in companies that have CFOs that are waiting to exit. [After interest rates drop enough to restart more dealmaking, probably in 2025], that's when you're going to see more IPOs. You're going to see more deals, you're going to see more M&A. The people that are really good, there's going to be more freed up that you can get access to. They're going to be looking for their next great CFO opportunity.

Vance will face off Tuesday against Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, in Philadelphia, at the vice presidential debate, marking the first time the two politicians have gone head to head.

""I know guns as well as anyone else in this room ... I know that there's no place for weapons of war in our schools, or in our churches, or in our banks, or anywhere else people are just trying to live their lives without fear,"" Walz said in his State of the State address in 2023. ""I got an A rating from the NRA my first term in Congress. Now I get straight F's. And I sleep just fine.""

Walz is still a hunting enthusiast. The governor tweeted a photo of a yard full of turkeys in August, writing, ""For the past few years I've not seen a turkey while hunting. Today they mock me.""

Unlike Walz, Vance has been vocally opposed to restrictions on guns, with the NRA describing the senator as ""a true Second Amendment champion"" when he was named former President Donald Trump's running mate. Vance has consistently pushed for weaker gun regulations in the Senate, co-sponsoring legislation that would expand concealed carry, increase rights for licensed gun owners who commit violations and oppose a federal rule that expanded when gun sellers must be licensed and conduct background checks, among other measures. Prior to becoming a senator, Vance authored an op-ed in 2021 in which he argued ""the Biden Administration's dull attempts to curb gun violence don't work and they threaten the very foundation of the rights we are afforded as free, American citizens."" Describing the ""unholy alliance"" between government and business in trying to restrict gun ownership, Vance wrote the efforts ""won't stop at the Second Amendment. Eventually, they'll come for other cherished American liberties, too.""

Harris named Walz as her vice presidential pick in August, after the Minnesota governor was one of a number of Democrats floated for the job, along with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. Originally from Nebraska, Walz served in the Army National Guard and was a school teacher for many years prior to entering politics, teaching social studies along with serving as a football coach and overseeing the school's Gay-Straight Alliance. Republicans have decried Walz, who had been viewed as a moderate earlier in his political career, as pushing the Harris ticket further left, with the Trump campaign claiming in a statement that by picking Walz, ""Kamala Harris not only bent the knee to the radical left, she doubled down on her dangerously liberal, weak, and failed agenda."" Walz's addition to the Democratic ticket came after a series of major gun control reforms failed to pass Congress following a slew of mass shootings that have taken place in recent years, with Republicans remaining opposed to reforms, and as the Supreme Court has opened the doors to more challenges against gun control measures."

JD Vance, R-Ohio is likely to be asked at Tuesday's vice presidential debate about comments he made denouncing Vice President Kamala Harris and others as ""childless cat ladies"" who don't have a ""direct stake"" in the country's future, which reflects a worldview that has affected Vance's policy views as he stands to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.

Vance will face off against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. The debate comes as the Harris campaign and Walz -- a cat owner himself -- have repeatedly highlighted Vance's ""childless cat ladies"" comments on the campaign trail. Walz has posted videos with cats and said when Taylor Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, ""It's not as if I didn't warn these guys a few months ago: You mess with cat people, you will find out."" The governor attacked Vance for his comments even before he was named Harris' running mate in August, criticizing the senator for apologizing to cats instead of women for his comments and telling MSNBC, ""My god, they went after cat people ... It would be funny if it wasn't so sad.""

In comments to right-wing journalist Megyn Kelly about his ""childless cat ladies"" comments going viral, Vance said his remarks were ""obviously ... a sarcastic comment"" and he has ""nothing against cats,"" but defended his broader views. ""People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance ... and the substance of what I said, Megyn -- I'm sorry, it is true,"" Vance said.

Vance's views that emphasize the importance of married families with children echo views espoused by the Heritage Foundation, a private right-wing organization with close ties to Vance that's recently come under fire for its 900-page policy agenda for a second Trump presidency known as ""Project 2025."" The Heritage Foundation has publicly called for ""encouraging marriage at the front end of a woman's childbearing years"" in order to increase the birth rate, and Project 2025 heavily emphasizes the importance of the nuclear family and imposing policies that strengthen it. The policy blueprint calls for ending ""LGBTQ equity"" initiatives and others in the Department of Health and Human Services and ""replacing such policies with those encouraging marriage, work, motherhood, fatherhood, and nuclear families,"" for instance, along with restricting abortion rights and eliminating federal healthcare mandates around contraception coverage. About the Heritage Foundation's proposals, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk told Forbes, ""The views of any outside group have zero effect on JD's policy positions -- full stop."" Vance's office also directed Forbes to comments Vance has made noting Project 2025 has no affiliation with the Trump campaign and saying he thinks ""there's some good ideas in there"" and ""there's some things that I disagree with.""

Vance's comments denouncing ""childless cat ladies"" have drawn widespread condemnation from the left, particularly from female voters. Actress Jennifer Aniston said in an Instagram post she ""truly can't believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States."" Addressing Vance, she added ""I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day."" Swift's post endorsing Harris was accompanied by a photo of the singer holding her own cat. Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., also criticized Vance on X, saying she is a ""proud mom"" of stepchildren -- like Harris -- and she and husband Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., were trying to conceive through in vitro fertilization before she was shot in 2011. ""To suggest we are somehow lesser is disgraceful,"" Giffords said. While Harris has not commented on his attacks directly, her stepdaughter Ella Emhoff posted an Instagram story saying, ""How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I,"" referring to her brother. ""I love my three parents,"" she added. Harris also garnered a significant amount of high-profile support from female voters in her campaign's opening days as Vance's comments first went viral, with more than 100,000 women joining a Zoom call Thursday to support the Harris campaign and fans of Taylor Swift mobilizing for the vice president.

How Vance's policy views would actually affect a potential Trump presidency. The vice presidential candidate is likely to fall in line with Trump's chosen policy agenda, and the ex-president has publicly espoused more moderate positions than Vance on issues like abortion, calling for the issue to be left up to the states. (Abortion rights advocates believe he may take harsher action if elected, however.) Trump has also publicly distanced himself from Project 2025 and its more extreme proposals, though many involved with his first presidential administration helped author the policy agenda.

Trump named Vance as his vice presidential candidate on July 15 as the Republican National Convention was underway, siding with allies like son Donald Trump Jr., who had pushed for Vance to be the nominee over more moderate choices like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Vance was elected to the Senate in 2022 and was previously best known as the author of memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy."" He notably spoke out against Trump in the 2016 election before he ultimately claimed his views had changed and he now strongly supports the ex-president. Trump's selection of Vance has come under increasing scrutiny as his more extreme views have gone viral and as President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and Harris replaced him, shaking up a contest that polling previously suggested could go more easily for Trump. The vice presidential candidate has struggled in the polls, with a FiveThirtyEight analysis finding he is the least popular non-incumbent vice presidential nominee since at least 2004, and The Hill reported even some House Republicans denounced him as Trump's running mate."

Read on for the exact vice presidential debate time and details about tonight's major event.

The debate, moderated by CBS, will be held at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City. The rules for tonight's debate are similar to those set in place for the presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris three weeks ago and the Trump-Biden debate in June.

At the start of the event, the moderators will introduce the candidates in order of incumbent party, with Walz going first, according to CBS News. There will be no opening statements, and campaign staff will are not permitted to interact with the candidates during the two four-minute commercial breaks.

Walz will stand behind the podium on the left side of the stage, which will be on the right side of viewers' screens. Meanwhile, Vance will be at the podium on the stage's right side but on the left side of people's screens. Candidates will be given two minutes to answer a question, two minutes to respond, and one minute for rebuttals. Candidates may receive an extra minute at the moderator's discretion.

The major difference between the presidential and vice presidential debates is that the candidate's microphone will not be muted when their opponent speaks tonight. However, CBS still has the right to turn off microphones.

Vance and Walz are set to debate in Philadelphia Tuesday night, their first time going head-to-head in the presidential election. The debate comes as Walz and the Harris campaign have used Project 2025 as a main line of attack against Trump and Vance, holding its extreme proposals up as a key reason for voters to oppose Trump's candidacy. Walz has repeatedly mentioned Project 2025 while campaigning and tied Vance to it, saying at a September rally, ""My opponent, Senator Vance ... said that when they get power and they will use the Project 2025, they need to be ruthless when it comes to the exercise of power."" (Walz was falsely citing a quote from 2021 -- before Project 2025 was written -- in which Vance, who was not yet a senator, told a conservative publication that conservatives ""really need to be really ruthless when it comes to the exercise of power."") Vice President Kamala Harris brought the issue up when she debated Trump in September, calling Project 2025 ""a detailed and dangerous plan ... that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again."" The Harris campaign also updated the policy section of its website last month with information on Project 2025, with Harris' policies on a range of issues each accompanied by a section that contrasts the vice president's views with Project 2025.

Trump has denied any connection to Project 2025, claiming on Truth Social last week that he has ""nothing to do with them,"" has ""no idea"" who's behind the plan and finds some of its ideas ""absolutely ridiculous and abysmal."" His campaign advisor Chris LaCivita has also denounced it, calling the effort a ""pain in the ass."" But many aren't buying the ex-president's claims: The team behind Project 2025 includes 140 people who worked for Trump in his administration, according to CNN, including six former Cabinet secretaries and four people he nominated as ambassadors. Trump has also seemingly endorsed Heritage's policy work in the past, saying at a 2022 dinner for the Heritage Foundation that the group was ""going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do ... when the American people give us a colossal mandate.""

Experts have warned Project 2025's proposals could have seismic impacts on how the federal government operates if carried out. In an article for Justia, criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor John May suggested Project 2025's language endorsing the executive branch being able to ""restrain the excesses"" of the judicial branch and Congress means ""if the President wants to, the President can defy any decision of the Supreme Court, any legislation by Congress, maybe even the act of impeachment and removal from office.""

The main team behind Project 2025 includes director Paul Dans and former Trump White House personnel leaders Spencer Chretien (who also served as Trump's special assistant) and Troup Hemenway, according to the project's website. Other groups listed as participating in the project include ex-Trump adviser Stephen Miller's America First Legal, legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, Liberty University, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and Turning Point USA. The 900-page policy agenda was co-authored by a series of conservative figures, with chapters penned by such Trump allies as former Housing Secretary Dr. Ben Carson, former Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli, former HHS Civil Rights Director Roger Severino and former Trump advisor Peter Navarro, who went to prison in March for contempt of Congress. The Heritage Foundation confirmed July 30 that Dans was stepping down and leaving the organization, saying in a statement he was ""moving up to the front where the fight remains."" The Daily Beast reports Dans resigned amid pressure from the Trump campaign, though the Heritage Foundation said only that it had always intended its ""policy drafting"" work to only last through the party conventions, ""and we are sticking to that timeline."" The Heritage Foundation denied reports Project 2025 is shutting down, and said its personnel efforts would continue.

Trump will not be under any obligation to follow Project 2025's proposals if he wins the presidency, though history suggests he'll listen to at least some of them. The Heritage Foundation made a similar policy proposal for Trump ahead of his presidency in 2016, and boasted two years into his tenure that Trump had already followed 64% of its recommendations, CBS News notes.

One area that Project 2025 doesn't touch on is Social Security benefits and any potential cuts to the program, even as proposals outline changes to numerous other government ""entitlements."" Changing Social Security and making cuts to its spending has been a priority for the GOP for decades, though the American public has long opposed slashing benefits. Republicans' efforts have waned under Trump, however, and the ex-president publicly claimed in March he ""will never do anything that will jeopardize or hurt Social Security or Medicare,"" after he came under fire for suggesting otherwise in an interview with CNBC.

While much of Project 2025's policy agenda concerns federal agencies, the proposal has also gotten attention for its call to outlaw all pornography, which it claims is tied to ""the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children"" and is not protected under the First Amendment. Project 2025 calls not only for pornography to be made illegal, but also for anyone involved with its production and distribution to be imprisoned, for any librarians or educators who ""purvey it"" to be registered as sex offenders and for telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its distribution to be shut down.

The Heritage Foundation's practice of laying out a policy roadmap for a future Republican administration actually dates back to the Reagan era, founder Edwin J. Feulner noted in the afterword of the 2025 edition. The organization first laid out a blueprint in 1981 that President Ronald Reagan ultimately adopted, fulfilling half of its recommendations by the end of his first year in office. The Heritage Foundation has continued to come out with blueprints for potential conservative presidents each election since, it notes, and its 2025 Mandate for Leadership was published in 2023. While it came out last year, Project 2025 gained new attention in the past week since Trump disavowed it -- sparking a wave of reports highlighting his ties to the figures behind the project that debunk his claims. Democrats have also used the controversial proposal as a key talking point and argument for why the left should unite behind President Joe Biden and focus on defeating Trump, particularly as Biden's candidacy came under widespread scrutiny in the wake of the president's poor debate performance in June, sparking his decision to drop out of the race."
Major Bitcoin Miner CEO Reveals Unveils His Plan For AI,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/01/major-bitcoin-miner-ceo-reveals-unveils-his-plan-for-ai/,2024-10-01T14:44:55Z,"Marathon Digital Holdings CEO Fred Thiel thinks that retail investors are giving small competitors too much credit for artificial intelligence plays that will not pay off for years. He has a vision for his company that plays to its core strengths.

Fred Thiel is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Marathon Digital Holdings, bringing over 35 years of extensive experience in the technology sector. In this discussion we cover a wide range of issues including how Marathon is adapting to the wave of smaller miners gravitating towards artificial intelligence, what separates his firm from some of the other pure-play miners, and how U.S. politics and the upcoming presidential election will affect the outlook for the mining industry.

Forbes: Can you give an overview of how you've tried to position Marathon Digital Holdings within the world of bitcoin mining?

Fred Thiel: We look at ourselves as sitting at the point of convergence between energy transformation and digital infrastructure. From a bitcoin mining perspective, we're the largest of the publicly traded miners today, operating 13 sites across four continents. We use a variety of different technologies and we're the only one of the large bitcoin miners that has a fully vertically integrated tech stack. What that means is we operate our own mining pool, which is what orchestrates all our miners around the world and is the interface to the Bitcoin blockchain. All the other miners use third-party pools that are either Foundry, for example, or Chinese pools. We also operate our own firmware, which runs in miners and then we have developed and designed our own cooling infrastructure. We have single-phase and dual-phase liquid cooling, both of which don't use water, so that is totally water-free, and this is a really exciting area as we move into providing digital infrastructure to the AI industry because it's the exact same infrastructure that's used by both industries. The other thing that is unique is we cofounded a company called Auradine, which is the only U.S. bitcoin mining ASIC manufacturer. Their miners can support multiple chip failures and still run so they can operate in wider temperature ranges. So what does that all add up to? To me, it means as a miner we have access to technologies that not necessarily other miners do and we continue to press the envelope on deploying that technology. Our data center in Abu Dhabi, which is all liquid immersion cooling, is a preeminent site. There are two data centers, a total of 250 megawatts, that have 99.8% uptime running in a very harsh environment, which is obviously the Middle East desert next to a body of water. It's very humid so liquid cooling is the only way to go.

Our strategy initially was one of being asset light. We focused on just growing rapidly by hosting with third parties. Then earlier this year we shifted to vertically integrating and we acquired 54% of our capacity's infrastructure, and as we continue to grow in coming years that number will get closer and closer to 100%. We tripled our capacity in 2023, we'll double it again this year and we'll continue to grow at a pretty great rate. Lastly, we're the second largest holder of bitcoin of publicly traded companies in the U.S. and our strategic focus really is to amass as much bitcoin as we can. That's our core treasury asset and we do that through mining and also going into the markets and buying opportunistically when it makes sense.

Forbes: What metrics do you pay the most attention to and how does the development and investment you detailed help give you a leg up on the pure bitcoin miners?

Thiel: A couple of things. I talked about how we operate 13 sites on four continents. We don't have a concentration in a particular region or state. Riot Platforms is 100% concentrated in Texas today. They're trying to solve that by acquiring Bitfarms and then they've acquired another small site, I think in Kentucky. CleanSpark was heavily focused on Georgia. Now they're focusing on Kentucky as well. The challenge with being focused on just one area is you're very susceptible to your energy utility and energy market pricing in that region. In the case of Riot, they have the double whammy of two big sites in Texas and you have curtailment issues, weather issues and community issues, which in Texas are not small things. In the case of CleanSpark, they operate lots of very small sites. Operationally that is a very different issue because now you have to have people spread all over managing these disparate small sites and it may mean you don't have the opportunity to really aggregate the scale and get the benefits of scale in the same way. But Marathon is operating on different continents, so we also have the ability to avoid the risk of regulatory regime issues in the U.S. For example, in the Biden budget, there were attacks specifically on energy used by bitcoin mining. The Harris administration seems like they are befriending AI, but they are still going to be antagonistic to bitcoin mining. By the way, you can't give AI energy at one price and not give bitcoin mining energy at the same price. Not only would the industry attack that issue, but it's a type of commercial discrimination, which could be viewed as illegal. But more importantly, there is a huge symbiosis between AI and bitcoin mining because AI workloads vary just like demand on the grid varies and bitcoin miners have a unique ability to synchronize their load to AI miners loads such that you don't get this huge variance of demand on the grid. So when you marry bitcoin miners and AI operators together, you get a much better grid profile. You have the ability to stabilize the load, and you have an ability to use more of the intermittent energy -- solar, wind -- than AI can use.

If you look at our technology piece, operating our own pool, it's very transparent to our investors; they can see every block that we win. By operating your own pool, you do a couple of things. One is you pay a pool operator a percentage of your winnings for them to operate the pool. It's 1% or 2% depending on the size of the miner; we don't have to do that.

Then we have systems like Slipstream, a non-standard block submittal service that people in the Ordinals world really love. It allows us to get higher fees for submitting blocks to the network than the normal mempool would pay, so that gives us additional revenues on top of the traditional transaction fees that we get. We also have a Layer 2 called Anduro, which people are now starting to develop applications on.

Forbes: Can you speak a little more about how Anduro is constructed?

Thiel: It's a Bitcoin L2 that is essentially a clone of the Bitcoin network. It can process transactions much faster. It can do things that you can't really do as easily on the L1 of Bitcoin, but it anchors all its security, and it's pegged to the L1. You can, for example, do transactions in a much easier way than you can with lightning. Lightning requires you to open channels and close channels. This is a true sidechain, so you could build a digital identity network on it. You could build a MLS for real estate on it. You could build a transaction processing system for credit card remittances, whatever you may want to have. One of the applications that's been built on it, which will be released soon, is called Alice, and Alice is a full EMV system from the Ethereum world that lets you take an application built for Ethereum and port it directly to Bitcoin.

And then going back to our liquid cooling technology and the ASIC technology, we have technology advantages in that we can build miners specific to the use case. So in Finland for example, we have a small data center that heats 11,000 homes. How are we doing that? We're doing it through district heating by capturing heat from the miners. We have the ability to build custom miners for use cases. We recently made an investment in a company in San Diego, and what they do is they go in and they over-dimension solar systems for homes with solar panels and batteries and they use the excess capacity to mine bitcoin. Realize that solar energy has zero marginal cost, and so if you put 10 kilowatts of panels on a house versus six kilowatts of panels, the only difference in cost is the capital expenditure for the panels. Then all that extra energy can be used for bitcoin mining. More importantly, you can also heat water with the heat from the bitcoin miners. And what they do is they provision this and then they sell electricity to the consumer at 25% below market price.

That fits into this model of the long tail of bitcoin mining, which is highly decentralized bitcoin mining, putting it out at the edge and leveraging zero-cost energy. So what you'll see from us over the next couple of years is a move towards the cost to mine being covered by services we're providing to the parties with which we're partnered. That's an obtuse way of saying we believe-and we're in the process of signing agreements with large partners-that people will pay us for the benefits of marrying bitcoin mining to different applications. And in doing so, our cost of energy will go towards zero.

Forbes: Hash price continues to go down, and your stock price, along with other pure-play miners, has trailed that of Bitcoin and some of the other smaller miners that have made more direct overtures towards AI. What do you think of those things?

Thiel: A couple of things. At the beginning of this year you started to see the shift from bitcoin miners to kind of MicroStrategy and the ETFs because of the coming halving. Any miner was suddenly going to produce half as much bitcoin, and so their costs were going to go up. Essentially, they'd be less profitable, so it's only logical to think that their market cap would be impacted. At the same time, MicroStrategy was out there buying $2 billion worth of bitcoin, and that became very attractive for people to do.

The investment community-I'll go away from the retail side for a minute-the hedge funds, the volatility investors, love bitcoin mining because you get a lot more alpha than you did just by investing in bitcoin. It's the same reason Warren Buffett invested in gold miners versus gold because he likes the fact that when gold price runs up, gold miners' cost to extract doesn't necessarily go up.

The same generally holds with bitcoin miners. There's a six to nine-month lag as bitcoin price runs up before the cost to mine really starts jumping because the cost of mine is driven by either energy costs or global hash rate and the difficulty rate going up. And so if you have to go buy new capacity, buy new miners and deploy them, there's a six to nine month lag in that process. So you have this period of high profit when bitcoin price moves quickly. When bitcoin price does not move quickly, it moves sideways, buying spot bitcoin is much smarter and that also gives you an insight into our HODL strategy and why we go and buy bitcoin in the market sometimes. But MicroStrategy and Marathon and the other big miners have options that there's an options market. And so the ball players love it. They can do all sorts of very creative stuff and if you look at the stock prices, they tend to move pretty much in a pattern where they move up at the beginning of the week and down at the back half of the week. And that all has to do with selling calls and then buying back the calls after you short the stock. You can see very specific trading patterns for all the companies. The smaller guys were generally ignored previously, and now people have said the big guys are well-valued, and the smaller guys should be valued similarly on a per exhash basis. I think they're giving the small guys too much credit. Look at Cipher, they've signed up 350 megawatts of new stuff, but it's not going to come online for 12 to 18 months, yet the stock price goes up. So that's retail chasing that. Our investor makeup interestingly has changed this year in that in the first quarter we had about 39% institutional and now we're up closer to 60%. The institutional investors are seeing the value in our story because of how we position the transition to AI. I do not think that a miner like TerraWulf or Hut8 can go and build and operate a hosting center for AI very effectively. It is not the same thing as running a bitcoin mining site.

Forbes: What is the investor makeup? Are these buy and hold investors?

Thiel: Our single biggest shareholder today is BlackRock. They hold 13% to 14% of our shares, in both their managed and unmanaged funds. Same thing with Fidelity. You have basically BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, and then some long list of others after that.

But I think what we're certainly seeing when we're out talking to investors is the people who are starting to talk to us with interest are the ones who are looking at what we're doing around AI infrastructure and how that opportunity is very different from traditional bitcoin mining. Traditional bitcoin mining is a zero-sum game, and every four years, you get slapped in the face with a price increase effectively. As you start looking at digital infrastructure in the AI space, you now have the benefit of providing technology or services to these hyperscalers. The area we believe is most interesting is AI at the edge, which is all about inference. The inference marketplace is still two to three years from growing a lot because people are still busy building these LLMs [large language models].

If you read Sam Altman's white paper that he published recently, basically, his argument is you have to invest heavily in LLMs so that you have essentially something for inference to query. The way I put it is LLMs are the brain and inference is how you make money off of AI. Inference is the digital twin that is sitting in a factory, running a factory, and leveraging a model that sits up in the cloud, and the model is updated daily, sent back down to the edge, and it operates at the edge. There will be tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of these modular data centers that do inference at the edges spread all over the place.

Forbes: Let's talk more about the HODL strategy. You've hinted at some very strategic decisions that affect how you leverage your balance sheet when updating equipment and making investments versus procuring bitcoin on the spot market. Can you break that down a little more?

Thiel: When you are investing in bitcoin mining, you are betting on the fact that you will be able to produce bitcoin at a lower cost than you could acquire it in the open marketplace. So if I'm going to spend $100 million dollars and buy bitcoin, I get that bitcoin tomorrow, and then I get the benefit of its price appreciation over the hold period, and let's just say I'm going to hold it for 36 months. If you assume it will go up 20%-plus a year, you have that price appreciation in the bitcoin, and your basis is today's price. If you are going to go into the mining business, your bet is I'm going to invest $100 million dollars in infrastructure that will likely go live in about 12 months on average. It could be shorter if you're buying an existing site that's running and you're just going to replace the miners. And so you need to over the following 24 months, mine not just as much bitcoin as you acquired where you bought the bitcoin today, but enough bitcoin so you're also covering your cost of power, etc., such that at the end of the period of time you end up with more dollar value of bitcoin than you did just by buying it today.

What that requires is a belief in what the price of bitcoin is going to do in the long term. And so when we have access to capital, there are times when we will choose to go into the market and buy bitcoin versus invest it in adding more mining capacity because sometimes there's a lag in how long it takes for us to deploy the capital when we're adding mining capacity.

Forbes: You recently met with Donald Trump. Can you share your experiences or takeaways from that round table?

Thiel: Former President Trump has been very well briefed and understands the value proposition that bitcoin provides to the U.S. as a country and the opportunity that bitcoin mining provides for the U.S. to be the dominant player in processing bitcoin transactions and securing the bitcoin blockchain. It's a little bit like the gold reserves the U.S. holds. The U.S. holds 40% of the gold reserves of the world because in the event there was ever an attack on the U.S. dollar, you have the gold reserves that you can use. The U.S. also happens to have custody of the majority of other countries' gold. As you know, Russia got on the wrong side of that with the sanctions program.

Many nations have figured out that with the weaponization of the dollar, they need to be able to hold assets in something other than the dollar. So they're now evaluating holding things in amongst other things, bitcoin as well as gold and other assets. And not that they will hold all their reserves in bitcoin, but they may decide to hold somewhere between 1% to 10%, depending on the country and their risk profile. I don't think the Saudis, if you were to talk to them, would say that they consider the rupee, the ruble or some of these other currencies as good reserve assets, and so they're still going to put their faith in the dollar. But they want to have a hedge, and they want to have something that provides a risk-adjusted return potentially better than just placing their money in dollar assets because a lot of the countries today outside of the U.S. are being very cautious about their buying of Treasury bills, for example. The sixth largest buyer of Treasury bills today is Tether [according to Investopedia]. It's not a country. It's a stablecoin.

So what you're starting to see is people who want to have dollar-denominated stablecoins end up being the biggest holders of Treasury bills. Then you have to look at bonds and who wants to hold those? The Chinese certainly aren't buying them anymore nor are a lot of other countries. So if a sovereign is going to hold bitcoin, then the sovereign has to be guaranteed that they can transact it. Because if all bitcoin mining happens in the U.S. or the U.S. has a significant amount of bitcoin mining going on, then the U.S., in theory, could sanction a country by forcing U.S. bitcoin miners through legal regulation to not mine certain transactions because they're on OFAC sanction lists, for example. That could restrict somebody from transacting where, let's just say you had 60% of mining in the U.S., well, six out of 10 blocks, meaning somebody would only be able to transact in four out of any 10 blocks. That happens, and if you've got enough countries in the world to go against one country, you could potentially almost block them out. So sovereigns who are going to hold bitcoin have a need to have mining in their country. Bhutan is a great example. Bhutan holds $1 billion of bitcoin. They also have a lot of mining in their country.

El Salvador now has stated that they no longer need third-party debt because they mine and hold bitcoin. So the U.S. should hold bitcoin just like they hold gold, and the U.S. should ensure that a certain percentage of the global hashrate comes from the U.S. so that all the bitcoin held in the U.S. by ETFs and these other funds can be transacted if need be.

Forbes: Trump has said that he would like to see all remaining bitcoin mined in the U.S. That might be just politicking more than a serious policy statement, but I'm interested in your thoughts, given what you just mentioned.

Thiel: I'm not going to put words in his mouth, but I think he views it as strategic importance for the U.S. to be a dominant player in bitcoin mining. And I think sometimes when he says dominant, he'll say, we have to be the end all. He wants that in the way of bitcoin mining and in the U.S. holding bitcoin reserves just like the gold aspect. You've seen him recently talk about if the U.S. were to hold a lot of bitcoin it could potentially appreciate to a point that it could pay for part of the debt or even all the debt. Representative Paulina Luna, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and others are all believers in these programs. We think it's certainly a very wise choice because there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. So it's just a question of who will own them over what period of time.

Being shareholders in and having cofounded the only U.S. ASIC manufacturer for bitcoin mining, we're certainly big believers in bitcoin miners made in the USA. You could argue that Chinese companies make 75% of the bitcoin miners made in the world today. I'm not saying that they're trying to do anything bad, but it does provide them an ability to essentially somewhat control the supply and the pricing of bitcoin miners.

Forbes: That concentration can be dangerous in anything.

Thiel: Exactly. So that's why we're big advocates. Regardless of who wins the presidential election, there may be opportunities to do something about that from a tariff perspective.

Forbes: Have you had any interactions with the Harris campaign?

Thiel: We have talked with the head of the DNC. We have talked with all sorts of senators and the Harris team does not want to engage with us. They have engaged with the AI industry. My belief is that, unfortunately, Senator Warren and her anti-crypto army have a fairly strong lock on some of the policy decisions that the Harris team is evaluating. Certainly, President Biden wanted to apply a tax to bitcoin mining as part of his budget. Part of this is they just don't understand the environmental benefit that bitcoin mining brings and the fact that it does not add additional fossil fuel requirements, it actually helps subsidize the renewable energy side of the world. And if they understood that, I think they would be willing to listen. But there are many forces rallied against us for political reasons on that side of the aisle that I wish didn't exist.

Forbes: When did you start imprinting ""made in the USA"" in the blocks that you mine and why did you do that?

Thiel: It was around the 4th of July [actual date was July 31]. It's a way for people to know if that block is mined in the U.S. or if it was mined offshore. Offshore entities control the majority of bitcoin pools. We're one of the few bitcoin pools that is not. We believe some people prefer transacting and putting their transactions into blocks that are mined in the U.S.

Forbes: Are you ever worried that there could be a certain premium on bitcoins mined in the U.S. versus those elsewhere? Could that potentially impact the fungibility of any of these assets?

Thiel: If you filter on OFAC, that doesn't impact the fungibility because you're not filtering bitcoins; you're filtering wallets. How to look at it is somebody's bank account is on an OFAC list. The dollars in the bank account are on the list. It's the account, so the account can't transact. It's not that the bitcoin it holds is tainted. You may remember back in 2021, when we launched our pool, it originally had OFAC filtering turned on.

Forbes: You've mentioned in the past that mining of Kaspa is a way to diversify. How much Kaspa do you have and are you continuing to mine it?

Thiel: We continue to mine kaspa. We've grown our capacity a handful of times since we first announced that we were doing it. It's dissimilar from bitcoin in that it's a much smaller market cap and pool of liquidity. And so you can't just add exahashes and grow. You have to be very careful because there isn't a lot of liquidity compared to bitcoin. We mine enough so that we are not an overwhelming amount of the hashrate on the Kaspa network, but it is more profitable to mine than bitcoin on a per kilowatt hour basis. So if I invest a kilowatt of energy towards bitcoin, my profit using S21s could be anywhere from 5 to 8 cents depending on my cost of energy per kilowatt hour. In the case of kaspa, it's anywhere from 35 cents to a dollar. I can take kaspa, I can sell it and I can buy bitcoin or hold it. Kaspa has had some very strong price appreciation lately. So we've had a HODL strategy around some of the kaspa.

Forbes: I published a list of what we called crypto billion dollar zombies in the magazine in March. Kaspa was mentioned as one of them. We saw the mining and we know it's similar to bitcoin, but it's hard to ascertain real discernible use for it beyond just people mining it and then sending it back and forth. Any more thoughts about Kaspa you'd like to share?

Thiel: Kaspa as a technology is very interesting. It is a webchain versus a blockchain. It's web of blocks versus a linear line of blocks, and Kaspa has a very fast transaction speed. It also has a very high emissions decline. So it goes from emitting a lot of kaspa at the front end and then that subsidy drops very rapidly down. And so kaspa mining will likely not be a long-term business, but as long as we can mine it profitably and there's a good liquid market for it, then we just view it as a great source of revenues.

Forbes: Is there anything I didn't ask you that's at the top of your mind you'd like to share?

Thiel: One thing that could be of interest to readers is that one of the primary drivers for the hashrate growth has been the upgrade cycle. If you take 30 watt per terrahash machines and replace them with 15 watt per terrahash machines, you just double your hashrate. Now that the upgrade cycle is finished, we're entering a phase where people have to add actual capacity.

I think you're still going to see global hashrate inching up, but you won't see the step function change that you saw. In 2023 hashrate doubled, then we had a halving in early 2024, and then you had all this hashrate come online [later]. We're pushing 700 exahash today. I think if anything, what you're going to see is bitcoin is going to continue to push sideways. We're seeing an institutionalization of bitcoin-ETFs have come on board; you now can do options on ETFs; you now have Morgan Stanley's 15,000 wealth advisors soliciting for bitcoin. We're still in the early days of this and you're now going to have hopefully the repeal or the reversal or the number of exemptions to SAB121, and you're going to see banks being able to custody bitcoin in addition to BNY Mellon, which means you can then start doing leverage, etc. You're going to build a lot of liquidity. With all those, what should be demand drivers? You still see institutional buyers sniping to buy bitcoin. They're sitting on the sidelines. They wait for a dip and they buy a dip. They are not in the market hurrying up, forcing the price up. So until there is a catalyst that drives the price of bitcoin up and maybe the election is the catalyst, I don't think we're going to see bitcoin price move up dramatically."
"What To Know About JD Vance's Policy Views -- On Abortion, Economy, Immigration And More -- Before Tonight's VP Debate",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/01/what-to-know-about-jd-vances-policy-views-on-abortion-economy-immigration-and-more-before-tonights-vp-debate/,2024-10-01T14:19:54Z,"Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, will likely be asked about his opinions on abortion and other major policy issues when he faces off against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at Tuesday's vice presidential debate, amid controversy surrounding his stances since being named as former President Donald Trump's running mate over the summer.

Vance told The New York Times in February that his populist economic vision can be described as ""applying as much upward pressure on wages and as much downward pressure on the services that the people use as possible."" The senator said he supports raising the minimum wage as an incentive to get workers back in the workforce -- and has co-sponsored legislation to raise it -- and other government intervention to boost industries, like providing subsidies or tax credits. He does not support more stringent government regulations on private businesses, however, telling The Times that to boost the economy, ""there's a lot you can do on the regulatory side -- make building nuclear facilities easier, make building natural gas pipelines easier, make building housing easier -- that doesn't cost money and in fact brings in money."" Vance also supports tariffs that impose taxes on foreign goods, saying that while that can result in higher prices, ""when you are forced to do more with your domestic labor force, you have all of these positive dynamic effects."" He told The Times that while he wouldn't want to raise taxes on middle class Americans, he isn't necessarily opposed to raising taxes on the wealthy, but asked, ""How much revenue does that actually raise?"" Vance is also a big proponent of cryptocurrency, holding bitcoin himself and drafting legislation that would help the cryptocurrency industry.

Vance told The Times he supports Social Security, saying, ""I don't know why people think that you solve many problems by taking a bunch of elderly people and saying, 'You're on your own.'"" The senator suggested he believes in raising more money for the program through a combination of tariffs and bolstering the American labor force, arguing that if more Americans are working rather than relying on public assistance, it would mean more money can go toward Social Security.

Vance has been widely criticized for his views on abortion. In 2022 he said he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally"" and opposed the idea that pregnant people could simply cross state lines to obtain an abortion if the state where they reside banned the procedure. He has also compared abortion to slavery, saying in 2021, ""While the people who obviously suffer the most are those subjected to it, I think it has this morally distorting effect on the entire society."" The senator was part of a broader group of GOP lawmakers who asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to enforce the Comstock Act in 2023, a long-dormant law from the 19th century that would ban the mailing of anything related to abortion. While the letter specifically asked to stop the mailing of abortion pills, experts have suggested the law could be interpreted more broadly to ban the mailing of abortion-related equipment altogether, which would effectively ban the procedure in practice by ensuring physicians can't get the necessary materials to perform it. Vance has more recently downplayed his former support for restricting abortion and endorsed Trump's view of leaving the issue up to the states.

Vance has echoed Trump in calling for mass deportations of immigrants from the U.S. and criticized the Biden administration for allowing an influx of undocumented immigrants. He also helped spread false rumors against Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, and disapproved of the Biden administration extending temporary legal protections to Haitian migrants. The senator has denounced using immigrants for cheaper labor in the U.S., saying business owners should instead increase incentives to lure American workers.

Vance has perhaps garnered the most attention for his attacks on childless Americans, with comments resurfacing from 2021 in which he complained about Democrats being ""childless cat ladies"" who ""want to make the rest of the country miserable too"" and don't have a ""direct stake"" in the country's future. While Vance has claimed his comments were a joke, they do reflect his broader views, as the senator has pushed policies that would incentivize people to have children and benefit families. He has suggested there should be a higher tax rate for childless adults and even said in 2021 parents should have more voting power than voters without children, and has touted a policy in Hungary that provides loans to married couples and then forgives those loans if the couple has children. Vance has supported ""universal childbirth"" policies that would provide healthcare coverage for childbirth, though he has opposed ""universal childcare"" proposals, which he said in 2021 are a ""massive subsidy to the lifestyle preferences of the affluent over the preferences of the middle and working class."" He has also supported expanding child tax credits for low-income families, but has been criticized for missing a Senate vote on the issue. The senator made comments in 2021 suggesting he was against no-fault divorce -- though he did not explicitly call for repealing it -- claiming that ""children suffered"" because of more relaxed views around divorce and calling for a return to viewing marriage as ""sacred"" in order to preserve American families.

Vance has deep ties to the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank spearheading the controversial Project 2025 policy agenda proposing an extreme overhaul of the executive branch should Trump win the election. The senator authored the introduction to Heritage president Kevin Roberts' forthcoming book -- which calls for a ""second American Revolution"" and says ""it's time to circle the wagons and load the muskets"" -- and has long been allied with the organization, with Roberts telling Politico in March Vance is ""absolutely going to be one of the leaders -- if not the leader -- of our movement."" Prior to joining Congress, Vance penned the introduction to a Heritage Foundation report that endorses many of the policies also mentioned in Project 2025, promoting heterosexual nuclear families and decrying abortion and public assistance programs. He has also expressed support for a key pillar of the Project 2025 agenda, which calls for replacing career civil servants with political appointees. Vance has not explicitly endorsed Project 2025, however, particularly as the Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from its proposals. He said in July, prior to becoming Trump's running mate, that he thinks ""there's some good ideas in"" Project 2025's policy blueprint, but it also has ""some things I disagree with.""

LGBTQ+ advocacy groups criticized Vance's nomination as Trump's running mate due to his record on LGBTQ+ rights. As a senator, Vance introduced legislation opposing transgender rights, authoring bills that would classify gender-affirming care for minors as a felony and ban ""X"" from being used as a neutral gender designation on U.S. passports. Vance also said in 2022 he would vote no on legislation to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, and has voiced support for policies like Florida's law known as ""Don't Say Gay,"" which restrict what schools can say about sexual orientation and gender identity.

Vance is one of the GOP lawmakers who has vocally opposed providing additional aid to Ukraine, and has come under fire for saying in 2022 that he ""do[esn't] really care what happens to"" the eastern European country. The senator called at the Republican National Convention for the U.S.'s allies to ""share in the burden of securing world peace,"" saying there should be ""no more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,"" and told The Times in June the U.S. ""should be dealing with other countries based on whether they're good or bad for America's interests."" He criticized the Biden administration's Ukraine policy to The Times, saying the U.S. was not sufficiently working to deter China from invading Taiwan because ""we're sending all the damn weapons to Ukraine,"" though also acknowledged that handling the situation in Ukraine means ""there's going to have to be some American security assistance over the long term."" Vance also agreed that Russia gaining control of Ukraine is ""is not in our interest."" The senator has expressed strong support for Israel in its war against Hamas, saying at a rally on Saturday that his peace plan is ""elect Donald Trump"" and suggesting he aligns with Trump's view that ""the only way to get to peace is to destroy Hamas and let Israel finish the job.""

Vance's views stand in stark contrast to Democratic rival Walz, who has championed progressive policies including abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights and opposing climate changes. Walz is a gun owner but is strongly in favor of gun control measures like universal background checks and banning bump stocks, in contrast to Vance, whom the National Rifle Association described as ""a true Second Amendment champion"" and has opposed gun control reforms. As governor of Minnesota, Walz has signed bills into law that include free meals for school children, expanded protections for workers, restoring voting rights for the formerly incarcerated, climate change initiatives and legalizing marijuana, among other measures. Like Vance, Walz supports expanding the child tax credit, and he helped enact a nation-leading $1,750 tax credit in Minnesota after a federal tax credit expired. Walz's administration also eliminated many beneficiaries' income taxes on Social Security benefits, which Trump has also called for.

While Vance's economic philosophy has a strong emphasis on bolstering the American worker, the senator has come under fire from the left for his mixed record on supporting labor unions. Though Vance made headlines for visiting striking United Auto Workers union members on the picket line, the senator opposed the PRO Act that would have strengthened protections for unionized workers and codified the collective bargaining process. He told Politico in March that he opposed the legislation in part because he favors a system where industries negotiate union deals, rather than individual workplaces or companies, and because he ""think[s] it's dumb to hand over a lot of power to a union leadership that is aggressively anti-Republican.""

Vance has reached across the aisle for several of his efforts in Congress, working with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, on a bill to improve rail safety standards after the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on legislation regarding banking regulations. The vice presidential candidate told Politico in March that his wariness of big corporations often aligns him with progressive Democrats even as he disagrees with them on other issues, saying, ""If you look at the people that I've worked with most successfully, it's people who, even though they're from the left, recognize that something's pretty fundamentally broken about American society."" Warren, for example, is ""at least thinking deeply about what's going on in the country and why things seem to be going off the rails,"" Vance said. In his June interview with The Times, Vance said ""Bernie Bros"" are the group on the left ""whose politics I'm open to,"" while criticizing ""center-left liberals who are doing very well,"" arguing them and their center-right counterparts ""have an incredible blind spot about how much their success is built on a system that is not serving people who they should be serving.""

34.7%. That's the average number of U.S. adults who have a favorable view of Vance as of Monday, according to a compilation of polls by FiveThirtyEight, versus 45.7% of Americans who have a negative view of him. Polling suggests the Ohio senator is the least popular non-incumbent vice presidential candidate in at least the past 20 years, according to FiveThirtyEight."
A Faux 'October Surprise' -- How Misinformation Could Upend The Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/01/a-faux-october-surprise-how-misinformation-could-upend-the-election/,2024-10-01T14:08:23Z,"As we head into the final weeks before Election Day, the political campaigns are likely bracing for an unexpected ""October Surprise"" that could influence voters and impact the results. The term was first coined by William Casey, who served as campaign manager for Ronald Reagan during the 1980 presidential campaign, yet, there have been October election-upending events going back to the 19th century.

What Casey and his predecessors likely never expected was how misinformation -- and even disinformation -- could be employed to sway voters. Advances in technology like Deep Fakes, an overreliance on social media for news and information, and foreign actors who seek to undermine confidence in our elections have created a perfect storm for such a nightmare scenario.

Nearly eight years ago, a video of then-candidate and now-former President Donald Trump surfaced in which he bragged about grabbing women by their genitals. It was an ""October surprise"" that almost derailed his campaign. Four years later, Trump contracted Covid-19 and was forced to cancel a debate with then-candidate Joe Biden and stop all campaigning.

With just weeks to go until Election Day, there could be a similar surprise -- and perhaps even a made-up one. Yet, the consequences could be huge.

""When Hillary Clinton recently warned Kamala Harris about the threat of an October surprise, she knew what she was talking about. Remember James Comey, just 11 days before the 2016 election? That turned out to be a nothing burger -- and Comey was rebuked in subsequent investigations for his actions. Or Pizzagate? That, too, turned out to be false,"" said Susan Campbell, distinguished lecturer in the College of Arts & Sciences at the University of New Haven.

""This year, voters must be on guard for the biggest threat to a free and fair election: Misinformation. They must steel themselves against lies and distortions, particularly on social media,"" added Campbell. ""Recently, an army of bots and trolls took to X(witter) to say that the federal government had not done enough to help the people harmed by Hurricane Helene, which was false.""

The spread of misinformation and disinformation during an election season isn't new and actually dates back to the country's founding. Smithsonian magazine previously reported how in the 1800 election Thomas Jefferson engaged in a ""smear campaign against then-president John Adams,"" which ""climaxed with an unexpected October broadside."" The late-season attack, carried out by Alexander Hamilton -- a critic of Adams and who went on to be Jefferson's VEEP -- remains one of the earliest examples of an effective late-campaign attack on a political rival.

During the 1840 election, rumors circulated that the Whig Party had paid residents of Pennsylvania to cross state lines and cast votes in New York during the 1838 election. There was no basis that this occurred, but people believed it -- just as some today believe illegal immigrants can head to the polls to sway the election results.

It was also 100 years before William Casey coined the term ""October Surprise"" that a disinformation campaign almost impacted the presidential election results.

The New York Truth newspaper published a forged letter on October 20, 1880, allegedly written by Republican candidate James Garfield voicing support for Chinese immigration at a time when many white Americans were opposed to Chinese immigration over fears that they were stealing jobs from American workers. In truth, both campaigns were in favor of immigration restrictions. Garfield went on to win the election by a narrow margin, but there has been speculation if the forged letter was released a little earlier the situation could have been different.

Misinformation/disinformation has clearly existed for a while, but social media could impact how it reaches the masses.

""The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report highlights that the primary risk for 2024 is the use of misinformation and disinformation by malicious actors to disrupt society and further polarize communities,"" warned

Craig Barkacs, professor of business law and ethics in the MBA programs at the Knauss School of Business at the University of San Diego.

The October surprise may no longer be a single event or revelation. We could already see many at work, with misinformation already circulating about Senator JD Vance and his couch, and Governor Tim Walz supporting post-birth abortions.

But users of social media should be on guard for even more misinformation and disinformation in the coming weeks.

""There may be several October surprises in the works,"" said Barkacs. ""For most individuals, these may not make a significant difference as their opinions are already formed. For a small percentage, however, these surprises could be pivotal. The presidential elections of 2016 and 2020 illustrate how a tiny fraction of votes in crucial swing states can determine the outcome.""

Artificial intelligence may offer the ability to micro-target voters on social media while being strategically timed and aimed at a particular audience to help alter the results of the election.

""These micro-targeted voters are likely to be low-information voters, who are more susceptible to misinformation. These individuals, often unaware of the broader context, are the first to believe and spread unfounded stories,"" Barkacs continued. ""Research indicates that micro-targeting specific groups can influence voting behavior. We should be concerned about just what impact a deviously concocted October surprise could have on the outcome of the election.""

The most effective way to combat misinformation and disinformation is to ensure that we have a well-informed electorate, and that could users offering direct responses to the more outlandish commentary spread on the social networks.

""This go-round, there can be no passivity,"" suggested Campbell. ""For the good of the election, voters must find and amplify the truth -- to, in effect, shout down the trolls."""
Vance Suggests Changes To Health Insurance That May Raise Premiums For Those With Preexisting Conditions,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2024/10/01/vance-suggests-changes-to-health-insurance-that-may-raise-premiums-for-those-with-preexisting-conditions/,2024-10-01T13:09:44Z,"Memorably, at the presidential debate last month, former President Trump mentioned ""concepts of a plan"" when asked about his proposal to reform healthcare. Now his running mate, Senator Vance, says there is a plan to ""fix healthcare,"" specifically with respect to the Affordable Care Act. Vance argues that the health insurance market needs to be deregulated. He speaks of placing people with chronic conditions into separate insurance pools. But this could lead to insurers charging higher premiums for individuals with pre-existing conditions.

Kamala Harris's campaign released a report yesterday which maintained that millions of people with preexisting conditions could lose protection guaranteed them by ACA rules if Vance's changes were to go through.

During his term in office, Trump sought to undo ACA by executive action, legislation and lawsuits. Yet the law survived. And during Trump's bid to secure a second presidential term, he has wavered on the idea of whether to repeal the ACA.

But perhaps given the fact that the ACA is popular and growing in terms of enrollment and the uninsured rate is at an historic low, rather than do away with the ACA Trump is now calling for what he describes as improvements in the law. His running mate, Vance, is proposing substantial changes to ACA health insurance coverage that could lead to the elimination of the ACA's protection against insurers levying higher premiums on individuals in poor health.

Vance has spoken of deregulating the insurance market so that ""people can choose a plan that actually makes sense for them,"" as reported in The Hill. On the campaign trail in North Carolina last month, for instance, Vance suggested getting rid of the ACA's single risk pool which enables community rating and introducing separate risk pools for people with chronic health conditions. This would disrupt one of the ACA's guiding principles which states that health insurers may not charge people higher premiums based on their health status.

KFF estimates that 27% of adults have a condition that would have led to denied coverage by an insurer in the individual market before the ACA. Prior to the law's passage, insurers were able to deny coverage for a wide range of diseases or charge substantially higher premiums for individuals with preexisting conditions.

Vance wants to leave decisions on how to regulate what insurers do with the aforementioned high risk insurance pools up to individual states. Subsequently, if certain states permit premium surcharges based on health status, people with preexisting conditions would theoretically have access to health insurance, but it could be unaffordable.

State high-risk pools could provide access to coverage to people with preexisting conditions as an alternative to the private insurance market. But whether such pools would be effective depends on adequate funding, which did not occur in the states that had instituted them before the ACA was enacted. And so these insurance pools were not a feasible option for many due to exorbitant premiums.

On the stump, Vance has also said ""we're going to actually implement some regulatory reform in the healthcare system that allows people to choose a healthcare plan that works for them. If you only go to the doctor once a year, you're going to need a different healthcare plan than somebody who goes to the doctor fourteen times a year because they've got chronic pain or they've got some other chronic condition.""

Though it's unclear what in particular Vance has in mind for healthier individuals, maybe he's referring to short-term insurance plans which the Trump Administration promoted and made more accessible. These options do not offer coverage as comprehensive as ACA plans. Some healthy people might have an incentive to opt for short-term insurance, which can be renewed every three to twelve months, as a way to lower premiums.

The problem is that this may drive up costs considerably for the sicker folks who remain on ACA exchange plans. Moreover, the idea of offering healthy individuals a cheaper plan with far less complete coverage tacitly presumes that people's health needs are static, which they often are not. Perhaps the most important aim of having health insurance is to provide financial protection from unforeseen events. The fact that a person only sees a doctor once now has no bearing on the future, whether that's next year or later.

Only 39% of survey respondents polled by KFF in February of this year were aware that the ACA prohibits insurers from denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions, and only 31% knew that the ACA also prevents sick people from being charged higher premiums than healthy individuals. In light of Vance's statements on ACA reform, it would seem important that the electorate be better informed about what the proposed changes could entail."

The bitcoin price has dropped after surging back toward its all-time high of over $70,000 per bitcoin as the market weighs the impact of a China earthquake.

Now, as Elon Musk reveals the details of his secret meeting with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink has warned he thinks the market needs to temper its expectations of Fed interest rate cuts -- while analysts think China's central bank will create ""fireworks"" with a ""tsunami of liquidity.""

""The amount of easing that's in the forward curve is crazy,"" Fink, who's led BlackRock to become the world's largest asset manager looking after $10 trillion on behalf of clients, told Bloomberg on the sidelines of a Berlin conference. ""I do believe there's room for easing more, but not as much as the forward curve would indicate.""

Traders are betting there's a one-in-three chance the Fed will cut another 50 basis points from interest rates at its November meeting, with a further 190 basis points shaved off before the end of 2025.

The market was caught somewhat off guard by the Fed's 50 basis point interest rate cut earlier this month -- its first post-pandemic era reduction -- widely expected to kick off a monetary policy easing cycle that could boost risk-correlated assets such as bitcoin and crypto.

However, Fed chair Jerome Powell played down chances of another 0.5% cut in a speech on Monday, saying officials ""are not on any preset course.""

Meanwhile, traders have been told to ""expect fireworks"" by analysts David Brickell and Chris Mill, who wrote in their newsletter that they see the bitcoin price hitting fresh all-time highs this week, pointing to China's long-awaited announcement of huge stimulus measures designed to reignite its stalled economy.

""The steps taken from China this week will unleash a tsunami of liquidity. Alongside the Fed more aggressively cutting and a global easing cycle, we're pumping in anticipation of that, but against this short term liquidity drain,"" Mill and Brickell wrote.

""They say don't fight the Fed. Also don't fight China. Definitely don't fight the Fed and China together."""
"Forbes Daily: Ahead Of Debate, How Much Are Vance And Walz Worth?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/10/01/forbes-daily-ahead-of-debate-how-much-are-vance-and-walz-worth/,2024-10-01T12:11:37Z,"You don't just need to be a billionaire to make this year's Forbes 400 list. The cutoff for the 2024 list of America's 400 wealthiest is $3.3 billion.

In fact, for the first time, there are more American billionaires not on the list than are on it. But many of those who did make the cut are familiar faces: Elon Musk is the richest person in America for a third-straight year, followed by Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.

Perhaps the most notable person to make the list, despite falling off of it last year, is Donald Trump, who has cashed in on the presidency more than anyone else, and benefitted from the shaky stock market run of Truth Social's parent company.

The S&P 500 had its best start to the year through September since 1997, gaining 21% so far this year. Big tech stocks benefitting from the generative AI boom have performed best, though the market has shifted slightly in recent months as investors anticipated and reacted to this month's supersized interest rate cut.

Dockworkers along the East and Gulf Coasts walked out on strike early Tuesday, a stoppage that one economist estimated could cost the economy up to $7.5 billion per week. The International Longshoremen's Association is requesting a wage increase as part of a new contract with the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents shipping companies.

If former President Donald Trump wins in November, it could hamper the Chinese stock market's recent rally, JPMorgan Chase strategists cautioned Monday. The risk of a Trump presidency for emerging market stocks is tied to his hawkish trade policies, especially toward China. Still, the strategists noted that emerging market stocks could be at a ""turning point.""

Fintech heavyweights like Jack Dorsey's Block and payments giant Stripe are joining a new compliance coalition for fintechs, in an effort to avoid the missteps of recent years -- which have led to everything from the dramatic collapse of Synapse to a surge in regulatory enforcement actions against fintech sponsor banks. ""Fintechs need to step it up and understand that regulatory requirements are real,"" says former startup CEO Sima Gandhi, a lawyer and former Department of Treasury official who organized the effort.

Aerospace and defense firm Sierra Nevada Corp. landed a $13.1 billion contract to build the next nuclear-ready 'Doomsday' planes, a game-changer for the privately-held company. The Doomsday project will help define the legacy of chairwoman and co-owner Eren Ozmen and her husband, who are worth a combined $7.8 billion. ""Taking smart risks is very important,"" says Ozmen. ""Without that, really, you're just following what's happening -- you're not leading.""

Video game company Epic Games accused Google and Samsung in a federal lawsuit of colluding to harm third-party app stores on smartphones running Google's Android operating system. Epic has taken on both Google and Apple in recent years, alleging that the companies abused their dominant position in the smartphone market to charge excessive fees to app makers.

X, formerly known as Twitter, is worth a little more than one-fifth of the $44 billion Elon Musk paid to acquire it in 2022, according to Fidelity. Fidelity's stake in the social media platform is now worth about $4.19 million, valuing X at $9.4 billion, according to recent disclosures from the financial services company.

Before JD Vance and Tim Walz face off in the vice presidential debate tonight, Forbes took a look at how the candidates stack up financially. While Vance is worth $10 million, exceeding Walz's net worth of just over $1 million, both candidates are less wealthy than their potential bosses: Donald Trump is worth $3.9 billion, while Kamala Harris has a net worth of $7 million.

As Donald Trump became perhaps the most polarizing and controversial president in recent memory, hotels began removing the Trump brand -- but he still made millions. The most likely explanation? Breakup fees. It's tough to say exactly how much all the breakup fees add up to, but Forbes estimates it was at least $15 million and could have been as high as $25 million.

The Israeli Defense Forces began ""limited, localized, and targeted ground raids ... in southern Lebanon"" against Hezbollah targets and infrastructure Monday -- escalating the conflict in the Middle East after Israel killed a number of Hezbollah leaders. The IDF said that the operations were ""approved and carried out in accordance with the decision of the political echelon.""

TOPLINE It was another great year to be rich, especially for the select few at the very top. With markets roaring, nearly all of the 25 wealthiest people in America got wealthier over the past 12 months -- some by billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars.

In all, the top 25 billionaires on The Forbes 400 list are worth a collective $2.5 trillion. They hold nearly half of the $5.4 trillion in total wealth of the entire 400.

This elite group is $471 billion richer than in 2023, with each of the top 25 up 31% on average, outpacing the 18% jump in wealth across list members overall and the S&P 500's 27% return.

Much of the gains come from two people: Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, who added $75 billion to his net worth thanks to rebounding Meta stock, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, who has ridden the AI wave to $63.3 billion in additional wealth since the 2023 ranking. They're two of a record 12 members of The Forbes 400 who are also in the $100 Billion Club, the lucky group of tycoons whose fortunes stretch a dozen digits.

Only three members of the top 25 got poorer over the past year: Elon Musk, whose fortune dropped by $7 billion but who remains the richest person in America; Bill Gates, after Forbes increased our estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement with Melinda French Gates; and Phil Knight, following a rough run for Nike stock since last year.

WHY IT MATTERS ""The Forbes 400 is a roadmap of America's great wealth,"" says Forbes senior editor Chase Peterson-Withorn. ""The 400 richest people in the nation are richer, and thus in many ways more powerful, than ever. It's crucial to investigate who they are, how they made it, where they spend it and how they choose to (or, as is often the case, choose not to) donate it.""

Forbes Releases 2024 Ranking Of The 400 Richest Americans,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2024/10/01/forbes-releases-2024-ranking-of-the-400-richest-americans/,2024-10-01T11:56:26Z,"The Richest Americans Are Worth A Record-Breaking $5.4 Trillion

The richest U.S. citizens continue to soar. They are collectively worth a record $5.4 trillion, up nearly $1 trillion from last year. A dozen have fortunes worth more than $100 billion, also a record. Admission to the elite club is pricier than ever, with the minimum net worth to make the list jumping to $3.3 billion, up $400 million from 2023.

Elon Musk continues to top the list, ahead of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (No. 2), for the third consecutive year -- despite losing $7 billion as shares of Tesla fell 14% and a Delaware judge voiding $56 billion of his stock options in January.

Former president Donald Trump returns to this year's list after falling off last year's ranking. Trump has an estimated net worth of $4.3 billion on the 2024 Forbes 400, the majority of which -- $2.2 billion as of September 1, the day Forbes determined net worths -- stems from Trump Media & Technology Group, which went public in March and operates Truth Social.

""With the American stock market setting records, the billionaires who dominate it are having a record-breaking year too,"" says Chase Peterson-Withorn, Senior Editor at Forbes. ""The Forbes 400 is richer than ever and it's harder than ever to be one of the 400 richest people in America.""

Despite this year's $3.3 billion cost of entry, the list features 23 newcomers, who amassed fortunes in everything from plastic pipes to artificial intelligence. For the first time ever, there are more American billionaires who didn't make The Forbes 400 than who did: 415 and counting. This includes famous faces such as Oprah Winfrey (worth $3 billion), Taylor Swift (worth $1.3 billion) and Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1 billion).

As part of The Forbes 400, Forbes scored billionaires based on the percentage of their fortunes they have donated to charity so far. The rating system ranks list members on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the most philanthropic. The Forbes wealth team estimated list members' total lifetime giving based on public filings and interviews with listees.

The Forbes 400 magazine issue features five consecutive covers including:

· Donald Trump: Plenty of rich people have blown fortunes on politics. But no other American has used politics to create as much personal wealth as the 45th president, who left office with a new asset -- throngs of people willing to buy almost anything from him, at virtually any price.

· Brian Armstrong: Coinbase's Brian Armstrong created one of crypto's central players, a fee-gushing monster that holds more than a tenth of all the Bitcoin ever minted. But now, in the cause of ""decentralization,"" he's pursuing a new path. It's easy to be an idealist when you're a billionaire.

· Eren Ozmen: Eren Ozmen's Sierra Nevada Corp. fought for years to land the $13 billion contract to build the next nuclear-ready Doomsday planes. Now the billionaire's reputation -- and her firm's finances -- hinge on whether she can pull off the most difficult maneuver in aerospace: executing a complex, top-secret government project on time and on budget.

Breaking Down Elon Musk's Big Beef With The FAA,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2024/10/01/elon-musk-spacex-faa-feud/,2024-10-01T10:37:58Z,"The billionaire has been publicly warring with the U.S. space regulator over fines and delays with an onslaught of criticism on X, blog posts and letters to Congress.

After days of feuding with the Federal Aviation Administration, Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of the rocket company SpaceX, ratcheted things up yet again. This time, he took aim at FAA head Michael Whitaker.

""He needs to resign,"" Musk wrote last week on X, the social platform he owns.

Musk called out Whitaker for alleged inaccuracies the administrator made about SpaceX during an unrelated hearing the day before, where he defended delays the FAA imposed on an upcoming SpaceX Starship launch. The FAA had licensed the launch for later in November, months after SpaceX's desired mid-September timeframe.

Whitaker said the delay had to do with permitting laws and an environmental analysis around sonic booms, which the launch could create when it attempts to return the rocket booster to earth -- a first for space flight. But SpaceX claimed the situation could have been fixed by a ""paperwork update"" instead of a two-month delay.

The dustup was the latest salvo in an escalating battle between Elon Musk and the FAA about launch dates and fines related to alleged SpaceX launch violations over unauthorized plans. Adding another layer to the spat: Musk could hypothetically become a regulator himself. Former President Donald Trump has floated the idea of tapping Musk to run a new committee on government efficiency, should he win a second term in November. The body would perform internal performance and financial audits on the federal government. The possibility should be taken with a grain of salt, but Musk, a Trump ally, has said he'd be interested in the role with ""no title, no pay.""

SpaceX's feud with the FAA may be core to Musk's interest in government efficiency. ""Unfortunately, we continue to be stuck in a reality where it takes longer to do the government paperwork to license a rocket launch than it does to design and build the actual hardware,"" the company wrote in a a 2,000-word blog post titled ""Starships Were Meant to Fly"" that slammed the FAA for the launch delay. ""This should never happen and directly threatens America's position as the leader in space.""

SpaceX and the FAA did not return requests for comment.

Big companies face off with regulators all the time. But Musk, with his megaphone of almost 200 million followers on X and his penchant for bluster, has been particularly pugilistic, with a steady stream of missives on X and letters to Congress over the last week. It's generally a bad idea to feud with regulators who ""could make life miserable,"" said Harry Kraemer, a professor of management and leadership at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. ""It's the last thing a company really ought to be doing. You're asking for a headache,"" said Kraemer. Musk persists, he added, because of his ""ego."" ""He doesn't think the rules apply to him.""

The FAA, created in 1958, sits within the Department of Transportation, and regulates civil aviation in the U.S. Its duties include air traffic control, flight inspection standards and drone regulation. The agency undertook regulating space travel in 1995 when the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, established in 1984, was transferred into the FAA as the agency's only space-related entity.

""We don't need another bully like Boeing. It's time for the FAA to do its job.""

Along with SpaceX, other players in the commercial space industry have questioned the FAA's ability to keep up as the sector has grown. In October, Blue Origin, the rocket company established by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, called out lagging operations at the agency during a hearing with the Senate Subcommittee on Space and Science. ""Congress and the FAA helped accelerate the development of the commercial space launch industry, and now the FAA is struggling to scale with the cadence of operation,"" Phil Joyce, a senior vice president at the company, said during testimony. ""Streamlining regulations and administrative processes and exploring the possibility for increased training opportunities will help utilize resources more efficiently.""

Meanwhile, Musk is warring with the FAA on another front as well. Two weeks ago, the agency announced proposed fines for SpaceX, worth more than $630,000, related to unapproved plans used during two rocket launches last year. The first incident, from last May at Florida's Cape Canaveral, was over a revised communications plan, in which SpaceX added an unauthorized new launch control room and removed a readiness poll from its procedures. Two months later, SpaceX used an unapproved rocket propellant facility as its fuel supplier at a launch at the Kennedy Space Center, the FAA alleged.

In response to the citations, Musk took to X to threaten legal action against the FAA for ""regulatory overreach,"" calling the move ""lawfare.""

Musk's accusations contrast from past criticism of the agency, which has been called out for lax regulation of the aircraft industry. Last week, a Senate subcommittee faulted the FAA's oversight in part for a door panel blowing out on a Boeing jet during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, raising questions about the agency's safety review. The FAA seems to be taking a different tack with SpaceX, which is a welcome change, Jim Hall, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told Forbes.

""We don't need another bully like Boeing,"" he said. ""It's time for the FAA to do its job. It hasn't in the past, particularly as it has pertained to Boeing.""

A day after the FAA levied the proposed fines, the company sent a letter to the heads of both Senate and House committees overseeing commercial space regulation, aiming to rebut each penalty. When SpaceX posted the letter on X, the company noted that it has been voicing concerns against the FAA for nearly two years for its ""inability to keep pace with the commercial spaceflight industry.""

""The Commerce Committee has received SpaceX's letter responding to the allegations levied by the FAA in its civil penalty notices and will evaluate whether federal agencies are appropriately structured and resourced to facilitate commercial space travel,"" a spokesperson for Sen. Ted Cruz, ranking member of the Senate committee, told Forbes in a statement. He added that Cruz would advocate for policies to ""minimize unnecessary bureaucratic interference and delays"" regardless of this particular dispute.

The Democratic staff of the House science committee declined to comment. The offices of Sen. Maria Cantwell, Rep. Zoe Lofgren and Rep. Frank Lucas -- who also head those committees -- did not return requests for comment.

Now, Musk is seeking to move the issue out of the realm of policy wonks. The billionaire, who has increasingly moved to the political right over the last few years, earlier this month bashed Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential run on X. One reason? He has argued government bureaucracy under Harris would impede SpaceX's lofty mission making humans an interplanetary species. ""This would destroy the Mars program and doom humanity,"" he wrote. ""This is a fork, maybe the fork, in the road of human destiny.""

Later in the week, SpaceX was back to putting out its normal promo on X, posting stunning photos of its Flight 5 Starship at sunset. Musk quote-posted it with an apparent typo in his caption: ""Starships were mean to fly."""
Tale Of The Tape: How The Finances Of JD Vance And Tim Walz Stack Up,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylemullins/2024/10/01/tale-of-the-tape-how-the-finances-of-jd-vance-and-tim-walz-stack-up/,2024-10-01T10:37:53Z,"There's no debate that JD Vance is richer than Tim Walz. But here's the breakdown on how the two vice presidential candidates, who face off tonight, compare financially.

ice presidents are usually tapped to consolidate the party, carry the presidential candidate's message or appeal to some key constituency. In other words, they're not usually selected for the money they bring to the campaign (RFK Jr's pick of Nicole Shanahan notwithstanding). Still, there's a lot to learn about a candidate from how they much money they've made and how they've made it.

Both Vance and Walz grew up in working class families in the Midwest, joined the military as teenagers and later went on to get social science degrees from state schools. But their career choices afterwards caused their paths to diverge. Vance went to Yale Law School, wrote a bestselling book -- ""Hillbilly Elegy"" -- about his rough-and-tumble upbringing and became a venture capital investor, which helped him rake in millions. Then he won a Senate seat in 2022 and, at age 39, was picked as Donald Trump's running mate. Walz, on the other hand, became a public school teacher, retired from the military and ran for Congress in the wake of the Iraq War that Vance had fought in. He next became governor of Minnesota, winning a second term before Kamala Harris tapped him as her second. Today, he's virtually swimming in pensions -- but not much else in the way of assets.

There is no doubt that Vance is vastly richer than Walz. But as the duo get ready for their debate tonight in Manhattan, here's a head-to-head comparison of how the two vice presidential candidates stack up financially, based on Forbes estimates and reporting.

Both Vance and Walz are less wealthy than their potential future bosses: Donald Trump is worth $3.9 billion -- landing him back on the Forbes 400 list of America's wealthiest people this year -- and Kamala Harris has a net worth of $7 million.

While Walz is about the same age as his running mate, who turns 60 on October 20, Vance has seen just over half of Donald Trump's 78 years. If elected, Trump and Vance would have the largest age gap between president and vice president in history by nearly a decade, according to the Pew Research Center.

Vance owns three homes in Ohio, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Only one, the D.C. home, has any record of debt on it today. Walz, on the other hand, sold his longtime Mankato residence in 2019 when he became governor, paid off his mortgage and moved into the state's executive mansion, owned by Minnesota taxpayers.

Walz and his wife, Gwen, as longtime public sector employees, have at least four pensions that make up virtually their entire net worth. The most valuable is almost certainly Tim's federal pension, which Forbes estimates is worth north of $475,000 thanks to the combination of his congressional and military service. Vance, after a career largely in the private sector, also has a federal pension, but it's worth much less because he's been in elected office for less than two years.

Most of Vance's net worth comes from his investments from his time as a venture capitalist. Not long after law school, he moved out to California and joined Mithril, a firm founded by Paypal billionaire Peter Thiel (who later bankrolled Vance's Senate run). Just a few years later, though, Vance moved back to Ohio, helping AOL billionaire Steve Case invest in middle America before starting his own firm, Narya (a name, like Mithril, sourced from ""Lord of the Rings""). Today, he still has some stakes in his old employers' portfolios, stock market and gold ETFs and even over $100,000 in Bitcoin. Walz, on the other hand, doesn't appear to have much in the markets, other than a 401(k)-style retirement account as governor.

Both men would get a raise if they're elected to the vice presidency -- the commander-in-chief's second-in-command gets paid about $235,000 annually. Walz's salary as governor is the 14th lowest in the country, according to the Council of State Governments. (The governor of Maine makes only $70,000, the lowest of any state).

In addition to his Senatorial salary, Vance reported a minimum of $150,000 in investment and other income in 2023. This includes income from selling his partnership interest in his venture capital firm, Narya, for between $100,000 and $1,000,000. His wife, Usha, earned a salary from D.C. law firm Munger Tolles & Olsen, but was not required to disclose the amount; she left the firm following JD's selection as VP. The Walzes, meanwhile, earned $135,000 in pension income, $50,000 from Gwen's part-time job at Augsburg University in Minneapolis and Tim's gubernatorial salary, according to their 2023 tax returns.

In Congress, the Minnesotan cut a moderate figure as a Democrat from a rural district, picking up endorsements from conservative groups like the National Rifle Association and liberal ones like the League of Conservation Voters.

Vance's memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy"" made him a nationally-known figure, winning him respect -- and interview requests -- from the media and business elites he now frequently rails against. It sold 1.6 million copies in print, according to data from Circana Bookscan, an industry tracking service.

Both men met their wives at schools -- the Walzes both taught at the same Nebraska public school, whereas the Vances met as students at Yale Law School. The Walzes have two children; the Vances have three."
"How This Immigrant Billionaire Outmaneuvered Boeing To Build America's Next ""Doomsday"" Nuclear Planes",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicahunter-hart/2024/09/30/how-this-immigrant-billionaire-eren-ozmen-snc-outmaneuvered-boeing-to-build-americas-next-doomsday-nuclear-planes/,2024-10-01T10:37:35Z,"Eren Ozmen's Sierra Nevada Corp. fought for years to land the $13 billion contract to build the next nuclear-ready Doomsday planes. Now the billionaire's reputation -- and her firm's finances -- hinge on whether she can pull off the most difficult maneuver in aerospace: executing a complex, top-secret government project on time and on budget.

ierra Nevada Corp.'s chairwoman and co-owner, Eren Ozmen, grins as she dances alone to the pop-funk beat blaring from the ballroom stage of the Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel. Clapping her hands in front of a 19-foot LED screen to kick off Sierra Nevada's annual ""Leadership Forum,"" Ozmen encourages the 300 or so employees in the audience to get up and move on this early April morning.

The song -- ""Happy,"" by Pharrell Williams -- matches her mood: Ozmen is almost certain that the aerospace-defense company she bought with her husband, Fatih, back in 1994 will win the U.S. Air Force's prestigious contract to develop the next Doomsday planes. These are the hardened airborne command posts reserved for top military and political brass in case of nuclear war or other catastrophes, like an asteroid strike.

Sure enough, SNC lands the deal 22 days later, on April 26. Next year's song? ""I'm thinking 'We Are the Champions,' "" Ozmen says.

The contract is worth $13.1 billion over 12 years and is a game-changer for privately held SNC, which booked just $2 billion in revenue last year. For the longest time, the company, which is based outside Reno in Sparks, Nevada, has been firmly entrenched in the middle tier of the aerospace-defense industry, miles away from the industry's five giants, including Lockheed Martin (revenue: $67.6 billion) and Northrop Grumman ($39.3 billion). Boeing, nearly 40 times as big as SNC at $77.8 billion in sales, was considered a shoo-in for the contract because it designed the four current E-4B -- a.k.a. ""Doomsday"" -- planes back in the 1970s. It has had contracts to maintain them ever since -- worth some $150 million per year -- and its four-engine 747-8 jumbo jets were considered the best models to accommodate the next generation. Whoever won the contract would be retrofitting up to eight used Boeing jets. SNC's victory was a bit of a surprise. ""You would have looked at this and said, 'Well, yeah, that'll go to Boeing,' "" says American Enterprise Institute defense analyst Todd Harrison.

""Taking smart risks is very important,"" says Ozmen, who transformed SNC into the country's biggest female-owned defense contractor by doing just that. ""That is a big part of being an entrepreneur. Without that, really, you're just following what's happening -- you're not leading.""

The Survivable Airborne Operations Center contract, as the Doomsday project is called, is a mountain of technical and management challenges. To grab it from Boeing, the Ozmens had to agree to do a minority of the project at a fixed price, bearing cost overruns themselves. That could prove difficult for the ambitious company. After all, the same sort of provision created a $2 billion (and growing) hole in Boeing's balance sheet for the much-delayed next generation of Air Force One presidential planes. One positive: Unlike that contract, SNC's fixed pricing structure will be limited to the production phase, meaning it likely won't have to eat unexpected costs during the more uncertain design stage.

""The incumbent"" -- read: Boeing, the only other company to bid on the project -- ""was not so interested in applying innovation, reducing costs or reducing schedule,"" Ozmen says. ""We are becoming known as a destructive innovator. I think that got us the contract.""

SNC benefited from a bit of lucky timing, too. In addition to its well-publicized problems with its commercial 737s, Boeing is saddled with a swarm of defense contracts that have turned into money pits. In short, the Arlington, Virginia-headquartered giant wasn't in any mood to bid aggressively, and it got eliminated last fall after submitting an offer that ignored the Air Force's tough terms, including giving up valuable intellectual property rights.

""If you lose a contract that you were going to lose money on, you actually win,"" says Nicolas Owens, a Morningstar aerospace analyst, discussing Boeing's move. ""If I get really good at making four Doomsday planes for the Air Force, what does that qualify me to do? Maybe make four more, but that's it. No one else is buying these things. It's not like Jeff Bezos gets one too -- I promise.""

But the Doomsday project will elevate the profile and help define the legacy of Ozmen and her husband, both 66, who own 87% of SNC (Eren has a slightly higher stake) and are worth a combined $7.8 billion. At best, it could jump-start a climb toward the aerospace major leagues. At worst, it could end up as a costly catastrophe that sets their growth plans back years.

Just before the pandemic, Fatih, who as CEO focuses on strategy and growth (Eren, who is also president, oversees governance and finances), decided it was time to compete for programs that typically go to ""tier one"" aerospace-defense companies. ""I challenged my executive leadership to think about how we could double the size of SNC in five years,"" Fatih says. The team set their sights on the Doomsday contract. The Ozmens began chatting with the Air Force about the project in early 2020, then started investing money. Lots of it. They spent $175 million (and counting) to modernize SNC's digital infrastructure, with a focus on AI and digital modeling. Then, before they won the contract, they spent over $100 million building a 747-sized hangar near an Air Force base in Dayton, Ohio. It's nice not to have to answer to public shareholders.

By William Baldwin

William Baldwin is Forbes' Investment Strategies columnist.

The Ozmens are no strangers to tricky aircraft modification. The couple, now U.S. citizens, were born in Turkey, met in Ankara and were graduate students together at the University of Nevada at Reno. Eren paid tuition in part by cleaning offi­ces at SNC, at the time a small defense outfit with fewer than 20 employees. She and Fatih took jobs there as a financial reporting manager and engineering intern, respectively, in the 1980s. After watching the company barely survive a series of financial crises, they decided to borrow against their home and purchase the business for less than $5 million in 1994.

SNC specializes in integrating existing aircraft with new technologies but is better known for its space affiliate, Sierra Space, which the Ozmens spun off in 2021. Sierra is developing its own space plane, the Dream Chaser, set to launch next year, and is working with Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin on an enormously ambitious plan for a space station to replace the $150 billion ISS, widely considered the most expensive man-made object ever built. Sierra Space has raised $1.7 billion from investors, most recently in September 2023 at a $5.3 billion valuation.

The four E-4B Doomsday planes are designed to provide ""constant, unbroken survival communications,"" says Col. David Leaumont, who commands the fleet, which also regularly transports the secretary of defense. ""We do it all the time. It's not just on bad days."" The planes' 40-plus distinct communications systems are built to withstand the electromagnetic pulse that would instantly fry nearby electronics in the event of a nuclear attack. These planes, which have been flying for 50 years, cost $140,000 per hour to operate, can hold up to 111 people each, have conference rooms and battle stations and can be airborne with just a few minutes' notice -- but they are approaching the end of their useful life. SNC is tasked with getting the next generation flying by 2036.

Boeing still owns the design data for the original plane, meaning SNC will have to play nice, and likely pay its bigger rival to consult on issues such as metal fatigue or the safest way to reattach a part. (SNC expects minimal contact with Boeing's intellectual property due to its scanning technology that will create a ""digital twin"" of the plane.) And SNC will never see this sort of revenue stream itself. As part of the deal, it has agreed not to retain any of the IP from the project. Instead, the Air Force will own it, meaning it could easily choose a new contractor to maintain or upgrade the systems in the future. This ""open systems"" approach is unusual in the highly consolidated defense sector, where firms often hold onto IP to compel the government to hire them for decades of lucrative maintenance and consulting work.

""This is how industry evolves,"" says Loren Thompson, a longtime aerospace analyst. ""There's a new player that operates in nontraditional ways and is willing to take a chance. And there's an old player that balks at having to match the terms the newcomer is offering.""

Given that this is SNC's largest-ever contract, Ozmen says the Air Force will provide extensive guidance: ""They understand that this is the first time SNC will be doing something like this. They want us to succeed."" SNC will also have help from experienced subcontractors such as Lockheed and General Electric. And it has decades of practice with classified and bespoke aircraft modification projects. Says Morningstar's Owens, ""It might actually be a perfect fit for them.""

SNC has already hit a few early program milestones, including constructing the second of at least four 90,000-square-foot hangars in Dayton and flying the first of the five used 747-8s it purchased from Korea Airlines for $675 million to the new facilities. The four other planes are still airborne, hauling on daily flights between Seoul and Atlanta, for instance, passengers who are utterly unaware they're aboard a plane that could one day direct a U.S. nuclear response.

If all goes well, SNC is hoping this big-name contract will help it amass a legion of others, including the Navy's version of the Doomsday plane, to be announced in January, for which it's competing against Northrop Grumman. It's already winning some notable contracts, including a $1 billion pact to develop long-range spy planes for the Army. The goal is to hit $4 billion in revenue by 2025 and triple its size by 2030.

""Once you prove that you can execute a program this size, you're going to get 10 more,"" Ozmen says. ""It's not gonna be business as usual for us.""

Adds Cai Von Rumohr, an aerospace analyst at TD Cowen: ""They clearly have moved up the food chain.""

Listicle

A Gulfstream is much too small for the U.S. military's Doomsday planes. Those are going to be converted 747-8s, big enough to seat more than 400 passengers. But the secretary of defense isn't the only one who has upgraded to a whole lot more legroom. Here are a few celebrities and billionaires who fly private on their own commercial airliners.

The Grease star is licensed to fly at least nine jets, including the 707, considered the first successful commercial jetliner. Travolta picked up his in 1998 and flew it around the world as an ambassador for Qantas Airlines. He donated it to Australia's HARS Aviation Museum in 2017.

Trump bought his ""Trump Force One"" plane from the late Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen in 2010, then Trumpified it with gold seat belt buckles, Trump family crests and a 57-inch flatscreen preloaded with 1,000 of his favorite films (3:10 to Yuma, An Affair to Remember, Air Bud).

The Saudi royal investor has a jet fit for a king (er, prince). His ride is tricked out with oversized conference tables, enough seating for an entourage of courtiers and a golden throne (really). He has been known to fly the Al Hilal Saudi Football Club around on the airborne palace, too."
"The Next U.S. President Won't Define Crypto's Future, Congress Will",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2024/10/01/the-next-us-president-wont-define-cryptos-future-congress-will/,2024-10-01T10:03:54Z,"The national conversation around cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and U.S. innovation leadership has centered on the White House this election cycle. Presidential candidates Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have both made notable shifts regarding this emerging industry of financial technology. Harris has pivoted from President Biden's antagonistic approach, led by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and prudential regulators, to a more pro-innovation tone focused on blockchain and digital assets. These technologies, she claims, are crucial to her ""Opportunity Economy,"" aimed at empowering middle-class families and small businesses.

Meanwhile, Trump, who once called bitcoin a ""scam,"" now vows to make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and pledges to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler (the head of an independent agency who can only be removed for cause) on his first day in office. Although these promises grab attention, the reality is that the President's influence over the future of digital assets is limited. It is Congress that holds the real power to shape the regulatory framework for crypto.

Congress Holds The Real Power

Congress, as the first branch of government, holds the key to determining the future of digital assets in the U.S. While presidential candidates may dominate headlines, under Article II of the Constitution, the President's powers are limited. The President cannot unilaterally enact laws or overhaul regulations for digital assets; their role is primarily to enforce the laws passed by Congress and oversee regulatory agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

Executive orders, while impactful, are not laws and can be undone by future administrations. For long-term stability in the digital asset industry, Congress must pass legislation. Yet, much of the public and crypto advocates tend to focus on presidential races, overlooking Congress's critical role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation.

The ""Do-Nothing"" Congress And Regulatory Bottlenecks

The current Congress has been criticized for inaction, having passed fewer than 230 bills into law during the 2023-2024 term, well below prior legislative sessions. This delay has hindered the development of a modern legal framework for digital finance, leaving regulatory agencies like the SEC to rely on outdated laws from the 1930s, ill-suited for today's digital asset landscape.

Without clear legislation, these agencies continue to enforce old frameworks, leading to regulatory confusion, inconsistent enforcement, and stifled innovation. Democratic and Republican leaders have pledged to change this, with support from figures like House Leader Mike Johnson. However, without decisive action, the U.S. risks falling behind in global digital asset innovation.

Congress's Crucial Role In Shaping Crypto Policy

Congress holds the unique authority to craft laws that reflect the country's evolving needs, particularly in emerging sectors like blockchain and digital assets. The SEC operates under laws such as the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 -- long before the internet or digital currencies existed. Applying these outdated laws to digital assets has led to friction and uncertainty, as many assets -- often dynamic in nature -- do not fit neatly into existing categories and twentieth century legal frameworks.

Agencies like the SEC and CFTC are forced to apply outdated laws in ways that extend beyond their original intent, leading to concerns of regulatory overreach. A recent federal court ruling highlighted this issue, finding that the SEC acted arbitrarily and capriciously in its denials of bitcoin exchange-traded funds. This kind of regulatory overreach hampers innovation, creating uncertainty around compliance and making it challenging for startups to succeed. Industry leaders continue to call for clear rules of the road from the SEC. However, executive agencies get their rulemaking and enforcement powers from Congress. Accordingly, the clearest rules will come from Congress.

The FIT21 Act and Securities Clarity Act

A significant step in this direction occurred with the passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which included Representative Tom Emmer's Securities Clarity Act. This act aims to provide much-needed legal clarity for the digital asset industry by distinguishing between an asset and the securities contract it may be part of. As Emmer stated, ""This is an important opportunity for the United States to lead... The FIT21 Act will give entrepreneurs the clarity and assurance they need to build here, in the United States.""

Before the FIT21 Act, one of the biggest regulatory hurdles for digital assets was the confusion over how they were classified under existing securities laws. Many cryptocurrencies start as part of a securities contract but may evolve into something else once a project becomes fully decentralized. The Securities Clarity Act, now Title II of the FIT21 Act, addresses this by providing the flexibility for a digital asset project to transition from centralization (controlled by developers or investors) to decentralization, where it operates independently.

Emmer emphasized this point during his remarks on the House floor, saying, ""Among the many important provisions in this bill is my Securities Clarity Act... which provides the legal flexibility for a digital asset project to transition from centralization to decentralization. This transition is critical to the future peer-to-peer digital economy.""

This legislative clarity is crucial for allowing digital asset projects to grow without unnecessary regulatory hurdles. By passing FIT21, Congress aims to keep U.S. innovation onshore and ensure the country remains competitive in the global digital economy.

The Limits Of Leaving It To The Executive Branch

While Congress often delegates authority to executive agencies, this does not give those agencies free rein. Agencies like the SEC are tasked with executing the laws passed by Congress, not creating new laws through regulation. When Congress fails to act however, as it has with respect to the crypto asset industry, agencies like the SEC are left to make judgment calls, leading to inconsistent enforcement that chills innovation.

The SEC's approach of enforcing regulations on a case-by-case basis, without setting clear industry-wide guidelines, has been particularly problematic for digital asset companies. Ongoing legal battles over the classification of certain tokens as securities have cast a chilling effect on the industry. The absence of comprehensive legislation has left both regulators and businesses in a state of uncertainty. Even agency heads disagree on the best approach. While Gensler criticized FIT21, CFTC Chair Rostin Benham commented that with successful passage of the bill, he was ""confident"" his agency could build a regulatory framework within 12 months.

Congress must have the last word and settle these issues by passing comprehensive legislation, such as FIT21, that provides clear guidance to both agencies and businesses.

Shifting Congressional Attitudes Toward Crypto

Key members of Congress are increasingly supporting digital asset innovation. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), once a critic, now acknowledges the importance of engaging with technologies like AI and crypto, stating, ""We've got to move forward with AI, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency... we have to learn more.""

At the recent Crypto4Harris town hall, aimed at strengthening ties between Harris's campaign and the crypto industry, several pro-crypto lawmakers voiced their support. Rep. Wiley Nickel (D-NC) called for Harris to adopt a more pro-crypto stance, while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) expressed optimism about passing bipartisan crypto legislation, stating, ""Crypto is here to stay no matter what. So, Congress must get it right.""

Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) also demonstrated support, signaling growing bipartisan backing for a regulatory framework that balances innovation with consumer protection.

Industry leaders echo these sentiments. Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, emphasized the importance of bipartisan efforts, noting that many in Congress already understand how critical digital assets are to the U.S.'s financial future. Will Schweitzer, co-organizer of Crypto4Harris, added, ""Bipartisan Congressional support for Digital Asset legislation continues to gain momentum.""

The StandWithCrypto.com database shows over 50 Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-PA), and Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), are now somewhat or strongly supportive of pro-crypto legislation. This growing base of support suggests that Congress is ready to proceed with bipartisan long-term regulatory changes in the digital asset space.

Why Congress Must Lead on Crypto

To keep the U.S. at the forefront of blockchain technology, Congress must prioritize policies that foster innovation. This goes beyond regulatory reform that tinkers at the edges -- it requires a fundamental shift in how emerging technologies are approached.

Unlike the Executive branch, Congress holds the power to create laws specifically tailored to the needs of the crypto industry. By collaborating with stakeholders, experts, retail investors, and innovators, lawmakers can design frameworks that foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection.

As G. Clay Miller of Penrose Partners noted, ""We will have a pro-crypto President no matter who wins in November, but the real work begins in January."" The future of digital assets in the U.S. depends on the legislative framework Congress creates, as only Congress can provide the long-term stability the industry needs.

Now is the time to focus where the real power lies -- on Congress."
How Donald Trump Climbed Back Onto The Forbes 400,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2024/10/01/how-donald-trump-climbed-back-onto-the-forbes-400/,2024-10-01T10:03:54Z,"The former president transformed his fortune, converting a real-estate empire into a political profit machine.

onald Trump returns to The Forbes 400 list of America's richest people this year, after selling his political supporters all sorts of nonsense -- virtual trading cards, coffee table books, cut-up clothing and, most importantly, shares of a money-losing startup. His roughly 60% stake in Trump Media and Technology Group, parent company to Twitter clone Truth Social, added an estimated $2.1 billion to Trump's net worth from September 2023 to September 1, 2024, the date Forbes used for its annual ranking. That lifted the former president's net worth to $4.3 billion, enough to make him the 319th-richest person in the country.

Parts of Trump's real estate business make good money, too. Mar-a-Lago generated an estimated operating profit of $23 million in 2023, roughly three times as much as it earned when Trump was in office, boosting the value of the club 15% in the last year to an estimated $375 million. Trump's golf business is also booming, in part thanks to an industry-wide Covid-bump. Operating profits at Trump's 10 traditional U.S. golf clubs hit an estimated $48 million in 2023, almost three times their pre-pandemic level, juicing the value of his properties by about $100 million over the last year. Trump National Doral, a golf resort in Miami, now generates an estimated $25 million of operating profit, which appears to be roughly 85% of the income that comes from Trump's five wholly owned hotels.

Another bright spot: Fifth Avenue, where the president lived before decamping for the White House. The retail corridor struggled in recent years, as shoppers increasingly moved online, especially during the pandemic. The Trump Organization lost longtime tenant Nike at 6 East 57 Street early in Trump's presidency, then slashed an estimated $7 million off Gucci's rent in Trump Tower around the beginning of the pandemic. Neighboring properties have sold for big money recently, though, providing some optimism for the neighborhood and lifting the projected value of Trump Tower and 6 East 57 Street by an a combined $57 million over the last year.

Challenges remain. In Lower Manhattan, 40 Wall Street languishes, with tenants vacating the office tower and profits falling. The property no longer earns enough money to cover its debt expenses, according to an analysis of documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Then there are Trump's liabilities. He tried to whittle down his debt, taking care of a $45 million Deutsche Bank loan in Chicago last October, then wiping out a larger loan against the same property two months later. This spring, Trump paid off a $12 million loan against Trump Plaza in New York City. But none of that makes up for Trump's new legal liabilities, which add up to an estimated $566 million. While Trump appeals three rulings -- from a fraud case and two libel suits -- interest continues to accrue at about $4 million per month.

Trump holds an estimated $413 million in cash, more than he typically stores on his balance sheet but not enough to take care of his legal troubles. He could access more liquidity by ditching his social-media shares, newly freed from lockup provisions. The former president claims he won't sell -- ""I don't need money,"" he says, ignoring the half billion in legal liabilities.

Obsessed with The Forbes 400 since its incarnation four decades ago, Trump has struggled to stay on the list since his presidency ended. He fell off for the first time in a quarter century in 2021, with Covid-19 still affecting his empire, dragging his estimated net worth down to $2.5 billion, $400 million short of the cutoff. He reclaimed a spot in 2022, with a $3.2 billion fortune, after investors went wild over his plan to launch Truth Social.

But business didn't go as Trump hoped, and he fell off the list again in 2023, having attracted roughly 6.5 million users, less than one-tenth his followers on Twitter. Further complicating things: the special purpose acquisition company that planned to merge with Trump's business got tangled in a web of investigations, leaving it unclear whether Trump's company would ever reach the public market. The estimated value of Trump's stake fell from $730 million in 2022 to about $100 million in 2023, dragging Trump's net worth down to $2.6 billion -- $300 million less than he needed to make the list that year.

Things took a huge turn again this spring. The SPAC paid an $18 million fine as part of an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission and -- at long last -- took the Trump Media and Technology Group public. Shares soared, at one point lifting Trump's net worth above $8 billion. The stock later plunged, losing more than half of its value. But Trump, who invested next to nothing in the venture, is still way ahead, and back on The Forbes 400 with an estimated $4.3 billion fortune.

Will he stay on the list in 2025? That question may depend on what Trump decides to do with his shares in Truth Social's parent company. The Trump Media and Technology Group generated just $3.4 million in sales over the 12 months ending in June and lost $380 million. But investors still think it's worth billions of dollars -- for now. The stock has declined 18% since Forbes locked in its ranking a month ago, dropping the former president's net worth from an estimated $4.3 billion on Sept. 1 to $3.9 billion as of Oct. 1, still enough to qualify for this year's list. But Trump's fortune could fall further if he loses the 2024 presidential race -- and, therefore, much of his relevance.

Then again, Trump could just cash out, reneging on his word and, in doing so, perhaps cementing a windfall large enough to solidify his position on The Forbes 400 for years to come."
The 2024 Forbes 400 List Of Wealthiest Americans: Facts And Figures,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2024/10/01/the-2024-forbes-400-list-of-wealthiest-americans-facts-and-figures/,2024-10-01T10:03:24Z,"Inside Forbes' ranking of the richest billionaires in the United States.

Forbes calculated fortunes using stock prices from September 1, 2024.

's a record-smashing year for America's 400 richest people. After adding nearly $1 trillion to their fortunes over the past 12 months, The Forbes 400 are worth a collective $5.4 trillion, by far the most ever. It now takes a record $3.3 billion to make the list, up from $2.9 billion in 2023.

In general, the richer you were, the richer you got. Just 25 people -- a dozen of them worth $100 billion or more -- are responsible for $500 billion of the gains. These top 25 now holds more than $2.5 trillion in wealth, nearly half the list's total net worth.

The richest person in America, for the third straight year, is Elon Musk, who is worth an estimated $244 billion. Despite dropping $7 billion in wealth over the past year amid sputtering Tesla stock and an ongoing battle over his $56 billion stock options package, Musk remains some $47 billion ahead of No. 2 Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, who is worth an estimated $197 billion. Mark Zuckerberg (estimated net worth: $181 billion) climbed from No. 8 last year to No. 3 in 2024 thanks to the huge rebound in shares of Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.

Alice Walton continues her reign as the richest woman in the U.S., her ninth time in a decade. With shares of Walmart, which her father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962, up by 41% in the past year, she's worth an estimated $89.2 billion, good for No. 15 overall. Walton is one of just 67 women on The Forbes 400, up from 60 last year.

As a group, the list's women are worth a combined $839 billion, compared to $621 billion in 2023. Diane Hendricks ($21.9 billion) remains the wealthiest self-made woman in America, one of a record 13 women on the list who built -- rather than inherited -- their fortune.

Overall, 67% of The Forbes 400 is self-made, meaning they founded their own company or helped build one, though some traveled much longer and tougher paths to great wealth than others. Forbes once again assigned everyone on the list a self-made score, from 1 to 10, with 10 being the true rags-to-riches stories. Those remain rare -- just 25 out of the 400.

Despite it requiring more money than ever to make the list, 23 billionaires were able to elbow their way into the ranks this year. These newcomers include Todd Graves ($9.5 billion), who created the Raising Cane's fast food chain; Peter Cancro ($5.6 billion), who built and runs Jersey Mike's Subs; Jayshree Ullal ($4.4 billion), the CEO of cloud networking firm Arista Networks; Leonid Radvinsky ($3.8 billion), the owner of OnlyFans; and Alex Karp ($3.6 billion), the cofounder and CEO of data mining company Palantir.

Another 11 people who fell off a previous Forbes 400 list returned to the ranks this year. The most notable: Donald Trump ($4.3 billion), who has ridden the volatile stock price of Truth Social parent-company Trump Media & Technology Group back onto the list, part of a broader ploy to wring billions in wealth out of his political career.

These newcomers and returnees displaced several less-fortunate billionaires who lost their spot among the nation's richest people. Among this year's 30 drop-offs: Vince McMahon ($2.5 billion), who stepped down as executive chairman of WWE-parent company TKO Holdings in January amid sexual assault allegations, which he has denied. Aneel Bhusri ($3.2 billion) of software firm Workday, meanwhile, is one of ten 2023 400 members who got richer over the past year but were displaced by better-performing billionaires.

They join a growing list of American billionaires who are simply too poor to make the cut. For the first time ever, there are more American billionaires not on The Forbes 400 than there are on it: 415 and counting. That includes plenty of famous faces. Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1 billion) is not rich enough for this list. Neither are Jerry Seinfeld ($1.1 billion), Bruce Springsteen ($1.1 billion), Taylor Swift ($1.3 billion) or Oprah Winfrey ($3 billion).

The youngest member of the ranks is Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who is 38 years old and worth an estimated $33.9 billion. Venture capitalist and real estate mogul Josh Kushner ($3.8 billion), 39, is the only other listee under the age of 40. On average, the members of the 2024 Forbes 400 are 70 years old. The eldest is Dole Food Company's David Murdock ($3.7 billion), who is 101.

The richest Americans' net worths have skyrocketed, but their generosity has not. Forbes once again investigated the lifetime charitable giving of every member of the list. A third have donated less than 1% of their fortunes so far, earning a lowly 1 on the Forbes philanthropy score; only ten people -- 2.5% of the list -- have given away 20% of their riches or more, earning the highest mark, a 5."
The 2024 Forbes 400: The 25 Wealthiest People In America,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2024/10/01/the-2024-forbes-400-the-25-wealthiest-people-in-america/,2024-10-01T10:02:49Z,"was another great year to be rich, especially for the select few at the very top. With markets roaring, nearly all of the 25 wealthiest people in America got wealthier over the past 12 months -- some by billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars.

In all, the top 25 billionaires on The Forbes 400 list are worth a collective $2.5 trillion. They hold nearly half of the $5.4 trillion in total wealth of the entire 400.

This elite group is $471 billion richer than in 2023, with each of the top 25 up 31% on average, outpacing the 18% jump in wealth across list members overall and the S&P 500's 27% return.

Much of the gains come from two people: Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, who added $75 billion to his net worth thanks to rebounding Meta stock, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, who has ridden the AI wave to $63.3 billion in additional wealth since the 2023 ranking. They're two of a record 12 members of The Forbes 400 who are also in the $100 Billion Club, the lucky group of tycoons whose fortunes stretch a dozen digits.

Most of these 25 were among the top 25 last year, too. But there are three fresh faces: traders Jeff Yass (who ranked No. 28 in 2023) and Thomas Peterffy (who was No. 27), plus Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who jumped from No. 31 last year to No. 25 in 2024 on the back of the retailer's rising stock. They replace MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, who continues to give away her fortune; Miriam Adelson, whose shares of casino operator Las Vegas Sands have hit a cold streak; and investor Len Blavatnik, whose stock in Warner Music Group is worth less than a year ago. Zuckerberg jumped five spots, to No. 3; Huang jumped six, to No. 11.

Only three members of the top 25 got poorer over the past year: Elon Musk, whose fortune dropped by $7 billion but who remains the richest person in America; Bill Gates, after we increased our estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement with Melinda French Gates; and Phil Knight, following a rough run for Nike stock since last year.

Here are the top 25 members of the 2024 Forbes 400 list:

One of Sam Walton's eight grandchildren, he inherited an estimated 4% stake in Walmart from his father, John Walton, who died in a 2005 plane crash. Lukas, who survived childhood cancer, founded and runs Builders Vision, a sustainability-focused philanthropic and impact-investing platform that has doled out more than $3 billion since launching in 2021. He is one of just two Forbes 400 members under age 40 (the other: VC investor Josh Kushner, No. 347, who is 39). His mother, Christy Walton (No. 48), cosigned a letter urging President Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election in July and has been fundraising for Kamala Harris. Two members of the family's third generation still sit on Walmart's board: Jim's son Steuart Walton (Lukas' first cousin) and Rob's son-in-law Greg Penner, who is chairman.

""On the doorsteps of the Olympic Games,"" Knight wrote this summer in a letter to U.S. athletes, whose jerseys Nike designed, ""we need to reignite the passion, desire and the want to win."" His sportswear giant could use a pep talk, too. Nike stock is down 15% since last year, making Knight, who created the company with his University of Oregon track coach in 1964, one of just three in the Top 25 to be poorer than in 2023.

Peterffy is more than $10 billion richer than last year as shares of Interactive Brokers Group, the electronic trading firm he founded in 1993, rose 30%. The company booked $4.3 billion in revenue last year, a 42% year-over-year increase. Since he failed to persuade Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin to enter the Republican presidential primary race, Peterffy, a longtime supporter of free-market policies, has kept quiet on Trump's reelection bid.

Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel, the most profitable of all time, raked in $8.1 billion in trading profits last year. Since then, Griffin, never one to leave money idle, has donated $50 million to the University of Miami, dropped $45 million on a Stegosaurus skeleton (a record price in the dinosaur auction business) and shelled out more than $90 million for an estate in Saint-Tropez, France.

In August, Schwarzman and his wife announced plans to open their Miramar estate in Newport, Rhode Island, to the public as a museum upon their deaths. They spent $27 million on the Gilded Age mansion in 2021 and have been restoring it ever since. In May, Schwarzman, the cofounder and CEO of $1 trillion (assets) investment firm Blackstone, announced he's backing Trump for president, two years after vowing to support someone else in 2024.

In August, their Mars Inc. announced it's gobbling up snack and cereal maker Kellanova (formerly Kellogg's) for $35.9 billion. The deal will put brands like Pringles, Pop-Tarts and Froot Loops under the Mars umbrella alongside Snickers, M&M's and Kind bars. It's the company's biggest acquisition since it bought Wrigley in 2008 for $23 billion. The Mars siblings own an estimated two-thirds of the $50 billion (2023 revenue) business but have no role in daily operations.

Yass' fortune nearly doubled after Forbes revalued his trading firm, Susquehanna International Group -- and Yass' share of profits -- based on tax returns leaked to ProPublica. With a potential TikTok ban threatening Susquehanna's estimated 15% stake in the social media app, Yass has made nearly $70 million of federal political contributions during the 2024 election cycle, including $20.5 million to the Club for Growth Action, a conservative super PAC that has publicly opposed the TikTok ban (but denies having been influenced by Yass).

In June, Koch Industries became Koch, Inc., as Charles rebranded the increasingly tech-focused $125 billion (revenue) conglomerate for the first time since taking over the family firm after his father's 1967 death. Julia Koch, the widow of his brother David (d. 2019), and her three children paid nearly $700 million that same month for 15% of BSE Global, which owns the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and the WNBA's New York Liberty and operates the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

Rob Walton retired from Walmart's board in June after more than four decades as a director of the firm his father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962. He and his siblings' estimated 35% stake in the retail giant is worth more than ever as shoppers flock to Walmart's ""Every Day Low Price"" strategy to escape high inflation, driving both its revenue and shares to all-time highs. Jim still chairs the family's $26 billion (assets) Arvest Bank Group. Alice, the richest woman in America for the ninth time in 10 years, reclaimed the title of the world's wealthiest woman in early September from L'Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers of France for the first time since May 2022.

Dell scored his biggest payday ever in November, when semiconductor giant Broadcom acquired his cloud computing spinoff VMware; Dell swapped his 39% stake for an estimated $33 billion in cash and Broadcom shares. Around that time, he put $3.6 billion in cash and stock into his family's charitable foundation and pumped at least $500 million into a donor-advised fund. Dell's net worth is up 40% this year, thanks to 90% and 64% jumps in Broadcom and Dell Technologies share prices, respectively.

Huang keeps climbing into rarer air: He has added $63.3 billion to his fortune, pushing him up six more notches on The Forbes 400 (he jumped 31 spots last year), on the back of a 162% rise in Nvidia shares. As his wealth grows, so does his celebrity: Paparazzi followed his every move on a trip to his native Taiwan this summer -- a phenomenon termed ""Jensanity."" Huang cofounded Nvidia, which designs and sells more chips used for artificial intelligence systems than any other company, in 1993 and has served as CEO and president since.

The former mayor of New York City and cofounder of financial-data and media firm Bloomberg LP was awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by President Biden in May. Over the next three months, Bloomberg announced $1.6 billion of gifts to the medical schools of his alma mater, Johns Hopkins, and four historically Black colleges.

The Microsoft cofounder's rank is lower than it has been in 34 years, due mostly to a new Forbes estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement. In September, Netflix released a five-episode series called What's Next? The Future with Bill Gates, which tackles topics including AI and income inequality. In February 2025, he's set to publish a memoir, Source Code. TerraPower, the next-generation nuclear power company he cofounded in 2008, broke ground on a demonstration plant in Wyoming in June. That same month, his ex-wife, Melinda, resigned as co-chair of the couple's Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and walked away with $12.5 billion for her own philanthropy.

""Damn, I'm fired up!"" exclaimed Ballmer in August at the grand opening of his Los Angeles Clippers' new 18,000-seat Intuit Dome stadium, which boasts a 38,000-square-foot circular scoreboard. He bought the Clippers a decade ago for a then-record $2 billion after running Microsoft as CEO for 14 years, and spent $2 billion of his own money on the new stadium; Forbes now values the team at more than $4.6 billion.

Net worth: $136 billion | Source of wealth: Google | Age: 51

A federal judge ruled in August that Page and Brin's Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, which is responsible for 57% of parent company Alphabet's sales. (The tech giant reportedly plans to appeal.) Shares hit an all-time high in July thanks to Google's continued push into generative AI and cloud services, including a partnership with Oracle, before slipping in recent months.

More than seven decades in, the investing legend is staying plenty busy. In August, Berkshire Hathaway became America's first non-tech company to hit $1 trillion in market capitalization. In June, Buffett -- the nation's greatest philanthropist, with some $60 billion in lifetime giving -- donated $5.3 billion of Berkshire stock, with a twist: He clarified that the vast majority of his remaining fortune will go to a charitable trust run by his three children, instead of the Gates Foundation, as was previously assumed.

It was another banner year for the Oracle cofounder, chief technology officer and more than 40% shareholder, with the software firm's shares up 12% to record highs. He's spending accordingly: Ellison splashed out nearly $300 million on a Florida resort in August, adding to his $2 billion-plus real estate portfolio. He also plans to invest a reported $6 billion into the on-again-off-again merger between Paramount Global and Skydance, his son David's media production company.

No one got richer over the past year, in sheer dollar terms, than Zuck. He's $75 billion wealthier, and ranks five spots higher, following a 75% runup in Meta Platforms stock. Revenue has been growing more than 20% per quarter, and the social media giant repurchased $31 billion of its shares over the past year. Zuckerberg, who turned 40 in May, has taken on a new look, sporting a gold chain, letting his wavy hair grow out and ditching his uniform hoodie for a shearling jacket. He also surprised his wife, Priscilla, with a seven-foot-tall statue in her likeness.

Since last summer, Bezos has snapped up three homes on Miami's ""billionaire bunker"" island for $234 million. He has the cash: Since moving to tax-friendly Florida last November, the Amazon founder has offloaded more than $8 billion (pretax) of his shares; he still owns 9% of the e-commerce Leviathan, whose stock is up 29%. The Bezos Earth Fund, through which he has given $2 billion of a $10 billion pledge, will hand out up to $100 million to winners of an AI for Climate and Nature challenge beginning later this year.

Tesla's self-proclaimed ""technoking"" tops The Forbes 400 for the third straight year, despite losing $7 billion as shares of his electric vehicle maker fell 14% and a Delaware judge voided $56 billion of his stock options in January. In May, Musk's new AI startup, xAI, raised $6 billion at a $24 billion valuation. A month later, his rocket maker, SpaceX, launched a tender offer valuing the company at around $210 billion, up from nearly $180 billion. In an X post seen by 220 million, Musk endorsed Donald Trump within an hour of the assassination attempt on the former president. Trump now vows to name Musk to a new government efficiency commission if elected."
Vice Presidential Debate 2024 Walz-Vance Watch And Wager Odds And Props,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayginsbach/2024/10/01/vice-presidential-debate-2024-walz-vance-watch-and-wager-odds-and-props/,2024-10-01T09:03:19Z,"The gloves are off and the microphones are on Tuesday, Oct. 1 for the Vice Presidential debate. Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Democratic vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are set to spar starting at 9 p.m. ET from the CBS News network's studios in Philadelphia. Watch and wager action is available at select offshore betting sites like BetOnline.ag.

Wagering on this year's polarizing political cycle has become most popular among Americans. While it's unlikely the Vice Presidential debate will have much effect on online betting markets, the potential is there.

Political fans and bettors are unable to place bets in the U.S. on the presidential election with the top online sportsbooks. But select offshore betting sites continue to take bets, and Tuesday's vice presidential debate is drawing more watch and wager interest.

Political odds are subject to change and are updated in real-time by BetOnline for President.

Three weeks ago ahead of the Donald Trump-Kamala Harris Presidential debate on Sept. 10, Trump was a -125 favorite to become the next U.S. President following the Nov. 5 election. Harris gained steam after the debate and rose as high as a -135 favorite on Sept. 18. Since then and now ahead of the Oct. 1 Vice Presidential debate, Harris dropped back to -110 and is now back to a -125 favorite and Trump the underdog at +105.

Trump said Monday he would give a play by play on Truth Social of his reactions to the Vice Presidential debate, attacking Walz as ""inarticulate"" and calling Vance ""brilliant.""

There will be additional political races and odds to watch including the New York Mayor race.

BetOnline posted more than 50 prop bets for Tuesday's VP debate last week. All debate odds are subject to change and will be updated in real-time on BetOnline.

Debate Victor (According to CBS poll, YouGov or Ipsos)

How many false/misleading claims will be made? (According to CBS News Confirmed team)

How many non-facts/lies will be said by JD Vance? (According to WaPo)

How many non-facts/lies will be said by Tim Walz? (According to WaPo)

What will Walz say first in reference to Vance-Trump past?

Will either candidate say a curse word? (Damn not included)

Will JD Vance mention his book or movie?

First candidate to mispronounce politician's name

First candidate to say AI/Artificial Intelligence?

The consensus among voters last month was they want more policy and less political sparring. There will be no studio audience during the 90-minute VP debate, but expect some sparring and more bickering than bantering ahead of the 2 minute closing arguments."
From Climate Purist To Climate Pragmatist: The Case Of Kamala Harris,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/prakashdolsak/2024/09/30/from-climate-purist-to-climate-pragmatist-the-case-of-kamala-harris/,2024-10-01T03:25:01Z,"How should we assess whether a politician is pro-climate, anti-climate, or somewhere in between? We probably look at what they say and what they do. If so, we might be witnessing a climate policy convergence between Democrats and Republicans, much more than what is typically acknowledged. This means that some liberals are no longer climate purists and some conservatives are no longer climate skeptics. They are becoming climate pragmatists.

The rise of climate pragmatism is visible in different forms. Some liberals recognize the tension between decarbonization on the one hand and jobs, inflation, and energy security on the other. Consequently, they have softened the rhetoric on ending reliance on fossil fuels. At the same time, conservatives recognize the inevitable shift away from fossil fuels because solar and wind are economically competitive. Seeing the writing on the wall, they are supporting climate-friendly industries.

While climate pragmatism might reflect political opportunism, we view it as a positive development that negates ""litmus test politics,"" and facilitates policy progress. Kamala Harris of 2024, in a sharp deviation from Kamala Harris of 2016-20, epitomizes the emerging climate pragmatism.

Kamala Harris' Evolving Climate Positions

In 2016, California's Attorney General Kamala Harris sued the Obama administration over permitting hydraulic fracturing. In 2019, Senator Harris co-sponsored the Green New Deal resolution. In the 2020 Presidential primaries, Candidate Harris said, ""I'm committed to passing a Green New Deal, creating clean jobs and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all.""

Fast forward to September 2024. In the TV debate with Trump, she supported fracking and even took credit for the largest increase in oil production in history: ""I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States. And, in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking ... We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history...""

Now consider another policy issue: Electric Vehicles (EVs.) In 2019, Senator Harris co-sponsored the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act, which required ""the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a zero-emission passenger vehicle standard. Specifically, the bill sets a schedule for increasing the percentage of zero-emission vehicles a manufacturer delivers for sale, culminating in a requirement to sell only zero-emission vehicles from 2040 on."" In 2024, she does not support the EV mandate.

Critics might call this opportunism. Instead, we suggest that she is a climate pragmatist who is not bound by ideological litmus tests, and who is open to changing policy positions in response to political imperatives and economic opportunities. She is a politician, not an ideologue -- and this is a good quality if we want policy progress in a polarized world.

Harris is not alone in evolving into a climate pragmatist; she is joined by a growing cadre of Republicans and Democrats.

Republicans and Climate Skepticism

Republicans are supposed to be an anti-climate party. Historically, many have questioned climate science -- and a handful probably continue to do so. They support investments in fossil fuel exploration, extraction, refining, and pipelines. Trump is a vocal supporter of coal. Not a single House or Senate Republican voted for the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. In recent years, Republican Attorney Generals and Congressional leaders have pursued companies supporting the pro-climate ESG metric alleging that these companies are neglecting their fiduciary duties, or unlawfully colluding to impose liberal agendas.

And yet, Republican Governors are supporting renewable energy. Texas leads the country in utility-scale wind and solar. Indiana's Governor Holcomb is an outspoken champion of renewable energy. Republican Governors (but for South Dakota's Governor Noem) are actively courting EV, solar, and wind manufacturing industries which have received generous federal subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Democrats and Fossil Fuels

Democrats are supposed to be the pro-environment party that seeks vigorous climate action. Many of them sponsored the Green New Deal Resolution in the U.S. House and the Senate. They enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest infusion of federal monies in climate policy.

And yet, the Biden-Harris administration celebrates the rise of America as an energy superpower, driven primarily by fracking. It allowed Alaska's Willow Project despite vocal opposition from environmental groups and Biden's pledge of ""no more drilling on federal lands, no more drilling, including offshore, no ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period."" It supports the massive investment in LNG pipelines and terminals for exporting fracked gas. Leading Pennsylvania Democrats, Governor Shapiro and Senators Casey and Fetterman do not support a fracking ban either. Alaska's lone House Member, Mary Pelota, a Democrat, claims credit for pressuring the Biden Administration to approve the Willow project. Ohio's Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown wants to overturn the EPA rule that limits greenhouse gas emissions from power plants as well as the vehicle tailpipe emissions rule.

In sum, ideological purity might have become less salient in driving climate policy. Instead, politicians are responding to local/state-level factors, a good development because it bridges the democracy deficit. Democrats from fracking states support fossil fuels. Republicans from a state with wind and solar potential support renewable energy. Hopefully, voters will reward climate pragmatism and policy evolution. They will assess politicians not by what they said in the past, but by what they say now and importantly, what they do. With this yardstick, Democrats and Republicans will have additional incentives to embrace climate pragmatism and work together on climate issues."
"Harris' ""Opportunity Economy""  Closes The Economic Gap With Trump",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardmcgahey/2024/09/30/harris-opportunity-economy--closes-the-economic-gap-with-trump/,2024-10-01T01:18:25Z,"With just over 30 days left until the presidential election, Kamala Harris is emphasizing an ""Opportunity Economy"" as a centerpiece of her campaign. Although Donald Trump held a substantial polling lead over Joe Biden on economic issues, Harris is now virtually even with Trump on economics. What's in her program that's closing the gap?

Harris' economic vision continually emphasizes the middle class -- not the poor, or minorities, or immigrants. They aren't central to her message and policies. Her campaign website says ""she will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans."" And the ""Issues"" page on her website leads, in big bold letters, with ""Build An Opportunity Economy and Lower Costs For Families.""

Why ""lower costs for families?"" Because the biggest economic problem faced by Joe Biden -- and still faced by Harris -- is inflation. An August CBS News poll found that ""76% of registered voters said it (inflation) was a major factor in their choice for president."" And in May, an ABC News poll found Trump trusted over Biden on inflation ""by a margin of 14 percentage points.""

Inflation was driven by the Covid-19 pandemic's ""supply shock,"" with disruption to supply chains, the economy, and prices. The inflation rate has been trending downward, with the current rate of 2.5% the lowest since February of 2021. But consumers remain heavily scarred by the pandemic inflation, which reached an annual rate of 9.1% in June of 2022, a rate not seen since the oil shock inflation of the early 1980s.

Harris doesn't duck away from inflation. Her program calls for bringing down housing costs by building more, but also for ""legislation to outlaw new form of price fixing by corporate landlords."" Another major provision would ""take down bad actors and bring down costs,"" calling for the ""first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on food and groceries.""

Economists are skeptical about these policies. Yes, investors buy many homes to rent them out. But the vast majority of housing investors are small local landlords, not big corporations.

And even some Democratic economists don't endorse the attack on price gouging. Jason Furman, chair of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, says ""this is not sensible policy...there's no upside here, and there is some downside."" But economists like Isabella Weber at the University of Massachusetts argue that large and powerful firms took advantage of the pandemic shock to raise prices and generate profits beyond covering their costs -- what she calls ""sellers' inflation.""

Of course, Harris is running for president, not leading an economics seminar. And her attacks on price gouging are very popular. A new poll for The Guardian did a blind test of Harris' and Trump's economic ideas, and found Harris had ""four of the top five most popular proposals."" The most popular of twelve policies tested in the poll? A ""federal ban on price-gouging food and groceries.""

That's one reason Harris' has closed the ""trust gap"" with Trump on the economy. A recent Morning Consult poll found Harris and Trump were equally trusted on the economy, a major gain for the Democrats compared with Biden's double-digit polling gaps with Trump.

Harris' economic plan goes well beyond managing prices. She promises to continue (and perhaps expand) Biden's support for US manufacturing, using trade policy (including tariffs) and subsidies to support critical industries like semiconductors, electric vehicles, and clean energy. She ties these to other specific policies to lower energy costs and help with the climate crisis.

Although Harris endorses strategic, limited tariffs, she opposes Trump's plan to raise tariffs on all imports by 10 to 20%, and on imports from China by 60% or more. She calls this a ""tax"" on American households, and economists agree with her. Economists at Goldman Sachs, the Peterson Institute, the Tax Foundation, and the Tax Policy Foundation all find Trump's draconian tariffs would slow the economy, penalize households, and cause higher inflation.

Harris also want to focus on care work, both for children and for the elderly, as important for the economy. Better care would help workers -- the vast majority of them women -- better balance care responsibilities and their careers. And it would help the women workers who provide paid care work while suffering inadequate wages and working conditions.

Although commentators criticize Harris for not providing enough detail on her economic policies, her proposals are a model of clarity compared with what Trump offers. The New York Times reports Harris has distributed an 82-page booklet on her proposals, compared to Trump who has ""coughed up a string of four- or five-word slogans promising tax cuts, some of which his advisers cannot fully explain."" '

Harris also is battling complex economic views held by voters. In spite of continued job creation, rising real wages, slowing inflation, and continued GDP growth, consumer confidence is sending mixed signals. September's Survey of Consumers from the University of Michigan rose 3% above August, ""as consumers' expectations for the economy brighten."" But the Conference Board's consumer confidence index suffered its largest drop ""since August 2021"" between August and September.

We're in the home stretch of the election, so don't expect significantly more policy details from Harris. Rather, she will continue emphasizing economic security and opportunity for the middle class, contrasting her optimistic vision against a bleaker and less coherent approach from Donald Trump. So far, that's working in her favor."
