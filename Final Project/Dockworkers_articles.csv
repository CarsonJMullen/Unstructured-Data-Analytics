Mauricio Pochettino kicks off new USMNT era with 'tough' and 'intense' training session,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mauricio-pochettino-kicks-off-new-usmnt-era-tough-intense-training-session,2024-10-08T22:11:45Z,"You know that old saying, the one about never getting a second chance to make a first impression?

New U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino apparently subscribes to that little pearl of wisdom, given what his new players had to say when asked how the first 48 hours under the former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham manager's watchful eye has gone.

""It's intense,"" veteran defender Tim Ream told reporters on Tuesday, shortly after the second training of the Pochettino era wrapped up. ""We had a pretty long session -- I'd say one of the one of the longer ones we've had with the national team.""

""It was definitely intense,"" said left back Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson, who noted that the USMNT's European-based players had in the past usually used the first day in camp to recover from club games and the long-haul transatlantic travel.

""If you've played on Saturday, it's kind of light, you're not doing a lot,"" Robinson said of the old way. ""Yesterday, we were kind of straight into training, and it was a tough session.""

Ream and Robinson were speaking via video conference from Austin, Texas, where the Americans will meet Panama on Saturday in a friendly at Q2 Stadium -- Pochettino's long-anticipated debut. The last few members of his 25-strong roster, including star forward Christian Pulisic, joined the group late Monday after playing for their clubs the day before.

Hired last month after the USMNT's humiliating 2024 Copa América performance on home soil, Pochettino's mandate is to produce a strong showing at the 2026 FIFA World Cup -- which will also be hosted by the U.S. (along with Canada and Mexico).

While the new boss immediately set the tone on the field, he and his recently appointed staff of assistants have taken a more relaxed -- though no less deliberate -- approach around the team hotel.

""Today, for the first time, he's kind of addressed us all and said how he wants certain things to be,"" Robinson said. ""Yesterday, before all the boys were here, he was kind of meeting people individually and just talking through some things, getting to know everyone a little bit better.""

So far, the individual and group meetings have been deliberately uncomplicated. After announcing the roster last week, Pochettino warned against overloading the players with new information, and Robinson said there hasn't been much discussion around tactics just yet. But with just 10 international windows remaining before the World Cup, there's also a sense of urgency. ""He knows that we've got a short period of time to kind of understand the principles he wants us to play with,"" Robinson said.

More than anything, Pochettino understands the importance of results. Last month, under interim coach Mikey Varas, the U.S. lost to Canada and tied New Zealand at home. Panama, which beat the USMNT at the Copa América, would love to spoil Pochettino's debut. The U.S. then faces a tricky visit to Guadalajara, Mexico, next week. The Americans have just one win over El Tri south of the border in program history.

""They want to get to know us and, obviously, we want to get to know them,"" Ream said. ""The message is that he wants to win.""

""He has his principles, he has his ideas, but at the end of the day, it's about winning,"" Ream added. ""It's important to have that mentality, it's important to have that mindset going forward and leading into these games and, you know, beyond."""
Howard Stern tells Harris sun will 'go out' if she loses: 'We're in for the darkest skies on the planet',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/howard-stern-tells-harris-sun-go-out-she-loses-were-darkest-skies-planet,2024-10-08T22:11:42Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Sirius XM radio host Howard Stern suggested Tuesday there would be a climate catastrophe if Vice President Kamala Harris did not win the 2024 election.

During an hour-long live interview with the Democratic presidential candidate, Stern repeatedly ripped into Harris' opponent, former President Trump, and expressed disbelief that anyone would vote for him. At one point, he claimed the sun would ""go out"" if Trump was re-elected.

""With all this pressure on you right now, and you've got to win, you just have to,"" he told Harris. ""I really believe we're in for the darkest skies on the planet, like the sun's literally going to go out. God bless you for doing this,"" he said about her presidential bid.

At one point, Stern said he didn't even like comedians portraying Harris on ""Saturday Night Live"" because there was ""too much at stake"" in the election.

KAMALA HARRIS TELLS 'THE VIEW' SHE CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING SHE WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY FROM BIDEN

""I hate it. I don't want you being made fun of,"" Stern told Harris of actress Maya Rudolph portraying her on ""Saturday Night Live.""

""There's too much at stake. I believe the entire future of this country right now, land of the brave, home of the free, it's literally on the line,"" he said.

Harris said she thought the portrayal was funny but confessed she ""literally loses sleep"" about ""what is at stake in this election.""

""I end the day, pretty much every day these days, asking, 'What can I do more?' The stakes are so high,"" she told Stern.

At another point, Stern defended the idea of people going to therapy, and asked Harris if she could ""unload"" from the pressures she's under at a therapist's office.

""This is my form of therapy right now, Howard,"" Harris joked, before explaining she had support from her friends and husband when she needed someone to talk to.

FOUR CELEBRITIES WHO HAVE REJECTED CONSERVATIVE FANS: 'I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR YOU'

Stern's interview with Harris also covered the vice president's career as a prosecutor, her relationship with her husband Doug Emhoff, her pledge to bring Republicans into her cabinet if elected, and a discussion on whether voters were ready to elect a female presidential candidate.

The softball interview follows Stern telling his audience last month that he hates Trump supporters.

""I don't agree with Trump politically, I don't think he should be anywhere near the White House. I don't hate the guy. I hate the people who vote for him. I think they're stupid. I do. I'll be honest with you, I have no respect for you,"" he said on his show in September.

Harris' appearance on Stern's show came after she sat down for a friendly interview on ABC's ""The View."" Her friendly media blitz will continue Tuesday night on ""The Late Show,"" where she will be interviewed by Democratic Party supporter and comedian Stephen Colbert.

On CBS' ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, Harris repeatedly dodged questions about her economic policy proposals and if the Biden administration's immigration policies were ""a mistake.""

While Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have ramped up their media appearances in recent weeks, the Democratic ticket still lags behind the Republican ticket in the number of formal interviews they have sat for.

Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, have sat down for at least 69 interviews since the Harris-Walz ticket was formed, compared to at least 31 non-scripted interviews for the Democratic presidential ticket thus far."
QB Stock Market Week 6: It's not Joe Burrow's fault. Is it Jordan Love's?,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/qb-stock-market-week-6-its-not-joe-burrows-fault-jordan-loves,2024-10-08T22:11:27Z,"If you love good quarterback play, I hope you didn't miss the Cincinnati Bengals and the Baltimore Ravens go at it on Sunday. It was the kind of game that reminded us why we make time for football.

Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow both seemed to know the last man with the ball was going to win. Defenses didn't really matter. And while it -- briefly -- seemed like that guy would be Burrow, it ended up being Lamar -- and a Ravens' win.

And it was a nice piece of redemption, because of what we saw in Week 1 when Lamar dueled with Patrick Mahomes and Isaiah Likely's toe was an inch out of bounds on the final drive as the Chiefs won. So, while that outcome went against the Ravens, this one ended in their favor. And this win is a big reason why Baltimore is back on track to make a playoff run.

By now, you can probably guess who is still sitting atop this week's QB Stock Market.

For these rankings, we weigh this week's performance with 30% importance with 70% applied to the rest of 2024. One question holds importance above all others: What have you done for your team lately?

It's not his fault the Bengals won't pay Ja'Marr Chase or Tee Higgins. It's not his fault the Bengals let Joe Mixon, Tyler Boyd, Jonah Williams, Chidobe Awuzie and D.J. Reader sign elsewhere in free agency this year. It's not his fault Zac Taylor has proven incapable of recreating the success he had en route to Super Bowl LVI.

All Burrow did on Sunday was drop 392 passing yards, five touchdowns and one interception.

You don't really see this: Burrow is an elite QB playing extremely well -- and yet he's on a 1-4 team. What a waste. Cincy is letting Burrow's prime pass them by.

4. Baker Mayfield, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (⬆️ 3)

5. Sam Darnold, Minnesota Vikings (⬇️ 2)

Against the Jets, Darnold played a little bit like the guy New York no longer wanted.

Robert Saleh's defense was able to generate 19 pressures, four sacks and three QB hits, including one that injured Darnold. The Jets also swallowed up Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison in coverage.

But in the moments where the New York defense was beatable, Darnold didn't seize his opportunities. On one particular third down in the first quarter, he stared down his open, primary target long enough to let the rushers get home. On another third down in the fourth quarter, he threw an uncatchable ball to a wide open Addison. It would have been a first down -- and probably a touchdown.

And then there was a potential 83-yard TD late in the fourth quarter that Darnold missed right before he threw an interception. It would've been a remarkable touchdown -- but it was there for him to hit.

Darnold's hesitancy and inaccuracy gave life to a potential Jets' comeback. It's the second week in a row we've seen him open the door to an opponent -- rather than help the Vikings slam it shut.

6. Brock Purdy, San Francisco 49ers (⬇️ 4)

7. Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills (⬇️ 3)

8. C.J. Stroud, Houston Texans (⬇️ 2)

There were cracks in the foundation of Stroud's performance on Sunday. As you can see, I'm not panicked. I still have him in the top 10. But ... I wasn't exactly reassured.

The Texans, for example, did not score a touchdown following the departure of Nico Collins. Stroud was 5 of 5 for 111 yards and a touchdown (to Collins) prior to the WR's injury. After that? He was 17 of 27 for 220 yards with an interception and a fumble.

It's not like Stroud fell apart. But the explosive plays came to a halt.

We might just see how important Collins is to Stroud in the coming weeks if the receiver has to miss time. And we might just see whether Stefon Diggs is still the WR1 that he used to be -- or whether he's lost a step.

Stroud lost his handle on the game against the Bills after Collins' exit. And because of that, Buffalo nearly pulled off a win.

9. Geno Smith, Seattle Seahawks (⬆️ 1)

10. Kirk Cousins, Atlanta Falcons (⬆️ 11)

For one night, Cousins found out what it felt like to be 2007 Tom Brady.

Cousins had the Falcons offense firing. Timing. Precision. Anticipation. But it wasn't all safe throws. Cousins was pushing the ball into traffic and taking risks where he saw fit.

After Week 1, the Falcons looked flat and Michael Penix seemed like a throw away from taking over. But this week, Cousins was the NFL's best pocket passer -- better even than Burrow. It was a delight to see Cousins go 42 of 58 for 509 yards, four touchdowns and an interception. And he got the W.

11. Dak Prescott, Dallas Cowboys (⬇️ 2)

12. Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs (⬆️ 2)

That might not have been vintage Mahomes from his explosive days early in his career. But that was absolutely 2023 Mahomes when he was patient and methodical in taking only what the defense gave him.

He registered 300 of his 331 passing yards on passing under 15 air yards in the Chiefs win over the Saints, per Next Gen Stats. Typically, I'd present that stat to show an overcautious, underconfident quarterback. But given how teams play Mahomes, that's actually K.C.'s recipe for some good BBQ. According to Next Gen, Mahomes didn't throw into a tight window on any of his 39 passes -- not even his interception when a Saints defender poked out JuJu Smith-Schuster's reception.

This is boring, game-manager Mahomes. But when he keeps his decision-making in check, the Chiefs demolish teams. Like they did with the Saints.

13. Aaron Rodgers, New York Jets (⬇️ 1)

14. Caleb Williams, Chicago Bears (⬆️ 12)

15. Kyler Murray, Arizona Cardinals (⬆️ 3)

16. Derek Carr, New Orleans Saints (⬇️ 5)

17. Jared Goff, Detroit Lions (⬇️ 4)

18. Daniel Jones, New York Giants (⬆️ 4)

19. Justin Herbert, Los Angeles Chargers (⬆️ 1)

20. Justin Fields, Pittsburgh Steelers (⬇️ 4)

21. Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles (⬇️ 2)

22. Trevor Lawrence, Jacksonville Jaguars (⬆️ 3)

23. Matthew Stafford, Los Angeles Rams (⬇️ 8)

24. Jordan Love, Green Bay Packers (⬇️ 7)

Love has been as erratic as any quarterback in the NFL. I'm not sure the Packers can sustain this.

The situation didn't come to a head Sunday because Love and the Packers eked out a win. But the film for Love wasn't pretty. Perhaps because of the knee injury, he was misfiring on simple throws, most notably on out-routes near the sideline where he overthrew or threw wide.

And then his biggest throw was one of his worst decisions. When he wound up for a 53-yard bomb to Jayden Reed, the defense was clearly sending a message: Don't throw the ball. Reed was tripled, with Ahkello Witherspoon in position to notch an interception. But Love got lucky: Witherspoon couldn't track the ball. The play provided a massive chunk. It was the wrong process resulting in the right results. But that's not something the coaches will build on.

On just 121 drop backs, Love has six turnover-worthy plays and only four big-time throws, per Pro Football Focus. He also has three passes batted at the line of scrimmage.

The Packers should take another look at the Malik Willis game plan. They kept things simple and efficient and Willis kept the ball out of harm's way. That might actually help Love get back on track after a pair of dizzying performances.

25. Joe Flacco, Indianapolis Colts (new)

26. Andy Dalton, Carolina Panthers (⬇️ 3)

27. Jacoby Brissett, New England Patriots (⬇️ 3)

Brissett was playing every week like the Patriots had the lead. Like he could coast to victory with throwaways and safe decision-making. But New England has been trailing or tied for 130 of their 300 minutes this season, 12th most in the NFL. And so the irony is that Brissett's conservative play is contributing to New England's inability to win.

That's why coach Jerod Mayo had to seriously consider starting rookie Drake Maye.

The case to bench Brissett was obvious: The season is over. Get the kid in there to start giving him real, game reps. His progress could go exponential with that experience.

The case against benching Brissett was also legitimate: The season is over. Keep the kid out of harm's way. The more the Patriots lose, the higher they'll pick in the draft. That'll help Maye next season when he's the undisputed starter.

Like the Patriots, the Raiders are mulling who to start at quarterback. It's unclear whether Minshew or Aidan O'Connell will start next week.

Unlike New England, it doesn't feel like Las Vegas' decision will materially change its season -- or its franchise. It was already clear going into the year that the Raiders did not have a franchise QB or even a guy who could get them to the playoffs. (Neither O'Connell nor Minshew have started a postseason game.)

Schrager's Cheat Sheet: Vance Joseph's resurgence; Jayden-Lamar must-see showdown,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/schragers-cheat-sheet-vance-joseph-lamar-jackson,2024-10-08T22:11:22Z,"Every week, FOX Sports NFL reporter Peter Schrager opens his notebook and opines on three of the biggest storylines around the league.

1. Vance Joseph's Resurgence

The best story that's not gotten enough press this year is what the Denver Broncos are doing on defense. And the man at the helm has a story to tell, himself. Vance Joseph, who has now been coaching in the NFL for 20 years, finally got his head coaching opportunity with the Broncos in 2017. But the results were mixed -- the Denver fan base never took to him and it all was over in 24 short months. Joseph was out. Fired. He resurfaced as Kliff Kingsbury's defensive coordinator in Arizona, but when Kliff lost his job, too, an opportunity came in Denver when Sean Payton took the head-coaching gig with the Broncos. Payton met with Rex Ryan and others for the DC position, but Vance Joseph was a name that kept coming up in conversations. But could Joseph go back to the place where he was fired as a head coach and return in an assistant role? It takes someone devoid of ego and someone who just loves the profession to do so. When the job was offered, he accepted the gig. The fan reaction was mixed. And after giving up 70 points to the Dolphins in Week 3 last year, it looked like it was a mistake on all fronts.

But something happened. A few weeks later, they held Patrick Mahomes in check in a rare Broncos win over Kansas City (Mahomes' first-ever loss to Denver). Over the second half of the 2023 season, Denver's D showed great improvement.

And this year, Denver ranks both third in the NFL in total defense (256.5 yards/game) and scoring defense (13.8 PPG). As rookie quarterback Bo Nix gets acclimated and comfortable, Joseph's defense is leading the way. Payton's got his hands full with the young offense, and Joseph's unit is the fuel behind the team's three-game win streak.

What a cool story in Denver this year. And while Nix and Payton dominate the headlines, there's a lot to be said for the story getting less press: the Vance Joseph redemption story. And just watch -- if things keep going this way, you better believe the man who waited his whole career for a shot at a head coaching gig is going to be considered for another one.

2. Buffalo's Big Gamble

Monday's Bills-Jets matchup has tension and real stakes. First place in the division could hang in the balance, but also mass hysteria with a loss. The Jets, well, that's normal fare. The Bills? Their last two losses have raised eyebrows around the league. The blowout against the Ravens was a harsh wake-up call and Sunday's loss in Houston was potentially worse, given the squandered lead and head-scratching play-calling.

Watching from SoFi Stadium before the Packers-Rams game on Sunday, I was confused and assumed there was something going on in a game that I wasn't tracking closely enough. But, no. The Bills' throwing the ball three times while tied and back up in their end zone late in the fourth quarter was nothing more than what we all saw on our tablets, phones and NFL RedZone. Buffalo became the only team in the last 45 years to be tied or leading in the final minute of a game while inside their own 5-yard line, to throw three straight passes.

My concern? It's whether they have the playmakers. Buffalo led the league in scoring through three weeks. That story is done. And as Stefon Diggs brushes by Josh Allen in the postgame, mid-field scrum, you can't help but wonder if the lack of a Diggs or even a Gabe Davis, on this roster will come to haunt Buffalo this season. The trade deadline is rapidly approaching. With Khalil Shakir out and Davis and Diggs elsewhere, is there a veteran wide receiver Buffalo could acquire before the deadline? No one's panicking in Buffalo right now and there's no sense of desperation. But a loss to the Jets on Monday could ring some alarms in Western New York.

Buffalo general manager Brandon Beane famously said he wasn't looking to be the Los Angeles Rams from a few years back. But they might want to consider a ""F them picks"" approach over the next few weeks if things go sour in the coming weeks.

3. Jayden vs. Lamar

The Commanders-Ravens tilt on Sunday is my favorite game of the season thus far, and nobody in a million years could have imagined such a must-see matchup in Baltimore in Week 6 when the schedule was released. Whereas Baltimore fans look at the Steelers, Bengals, Browns and even the Colts as far more bitter rivals -- the geographical proximity and relatively small history between the Commanders (or what they were named at the time of a majority of their previous matchups) makes this somewhat testy franchise-wise.

But that's just the backdrop to Jayden Daniels versus Lamar Jackson, which is as tantalizing a quarterback matchup as you'll find. Lamar's playing the best football of his season right now, coming off two dazzling performances the past two weeks, and Daniels is having arguably the greatest start to a rookie quarterback's career...ever. Even C.J. Stroud, who ran away with the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Award last year, didn't tear it up in any single five-game span like Daniels just did in his first five games out of the gate.

With the Beltway serving as the backdrop, two of the league's best quarterbacks -- with their own style and unique abilities -- are squaring off. As someone who's alternated between giving Daniels and Lamar his weekly ""Player of the Week"" award the last four weeks, it's truly a pleasure to be able to sit back and see how this plays out. Commanders vs. Ravens as the most anticipated game of the season thus far? It's why you love the NFL.

Why A Startling 49% Of Emerging Leaders Lack Conflict Resolution Skills,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/markcperna/2024/10/08/why-a-startling-49-of-emerging-leaders-lack-conflict-resolution-skills/,2024-10-08T22:08:56Z,"Is a lack of confliction resolution skills holding you back at work?

Ever have a difference of opinion with someone at work?

Whether it's a dispute over limited resources, job responsibilities, poor communication or just plain old politics, most of us have experienced some level of conflict with a coworker. Brightmine recently found that nearly two in five (38%) of Americans have experienced a political disagreement with a colleague at work, with that number rising to 45% for Gen Z and 43% for millennials.

If an argument worsens or remains stagnant and unresolved, it can have a negative ripple effect throughout the organization -- even if it was originally just between two people. Unchecked conflict is often an underlying factor in the toxic workplace.

Unfortunately, many manager candidates don't feel confident in their conflict resolution skills, with DDI recently finding that 49% lack the requisite skills to diffuse tension. These skills include:

Since conflict is a fact of life and work, effective leaders will take the steps to equip themselves and their teams to handle disagreements productively. Good conflict resolution starts with personal assessment and reflection.

When I've had a disagreement with a coworker or vendor, these principles have helped mitigate some of the negative emotions so we could work toward a mutually beneficial outcome.

To assess your own skill level at resolving conflict, use the following principles in a reflective way. How well do you:

This is more than giving the other person time to talk while you mentally prepare your own response. Active listening is a posture of undivided attention, asking good questions to truly understand the other person's perspective. Active listening is empathy expressing itself.

Assess yourself: When is the last time I listened to an opponent to really hear their perspective? Do I look for any common ground? Do I ever ask permission to restate what I thought I heard to ensure full understanding?

This one can be hard, but we need to admit we're not mind readers here. Maybe the other person has a good reason for their stance; maybe not. Try not to decide that before you've heard directly from them.

Assess yourself: Do I think I know all the reasons why this person is disagreeing with me? Do I ever attribute positive motives to an opponent, or only negative ones?

When discussing a contentious topic, it's helpful to avoid ""you"" statements in favor of speaking only from your own perspective. ""I understood this to mean X"" is a lot less accusatory than ""You said X,"" for example.

Assess yourself: Am I choosing to make inflammatory statements or do I deliberately use calm, measured words? Do I take any of the responsibility/blame for what is happening or do I communicate that it's all the other person's fault?

This is pretty obvious but in the heat of the moment, a reminder never comes amiss. It's a lot easier for the other person to be respectful toward you if you first show that courtesy to them. Also, note that respect is not just the words we say, but how we say them. Inflection, tone and body language should imply the other person has dignity and a valid opinion.

Assess yourself: Do I communicate in a respectful way with those I disagree with? How respectful is my tone and body language when I communicate with them? How can I intentionally make the other person feel respected in the middle of a disagreement?

It can be hugely tempting to tell coworkers about your disagreement, but it's much wiser to keep the matter as quiet as possible. Seeking justification from others who aren't involved in the issue can come across as insecure and signals that you're not a safe person to disagree with.

Assess yourself: Do I talk about coworkers I disagree with to other coworkers? Do I rehash the situation unnecessarily to make myself feel better? How can I be intentional about avoiding gossip?

One of the best-kept secrets of conflict resolution is that managers aren't actually responsible to solve a conflict between employees. The only people who can truly solve a conflict are those directly involved. Solutions that are handed down to both parties from an authority figure, with little or no input from those directly involved, rarely go down well.

That said, managers do have a responsibility to provide a safe space where conflict can be resolved. Their role is not to be the savior, but the facilitator.

Finally, there can be benefits to clearing the air with an honest discussion: issues come to light instead of festering, allowing solutions and compromises to be implemented. Conflict may also offer a way to grow professionally. The way you handle conflict today may be noticed by those in a position to promote you tomorrow.

If conflict is an inevitable part of working with people, we must see it as an opportunity rather than a setback -- and then work toward a productive outcome for everyone involved."
"Who Is Peter Todd, The Man Named By HBO As Bitcoin's Mystery Creator Satoshi Nakamoto?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/08/who-is-peter-todd-the-man-named-by-hbo-as-bitcoins-mystery-creator-satoshi-nakamoto/,2024-10-08T22:05:17Z,"Satoshi Nakamoto -- the mysterious, anonymous creator of bitcoin -- has successfully kept their real identity hidden since they published bitcoin's white paper in 2008.

Bitcoin has become a $1.2 trillion asset (though one Wall Street giant has predicted it could be about to go far higher) over the last 15 years -- making the man, woman or group known only as Satoshi Nakamoto worth almost $70 billion if they still control the 1.1 million bitcoins they're believed to hold across a series of wallet addresses, pieced together by blockchain sleuths.

Now, HBO documentary film maker Cullen Hoback has named Peter Todd, a bitcoin core developer who has been involved with bitcoin since 2010, as who he believes to be the real-world identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.

Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex -- A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run

""What if the real reason for using the name Satoshi, for the anonymity, was so that people could take bitcoin seriously, so they could believe it was created by [a famous cryptographer] and not some kid still in school,"" Hoback said during the Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery documentary on HBO before putting his theory directly to Todd -- who was in his early 20s and finishing a fine arts degree in 2008, the year Satoshi Nakamoto published the bitcoin white paper.

""Here's what I think happened, possibly,"" Hoback said, speaking on camera to Todd and Adam Back, the chief executive of bitcoin development company Blockstream that Todd has worked with since the earliest days of bitcoin.

""I think that John Dillon [an anonymous BitcoinTalk contributor that some believe to have been linked to the intelligence community] was created so you would have an excuse to make replace-by-fee, a concept you had envisioned years earlier but needed some kind of cover in order to make, and you also needed some cover for the 2010 post,"" Hoback told Todd, referring to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 125 introduced by Todd in 2015 and a 2010 BitcoinTalk post replying to Satoshi Nakamoto that Hoback believes was accidentally posted using Todd's profile.

Hoback's theory relies on a chat log message written by Todd in which he claims to be the ""world's leading expert on how to sacrifice your bitcoins ... I've done one such sacrifice and I did it by hand,"" Todd wrote.

Hoback characterized the message as an ""admission"" by Todd that he destroyed his ability to access the 1.1 million bitcoin believed to be held by Satoshi Nakamoto, something Todd denies.

""It's ludicrous,"" Todd told Hoback, also denying he's John Dillon. ""This is going to be very funny when you put this into the documentary and a bunch of bitcoiners watch it.""

Ahead of the documentar airing, leaked clips appeared online, spreading on the social media site X.

In a statement to Coindesk, Todd denied he's Satoshi Nakamoto, saying Hoback is ""grasping at straws.""

Todd is a Canadian who started contributing to bitcoin's code in 2012 and describes himself as a ""cryptochronomancer"" on X.

During bitcoin's so-called blocksize war, waged from August 2015 to November 2017, Todd was on the side of the ""small blockers"" -- along with Adam Back and Blockstream -- who wanted to keep bitcoin's 1 megabyte limit, arguing against the ""big blockers"" who wanted to increase the block size to enable cheaper and faster transactions.

The small blockers won, forcing those who had opted to increase the blocksize to ""fork"" from bitcoin, creating the bitcoin cash cryptocurrency.

Todd is the founder of OpenTimestamps, an open-source project designed to provide a standard format for blockchain timestamping.

Walt Disney World Closing Tomorrow As Hurricane Milton Projected To Take $150 Million Toll,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/08/walt-disney-world-closing-as-hurricane-milton-projected-to-take-150-million-toll/,2024-10-08T21:57:16Z,"Walt Disney World announced a number of theme park closures beginning Wednesday because of Hurricane Milton -- which is projected to tear through Central Florida -- after a Goldman Sachs report released Tuesday projecting Disney is likely to take a nine-figure hit financially from the oncoming storm.

The Orlando area is now under a hurricane warning, with hurricane force winds expected Thursday morning and tropical storm force winds projected to continue through Thursday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service as of 5 p.m. EDT Tuesday. Wind speeds are expected to reach between 74 to 110 miles per hour, in line with a Category 1 or 2 hurricane, with at least eight to 12 inches of projected rainfall. The National Weather Service urges local residents to ""prepare for considerable wind damage"" and has called the projected wind speeds and rain a ""threat to life and property"" also warning of the potential for several tornadoes.

If Goldman Sachs' estimates are accurate, CNBC notes Hurricane Milton would be the costliest Florida storm to Disney since Hurricane Irma in 2017. The company said its parks segment lost $100 million due to that storm, which caused Walt Disney World to close for two days and also canceled multiple sailings on Disney Cruise Line. Walt Disney World has closed at least seven times in the past due to hurricanes, according to USA Today.

Universal Resort Orlando announced Tuesday afternoon it will close at 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday and remain closed Thursday, canceling its popular Halloween Horror Nights events on Wednesday and Thursday. Legoland Florida Resort and SeaWorld Orlando will both be closed on Wednesday and Thursday, and Busch Gardens Tampa is now closed through Thursday. In addition to its theme parks, Disney's Typhoon Lagoon water park, Winter Summerland Miniature Golf and Fantasia Gardens Miniature Golf will be closed on Wednesday. Orlando International Airport will be closed for commercial air travel starting at 8 a.m. on Wednesday, but will remain open to receive any flights containing emergency relief aid."
Some Indian American Democrats see themselves in Harris. Others see the limits,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5131223/some-indian-american-democrats-see-themselves-in-harris-others-see-the-limits,2024-10-08T21:57:10Z,"In the warm Georgia heat, Kannan Udayarajan is sipping chai and talking politics at an Indian restaurant in a small strip mall in suburban Atlanta.

There used to be only one Indian restaurant here, Udayarajan says, in this corner of adjoining suburbs at the edge of Forsyth County.

""Now in a 10 mile radius we probably have 40 to 50 at a minimum.""

The exponential rise in Indian restaurants follows a wave of Desi immigrants here. Desi is a term many people from the South Asian diaspora use to describe themselves. These immigrants are no longer primarily landing in traditional South Asian strongholds, like California and New York, but are also reshaping states like Texas and Georgia, helping transform metropolitan suburbs into some of the most diverse spaces in American life. Indian Americans now make up the second largest immigrant population in the United States.

Udayarajan says he's been a political junkie ever since he came to America for work in 2007. He hadn't planned to stay, but he got married and had kids, and in 2018 he became a citizen. Still, he didn't get involved in local politics until 2020, when former President Donald Trump was running for his second term. Udayarajan organized in his own community, helping register Indian Americans to vote, sometimes teaching them about American democracy.

""Joe Biden won Georgia by 11,780 votes,"" he says. ""And Forsyth County polled16,000 brand new Democratic votes in that election. So we made an impact.""

South Asians are one of the most progressive Asian American communities, a realignment that dates back to 9/11 and the policies and racial animus that followed. A recent Pew Research Center study found that 68 percent of Indian registered voters identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning.

Two years ago, Udayarajan became the head of the Forsyth County Democratic Party. He says this year, he believes Desis could again make the difference in a battleground state like Georgia.

Udayarajan is joined at the restaurant by Ashwin Ramaswami, a 25-year-old who was born and raised just a few blocks away in Johns Creek. Udayarajan asks Ramaswami if he thinks the South Asians here are excited about Vice President Kamala Harris' nomination for president.

""I see a huge amount of excitement,"" Ramaswami tells him. Udayarajan asks if it's more among the immigrant community or among folks who were born here?

""I think everyone,"" Ramaswami says. ""It's so different to have a presidential nominee called Kamala, right? Kamala is a Sanskrit word.""

A meme circulating on messaging apps and other social media has been hard to miss. The meme goes that in Sanskrit, Kamala means ""lotus,"" but in America Kamala means POTUS -- President of the United States.

""The ticket's been supercharged for the Desi community,"" Ramaswami says. He points out a personal overlap: Harris' mother is from the same village as his mother in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

""People can see the connections, they can see their own stories in her, because politics -- a lot of it is about the policy, but it's also about can you trust the person you're going to be electing.""

Ramaswami left John's Creek to go off to school, and then work. Now he's returned and is making a run for Georgia state Senate. He's part of another growing group -- young South Asian Americans running for office.

At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this past summer, South Asians gathered everywhere: Delegate meetups and happy hours and networking lunches.

""For all the years that I've been involved in politics, I've been part of the broader Asian American community,"" says Ann Lata Kalayil, co-founder of the South Asian American Policy and Research Institute. ""But more recently, we've started talking about South Asian Americans."" She points out the number of times she heard ""Indian American"" mentioned on the DNC stage and in the media to describe Harris. ""There's a real sense of pride, you know?""

Deep Singh Badhesha grew up in predominantly white Colorado Springs, Colo.

""I was the only South Asian there,"" he says. ""I was always trying to find my identity, but it was hard,"" he says, because no one at school looked like him. He describes experiencing a classic Asian American childhood experience -- the lunchbox moment. ""Your mother will make you a deliciously cooked Indian dish"" Badhesha explains, ""and you'll bring it to school and you open it up and everyone's like, oh, what the hell is that gross food?""

He says when it happened to him he felt like an outsider, so he broke off parts of himself to fit in.

""I used to actually be a super Republican and libertarian person because I used to look for folks like Bobby Jindal or Nikki Haley. And I'm like -- 'oh this is where South Asians look like they're having acceptance, right?'""

Then he went to college and met South Asian peers.

""They instilled a lot more pride in who I was,"" he says.

Badhesha believes things are different now.

""Being in this moment and seeing a lot of young folks in particular who see themselves in the Democratic Party -- who see themselves in Ro Khanna or Pramila Jayapal -- and of course Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, you know, it's like a huge moment for South Asians.""

Back in the Atlanta suburbs, another group of South Asians are meeting to talk politics, but there is no celebration over Harris' nomination.

""It stings, right?"" says Anjali Enjeti. ""I mean, boy, would I love to celebrate a Black, Jamaican, Indian woman.""

Enjeti says she cannot support Harris because of the Democratic party's political, military and financial support for Israel, and what is happening in Gaza and in other parts of the Middle East.

""It feels like a betrayal that when we finally get somebody who we can relate to in some way, to have them support and enforce a genocide is -- it's just devastating.""

Israel stands accused of war crimes and genocide in front of the International Criminal Court, whose preliminary finding is that it is plausible Israel has violated the convention against genocide. Israel and the Biden administration strongly deny the charges.

Enjeti and Harris are both half Indian, and they can each trace their roots back to southern India. Enjeti says that is where the similarities to Harris end.

""I think identity politics is a trap,"" she says. ""It is a trap to think that somebody's shared demographics or community has anything to do with your values.""

Enjeti is sitting with Farhana Rahman, remembering 2020. They registered voters and knocked on doors and drove people to the polls.

""We were screamed at,"" Enjeti says. ""We faced very real physical threats. We risked it all for Biden to win in Georgia.""

""That same me has done nothing this election cycle,"" Rahman adds.

Rahman says as an Indian American Muslim, she believes another Trump presidency is a ""existential threat to democracy,"" even potentially to her own safety. But she says she doesn't feel safe now. She says she's afraid to speak out against the conflict in Gaza and she's reluctant to tell colleagues and acquaintances that she is Muslim.

""I feel like I have to hide my identity,"" she says. ""It's unfortunate, but the level of Islamophobia, just making it so prevalent -- people can say horrible things to Muslims, and it's completely okay.""

She believes she has faced more Islamophobia and repression in the past year than she did after 9/11.

""After October 7th, it has become extremely dividing to the point where being a Muslim automatically means you are pro-Hamas and [an] anti-Semite.""

Rahman says she still doesn't know who she will vote for on Election Day, but she says the options only fill her with sadness and fear."
Musk's X to be reinstated in Brazil after complying with Supreme Court demands,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5146510/brazil-x-twitter-court-reinstated-elon-musk,2024-10-08T21:55:25Z,"SAO PAULO -- The Brazilian Supreme Court's Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday authorized the restoration of social media platform X´s service in Brazil, over a month after its nationwide shutdown, according to a court document that was made public.

Elon Musk's X was blocked on Aug. 30 in the highly online country of 213 million people -- and one of X's biggest markets, with estimates of its user base ranging from 20 to 40 million. De Moraes ordered the shutdown after a monthslong dispute with Musk over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. Musk had disparaged de Moraes, calling him an authoritarian and a censor, even though his rulings, including X's suspension, were repeatedly upheld by his peers.

Despite Musk's public bravado, X ultimately complied with all of de Moraes' demands. They included blocking certain accounts from the platform, paying outstanding fines and naming a legal representative in the country. Failure to do the latter had triggered the suspension.

""The resumption of (X)'s activities on national territory was conditioned, solely, on full compliance with Brazilian laws and absolute observance of the Judiciary's decisions, out of respect for national sovereignty,"" de Moraes said in the court document.

X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Just two days before the ban, on Aug. 28, X said it was removing all its remaining staff in Brazil ""effective immediately,"" saying de Moraes had threatened with arrest its legal representative in the country, Rachel de Oliveira Villa Nova Conceição, if X did not comply with orders to block accounts.

Brazilian law requires foreign companies to have a local legal representative to receive notifications of court decisions and swiftly take any requisite action -- particularly, in X's case, the takedown of accounts. Conceição was first named X's legal representative in April and resigned four months later. The company named her to the same job on Sep. 20, according to the public filing with the Sao Paulo commercial registry.

In an apparent effort to shield Conceição from potential violations by X -- and risking arrest -- a clause has been written into Conceição's new representation agreement that she must follow Brazilian law and court decisions, and that any legal responsibility she assumes on X's behalf requires prior instruction from the company in writing, according to the company's filing.

Conceição works for BR4Business, a business services firm. Its two-page website provides no insight into its operations or staff. ""Something great is on its way,"" the top of the site's main page reads in English. Its other page is an extensive privacy policy.

At three of its listed Sao Paulo offices, receptionists told the AP that the company's offices are empty and employees work remotely. Neither Conceição nor BR4Business returned multiple phone calls and emails from the AP.

There is nothing illegal or suspect about using a company like BR4Business for legal representation, but it shows that X is doing the bare minimum to operate in the country, said Fabio de Sa e Silva, a lawyer and associate professor of International and Brazilian Studies at the University of Oklahoma.

""It doesn't demonstrate an intention to truly engage with the country. Take Meta, for example, and Google. They have an office, a government relations department, precisely to interact with public authorities and discuss Brazil's regulatory policies concerning their businesses,"" Silva added.

Indeed, it is rare for an established, influential company such as X to have only a legal representative, said Carlos Affonso Souza, a lawyer and director of the Institute for Technology and Society, a Rio-based think tank. And that could be problematic going forward.

""The concern now is what comes next and how X, once back in operation, will manage to meet the demands of the market and local authorities without creating new tensions,"" he said.

Some of Brazilian X's users have migrated to other platforms, such as Meta's Threads and, primarily, Bluesky. It's unclear how many of them will return to X. In a statement to the AP, Bluesky reported that it now has 10.6 million users and continues to see strong growth in Brazil. Bluesky has appointed a legal representative in the South American country.

Brazil was not the first country to ban X -- far from it -- but such a drastic step has generally been limited to authoritarian regimes. The platform and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to quell dissent and unrest.

X's dustup with Brazil has some parallels to the company's dealings with the Indian government three years ago, back when it was still called Twitter and before Musk purchased it for $44 billion. In 2021, India threatened to arrest employees of Twitter (as well as Meta's Facebook and WhatsApp), for not complying with the government's requests to take down posts related to farmers' protests that rocked the country.

Musk's decision to reverse course in Brazil after publicly criticizing de Moraes isn't surprising, said Matteo Ceurvels, research firm Emarketer's analyst for Latin America and Spain.

""The move was pragmatic, likely driven by the economic consequences of losing access to millions of users in its third-largest market worldwide, along with the millions of dollars in associated advertising revenue,"" Ceurvels said. ""Although X may not be a top priority for most advertisers in Brazil, the platform needs them more than they need it."""
Fox News Politics: Harris on '60 minutes': Joe 2.0?,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-politics-harris-60-minutes-joe-2-0,2024-10-08T21:51:34Z,"Welcome to Fox News' Politics newsletter with the latest political news from Washington D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail.

What's happening...

-North Carolina residents will see changes to early voting after Hurricane Helene

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program...Read more

"Today's NYT 'Strands' Hints, Spangram And Answers For Wednesday, October 9",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/krisholt/2024/10/08/todays-nyt-strands-hints-spangram-and-answers-for-wednesday-october-9-full-house/,2024-10-08T21:49:34Z,"Looking for Tuesday's Strands hints, spangram and answers? You can find them here:

Hey, everyone! It surprises me every year how quickly the fall hits. Just a few days ago, I was swimming outside and now it's much too cold to do that, even in a heated pool. Still, I'm defiantly going to keep wearing shorts for as long as I can.

There's a new game of Strands to play every day. The game will present you with a six by eight grid of letters. The aim is to find a group of words that have something in common, and you'll get a clue as to what that theme is. When you find a theme word, it will remain highlighted in blue.

You'll also need to find a special word called a spangram. This tells you what the words have in common. The spangram links at least two sides of the board, but it may not start or end there. While the theme words will not be a proper name, the spangram can be a proper name. When you find the spangram, it will remain highlighted in yellow.

Every letter is used once in one of the theme words and spangram. You can connect letters vertically, horizontally and diagonally, and it's possible to switch directions in the middle of a word. If you're playing on a touchscreen, double tap the last letter to submit your guess.

If you find three valid words of at least four letters that are not part of the theme, you'll unlock the Hint button. Clicking this will highlight the letters that make up one of the theme words.

Be warned: You'll need to be on your toes. Sometimes you'll need to fill the missing word(s) in a phrase. On other days, the game may revolve around synonyms or homophones. The difficulty will vary from day to day, and the puzzle creators will try to surprise you sometimes.

Here are the first two letters of every word, including the spangram, in today's puzzle:

Before I reveal the other the full word list, I'll first tell you the spangram and show you where that is on the grid.

Pretty straightforward game today thanks to a very clear theme hint. I pretty much worked from the bottom left corner (HALL) upwards. Must be a fancy house if it has a library, though.

I used no hints and the spangram was the fifth theme word I found."
How Airbnb.org Helps Make Housing Accessible To All -- Even Paralympic Athletes,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenaquino/2024/10/08/how-airbnborg-helps-make-housing-accessible-to-all-even-paralympic-athletes/,2024-10-08T21:49:18Z,"I should start this story with a confessional: Prior to recently sitting down with Airbnb.org executive director Christoph Gorder, I never knew the organization existed -- let alone that it was affiliated with the Airbnb I've covered at close range for several years. It goes to show even the most knowledgeable, seasoned journalists never stop learning things.

As it turns out, Airbnb.org is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, replete with its own board of directors, whose mission it is to ""unlock the power of sharing space, resources, and support in times of need."" Take a cursory glance at the organization's homepage and you'll notice it dominated by a call to action for supporting those who've been affected by Hurricane Helene. As its origin story is told on its website, Airbnb.org's beginnings trace back to 2012, following Hurricane Sandy's thorough pummeling of New York City. As a result of the disaster, an Airbnb host in Brooklyn named Shell got ahold of Airbnb and asked if she could list her home free of charge for those seeking refuge; the company agreed, working ""extremely long hours"" in order to make Shell's place open for evacuees.

More than a thousand hosts eventually would follow suit.

Airbnb.org wouldn't be formally established until December 2020, in culmination of the hard work done by Open Homes, announced two years earlier, to support families during times of crisis. Airbnb.org was instituted with the intention of ""[focusing] on helping people share housing and resources with each other in times of crisis.""

In our interview, Gorder explained Airbnb.org has helped about 240,000 people spanning 134 countries since its inception. The organization's work has ""run the gamut"" globally, he said, with the team helping survivors of of natural disasters like the aforementioned hurricanes. Airbnb.org has been involved in assisting refugees in Ukraine as the country's war with Russia continues to wage on and on.

Gorder helpfully clarified that, yes, his organization and the canonical Airbnb are markedly different entities. His group is, again, a nonprofit who sees Airbnb ""cover all our expenses"" and is a ""big donor"" to the nonprofit, as it has access to Airbnb's sprawling network of 9 million listings. The 5 million hosts on Airbnb, Gorder said, all are ""huge supporters"" of the humanitarian work done by the nonprofit.

My conversation with Gorder was coincident with the Paralympics Games happening in Paris. He said Airbnb -- the ""parent company,"" if you will -- was an official sponsor of the Games, with Airbnb.org being around to support Paralympian refugees find housing. One of those people was Vanderson Chaves. A 30-year-old Brazilian, Chaves is a fencing para-athlete and part of the group, called Grêmio Náutico União, who traveled to Paris for this year's Paralympics. It was Chaves' third trip to the Games, having also gone to Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo. He said Airbnb.org's support of him ""helped a lot"" and added he was one of the people affected by the floods in Porto Alegre, which rendered him homeless. But he was committed to competing, telling me he ""had to stay focused"" on finding a way to competitions and ultimately the Paralympics. That Airbnb.org helped him proved instrumental, as Chaves said the nonprofit's assistance ""really meant a lot to me.""

In the end, Chaves enjoyed his time in the French capital.

""I really liked Paris,"" Chaves said. ""Unfortunately, I couldn't be too much of a tourist, I couldn't go to the tower and everything else. I didn't see the [Eiffel Tower] up close, but the location of our competition was past [it], so I was able to look, but unfortunately I wasn't able to get around the way I would have liked. But the city is very beautiful.""

Gorder said Airbnb.org was ""devastated"" when it learned about Chaves' plight and swooped in to try to help him recover and, as Chaves said, maintain focus on making the Games in Paris. The floods in Brazil, Gorder told me, displaced a staggering 600,000 people and prompted Airbnb.org to activate a response. Chaves ""lost everything,"" his wheelchairs included, and he's a big deal being a world-class Paralympian. Airbnb.org worked tirelessly to stabilize him as much as possible, with Gorder saying ""we'll continue to support him"" as Chaves continues the recovery process. The devastation n Chaves' home country lives on an ""epic scale, according to Gorder, and the Airbnb.org team felt ""inspired"" to stand behind someone who's such a role model to so many.

Chaves had a ""very positive"" experience being in Paris, telling me he enjoyed it thoroughly and is looking forward to traveling to Los Angeles come 2028. He hopes to medal then, resolute in ""[training] hard [and] stay 100% focused so that, God willing, I can go to another Paralympics.""

Chaves continued: ""All of us athletes had a lot of fans in Paris. The crowd was sensational! Everything was very beautiful!""

As to Airbnb.org, Gorder told me the feedback on the organization's work has been similarly positive. He described it as a ""life-changing experience"" to be able to settle in with a host and feel secure, not to mention have the host offer guidance on how to acquire essentials like food and so forth. The nonprofit's long-term ambition is to become the standard bearer for emergency shelter during crises, adding that a huge competitive advantage is they do have unfettered access to Airbnb's platform and cadre of resources. Since efficiency is the name of the game during such traumatic events, Airbnb.org is fortunate to be able to move quickly in helping people literally get roofs over their heads and feel safe.

""There's more potential out there,"" Gorder said. ""There's certainly no shortage of need, but if we can leverage what's special about Airbnb and bring it to this particular application, it'd help even more people."""
8 Ways For Small Owners To Still Lower Their 2024 Taxes,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrae/2024/10/08/8-ways-for-small-owners-to-still-lower-their-2024-taxes/,2024-10-08T21:49:11Z,"As a successful business owner, it probably seems like you are always dealing with taxes. If you file on extension, you probably need to be doing year-end tax planning around the same time you file your prior year's tax returns. Tax planning should be a year-round endeavor for the best results and to avoid leaving the IRS a huge tip. It's not just something you think about once per year while filing your taxes.

The year 2024 will be over before you know it. Many valuable tax-planning strategies must be implemented or at least set up before New Year's Eve strikes midnight. Below, we will share eight tax-planning strategies for small business owners to help lower their tax bills yearly.

The higher your income, the more you can potentially save with valuable proactive tax-planning strategies. This is even more pertinent for business owners in high-tax states like California, with a top state tax bracket of 13.3%, on top of the current highest federal tax bracket of 37%. Sadly, many business owners work to get their taxes filed and, for the most part, skip over any opportunities to implement tax-minimizing strategies.

Bidenomics has helped many business owners have record incomes in 2024. While earning more money is great, it can also bring quite a few tax headaches. Even if your income was below average in 2024, paying fewer taxes can still increase your net after-tax take-home pay. With a lower income, you may even be eligible for tax credits or tax deductions that you haven't been able to benefit from. Understanding your 2024 income will help determine how aggressive you need to be with tax planning before the year's end. It can also help you avoid a surprisingly large tax bill when you eventually file your taxes, not to mention helping to avoid underpayment penalties and interest.

Are you running your business as a sole proprietorship or another business entity? Would restructuring your company as an S-Corp, LLC, Partnership, or C-Corp help you lower your annual tax liabilities? Even if you have gotten guidance on this topic in the past, as your business and income grow, the best structure for your business may change.

If your business leaves your earning $100,000 (or less), the time and effort (and cost) of setting up an S-Corp likely isn't worth it. However, the tax-planning benefits increase by incorporating your business as your income grows. You should review this with your tax professional and tax-planning Certified Financial Planner every few years (more often if your business is growing rapidly or if there have been changes to the ownership of your business).

The more income you have, the more beneficial optimizing your small business retirement can be when it comes to minimizing taxes. Also, having the right retirement plan for your business can help you achieve financial freedom more quickly.

Likewise, maximizing the benefits of your small business retirement plan is a fabulous way to minimize your taxes each year and increase your financial security in retirement. Would you rather write a check to the IRS or to your own retirement account? The choice is yours. High-income, self-employed business owners could potentially defer income taxes on hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.

Here are a few of the most common retirement plans for high-income-earning small-business owners.

If you are self-employed, you can contribute 20% of your self-employment earnings into a SEP-IRA per year. The maximum contribution to a SEP-IRA is $69,000 for 2024. There are no catch-up contributions for SEP-IRAs. With no year-end deadline, a SEP-IRA can be set up and funded just before filing your taxes for the previous year.

Typically, a solo 401(k) will allow for the largest pre-tax contributions, which should translate into the largest tax savings. Business employees can contribute up to $23,00 for 2024 plus a $7,500 catch-up contribution if they are at least 50. Additionally, the business can make a profit-sharing contribution of up to 25% of payroll. That means up to $76,500 can go into your solo 401(k) pre-tax in 2024.

You can also benefit from a Roth solo 401(k) for the employee portion of your contributions, $23,000, plus a $7,500 catch-up contribution for business owners 50 and older. If your spouse also works with you in the business, that person can be included in the plan, doubling the amount you can contribute and the tax savings.

For business owners looking to save even more, the Cash Balance Plan (combined with a 401(k)) could allow your business to shelter several hundred thousand dollars in income each year. You may also hear people call this a Defined Benefit Pension Plan; it's more likely that your basic financial advisor or CPA won't mention it all (sadly).

Defined benefit pensions are the most complicated of the small business retirement plans because their design is complex and time-consuming. If you are nearing 50 (or older), are already maxing your 401(k) and want to save even more, talk with your financial planner about your tax strategy as soon as possible. If your advisor can't help determine whether a Cash Balance Plan is right for you, talk with someone who can. Some might be unable or unwilling to do the work to set up this type of plan.

Do you find yourself doing much of your work at home? Your business may be eligible for the home office tax deduction if this sounds like you. The great thing about this tax break is you are already spending the money on your home and other expenses like utilities and internet.

Here is what you need to know to determine if you qualify and better understand how this often scary home office deduction works.

You will miss valuable tax deductions if you don't track your spending. I'll be the first to admit that bookkeeping isn't fun, but neither is overpaying your taxes. Plan to spend a little time throughout the year to stay updated on your bookkeeping (or hire someone to do it for you).

One of the positive changes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is that you can now get a 60% first-year bonus depreciation for qualified used and new property acquired and placed in service during your 2024 business year.

If your income is higher in 2024 than expected in 2025, you will likely want to make purchases now. On the other hand, if your income may be substantially higher next year, you may want to put off large purchases.

What is the point if you set up the best retirement account but never fund it? Similarly, what is the point if you have a bunch of tax-deductible expenses but don't track them (and miss out on tax deductions)? Tax planning is not a once-a-year meeting with your tax preparer.

With proper timing (from proactive tax planning), you can make your income more valuable in terms of net take-home pay. For those who use pass-through entities (Sole Proprietor, S-Corp, LLC, or Partnership), your portion of the business profit and deductions are passed through to you and eventually taxed on your personal returns. Taxes are based on your overall household income and filing status.

When you are self-employed, minimizing taxes is one of the best ways to increase the net profitability of all your hard work. Be proactive and work with your tax-planning CFP and CPA to develop a strategy to make proactive choices to help you keep more of your hard-earned money. Would you rather write a check to yourself or the IRS regarding retirement accounts? The choice is yours."
DOJ accuses popular gym chain of discriminating against disabled people,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/doj-accuses-popular-gym-chain-discriminating-disabled-people,2024-10-08T21:48:53Z,"A man is in jail after he stabbed another man in the buttocks after an alleged dispute over a workout machine. (FOX 7)

The Department of Justice (DOJ) is accusing LA Fitness of discriminating against disabled people in a lawsuit that was announced on Tuesday.

In a press release published by the DOJ, the agency explained that it was suing Fitness International LLC - the company that owns LA Fitness - for ""discriminating against people with disabilities at its gym and fitness clubs.""

The DOJ is asking the Central District of California to ""stop LA Fitness from discriminating against people with disabilities, including by requiring LA Fitness to make its facilities and equipment accessible.""

According to the DOJ, LA Fitness discriminated against disabled people because some of the chain's amenities were not sufficiently accessible. The press release referenced broken pool lifts, broken elevators and broken equipment.

DOJ CONTENDS HUNTER BIDEN WAS HIRED BY ROMANIAN OLIGARCH TO 'INFLUENCE US POLICY:' DOCS

The chain is also accused of charging disabled patrons an extra fee for certain services. The lawsuit seeks money damages for the people who were ""harmed by LA Fitness's discrimination.""

""This includes people who were directly harmed by LA Fitness's barriers to access and broken equipment, as well people who need help to use LA Fitness's clubs and were charged extra fees to have a friend, nurse or personal assistant help them use LA fitness facilities,"" the press release noted.

LA Fitness, one of the largest chain gyms in the U.S., operates nearly 700 clubs across the country. The DOJ's lawsuit hinges on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was passed in 1990 to ""establish a clear and comprehensive prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability.""

""The ADA requires LA Fitness to give people with disabilities equal access to LA Fitness's services and facilities, remove architectural barriers to make its facilities accessible to people with disabilities and maintain accessible features,"" the DOJ argued.

""The ADA also prohibits LA Fitness from charging extra fees to people with disabilities.""

In a statement, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said that access to physical health activities is ""crucial for promoting the health and well-being of all individuals, including those with disabilities.""

""For over 30 years, the ADA has prohibited gyms and fitness clubs like LA Fitness from denying patrons with disabilities the opportunity to use and enjoy facilities enjoyed by patrons without disabilities,"" Clarke said. ""Through this lawsuit, the department seeks to remedy LA Fitness's discriminatory actions and ensure that patrons with disabilities have equal access to fully participate at their local LA Fitness gym and fitness clubs.""

CENTCOM to continue supporting Middle East operations as Hurricane Milton barrels toward Florida headquarters,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/centcom-continue-supporting-middle-east-operations-hurricane-milton-barrels-toward-florida-headquarters,2024-10-08T21:40:12Z,"Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said on Tuesday that U.S. Central Command, which is based in Tampa, Fla., and in the path of Hurricane Milton, is taking precautions to continue 24/7 support of Middle East operations.

The Pentagon does not expect U.S. Central Command's (CENTCOM) 24/7 operations to be affected by Hurricane Milton, as the monster storm barrels toward Tampa, Florida, where CENTCOM headquarters is located at MacDill Air Force Base.

Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Tuesday she did not have specific numbers in terms of how much equipment or personnel had been moved from MacDill, though she said a number of precautions had been taken, like moving aircraft out of the area and other protective measures.

""There is an evacuation order in place. I believe there will be...only essential personnel needed at the base during this time,"" she said. ""But, for the most part, I think most folks are, you know, following those orders and leaving the affected area.""

Will Israel Attack Iran's Nuclear Program? Here's What To Know As Ex-PM Calls For Strikes,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/10/08/will-israel-attack-irans-nuclear-program-heres-what-to-know-as-ex-pm-calls-for-strikes/,2024-10-08T21:39:57Z,"While Iran does not yet have nuclear arms, analysts believe the country's nuclear development program might be a prime target for Israeli retaliation -- despite U.S. opposition -- following Iran's missile launches at Israel, as a former Israeli prime minister argues for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.

In April, top Iranian general Ahmad Haghtalab threatened that the country could revise its nuclear policies if Israel hit its nuclear sites, saying such an attack could incite Iranian counterattacks targeting Israel's own nuclear facilities, according to reporting by state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

Israel and Iran are archrivals with a history of terse relations dating back to Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. A corresponding decades-long shadow war -- fueled by Iran's years of supporting Lebanese Shia militia Hezbollah and Islamist militant group Hamas -- has become a direct conflict as tensions spiked in recent years, particularly after Hamas' attack on Israel last year and Israel's intense invasion of Gaza. Israel -- alongside the U.S. and the U.N. -- has been concerned with Iranian nuclear progress since Iran started its weapons program in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Israel has spent the decades since targeting the program to prevent nuclear development through Israeli-connected missions like stealing nuclear secrets, sabotaging explosions and launching drone attacks. While Israel never took responsibility, Iran accused the country of assassinating top Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020. Iran has enough weapons-grade nuclear fuel to make three bombs and is one of the only countries without nuclear weapons that can produce 60%-enriched uranium, a quality of enriched uranium close to the 90% needed for weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal. Russian ties to Iran have deepened in recent years, and Bloomberg has reported the U.S. is concerned about the sharing of information and technology between the two countries -- a potential boon to Iran's nuclear interest. Israel is considered an undeclared nuclear weapons power because it is believed to have nuclear arms but has not confirmed possession of them, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.

While hitting it would be viewed as a major escalation, Israel has long watched Iran's nuclear enrichment plant in Natanz, an enrichment facility buried in the desert with thousands of centrifuges, according to the New York Times. Other facilities, like the enrichment plant buried under a mountain in Fordow, represent another potential target, yet U.S. officials have historically blocked Israel from getting the bomber planes and weapons powerful enough for an attack so deep underground, The Times reports. But Israel's methods have used other methods than bombings or missile attacks. Israel has a strong cyberdefense program -- exhibited recently when it launched an attack that exploded wireless devices owned by Hezbollah members. Another attack believed to be from the U.S. and Iran happened in the early 2000s -- called ""Olympic Games"" and known commonly the Stuxnet virus -- was a cyberattack that used digital ""worms"" to disrupt Natanz's facility operations.

Matthew Bunn, a professor of energy, national security and foreign policy at Harvard, told Forbes that there would be no nuclear fallout, or spreading of radioactive material, from attacking a uranium enrichment facility like Natanz or Fordow. These facilities deal with uranium that has not been irradiated in a nuclear reactor, meaning it's less radioactive. In an attack, some areas may suffer ecological damage, but the result would be isolated to the limited quantity of uranium at the locations, he said.

In April, top Iranian general Ahmad Haghtalab threatened that the country could revise its nuclear policies if Israel hit its nuclear sites, saying such an attack could incite Iranian counterattacks targeting Israel's own nuclear facilities, according to reporting by state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

In mid-2018, former President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Under the Obama administration deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities and permit U.N. inspections, and in return, economic and financial sanctions set by the EU, U.S. and U.N. were lifted. The deal outlined three main points: reducing Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium (a key ingredient in making bombs) by 98%, stopping production of higher-grade enriched uranium for 15 years and removing two-thirds of its more than 19,000 centrifuges (machines that enrich uranium). Under the deal, it would take Iran about 12 months to make a nuclear weapon. Trump was outspoken against the deal, calling it ""too much in exchange for too little."" Since 2018, Iran has significantly advanced its nuclear program, and while there is no evidence of nuclear-armed missiles, officials are concerned about metallurgy and computer modeling research related to weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Iran's nuclear capacity is playing out as a point of contention in the 2024 presidential campaign and was the leading question posed in Tuesday's vice presidential debate, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz arguing Trump was incapable of de-escalating tensions and did not put adequate nuclear protections in place when he pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, argued the Biden-Harris administration has supported Iran financially and that ""Donald Trump consistently made the world more secure."" Trump said on Oct. 4 at a campaign event in North Carolina that Israel should ""hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later."" When asked in a 60 Minutes interview on Oct.7, Vice President Kamala Harris responded that Iran was the U.S.'s greatest foreign adversary."
Biden undermines Harris claim that Ron DeSantis is politicizing hurricane response: 'Doing a great job',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-undermines-harris-claim-ron-desantis-politicizing-hurricane-response-doing-great-job,2024-10-08T21:36:12Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

President Joe Biden praised GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for being ""cooperative"" and doing a ""great job"" in his response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, despite Vice President Kamala Harris slamming DeSantis for ""playing political games"" instead of doing his job in response to the storms.

NBC News reported Monday that DeSantis was denying phone calls from Harris' team. ""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games with this moment, in these crisis situations, these are the height of emergency situations, it's just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris told reporters Monday.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, President Joe Biden's opinion about the GOP Florida governor's response to Hurricane Helene and his preparation for Milton, diverged substantially from that of his vice president's.

""The governor of Florida has been cooperative. He said he's gotten all that he needs. I talked to him again yesterday, and I said - no - you're doing a great job, it's all being done well and we thank you for it,"" Biden said at a press conference from the White House Tuesday. ""There was a rough start in some places, but every governor, every governor - from Florida to North Carolina - has been fully cooperative and supportive.""

RON DESANTIS: 51 COUNTIES ARE UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY

After a DeSantis staffer told NBC on Monday that the Florida governor had chosen not to take the vice president's call, DeSantis later clarified that he was never even aware Harris was trying to contact him.

DeSantis also shot back at Harris' claims that he was playing politics with the storm, accusing her of being the actual culprit of engaging in political gamesmanship.

""I've worked on these hurricanes under both President Trump and President Biden. Neither of them ever tried to politicize it. She has never called on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president until apparently now,"" DeSantis told ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday morning following reports of the vice president's criticism. ""Why, all of the sudden, is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown any interest in the past? We know it's because of politics, we know it's because of her campaign.""

""Harris is not even in the chain of command. She has no role in this,"" DeSantis added. ""The idea that I should be, like, worrying about her when I'm focused on the task at hand is just quite frankly absurd.""

BIDEN CANCELS OVERSEAS TRIP AS MILTON BEARS DOWN ON FLORIDA; DESANTIS TELLS VP 'IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU KAMALA'

Biden, who has had multiple phone calls with DeSantis since Hurricane Helene began barreling down on the Southeast, told him and Tampa Mayor Jane Castor to ""call him directly"" if any further support is needed. DeSantis, meanwhile, noted Tuesday morning that ""every"" one of his federal requests for more support have been answered.

DeSantis pointed out as well that, at the state level, he has been reallocating resources as necessary to help Florida's smaller communities that have fewer resources.

COASTAL FLORIDIAN WARNS OTHERS TO 'GET OUT' AS HURRICANE MILTON CLOSES IN: 'WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S COMING'

Gov. DeSantis' office declined to comment to Fox News Digital on the record, but pointed to the governor's comments on both ""Fox & Friends"" and ""Hannity,"" respectively. Fox News Digital also reached out to the Harris campaign for comment, but did not receive a response in advance of publication time.

As Florida continues to clean up the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, it is now preparing for a potentially even worse storm in Hurricane Milton and is calling on millions of residents to evacuate.

""Helene was a wake-up call - this is literally catastrophic,"" Castor said Tuesday. ""And I can say without any dramatization whatsoever: If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you are going to die."""
Architect Shares Four Tips For Rebuilding Homes After Hurricane Damage,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiegold/2024/10/08/architect-shares-four-tips-for-rebuilding-homes-after-hurricane-damage/,2024-10-08T21:32:31Z,"Homeowners impacted by Hurricane Helene are still digging out from that deadly storm that hammered states across the Southeast, while millions in Florida are preparing for the onslaught of a potentially larger and more ferocious Hurricane Milton late tomorrow. When the waves recede and the winds finally die down, the painful process of cleaning up and rebuilding will commence. Here is advice that can be helpful in both processes.

The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers offers a set of cautions on its website for safely operating your appliances after a storm, including when not to turn them on. Pinellas County, Florida offers recovery suggestions on its site, including how to document damage, file flood claims and avoid scams.

What we've seen in recent storms, especially Hurricane Ian two years ago, is that storm surge is becoming an increasing danger to survivability. I reached out to the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety to see whether its Fortified programs offer protection against this growing menace. ""Because elevation of an existing home to avoid flood damage is a cost-prohibitive expense for many homeowners, this program only addresses wind and wind-driven rain aspects of risk,"" explains IBHS communications director Mary Anne Byrd.

At some point hopefully soon, you will be in a position to rebuild your storm-damaged home. This presents an opportunity to strengthen it against future risks, using new materials and concepts. ""Homeowners whose properties were inundated by Hurricane Helene and similar storms should think about making some changes when they set about rebuilding their houses,"" advises Miami-based architect Ted Caplow. He outlines four steps to improving a home's survivability in future storms.

1. ""Elevate: The most obvious step is also the most important one. The force of ocean waves, even small ones, on a structure is far beyond the force of wind or rain. It's critical to lift the walls of the house above the water, so that the only thing underwater in a storm are columns.""

Caplow notes that flood plain maps are inexact and it's better to exceed current recommendations. 'In many areas, this will mean elevating your house as much as 20 feet above sea level. Keep in mind that the more elevated your house is, the cheaper it will be to insure, the longer it will last, and the better it will keep its value.""

2. ""Eliminate fragile materials: When a home floods from a storm surge, sometimes the structure itself is not badly damaged, but the materials and finishes inside the home are soaked with sea water and begin to decay rapidly."" Post-storm power shortages accelerate mold growth and hamper efforts to dry out a home's interiors, he notes. Selecting more resilient materials can reduce or event prevent water damage in some cases. ""Using polished concrete floors is a great example - these floors are not damaged by water. Tile is also pretty good, although the grout can deteriorate,"" he adds.

Two major risk points are walls and cabinets. The architect suggests, ""Try to find substitutes for drywall, particularly in the lower part of a home. There are wallboards with much better water resistance, such as cement board or magnesium oxide board. Masonry walls will hold up better than walls made of wood or metal studs and drywall. Fiberglass insulation turns into a soggy mess when it gets wet; mineral wool is more resistant to mold growth and so is Styrofoam.""

""When cabinets are built in bathrooms, kitchens, and closets, try to choose materials that can stand up to a good soaking. Metal cabinetry is one option, although it's often impractical. Laminated phenolic products like Richlite and some solid surface product like Corian offer excellent resistance to water, but aren't affordable in every cabinet. Most of the time, cabinetry will be built of wood, but try to avoid particle board or oriented strand board. Standard MDF (fiberboard) is slightly better, and solid plywood is better still,"" Caplow suggests.

3. ""Monitor air quality: Indoor air is very important for our health, because we breathe it for more than half our lives (and some of us breathe it almost continuously around the clock, especially in very hot and very cold climates where people don't spend enough time outdoors)."" It's relatively easy today to track indoor air quality in your house, so that if a flood happens, you can quickly observe any changes, he points out.

""Air quality has many components, but the ones that are most important are the basic parameters of temperature and relative humidity, together with total particulates (PM2.5 is the best one to watch) and volatile organic compounds (formaldehyde is often used as a proxy for this large class of potential toxins),"" the architect recommends. It's particularly important to pay attention after a flood. ""Keep an eye on humidity. If it becomes elevated even after restoring air conditioning, it's a sign that there may be a reservoir of moisture somewhere inside the walls, floor, or ceiling. Changes in air quality might also signal damage to exhaust vents (dryers and bathrooms) or even undetected leaks in the roof."" Tracking air quality is easy, the architect comments, pointing to widespread availability of monitors sold online today.

4. ""Provide access to mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems: The way we build houses is a little strange. We create a box, and we equip the box with a bunch of wires and hoses and tubes and ducts in order to make humans comfortable inside,"" Caplow notes. ""That's all fine and good, but then we cover all of these systems with layers of drywall, tape, plaster, and paint, so we can't see them and can't reach them."" When something goes wrong, heralded by a strange smell or ceiling stain, we have to tear apart walls to access the system, making a huge, unhealthy mess to diagnose and fix the problem. ""Drywall dust is a substantial hazard (particularly to people with asthma or allergies), and families sometimes have to move out of a house just to make these types of repairs,"" he warns.

""We suggest providing access to as many of the plumbing lines and air conditioning ducts as possible (electrical wiring lasts a bit longer). In the case of plumbing, it's possible to design a house so that the major connections are grouped together, for example by vertically stacking bathrooms in a two story home. It's also possible to add access panels to valve connections that cause frequent issues (such as in-wall toilet tanks and the areas behind sinks) or to provide access underneath first-floor bathrooms (this is particularly easy to do in an elevated home).""

He adds, ""When it comes to air conditioning, long duct runs are a health hazard, both before and after a storm event. Dust, allergens, pests, and mold all accumulate in air conditioning ducts. Short ducts are more easily accessed, cleaned, and replaced, and no ducts is the best solution of all. Modern ductless ""mini-split"" air conditiong systems provide excellent energy efficiency, room-by-room control, and a lot of peace-of-mind.""

Storms are inevitable. Total destruction doesn't have to be. There are organizations and architects addressing resilience. One is the International WELL Building Institute, creator of the WELL for residential building standards, rolled out at the beginning of 2024. Caplow's firm, Caplow Manzano, is one of its proponents, and was involved in its pilot program with its CM1 residence in Miami. ""The WELL standard gives points for choosing healthier materials, including the more durable alternatives described above,"" Caplow comments.

Rebuilding with a WELL-certified architect and considering IBHS' Fortified programs can keep your new home safer, dryer, healthier and more insurable.

Supreme Court signals support for Biden administration regulation of 'ghost gun' kits,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-signals-support-biden-administration-regulation-ghost-gun-kits,2024-10-08T21:31:11Z,"Shannon Bream, chief legal correspondent, anchor of Fox News Sunday (check your local listings), host of the hit podcast Livin' The Bream and bestselling author of her latest book.

The Supreme Court offered clear support Tuesday for continued federal regulation of so-called ""ghost guns"" that can be assembled from kits into a working firearm without a background check or the usual serial numbers.

At issue in oral arguments was whether the devices meet the federal definition of a ""firearm"" and ""frame and receiver,"" and whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) exceeded its authority to regulate and enforce their sale.

Ghost guns are do-it-yourself functional weapons that are often purchased online, and marketed by some sellers as easy to assemble.

The Justice Department said more than 19,000 hard-to-trace ghost guns were seized by law enforcement in 2021, a more than tenfold increase in just five years.

That was driven in part by recent technological advances, many containing polymer-based unassembled firearm components.

Final home assembly typically requires the use of some readily available tools, including drilling holes and milling or sanding the unfinished frame or receiver, which enable the installation of parts.

U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said the rising sale of untraceable ""ghost guns"" had created a ""public safety crisis"" with an ""explosion"" of crimes committed using them.

Several justices in the 75-minute argument appeared to back much of the Biden administration's arguments, suggesting nearly complete parts meet the ordinary definition of a firearm subject to regulation.

""What is the purpose of selling a receiver without the holes drilled in it?"" said Chief Justice John Roberts, rejecting suggestions the kits were marketed at the weekend gun hobbyist. ""Drilling a hole or two, I would think, doesn't give the same sort of reward that you get from working on your car on the weekends. My understanding is that it's not terribly difficult for someone to do this.""

Justice Brett Kavanaugh -- who could be the key deciding vote -- raised concerns someone ignorant of the law might inadvertently sell or buy a ghost gun kit.

""What about the seller, for example, who is truly not aware, truly not aware that they are violating the law and gets criminally charged?""

But Kavanaugh also signaled some backing of the government's position, telling Prelogar, ""Your statutory interpretation has force.""

The 1968 Gun Control Act was revised in 2022 to regulate the growing market for certain ""buy build shoot"" kits.

The law defines a ""firearm"" to include ""any weapon... which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive,"" as well as ""the frame or receiver of any such weapon.""

The administration said it was not seeking to ban the sale or use of these kits, merely requiring them to comply with the same requirements of other commercial firearms dealers. That includes serial numbers on the parts and background checks on the purchasers.

A federal appeals court late last year struck down the updated rules, after a legal challenge from kit sellers and buyers, but the Justice Department appealed to the Supreme Court.

Gun rights groups say that the rule is ""unconstitutional and abusive,"" arguing the ghost gun kits consist of ""non-firearm objects.""

Attorney Peter Patterson said only Congress can change the law over ghost gun regulations and added that 42 of 43 unlicensed manufacturers of the kits would be driven out of business if the rules go fully into effect.

The devices can also be made from 3D printers or from individual parts. That is part of separate legal challenges in the lower courts.

In oral arguments, the high court wrestled with questions about the ease of assembling a ""ghost gun"" from a kit, and whether judges should even be involved in the matter.

""I'm worried about... the Court taking over what Congress may have intended for the agency to do in this situation,"" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. ""I think it can't be assumed that the agency exceeds its authority whenever it interprets a statutory term differently than we would such that all we have to do as a part of this claim here today is just decide what we think a firearm is.""

But others on the court questioned whether a bunch of unassembled parts really made them into a gun.

""Here's a blank pad and here's a pen, all right? Is this a grocery list?"" asked Justice Samuel Alito. ""If I show you -- I put out on a counter some eggs, some chopped-up ham, some chopped-up pepper, and onions. Is that a western omelet?""

Justice Amy Coney Barrett then appeared to blunt Alito's argument, focusing on do-it-yourself kits.

""Would your answer change if you ordered it from HelloFresh, and you got a kit, and it was like turkey chili, but all of the ingredients are in the kit?"" she asked, mentioning the ready-to-cook meal kits delivery service.

Barrett also appeared skeptical of the legal alternatives to the ATF rules, proposed by Patterson, the lawyer representing the gun rights supporters.

""It seems a little made up,"" she said.

Prelogar claimed the new rules had led to a dramatic drop in the online sales of the ready-to-assemble weapons.

The ATF's rule requires unfinished parts of a firearm, like the frame of a handgun or the receiver of a long gun, to be treated like a completed firearm. These parts need to be licensed and must have serial numbers.

The rule also requires manufacturers to run background checks before selling these parts, as they are required to do for whole commercial firearms.

The Supreme Court had previously allowed the regulation to remain in effect while the lawsuit continued through the courts, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett voting with the three liberal members of the court to form the majority.

The justices have been revisiting the Second Amendment in recent years, after the conservative majority in 2022 made it easier to carry handguns outside the home for protection.

In June, a federal ban on bump stocks, devices that can convert semi-automatic rifles into weapons that can fire hundreds of rounds a minute, was struck down by the high court.

But that same month, the justices upheld a federal ban on firearms possession for people subject to certain domestic violence restraining orders."

You can find them here:

It's Wednesday, and you know what that means: it's time for another round of Connections!

Also, there's some big news! The Connections archive is now available, so if you have an NYT Games or All Access subscription, you can go back and play any previous game you missed (and look up my earlier guides if you need help, of course!).

You're presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like items you can click, names for research study participants or words preceded by a body part.

There's only one solution for each puzzle, and you'll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them.

Each group is color coded. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and the purple group is usually the most difficult one. The purple group often involves wordplay.

Select four words you think go together and press Submit. If you make a guess and you're incorrect, you'll lose a life. If you're close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you're one word away from getting it right, but you'll still need to figure out which one to swap.

If you make four mistakes, it's game over. Let's make sure that doesn't happen with the help of some hints, and, if you're really struggling, today's Connections answers. As with Wordle and other similar games, it's easy to share results with your friends on social media and group chats.

Scroll slowly! Just after the hints for each of today's Connections groups, I'll reveal what the groups are without immediately telling you which words go into them.

A perfect game brings me up to four wins in a row. Here's how I fared:

This one was pretty straightforward for me. I spotted the blues right away, but decided to go with the yellows first as an insurance policy. Once the grid was down to eight words, I found the greens quickly. That was a good thing, as I did not figure out the purple connection.

"Museum worker mistakes beer can artwork for garbage, tosses in trash",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/museum-worker-mistakes-beer-can-artwork-garbage-tosses-trash,2024-10-08T21:31:08Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A museum technician mistakenly threw away artwork after thinking it was trash left behind by construction workers.

The LAM Museum in Lisse, Netherlands, is home to an international art collection that showcases pieces in unconventional ways, with one exhibit looking like it's an area to place trash.

French artist Alexandre Lavet's piece titled,""All the good times we spent together,"" from 1988 is displayed at the museum, showing what appears to be nothing more than two empty beer cans to the naked eye.

The beer cans, however, are hand-painted with acrylics to replicate Jupiler beer.

Recently, a lift technician was covering for another employee when he thought he was simply picking up trash left inside the museum's glass elevator shaft as he came across the cans, according to the museum.

Museum Director Sietske van Zanten said the worker was, ""just going his job in good faith,"" and that the museum has no ill will toward him.

""In a way, it's a testament to the effectiveness of Alexandre Lavet's art,"" van Zanten said in a press release.

The theme of the particular collection is food and consumption, according to the museum, with van Zanten adding, ""By displaying artworks in unexpected places, we amplify the experience and keep visitors on their toes.""

After realizing the beer cans were missing, museum curator Elisah van den Bergh went searching and found the artwork in a bin bag and ready to be thrown away.

Museum officials said that shockingly, both cans were intact. The art is now sitting near the front of the museum in a temporary spot to honor the laughable moment.

""We wanted to give them their moment in the spotlight,"" van den Bergh said in the press release.

Mike Tomlin doesn't think the Steelers have a George Pickens problem,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mike-tomlin-doesnt-think-steelers-have-george-pickens-problem,2024-10-08T21:31:07Z,"Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin doesn't believe wide receiver George Pickens is becoming a distraction, even as Pickens' public displays of dissatisfaction suggest otherwise.

The talented but enigmatic Pickens, who leads the Steelers (3-2) in receptions and yards, played a career-low 34 snaps during Sunday night's 20-17 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. Pickens caught three passes for a season-low 26 yards on seven targets but also spent a significant chunk of the game as a spectator.

Tomlin called the dip in time for the 23-year-old Pickens an example of load management.

""Most players, particularly in today's game that have specialized skill sets, they play positions like receiver (and) they don't play every down,"" Tomlin said Tuesday. ""They don't play every down because you need them in significant moments. You need them at the back half of the season. You need them in the second half of football games and those weighty downs.""

Maybe, but Pickens didn't appear to handle the decision particularly well.

Wearing eye black with the phrase ""always (expletive) open"" written in front of a national television audience, Pickens sat motionless and alone for long stretches while his teammates met with coaches.

At the end of one offensive possession that included quarterback Justin Fields overthrowing him on a crossing pattern, Pickens slammed his helmet so hard coming off the field that it bounced over the bench.

After the game's final play -- a last-gasp series of laterals that went nowhere -- Pickens grabbed at the facemask of Cowboys cornerback Jourdan Lewis, who later called Pickens ""weak"" while heading back to the Dallas locker room.

Pickens declined to speak to reporters after the game and brushed them off again on Monday, retreating to the team's equipment room during the 45-minute media window.

This isn't the first time in his career that Pickens has found himself in the middle of a maelstrom because of a perceived lack of effort. He was chastised late last season when cameras caught him opting not to block downfield when teammate Jaylen Warren broke off a long run, a decision Pickens at the time attributed to injury avoidance.

Tomlin has repeatedly backed Pickens publicly, saying in September that he ""absolutely"" believes Pickens would handle adversity both on and off the field more positively as he enters his third season.

Asked on Tuesday if he still feels that way after a series of perceived missteps were outlined, Tomlin said ""in those instances, no, but largely it's been an improvement in those areas, certainly.""

Perhaps more tellingly, Tomlin reiterated his long-held belief that he has no interest in making whatever issue he might have with a given player fit for public consumption.

""This business between he and I, in terms of his growth and development as a player and as a man, I just don't think it aids that growth and the development to address it in open settings such as this,"" Tomlin said.

Tomlin added that the decision to curb Pickens' playing time was communicated to him before the Dallas game and that Pickens did not have an issue with it.

The reality is the Steelers need Pickens to be engaged and on the field if they want to have a balanced offense. Production from the receivers behind him on the depth chart -- a list that includes Van Jefferson and Scotty Miller -- has been modest at best. Pickens' 23 receptions through five games is more than the combined total from Jefferson, Miller and Calvin Austin III (18).

It didn't help Pickens that quarterback Justin Fields had perhaps his shakiest performance of the season against Dallas, completing a season-low 55% (15 of 27) of his passes, though he did throw a pair of second-half touchdowns, including a shovel pass to tight end Pat Freiermuth that gave the Steelers the lead with less than five minutes to go.

Fields will likely make his sixth straight start on Sunday against Las Vegas (2-3). Russell Wilson is expected to be a full participant in practice on Wednesday for the first time since aggravating a calf injury just before the season opener in Atlanta. Fields will practice with the starters on Wednesday, with Wilson working with the backups.

Tomlin, as he has for weeks, declined to get into what he considers a still unnecessary discussion about Wilson reclaiming the starting job he won out of training camp.

""Until Russ gets to a point where we're comfortable with what we're looking at, he's able to execute all schematics, he's able to put together back-to-back consecutive days and so forth. I just think that's a hypothetical conversation,"" Tomlin said. ""We'll continue to push forward with Justin until those things are legitimate.""

Azerbaijan's human-rights record is under fire as it prepares to host UN climate talks,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5145637/azerbaijan-human-rights-climate-change-cop29,2024-10-08T21:28:09Z,"Human rights activists and lawmakers in the United States are calling for Azerbaijan to end alleged abuses of civil society groups and ethnic Armenians ahead of a global climate change summit the country will host in November.

A new report from Human Rights Watch and Freedom Now says Azerbaijan is carrying out an ""escalating crackdown"" on government critics and activists. That includes the arrest this spring of human-rights advocate Anar Mammadli, who co-founded a group to work on issues related to climate justice.

The report was published days after dozens of U.S. lawmakers urged Secretary of State Antony Blinken to push for the release of political prisoners and hostages in Azerbaijan, a major oil and gas producer on the Caspian Sea that borders Russia, Iran and Armenia. The lawmakers said Azerbaijan carried out an ethnic cleansing last year in Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-majority enclave. And they pointed to a State Department report that found ""significant human rights issues"" in the country, including credible reports of arbitrary detentions and unlawful or arbitrary killings.

U.S. lawmakers told Blinken that the upcoming COP29 climate negotiations in Azerbaijan offer ""a pivotal platform"" to promote energy security in the region and to help countries like Armenia cut their dependence on Russia for natural gas. The criticism of Azerbaijan also comes against the backdrop of growing concern globally that grassroots efforts to limit and adapt to climate change are being met with state pushback and human rights abuses.

""When civic space is actively shut down, the voices of those most affected by the climate crisis are at risk of being excluded from the negotiations,"" Myrto Tilianaki, a senior advocate for the environment and human rights at Human Rights Watch, said at a press conference Tuesday. ""And that is a major problem, because if their lived experiences and solutions aren't heard, the policies that come out of these talks might not fully reflect their needs or protect their rights.""

A spokesperson for Azerbaijan's Embassy in Washington wasn't immediately available for comment.

Responding to the earlier allegations from U.S. lawmakers, the embassy said Azerbaijan is a victim of an ""orchestrated disinformation campaign.""

The selection of Azerbaijan to host this year's climate talks shows the country is ""a responsible and credible member of the international community,"" the embassy said in a statement. It added that ""human rights have nothing to do with permissiveness to engage in illegal activities.""

The report from Human Rights Watch and Freedom Now says recent arrests of activists and media figures in Azerbaijan were primarily linked to laws restricting nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The arrests were politically motivated, the report says, and ""follow well-established, abusive methods the government has used for many years to curtail freedom of speech and freedom of association in the country.""

In most of the cases documented in the report, people who worked for or were involved with unregistered NGOs and independent media outlets were charged with smuggling money into Azerbaijan. Some of those people were also charged with crimes such as illegal entrepreneurship, forgery and tax evasion, according to the report. In other cases, people were charged with extremism, drug possession, counterfeiting and treason.

The circumstances and timing of most of those arrests ""strongly suggest that the criminal charges were merely a pretext intended to punish and put an end to activists' legitimate work,"" according to Human Rights Watch and Freedom Now.

Azerbaijan was picked to host this year's United Nations climate talks after Russia blocked bids from countries in the European Union, which has supported Ukraine in its war with Moscow.

At last year's climate conference in the United Arab Emirates, countries agreed to move away from fossil fuels, the main driver of human-caused global warming. However, Azerbaijan has suggested the world can meet its climate targets while continuing to produce fossil fuels.

Oil and gas pays for a large share of Azerbaijan's budget, and the country is poised to increase gas production by a third over the next decade, according to an analysis by Global Witness, an environmental and human rights group.

""I have always said that having oil and gas deposits is not our fault. It's a gift from God,"" Ilham Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, said at a conference earlier this year. ""We must not be judged by that. We must be judged based on how we use these reserves for the development of the country, to reduce poverty and unemployment, and on what our targets are with respect to the green agenda.""

One of the cases highlighted by Human Rights Watch and Freedom Now involves an economist named Gubad Ibadoghlu who was arrested on charges related to the production of counterfeit currency and extremism. Ibadoghlu has argued that average citizens in Azerbaijan don't benefit from the country's oil and gas reserves because revenues are mismanaged. And he recently examined plans for greater energy cooperation between Azerbaijan and the European Union, questioning how much gas Azerbaijan could send to Europe. If he's convicted, the report says Ibadoghlu faces 17 years in prison."
Supreme Court majority may embrace ATF's ghost gun rule,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5145914/supreme-court-ghost-guns,2024-10-08T21:24:34Z,"The U.S. Supreme Court seemed inclined Tuesday to side with the government in a case brought by gun kit manufacturers who say the ATF exceeded its authority by classifying the kits as guns. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images hide caption

The conservative Supreme Court, largely hostile to gun regulations in recent years, seemed tentatively supportive of the Biden administration's effort to curb ""ghost guns.""

These build-it-yourself gun kits can be bought online and anonymously, without a background check. The guns from these kits have also have no serial numbers, meaning they cannot be traced. In 2022, as the number of ghost guns found at crime scenes was growing exponentially, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives issued a new rule classifying the kits as firearms under the 1968 Gun Control Act. The statute defines a firearm as any weapon that is ""designed to or may readily be converted into"" a functional firearm. The kit manufacturers and sellers challenged the rule in court, asserting that the ATF had exceeded its authority. The conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals struck the rule down.

The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court, and last year the court voted 5-to-4 to leave the regulation in place while it reviewed the case. On Tuesday a majority of the justices seemed to think the gun-kit sellers were on pretty shaky ground.

Arguing in support of the regulation, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said that if the manufacturers and sellers of these kits prevail, it would work ""a sea change"" in the nation's firearm laws. Under the kit sellers argument, ""if a firearm isn't a 100% functional, if its missing just one hole that could be drilled in seconds and immediately assembled into a working gun, that product can be sold to anyone online with no background check, no records, and no serial number,"" said Prelogar.

Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh all expressed some skepticism about that argument. The four were the likely dissenters when the court allowed the ghost gun regulation to remain in effect.

Alito focused on the definition of a weapon, and when it is considered just a part. Holding up a yellow legal pad and a pen, he asked: ""Is this a grocery list?"" Solicitor General Prelogar replied that it was not, since ""there are a lot of other things you could use [the pad for] for to create something other than a grocery list.""

Justice Amy Coney Barrett chimed in, asking Prelogar if her answer would change if she were to order a kit to make turkey chili from HelloFresh with ""all of the ingredients in the kit."" Prelogar saw this as ""the more apt analogy"" because much like a gun kit, where the purpose is to build a gun, the purpose of that kit would be to make chili.

Kavanaugh said his main concern was whether a kit seller who didn't know he was violating the law would he be prosecuted. Prelogar responded that the U.S. criminal code requires ""willfulness"" in order to bring a criminal charge and that any manufacturer or seller who has doubts is able to get a dispositive ruling from the ATF as to whether the gun or gun kit is legal.

But Kavanaugh was still concerned, asking, ""If you haven't done that,"" referring to receiving a dispositive ruling from the ATF, ""and you truly believe you're not violating the law, could you be charged under that provision? Is that something the government would do?""

""I don't think the government would be likely to charge someone in that situation,"" responded Prelogar. She also asserted that Justice Kavanaugh's hypothetical gun manufacturer is nothing like what is happening in reality, where the gun kit sellers are intentionally trying to circumvent a regulation while advertising their products as ""ridiculously easy to assemble"" and a way to have a ""fully functional gun in as little as 15 minutes.""

Turning to a broader question, Justice Elena Kagan noted that sometimes ""there's an old statute that didn't contemplate a new problem,"" and in those situations, when ""Congress can't get its act together,"" an agency takes old statutory language that doesn't really fit the problem but tries to make it fit. Kagan asked Prelogar if that ""is a storyline"" that the kit sellers ""can tell about this regulation?""

""No"", replied Prelogar. Gun manufacturers trying to evade gun regulations is ""an age-old problem"" that Congress was trying to fix, so they wrote a statute designed to deal with that problem.

""I think it's really notable,"" she said, ""that none of the major gun manufacturers is suing us about this rule, and the reason for that is because they have abided by the 'readily converted' standard for more than 50 years, since the Gun Control Act became law.""

Following Prelogar to the lectern was lawyer Pete Patterson, representing the kit sellers.

He maintained that just because the kit buyer only has to drill a hole or holes in the frame or receiver part of the gun, that doesn't convert it into weapon that can be regulated by the government. Rather, he said, the standard should be whether critical machining was necessary.

Justice Barrett appeared skeptical of Patterson's proposed standard, pointing out that ""it doesn't appear in statute"" and that ""it seems a little made up.""

Chief Justice John Roberts, who was quiet throughout Prelogar's argument, weighed in on the debate about whether these guns are used by hobbyists or by individuals who could not legally buy a gun. When Patterson compared building these gun kits to how ""some individuals enjoy working on their car every weekend,"" Roberts responded caustically, that just ""drilling a hole or two doesn't give the same sort of reward that you get from working on your car on the weekends."""
Apple MacBook Pro Release Date Confirmed In New Report,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2024/10/08/apple-macbook-pro-macbook-air-release-date-leak-new-macbook/,2024-10-08T21:23:23Z,"The new MacBook Pro has long been expected to launch in October. That event is now being reported as happening in the last week of the month -- possibly as late as Halloween to tie in with the horrible holiday -- ahead of a retail release on November 1st.

The launch of three major models of the MacBook Pro (alongside new versions of the Mac Mini and iPad Mini) has been reported by the ever-reliable Mark Gurman. Writing for the Power On newsletter, he states that the MacBook Pro models will include a 14-inch variant running the low-end M4 Apple Silicon chipset, and 14-inch and 16-inch variants running the M4 Pro or and M4 Max chipsets.

Missing from that list is any sign of a consumer-focused MacBook Air; the M4 MacBook Pro stands as the lowest-priced laptop in this round of updates. Previously the M4 MacBook Pro has been a bit of a shell game as it is built around the MacBook Air internals, but adding a fan to increase the power on tap from the M4 chipset. The Air is expected to launch late in Q1 2025 (around the same time as the next-generation iPhone SE).

The Apple Silicon M4 was launched in May 2024. For the first time, Apple's new M series debuted not in a Mac but in an iPad, the seventh generation of the iPad Pro. Mac fans will have been waiting nearly six months for an M4 MacBook when the laptops hit the shelves in November.

No doubt Apple will be leaning heavily ito generative AI on the new MacBooks. The awkwardly backronymed Apple Intelligence was the prime selling point at the iPhone 16 launch -- even if Apple is still to release the software. With Microsoft's focus on generative AI in Windows 11, macOS will need to implement Apple Intelligence quickly if it does not want to be left further behind.

Two generative AI features being tested -- and likely to be found in macOS Sequoia when it launches with the new MacBooks -- are Writing Tools, which helps summarise and rewrite text in a select number of apps, and improvements Sri, which allows for more natural language requests to be made to the existing voice-based assistant.

Given the rapid explosion of generative AI tools in the last twelve months, this feels more like a taster of AI rather than Apple being at the top of its game, ready to change the landscape by arriving late with a full toolbox.

Still, with generative AI features delayed on the iPhone, arriving late on the MacBook feels on brand for Apple Intelligence."

Hurricane Milton Live Updates: Storm Now A Category 5 En Route To Florida,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/10/08/hurricane-milton-live-updates-storm-now-a-category-5-en-route-to-florida/,2024-10-08T21:13:54Z,"Hurricane Milton has become a Category 5 storm -- again -- as it continues to move across the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida, where millions have been told to evacuate as forecasters warn it could be be ""one of the most destructive hurricanes on record"" for the west-central part of the state.

President Joe Biden addressed the country from the White House Tuesday morning and called Hurricane Milton ""a matter of life and death."" He encouraged Florida residents in the path of the storm to evacuate ""now"" and postponed a planned international trip to Germany and Angola ""in order to oversee preparations for and the response to Hurricane Milton."" Vice President Kamala Harris and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have been in a strange he-said-she-said about the incoming storm, with Harris accusing DeSantis of not taking her calls and ""playing political games"" Desanis said Harris ""has no role in this"" and that he's been communicating just fine with Biden, who also said he has been in touch. Biden said he gave DeSantis his personal phone number and told him to call if there is anything the federal government can do to help. Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said in an interview with CNN, ""I can say without any dramatization whatsoever: If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you're going to die.""

Tampa International Airport closed at 9 a.m. Tuesday with plans to reopen ""as soon as it is safe"" later this week and Orlando International Airport will close at 8 a.m. Wednesday. Almost 1,000 flights into and out of the United States were delayed as of Tuesday afternoon with another 700 canceled. More than 1,500 flights scheduled for Wednesday have been canceled, Reuters reported, and major airlines have told passengers they can change their plans without paying a fare difference. Walt Disney World Resort was open and running as usual Tuesday, and the company said it is monitoring the weather and will make adjustments as needed. Universal Resort Orlando announced Tuesday afternoon it will close at 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday and remain closed Thursday. Legoland Florida Resort and SeaWorld Orlando will both be closed on Wednesday and Thursday, and Busch Gardens Tampa is now closed through Thursday.

Milton will be the second major hurricane to hit Florida in two weeks. Hurricane Helene hit the state on Sept. 26, killing at least 20 in Florida, before going on to devastate parts of the southeastern United States. More than 220 people have died and hundreds more are still missing, with western North Carolina taking the brunt of flooding that the state's governor says wiped communities ""off the map."" In Florida, people are still working to clear debris from Helene as the next storm bears down. Ahead of Hurricane Milton, Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, ordered evacuations for areas near Tampa Bay and for all mobile and manufactured homes by Tuesday night. Lee County, home to Fort Meyers, issued a mandatory evacuation order for the island of Fort Myers Beach. Other mandatory evacuation orders have been issued in Pinellas County, Pasco County and Manatee County. DeSantis on Tuesday said he wasn't sure exactly how many people plan to evacuate for Hurricane Milton, but that he thinks those who saw Hurricane Helene will be particularly motivated to leave the area.

Federal Emergency Management Agency has said it is grappling with ""extremely damaging"" false narratives circulating about Hurricane Helene, which hit the U.S. two weeks ago. FEMA chief Deanne Criswell said misinformation about the storm and the federal government's response is the ""worst"" she's ever seen as former President Donald Trump and his allies slam the agency. Trump incorrectly claimed FEMA couldn't respond appropriately to the storm because it diverted so much money to helping migrants on the order of Vice President Kamala Harris. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the agency is ""meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have."" Other rumors include that FEMA has been withholding aid from areas that have historically voted Republican and that the agency is only giving $750 to disaster survivors to support their recovery."
6 Most Undervalued Stocks To Buy In November 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/op-undervalued-stocks-to-buy-november-2024/,2024-10-08T21:13:48Z,"The big investing news recently is the Fed's long-awaited interest rate reduction. Although a strong jobs report has dampened hopes for another aggressive cut, rates will get lower in 2025. That should benefit capital-intensive industries like technology, but it will also trim your income on cash deposits.

You can counter the income change by shifting undeployed cash into dividend stocks, where yields will look more attractive as interest rates fall. That's why this month's undervalued stock list focuses on dividend payers -- specifically, stocks that have a history of raising dividends over time. Below I highlight six dividend-payers that may be undervalued.

To identify these undervalued stocks, I screened the U.S. stock exchanges for companies meeting these criteria:

I ordered the resulting stocks from largest to smallest in terms of market capitalization. Note that oil and gas companies comprise half of this list, so these best stock picks are not intended to be a diversified portfolio.

Below I'll discuss each of these undervalued stocks in more detail. Stock prices and related percentages and ratios are as of October 6, with data sourced from StockAnalysis.com and MarketBeat.com.

Comcast is a diversified media company that operates around the world. The company provides broadband and wireless connectivity services to consumers and businesses. Comcast also owns NBCUniversal, which produces and distributes entertainment content and operates theme parks.

Comcast stock is a frequent member of undervalued stock lists, partly because the company has struggled to demonstrate consistent growth in market value over the last few years. Still, there are important pieces in place. Comcast has reach, somewhat sticky connectivity customers and complementary businesses that should provide synergies.

Realizing those synergies has been a challenge for Comcast. This is one reason why some analysts have lowered their price targets recently. However, the company does generate significant cash, which funds a nice dividend and share repurchases. Shareholders who are willing can get paid to wait for Comcast to realize its potential. The current quarterly dividend of $0.31 is up from $0.27 in January 2023.

CVS is a diversified healthcare business. The company owns a retail pharmacy and clinic network, manages pharmacy benefits and provides health coverage through Aetna, the health care payer CVS purchased in 2018.

CVS stock looks like a bargain, but investors disagree on the company's outlook. CVS has had issues in all three business segments, from retail to health insurance. CNBC recently reported the company is weighing options to revive the business and maximize shareholder value.

The strategic review includes input from major shareholder and hedge fund Glenview Capital. Glenview owns about $700 million worth of CVS, so its team is motivated to maximize CVS's value.

In response to disappointing earnings, CVS is working on reducing costs and repricing insurance premiums. As with Comcast, CVS shareholders can collect a competitive dividend while they wait for a turnaround to take shape.

U.S. Bancorp provides a range of financial services to individuals, businesses, agencies and other financial institutions. The service set includes depository accounts, credit cards, loans, mortgages, wealth management, treasury management, commercial loans and merchant services.

Net interest margin or NIM is a primary profitability indicator for banks. This is the difference between the interest rate the bank charges on loans and the interest paid on savings accounts and certificates of deposits.

USB's net interest margin in the second quarter of 2024 was 2.67, which is 20 basis points below the average for domestic banks. However, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsey Graseck points out that USB's strength in variable-rate deposits will be an advantage as the Fed lowers interest rates. The rates on those deposits will fall, which should support higher NIM.

U.S. Bank additionally pays the highest dividend yield among these undervalued stock picks. The $0.50 per share quarterly dividend is up from $0.48 last year.

Coterra Energy explores, develops and produces natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs). The company's assets are primarily in Texas, Pennsylvania and Oklahoma in the Permian Basin, Marcellus Shale and Anadarko Basin, respectively.

Coterra has a history of disciplined capital deployment and operational efficiency. The company participates in the oil and natural gas markets, and can adjust production and capital allocation according to market conditions. This is an advantage CEO Tom Jorden describes as ""significant investment optionality between oil and gas.""

In the second quarter of 2024, Coterra increased revenue 6.7% despite oversupply and lower pricing in the natural gas markets. Coterra also reaffirmed its commitment to returning at least 50% of its annual free cash flow to shareholders.

Murphy Oil explores and produces oil and natural gas. The company's exploratory assets are in Vietnam, Cote d'Ivoire, Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. Producing assets are in Canada and the U.S.

In 2022, Murphy Oil's leadership team announced a capital strategy to reduce debt, strengthen its balance sheet and return value to shareholders. Since the second quarter 2022, the company has reduced long-term debt to $1.2 billion from $2.2 billion. Total liabilities have also declined to $4.3 billion from $6 billion.

The company has also added to its share repurchase authorization and raised its quarterly dividend. The $0.30 dividend is up $0.05 from 2022. Going forward, Murphy will allocate at least 50% of its adjusted free cash flow to shareholder returns, with the remainder to fund balance sheet optimization.

Northern Oil and Gas acquires minority interests in premium oil and gas assets that are run by leading operators. By leaving the operations to other companies, NOG remains focused on deploying capital to high-potential drilling assets in the U.S. to deliver returns to shareholders.

NOG invests in high-return oil and gas assets but does not operate them. In this way, the company's relatively small team can focus on evaluating acquisition opportunities and executing on the best of them. Also, the company's position in the industry as the premium buyer of non-operated assets provides access to the best deals.

NOG owns roughly 300,000 acres and has completed almost $5 billion worth of acquisitions. Despite the sizable portfolio, the company delivers industry-leading operational efficiency.

In the second quarter, NOG reported revenues of $560 million, up from $476 million in the prior-year quarter. Income from operations declined to $218 million from $234 million due to higher production expenses and higher depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses.

After the quarter-end, NOG increased its share repurchase authorization by $150 million and raised its quarterly dividend 5% to $0.42.

Dividend-paying value stocks can deliver income plus appreciation over time. Prioritizing companies that are committed to raising their dividend payouts can help you shift into a lower interest-rate environment in 2025 with ease."
3 Top Stocks To Buy Now After The Fed Rate Cut,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-stocks-to-buy-now-after-fed-rate-cut/,2024-10-08T21:13:42Z,"The Federal Reserve committee inaugurated the much-anticipated interest rate cut cycle in mid-September, slashing half-a-percentage point off its benchmark rates without waiting to hit its actual 2% inflation target. The objective of the bigger-than-expected rate cut was to avert a recession, when a weaker-than-expected July jobs report officially triggered the Sahm Rule-a historical recession indicator that has a consistent 100% (well, almost) accuracy rate for every recession since the early 1970s. This gives rise to a few questions like:

The Federal Reserve launched its interest rate cut cycle on September 18, by aggressively slashing 50 basis points off benchmark rates, lowering the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%. The federal funds rate represents the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans to fulfill their reserve requirements. Banks are mandated by law to hold a reserve equal to a specific percentage of their deposits, referred to as the reserve requirement to ensure that bank is capable of meeting sudden withdrawals.

This is the first rate cut in four years since the Fed's emergency response to pandemic shutdowns in March 2020. Another half-percentage point reduction before this year-end is likely in the cards with an additional percentage-point cut anticipated in 2025.

The Fed raised interest rates from March 2022 to July 2023, to ease inflation that surged to the highest levels in more than four decades. In June 2022, inflation in the U.S. reached a whopping 9.1%, as prices and demand soared amid pandemic-disrupted supply constraints and unprecedented government stimulus programs that pumped about $5 trillion into the economy. When inflation shoots up, the Fed Reserve typically steps in to cool the inflation by raising interest rates and making borrowing more expensive. This brings down spending and demand thereby inflation.

The corollary to rising interest rates is an increase in borrowing costs for businesses as well, which in turn triggers cost-cutting, slowdown in expansion initiatives, layoffs and lesser new hires. This leads to an increase in the unemployment rate, which was 4.1% in September, up from 3.8% in the same month last year. A rise in unemployment rate alongside a slowdown in hiring has renewed recession concerns.

With the half-a-percentage cut, the Fed is hoping for a soft landing, a scenario in which the economy slows sufficiently to reduce inflation without entering a recession. The Fed's mandate is to restore price stability, while trying not to increase unemployment, even as its 2% inflation target appears within reach. Experts opine that a soft landing is plausible but far from guaranteed.

The current inflation rate is 2.5%, the lowest since February 2021, and lower than the long-term average of 3.28%. The fact that the Fed did not wait until the 2% inflation target was hit clearly shows where its priorities lie now-to avoid a recession.

Historically accurate and reliable recession indicators like the Sahm Rule are now facing skepticism because the pandemic has disrupted normal business activity and complicated forecasting efforts. The Sahm Rule, named after former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, states that a recession may happen when the three-month moving average of the national unemployment rate rises by 0.50 percentage points or more when compared to its low during the previous 12 months. The Sahm Rule has maintained an impressive accuracy rate of nearly 100% for every recession since the early 1970s. The only exception occurred in November 1976, when the rule was triggered without a corresponding or subsequent recession.

The Sahm Rule reading was 0.53% for July when the unemployment rate hit 4.3%. However, the rule's inventor Sahm herself rebutted the surge of catastrophic narratives, stating that ""I am not concerned that, at this moment, we are in a recession."" in an interview with Fortune. However, she also added later ""I think the recession odds, given what we're seeing in the labor market, are increasing."" While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was slightly dismissive of the Sahm Rule as more of a ""statistical regularity"" than an ""economic rule."" Sahm believes the rule shouldn't be dismissed as it's been very accurate over time and noted that ""recessions can build slowly, and then come quickly.""

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dipped from 4.3% in July to 4.2% in August and 4.1% in September showing improvements ahead of the upcoming elections in November. In September, the U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs exceeding estimates for 150,000 new jobs. The upbeat September jobs report should silence concerns about an impending disaster at least for now.

Nevertheless, unemployment rates will be a key data point to watch going forward. Any material rise in unemployment and fall in hiring may likely hit consumer spending, which has thus far been resilient because of strong wage gains. It is natural for people to cut back on spending when facing unemployment or the threat of losing a job.

High interest rates incentivize the consumer to save money, while lower interest rates tend to influence the consumer to borrow, spend and invest. Consumer spending is the main driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

Fed rate cuts are expected to be most impactful for credit cards that have variable interest rates. The previous Fed rate hike cycle has pushed the variable interest rates on credit cards close to all-time highs of above 21% currently, from around 14.6% in March 2022 when the rate hikes began. As the rate cut cycle unfolds, credit card rates will likely ease below 20%, offering some degree of relief for borrowers.

Mortgage rates for both 15-year and 30-year fixed loans are typically linked to Treasury yields and the overall economy, are likely to decrease slightly but are unlikely to return to the lows seen in the last decade. Currently, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage hovers around 6.2%. Experts predict these rates will remain between 6% and 6.5%, with the possibility of dipping below 6%. However, elevated home prices may still deter potential home buyers.

Auto loans are fixed with the average rate on a five-year new car loan being 6.8% in the second quarter, sharply higher than the 4% levels at the beginning of rate hikes. While the easing of rates may encourage car buyers who have pushed-out on purchases, the limiting factor could still be higher vehicle prices and lack of incentives for buyers.

The fixed nature of Federal student loan rates also means that a rate cut may have no impact on these borrowers, because these interest rates don't change over the loan term.

Savings rates have benefitted from the rate hike cycle. A high-yield savings account (HYSA) offers nearly 5% interest, while top interest rates from certificate of deposit (CD) instruments range from 4.00% to 5%. While these interest rates could decline, the opportunity still exists to secure a HYSA or CD before rates drop further.

A research study by Hartford Funds shows that 7 of the 11 Fed rate cutting periods from 1980 to 2024 were accompanied by recessions. While recession is not a desirable condition, how does it impact the stock market? Here are some interesting observations.

An analysis by Hartford Funds of 22 Fed rate-cutting cycles since 1928 revealed that the S&P 500 benchmark index on average outperformed government bonds and corporate bonds in the 12 months after the Fed started cutting interest rates. The average 12-month real return (after adjusting for inflation) from the date of first rate cut for U.S. stocks (represented by the S&P 500 index) has been 11% vs. 5% returns for government bonds and 6% returns for corporate bonds and 2% returns for cash.

The average returns of the stock market in the 22 rate cut cycles is even more impressive considering that in 16 out of 22 cycles the U.S. economy was already in a recession when the rate cuts were initiated or entered a recession within a 12 month period.

During the non-recessionary, rate-cut cycles the stock market returned a solid 17% on average (in the 12-month period after the first rate cut) vs. 2% for government bonds, 4% for corporate bonds and 3% for cash. In the event of a recessionary, rate-cut period, the stock market still returned a positive 8% on average vs. 7% for government and corporate bonds and 2 % for cash (in the 12-month period after the first rate cut.)

While these stock market returns seem solid, investors should remember that this is an average value for 22 rate cut cycles. The stock market suffered heavy losses too during recessionary periods. In 6 out of 22 rate cut cycles, stock market returns fluctuated widely between a negative 10% to negative 45%.

After the much touted ""great rotation"" into small-cap stocks, the focus is shifting to mid-cap stocks, because investors may be looking at a situation where small-caps may still be risky and large caps still too expensive. Until the Fed achieves the targeted soft landing, recession worries will continue to linger at the backdrop. Besides, the longer-for-higher interest rates have also triggered concerns about a slower-than-anticipated Fed rate easing cycle.

With stronger fundamentals (higher profitability and solid balance sheet) vs. small-caps and attractive valuations vs. large-caps, mid-caps seem better positioned to benefit from the present Fed rate cuts. Yet another solid reason for the pivot to mid-caps is the historical outperformance of mid-caps vs. large caps and small caps in the first 3 and 12 months subsequent to the first Fed rate cut. According to Goldman Sachs, the S&P 400 mid-cap index has been an outperformer since 1984 vs. the S&P 500 (large-caps) and Russell 2000 (small-caps) in the 3 and 12 months following the first Fed first rate cut. Presently, Goldman Sachs projects a 13% return for the S&P 400 index over the next 12 months.

Elf Beauty qualifies as a high growth beauty company, having grown sales and market share for 22 straight quarters, and averaging at least 20% sales growth per quarter. Over the past five years, Elf has expanded its top one/two positions from across eight segments in the color cosmetics category to 18 segments, which now account for over 80% of its Elf cosmetics sales. The company's ""Holy Grail"" approach centers on creating value versions of prestige products to align with consumer preferences. For reference, the average price point for Elf is about $6.50 vs. around $9.50 for legacy mass cosmetics brands and more than $20 for prestige brands. Elf's recent Bronzing Drops is comparable to a prestige product in the market at a third of the price. This strategy has helped solidify Elf's outperformance in the cosmetics category.

Solid market share gains: Elf Beauty's color cosmetics business continues to be a category outperformer. A 26% growth across track channels in the first quarter vs. a 1% decline for the category, has helped ELF grow its cosmetics market share to 12.3% presently. This represents a more than 2x increase from 5.7% market share in the same quarter three years ago. ELF expects to double its cosmetics market share again in a few years.

Shelf-space gains with Walmart, top share with Target, Opportunities at groceries, drug stores: With Target, a long-standing customer, Elf Cosmetics is the number one brand for six quarters in a row with its share rising from 13% to 21%. A 50% shelf space gain from 8 feet to 12 feet at Walmart is commendable, but still underpenetrated vs. legacy brands that have a 16 feet to 20 feet shelf space. The opportunities for expansion are attractive at Target, Walmart and Alta, alongside growth at grocery and drug stores, where ELF currently has a much smaller footprint.

Maximizing Brand Performance with Retail Partners: Elf proactively refreshes up to 20% of its retail assortment annually, leveraging insights from its digital business and beauty squad loyalty programs. This strategy has doubled its average sales per SKU over the past five years, making it a highly productive brand in terms of dollar sales per foot basis with retailers.

Growing Skincare business: Elf Beauty hopes to replicate the success in its cosmetics business across its skincare segment. For the latest first quarter, Elf SKIN grew 45% in track channels, vs. category growth of 1.4%. Elf SKIN has roughly 2% market share as of the first quarter vs. 14% share for the leading skin care brand. ELF's Naturium acquisition from last year should also help unlock growth in the skin category.

International expansion opportunities: International sales accounted for 16% of ELF's total first-quarter sales, up from 13% a year ago, but is still underpenetrated vs. global peers that have a 70% exposure to international sales. International expansion represents a key growth runway for ELF.

Upbeat Guidance: ELF recently raised guidance for fiscal 2025 (ending on March 31, 2025), now expecting adjusted EPS of $3.36 to $3.41, on sales of $1.28 billion to $1.30 billion, from prior expectations of $3.20 to $3.25 EPS on sales of $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion. The revised guidance compares more favorably with year-ago EPS of $3.18 on revenues of $1.02 billion.

ELF Stock Sell-off presents opportunity: Despite these positive developments, ELF stock trades way off its 52-week intra-day high of $221.83 reached in early March. After a couple of attempts in late June and mid July to recapture the highs of the year, the stock has fallen sharply amid concerns regarding the sustainability of its growth rates above 20%. However, it still has a Strong Buy rating from 16 Wall Street analysts.

Medpace is a full-service clinical contract research organization providing Phase I-IV clinical development services for the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Medpace calls itself as a CRO trusted by biotechs with a focus on small to mid-sized biopharma customers that represented more than 95% of its 2023 revenues. With an estimated 5% market share in the small and mid-sized biopharma space, Medpace sees an estimated core addressable biopharma CRO market of $28 billion.

Solid growth trends in revenue, profit: Top line has grown at a nearly 22% CAGR from $704.6 million in 2018 to $1.89 billion in 2023, while net income has grown four-fold from $73.2 million or $1.97/share in 2018 to $282.8 million or $8.88 per share in 2023.

Attractive Free Cash Flow characteristics: Medpace has attractive free cash flow (FCF) characteristics with FCF growing from $138.7 million in 2018 to $396.7 million in 2023. Ebitda-FCF conversion has remained above 100% since 2019.

Upbeat outlook: For 2024, revenue is expected to be between $2.125 billion and $2.175 billion, representing year-on-year growth of 12.7% to 15.3%. Net income is expected to be $361 million to $383 million or $11.24 per share to $11.93 per share and Ebitda to be $430.0 million to $460.0 million.

Concerns over cancellation appear baked into stock price now: While announcing second-quarter earnings results, the company cited some order cancellations that brought its book-to-bill ratio to 1.04 for the quarter vs. prior expectations for 1.2. Medpace also cautioned that the book-to-bill numbers could be flat to slightly higher sequentially in the third quarter. Some analysts downgraded the stock to a Hold/Neutral rating in late September citing weaker bookings growth coupled with cancellations as one of the reasons.

Are the concerns overrated? In the earnings call, Medpace said it does not see a prolonged pullback, or does not view the cancellations as a pattern that's going to continue. Besides, a book-to-bill of 1.04 for one quarter is not earth shattering, because it is still above 1, implying strong demand. Medpace sees the third quarter book-to-bill to be at 1.04 or slightly higher and in the first quarter the number was at 1.2. Also, Backlog as of June 30, 2024 was a solid $2.9 billion, up 13.7% year-on-year, and Medpace expects to convert about $1.585 billion of this backlog to revenue over the next twelve months. Medpace even raised its profit guidance for 2024 to show that it continues to anticipate industry-leading organic revenue growth and profitability despite the challenges in backlog growth. The backlog concerns appear to be priced into the MEDP stock that is already trading well below its mid-July highs of $459.77.

Upcoming catalyst: A key catalyst for the Medpace stock is the upcoming third-quarter earnings report, slated for release on October 21, after market close. Overall the MEDP stock has a moderate buy rating from analysts.

Skechers, dubbed as the comfort footwear giant, is a Fortune 500 company that makes lifestyle and performance footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. International sales represented more than 60% of its 2023 top line. The comfort footwear maker operates via wholesale and direct-to-consumer (DTC) business segments, with wholesale representing 56% of sales in 2023, and the rest coming from DTC.

Record second-quarter sales: Despite currency and supply chain headwinds, regulatory obstacles in India, and a lackluster 6/18 holiday in China, Skechers delivered record second-quarter sales of $2.16 billion, up 7.2% year over year driven by continued strength in its international DTC business and significant improvement in its domestic wholesale business.

Solid growth trends in revenue, profits: Skechers has grown sales from $5.2 billion in 2019 to $8 billion in 2023, and earnings per share from $2.25 to $3.49. Fiscal 2024 outlook is even better with sales expected between $8.88 billion and $8.98 billion and EPS expected to be $4.08 to $4.18.

Expanding margins: Skechers sells at affordable price points, yet gross margins have remained above 47% since 2019 exceeding 50% in 2023, while operating margins have been mostly in the mid-to-high single digits, with the exception of a drop to 2.9% in 2020. The margin story gets even better in the first half of 2024, with gross margins at 53.7% and operating margin at 11.5%.

One shoe does not fit all but Skechers fits all into one shoe: Considerable thought goes into the design of Skechers footwear to meet the needs of every walk of life. Under a partnership with John Deere, Skechers recently launched a footwear line for agricultural professionals, construction workers, and outdoor enthusiasts. Made of waterproof materials, the footwear line has interesting features like composite toe protection, nano carbon safety and Poron XRD metatarsal protection-Poron XRD being a flexible, lightweight, breathing foam, which hardens when impacted and forms a protective shell around the foot, absorbing up to 90% of the impact energy. Skechers has also integrated its slip-resistant and electrical hazard-rated technologies into the new offering.

Reasonably attractive valuation: Skechers stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 16.2x based on $4.08 eps guidance for 2024 (at the low end of the range). This is lower than its own five-year historical average of 21.2x. If the multiple re-rates to a conservative 19x (at the midpoint of the multiple range), it would still represent about 17% upside from current price levels. The footwear maker's expectations to achieve $10 billion in sales by 2026, also implies 13% upside potential from current stock levels, upon applying the current forward price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 1.13x. The stock may have 13%-17% upside potential from current levels.

The U.S. economy is currently not in a recession. The Fed rate easing cycle may likely achieve a soft landing of the economy, although there are no guarantees and historical evidence points otherwise, at least most of the time. Monthly Jobs data will continue to be a critical watch point. Even as recession fears linger, mid-cap stocks could be a preferred investment over large-cap or small-cap stocks, as mid-caps are at the confluence of reasonable valuations and stronger fundamentals. The mid-cap stocks highlighted in the article enjoy profitable growth with upbeat future prospects."

Dodgers' Dave Roberts thinks Manny Machado threw ball at him in dugout 'with intent' after 'unsettling' video,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/dodgers-dave-roberts-thinks-manny-machado-threw-ball-him-dugout-with-intent-after-unsettling-video,2024-10-08T21:12:45Z,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Game 3 of the NLDS between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres already has pent up tension after Game 2's incidents of thrown objects, players jawing at each other from opposite teams, and the historic rivalry sprinkled on top.

But Padres star third baseman Manny Machado throwing a ball into the Dodgers' dugout - a dugout he used to share as a member of the team - has gone all the way to the MLB league office for investigation, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Manager Dave Roberts also believes that Machado wasn't simply putting the ball out of play with Padres pitcher Yu Darvish getting another from his catcher.

Roberts said he thought Machado purposefully whipped the ball at the dugout, which almost hit him, after seeing video that has gone viral.

""I didn't notice it at the time. I really didn't,"" Roberts said on Monday, per the New York Post. ""I didn't notice it. I did see the video and it was unsettling. Obviously, I have a relationship with Manny from years past. There was intent behind it. It didn't almost hit me because there was a net.

""And that was very bothersome. If it was intended at me, I would be very - it's pretty disrespectful. So I don't know his intent. I don't want to speak for him. But I did see the video. And the ball was directed at me with something behind it. But I don't know what led to that. I didn't see it in real time, but I did see the video.""

PADRES' JURICKSON PROFAR TRIED GOODWILL GESTURE WITH DODGERS FAN MOMENTS BEFORE OBJECTS WERE THROWN AT HIM

Machado was at the center of one aspect of the Game 2 drama, as he was seen yelling at Dodgers starter Jack Flaherty, who told him to ""sit the f--- down, motherf-----"" after striking him out in the sixth inning.

Machado, now at third base, continued to have a war of words with Flaherty, and appeared to say he'd meet him after the game.

Flaherty explained why they were barking at each other.

""He did some s--- between innings where he throws the ball at our dugout and everybody kind of catches the tail end of it, which is me and him going at it,"" Flaherty said, referencing the ball thrown in the direction of Roberts. ""I was sitting there for my team, I wasn't going at him, but he was throwing the ball at our dugout and the umpires went over immediately to tell him - don't know what their conversation was, but our dugout was fired up because there ain't no reason for that.""

It is normal for players to toss balls out of play when they're not in use, sometimes trickling them toward the opposing dugout. But Machado clearly put some velocity on the throw, though he said there was nothing behind the reason for doing so.

""I throw balls all the time into dugouts. Both dugouts,"" he said, per The Post. ""They have bat boys, you throw the ball back in there.""

Roberts added that he shook his head at Machado while the third baseman and Flaherty were going back and forth, with his reasoning being to dissuade Machado that Fernando Tatis Jr. was hit on purpose by his pitcher the inning prior.

""As a baseball person, anyone understands that you don't do that, intentionally put the leadoff man on base, with three, four, five coming up behind. It just makes no sense,"" Roberts said.

With Jurickson Profar dealing with objects thrown at him from the stands, the Padres bullpen dealing with the same, and the animosity between players, it's safe to say there is bad blood between these two teams and fan bases heading into a crucial Game 3 on Tuesday night at Petco Park in San Diego."
Islamic group calls out Jets for firing Robert Saleh after wearing Lebanon pin amid Israel war,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/islamic-group-calls-out-jets-firing-robert-saleh-after-wearing-lebanon-pin-amid-israel-war,2024-10-08T21:12:39Z,"Emmanuel Acho reacts to the New York Jets firing HC Robert Saleh after a 20-36 record and 2-3 start this season.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) released a statement on Tuesday addressing the firing of former New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh.

CAIR called on the Jets and owner Woody Johnson to explain reports that Saleh was escorted out of the building by security following his firing, and also brought up the fact that Saleh was fired just days after wearing a pin with the Lebanese flag amid ongoing attacks on the nation by Israel.

Saleh is of Lebanese descent and was the first Muslim head coach in NFL history.

""We commend Coach Robert Saleh for making history as the first American Muslim head coach in NFL history. Although no one should jump to conclusions about why the Jets fired Coach Saleh, the report that Jets security physically escorted Saleh out of the building does raise concerns about the possible motive for such unusual hostility -- especially given that Saleh wore a Lebanese flag pin at a game just days ago and that owner Woody Johnson is a former Trump administration official who has been accused of making racially charged remarks. We encourage the Jets to thoroughly explain its unusually hostile reported treatment of Coach Saleh,"" the statement read.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Jets for comment multiple times but has not received a response at the time of publication.

Both of Saleh's parents were born in Lebanon and immigrated to the United States ahead of his birth in 1979. Saleh previously wore the Lebanese flag on his arm during a game against the Giants, just weeks after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

Saleh wore that patch during the week that NFL executive vice president of club business Peter O'Reilly released a statement encouraging players to represent their heritage via decals to the back of their helmets with their flags, while coaches added a patch to their team gear.

Saleh's decision to wear the patch in London on Sunday came amid Israel's ongoing strikes on Lebanon and Gaza as it seeks to combat Hamas and Hezbollah.

CAIR's point that Johnson ""has been accused of making racially charged remarks,"" references an investigation in 2020 that never confirmed whether Johnson made those remarks. Johnson was accused of making racist and sexist comments to staff while serving as an ambassador to the United Kingdom under the Trump administration. Johnson was investigated in July 2020 by the State Department watchdog after the allegations.

Johnson denied the allegations in a post on the official X (then known as Twitter) account for the U.S. ambassador to the U.K. that same month.

""I have followed the ethical rules and requirements of my office at all times. These false claims of insensitive remarks about race and gender are totally inconsistent with my longstanding record and values,"" Johnson wrote.

The investigation's findings have never been made public.

At the time, Johnson was not involved with the Jets, as he was tending to his diplomatic duties for Trump. Still, the Jets released a statement regarding the allegations against Johnson and noted his denial of them.

""Since the Johnson family became owners of the New York Jets, the organization has consistently and actively supported, engaged and encouraged the development of many different social justice, diversity, women's, and inclusion initiatives,"" the team said in a statement. ""One of our fundamental principles is treating employees, players, coaches and fans with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, color, religion, or gender. These principles have been established by the Johnson family, which Woody implemented in our organization over the past 20 years.""

Saleh was hired by the Jets in January 2021 while Johnson was in the final month of his duties as ambassador to the U.K. Therefore, the owner did not make the final decision to hire Saleh. It was Johnson's brother, Christopher Johnson, who made the decision to hire Saleh.

When Trump left office and Woody Johnson returned to his duties as Jets owner, he kept Saleh employed for three straight seasons, none of which resulted in trips to the playoffs or winning records. Saleh went 20-36 with New York and never won more than seven games a year while at the helm.

Then, when Saleh was fired on Tuesday, the coach was reportedly escorted out of the team facility by security, according to multiple reports. The most recent head coach to be fired by the Jets, Adam Gase, was fired after the conclusion of his second season and was reportedly not removed by security.

The Jets were off to a 2-3 start this year after losing to the Minnesota Vikings 23-17 in London on Sunday, as New York is among the most penalized teams in the league this year. The Jets have struggled this year despite veteran star quarterback Aaron Rodgers starting all five games this season."
"MLB To Produce, Distribute, And Provide DTC For Guardians, Twins, Brewers In 2025",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2024/10/08/mlb-to-produce-distribute-and-provide-dtc-for-guardians-twins-brewers-in-2025/,2024-10-08T21:12:35Z,"As the bankruptcy of Diamond Sports Group (DSG) continues to unwind, Major League Baseball will take over production, distribution, and a direct-to-consumer streaming option for another three teams in 2025.

As reported last week, DSG announced in a bankruptcy hearing that they planned to address all the remaining MLB clubs under the Bally Sports regional sports network brand, with the Atlanta Braves the exception. Of the 11 clubs, four of them - the Milwaukee Brewers, Minnesota Twins, Cleveland Guardians, and Texas Rangers - all had contracts that have expired with Diamond.

Today, MLB announced that they would be taking over production, providing distribution deals with the likes of DirecTV, Comcast, and more, as well as providing DTC streaming option for the Twins, Guardians, and Brewers. The Rangers will continue to look to their own options for a local deal for next season outside of MLB's offering.

Major League Baseball, which has been the gold standard for streaming since 2002, and has produced games nationally on MLB Network for 16 seasons, already had the Colorado Rockies, San Diego Padres, and Arizona Diamondbacks under such agreements. The Padres and DBacks had both been dropped by Diamond mid-season and had MLB pick up distribution deals in under 24 hours. The league hired former Sinclair Broadcasting and FOX Sports Media Group exec Billy Chambers in 2023 as Executive Vice President, Local Media in anticipation of Diamond's bankruptcy gyrations.

""With the media landscape continuing to evolve, Major League Baseball is committed to serving our fans by ensuring they can see their favorite Clubs, removing blackouts where we can, and ultimately growing the reach of our games,"" said Noah Garden, MLB Deputy Commissioner, Business and Media. ""We are proud to bring Guardians, Brewers and Twins games to their passionate fan bases with the same high-quality production that we have demonstrated in Arizona, Colorado, and San Diego.""

""In addition to expanding reach, Major League Baseball is utilizing resources to provide fans with an outstanding production that features new technology, improved picture quality, and better access to the game and players,"" added Chambers.

According to Major League Baseball, last season, the Guardians reach on its RSN was approximately 1.45 million households and the Twins reached approximately 1.08 million homes. With MLB's direct-to-consumer streaming option, Cleveland's games now can reach up to approximately 4.86 million households (+235%) and Minnesota expands to approximately 4.40 million homes (+307%). With a similar household audience, Milwaukee had a direct-to-consumer streaming option available with their previous local media arrangement and will continue to do so with MLB moving forward.

As to the remaining clubs mired in DSG's bankruptcy or clubs that are seeking to potentially leave otherwise, Diamond has said they are seeking to renew, albeit under deep discounts.

Should those extensions not come to fruition, it opens the door for MLB to shop a package of local rights to streamers, that could include ESPN. With MLB now having six clubs under their umbrella, they would need nearly half of the 30 clubs to make such a package enticing."
Why a federal judge appointed by Ronald Reagan is slamming the Trump immunity ruling,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-trump-immunity-judge-stephen-trott-rcna174539,2024-10-08T21:06:19Z,"Stephen S. Trott, a senior judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote in an op-ed that the decision in Trump v. United States has left us ""a kingdom within our republic.""

The Supreme Court decision granting Donald Trump broad criminal immunity has had no shortage of critics. But it's still notable that a federal judge just came out with an op-ed in The Washington Post blasting the ruling authored by Chief Justice John Roberts.

In the opinion piece published Monday, Stephen S. Trott, a senior judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote:

It's worth underscoring here that Trott was appointed to the federal bench by a Republican president, Ronald Reagan. He wrote that the result of the ruling from the court's GOP majority in Trump v. United States is that: ""The president and his agents are free to break the laws that apply to every other person in the nation.""

Not just the fact but the breadth of Trott's critique is noteworthy, in his estimation of how the ruling would apply beyond former presidents. That's because a question raised by the immunity decision is whether and how it would extend beyond Trump (or another former president), because the decision focused on former presidents. The issue could need further clarification from the justices if it arises in a case against someone who was allegedly engaged in criminality with or at the direction of a president.

At any rate, Trott's criticism is correct as he concludes: ""Nowhere in the Constitution or the Federalist is there any provision, suggestion, or hint that the president can with impunity commit crimes against the state or lawlessly abuse citizens without recourse. But that is what the Supreme Court has left us: a kingdom within our republic."""

The Ukrainian Air Force's New Bomber Brigade Will Fly Supersonic French Jets,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/10/08/the-ukrainian-air-forces-new-bomber-brigade-will-fly-supersonic-french-jets/,2024-10-08T20:59:01Z,"The first ex-French Dassault Mirage 2000-5s are scheduled to arrive in Ukraine in early 2025.

Ex-French Dassault Mirage 2000-5 fighters will arrive in Ukraine in the first quarter of next year, French defense minister Sébastien Lecornu announced Tuesday.

But first, the delta-wing supersonic fighters ""will be equipped with new equipment,"" Lecornu wrote, including systems for air-ground combat and electronic warfare.

Lecornu's comments seem to confirm what observers have suspected since France pledged surplus Mirage 2000s to the Ukrainian war effort back in June: the Ukrainian air force will arm its former French jets with the same French-made munitions it's already hanging on its old Soviet-made Mikoyan MiG-29, Sukhoi Su-24 and Sukhoi Su-27 warplanes. These include SCALP-EG cruise missiles and Hammer glide bombs.

Armed for precision attacks on ground targets as far as 155 miles away, the single-seat, single-engine Mirages will reinforce the Ukrainian air force's aging, swing-wing Su-24s. Meanwhile, the approximately 85 -- or 84, now that one has crashed -- ex-European Lockheed Martin F-16s Ukraine is getting will reinforce the only slightly younger MiG-29s and Su-27s.

Surviving French Mirage 2000-5s -- out of the 37 ""dash-fives"" Dassault built for the French air force in the 1990s -- are scheduled to retire between now and 2029, but Lecornu has said their replacements, new Dassault Rafales, could arrive early and speed up the process.

With a little bureaucratic urgency, there's no reason France couldn't equip the Ukrainian air force with a couple of dozen Mirage 2000-5s through 2025 -- enough to expand the air force's existing bomber unit, the 7th Tactical Aviation Brigade, or form a new brigade.

A second bomber brigade is the likelier outcome, given how much the 7th Tactical Aviation Brigade has already expanded in the 31 months since Russia widened its war on Ukraine.

Ukraine inherited around 200 of the 1970s-vintage Su-24s when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Thirty years later, just a dozen or so of the two-seat, twin-engine bombers were still active with the 7th Tactical Aviation Brigade.

Flying into action with gravity bombs, and later glide bombs and cruise missiles, the Su-24s suffered heavy losses. The Russians have shot down no fewer than 18 of the vintage bombers, most of them early in the war before the bombers shifted to strikes with long-range munitions.

That the Ukrainians have lost more Su-24s than they had at the start of the wider war speaks to their determined effort to identify old Su-24 airframes at various storage sites and restore them to flightworthy status. Older pilots and navigators have come out of retirement to fill the jets' cockpits.

In a recent interview with Voice of America, Col. Yevhen Bulatsyk -- the 7th Tactical Aviation Brigade's commander -- said the brigade has ""much more"" now than it did in February 2022. More bombers. More crews.

The Ukrainian air force clearly has plans to retain the Su-24s in service for the foreseeable future. It's even developing a new locally made glide bomb to give the bombers more weapons options.

As Mirage 2000s arrive, they could fill out a new brigade that would fight alongside the battle-hardened 7th Tactical Aviation Brigade, adding mass to the Ukrainian air force's deep strikes on Russian warships, air-defense batteries, headquarters and supply depots in occupied southern and eastern Ukraine.

The ex-French jets will need aircrews and ground crews, of course. According to Lecornu, ""the training of Ukrainian pilots and mechanics continues."""

Jen Psaki: The strategy behind Harris' untraditional media blitz,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/harris-interview-call-her-daddy-media-rcna174531,2024-10-08T20:55:56Z,"For weeks, Republicans have been hemming and hawing about how Vice President Kamala Harris is avoiding the press. Well, it seems they're going to have to find something else to complain about because Harris is in the middle of a media blitz.

On Monday, CBS' ""60 Minutes"" aired an in-depth interview with the vice president, which came a day after Harris appeared on the popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, hosted by Alex Cooper. On Tuesday, Harris' whirlwind day of media appearances includes ""The View"" on ABC, ""The Howard Stern Show"" on SiriusXM radio, and ""The Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" on CBS.

And yet, perhaps predictably, the more traditional, legacy Washington, D.C.-based media outlets are still spitting mad. Politico Playbook is complaining that ""Harris is ... still largely avoiding the media,"" noting ""Most of these are not the types of interviews that are going to press her on issues she may not want to talk about."" The New York Times also focused on the ""friendly"" nature of the interviews, stating the Harris campaign was ""unlikely to place her in front of many aggressive inquisitors.""

Let me give you a little insight into why traditional media is so upset about this. It's not because they think they reach more people; they don't. It's not because they're going to ask different questions than ""60 Minutes."" It's definitely not because they're going to ask more creative or outside-the-box questions than Cooper, the hosts of ""The View"" or Colbert. It's because their relevance relies on being the sole arbiters of asking the questions.

But the problem for them is that the way people consume information and the way the public looks for information have completely evolved -- and I don't say that lightly.

I stood at the front of the White House briefing room and answered questions from a room full of legacy, Washington-based journalists every day because I respect what they do and the role of the press. I also suffered through years of criticism for what was considered a less traditional media strategy, including when I was the communications director for President Barack Obama.

We did things that the traditional press did not deem hard-hitting or presidential enough. Like an interview with Bear Grylls to talk about climate change or an interview with Vice inside a prison to talk about criminal justice reform or, of course, the biggest violation: sitting down with Zach Galifianakis on ""Between Two Ferns"" to talk about health care. Now, I wish I could take credit for that one -- hats off to former Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer -- because it drove hundreds of thousands of people to the online portal where they could sign up for affordable insurance plans.

My point is this: The job of a president is not to satisfy the demands of the major networks or the major daily newspapers. It's to connect with the people who may not be clicking refresh on WhiteHouse.gov or subscribing to any Washington insider newsletters.

And for a presidential candidate, especially when people are already voting, your job is to excite and engage more people to support your candidacy -- people who probably don't watch my show, frankly.

I'm not saying that press conferences or interviews with major networks are bad. They are all important parts of our democracy. But this notion that the only people capable of asking a presidential candidate a question are credentialed members of the White House press corps is, well, as insane as it sounds.

So, if you are the Harris campaign and you know there are no more debates, no more conventions, and have fewer than 30 days left to reach more voters, this plan makes a lot of sense. And right now, having a conversation with Alex Cooper, who has about 5 million listeners per episode, is far more valuable than any interview with a more traditional outlet, maybe even ""60 Minutes."""
Patriots to start rookie Drake Maye as quarterback: reports,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/patriots-start-rookie-drake-maye-quarterback-reports,2024-10-08T20:54:39Z,"After backing up Jacoby Brissett for the first five games of the season, the New England Patriots are reportedly set to name Drake Maye as their starting quarterback.

New England selected the quarterback out of North Carolina with the third overall pick after fielding several offers from teams to move up - ultimately, they decided to stick to their guns.

Brissett was named the starter in training camp, and given the difficulty of their schedule, it made sense to not want to plug in a rookie right away.

Granted, New England did upset the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 1 on the road, but the Pats have since lost four in a row.

Brissett has completed just 58.5% of his passes for two touchdowns, and the Pats are widely regarded as possibly the worst team in the NFL, along with the Carolina Panthers.

A Legacy Of Patient-Centered Transformation - A Conversation With Cleveland Clinic's Dr. Toby Cosgrove,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billfrist/2024/10/08/a-legacy-of-patient-centered-transformation--a-conversation-with-cleveland-clinics-dr-toby-cosgrove/,2024-10-08T20:53:32Z,"This week, my longtime friend Dr. Toby Cosgrove and I had the fun of kicking off the Nashville Healthcare Sessions Conference, hosted by the Nashville Health Care Council. Our opening panel was titled, ""Leading the Charge: A Legacy of Patient-Centered Transformation,"" a title we both took issue with since it implied that if we'd already left a legacy - we were old!

Despite this slight, it did give us the opportunity to reminisce on when we first met - 42 years ago at Massachusetts General Hospital when I was Chief Resident in cardiac surgery and Dr. Cosgrove was already an exceptionally talented cardiac surgeon visiting from the Cleveland Clinic. I remember watching in awe from the other side of the operating room table as he deftly sewed the new coronary artery grafts in our heart patient with perfect textbook precision.

Our paths continued to cross over the years as we each took our own journeys to transform healthcare in ways that better served the patient - Toby as the cardiac surgeon turned innovative, data-driven, genius CEO behind the Cleveland Clinic, setting the global standard for quality care in many specialties; me as the transplant surgeon turned national policymaker and now healthcare company innovator. In recent years, we've come together through organizations like the Health Affairs Council on Health Care Spending and Value and the Aspen Institute's Health Strategy Group.

We always have fun picking each other's brains on the healthcare trends we're seeing and our predictions for the future - and this day was no different. In front of a packed audience, I asked Toby, what made the Cleveland Clinic unique when it came to quality?

Without hesitation, Toby shared how, as head of the cardiac surgery department, he and his fellow cardiac surgeons agreed they should let cardiologists know what the outcomes were of the patients referred to them - a feedback loop that often isn't closed in the healthcare continuum. What began as an annual presentation and shared slides progressed to a polished booklet, then to a book of outcomes data across all Clinic departments, which soon became annual outcome and quality data shared with the public. The Cleveland Clinic was committed to being transparent and accountable for their patients' outcomes.

We had a ""tradition of measuring, measuring, measuring,"" Toby explained, because you can't improve without understanding your results.

I completely agreed with Toby. When I stood up the Vanderbilt Multi-Organ Transplant Center over three decades ago, measuring outcomes was absolutely fundamental to our success and survival - it was how we convinced the federal government and later private insurers to cover nascent transplant procedures. We had to demonstrate we had quality outcomes that justified the high cost of the procedures. This relentless commitment to data measurement, quality and innovation is part of the reason Vanderbilt is now the busiest heart transplant center in the world.

But today's healthcare environment has a number of challenges that make commitment to quality hard. Toby pointed to three key issues:

The first is cost: The average hospital margin is 2% and half the hospitals are running in the red. Inflation is hitting our hospital systems hard.

Second is workforce shortage: ""There are two million unfilled healthcare jobs in the United States,"" Toby explained; 500,000 of those are in nursing, while 50,000 are primary care physicians.

The third challenge is the explosion in knowledge: ""There's 1.8 million medical articles written every year,"" he noted, with the total amount of medical knowledge doubling every 73 days. It takes 13 years before empirically proven knowledge becomes the standard of care - so it's nearly impossible for providers to stay at the cutting edge of their field - and for our patients to receive the very latest in care.

Additionally, we touched on cybersecurity, something that we both agreed was top of mind for all health systems. ""I think there were 200 hospitals hacked in the first half of this past year,"" recalled Toby, explaining that most systems wouldn't be prepared for a cyber-attack. ""I don't think you can accomplish cyber security without blockchain,"" I remarked, citing how slow the healthcare industry has been in adopting this technology. ""I don't think you can,"" Toby confirmed.

As we looked to the future and the bright spots in healthcare today - Toby had a few observations.

On the workforce issue, telemedicine has opened up tremendous new capabilities, although its use has backslid too much since Covid. Toby recounted a personal story of being able to quickly diagnose and treat a poison ivy rash on his daughter with an uploaded photo in a telemedicine consult, rather than spending the time and money to take her to an emergency department. ""Hospitals can't be all things to all people,"" Toby remarked, a lesson he said he learned from his service during the Vietnam War. In Saigon, they triaged in a field hospital then moved to the next treatment location based on type of care needed. Today, we should concentrate people with high tech needs in health systems with just that, while less intensive care needs can be met at lower-tech hospitals or outpatient facilities. A poison ivy case, for example, is a great fit for telemedicine instead of a brick-and-mortar facility.

Finally, Toby shared that, ""AI is the salvation for a lot of the things going on in healthcare today."" It will make providers much more efficient. Ambient scribes will reduce physician burnout and improve patient satisfaction as the doctor spends time conversing rather than entering data into a chart. It will also empower healthcare professionals with more knowledge and will be particularly useful with administrative tasks. Globally, AI will be a gamechanger for the health systems of developing countries, helping them leapfrog a long way ahead.

As Bill Gates and others have said, we overestimate technology in the short run and underestimate it in the long run. Toby and I are both excited and optimistic about the future of healthcare in America, and around the world. The opportunity for more high-quality patient-centered care is just beginning."

"If 2024 polling errors mirror those in 2020 election, Trump 'wins in a blowout,' CNN data guru says",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/2024-polling-errors-mirror-those-2020-election-trump-wins-blowout-cnn-data-guru-says,2024-10-08T20:50:50Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said Tuesday that if the 2024 presidential election polls are as off as they were in 2020, former President Trump ""wins in a blowout.""

Enten broke down current swing state polling numbers between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump, noting that they show a race ""too close to call."" However, he pointed out that polls have been off significantly in recent elections, and if that's the case this time, Trump could win by a landslide.

""But let's say we have a polling miss like we had in 2020,"" Enten told CNN anchor John Berman.

""What happens then? Well, then Donald Trump wins the election in a blowout with 312 electoral votes because he carries all these Great Lake battleground states plus Nevada, plus the other states he was leading in -- Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia,"" he said.

CNN DATA GURU SAYS HARRIS STRUGGLING WITH 'UNDERPERFORMANCE' FROM YOUNG VOTERS AMID TAYLOR SWIFT ENDORSEMENT

The reporter began by displaying the close race numbers between Trump and Harris in the seven battleground states. As his aggregate polls showed, Harris is up by one point in Nevada and Pennsylvania, and up by two in Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump, on the other hand, is up by one in North Carolina and Georgia, and two points up in Arizona.

Enten reminded viewers that these point differences are within the polling margin of error according to FiveThirtyEight, so currently, it's impossible to know who is winning.

He mentioned that on average since 1972 - provided that presidential candidates are polling within ten points of one another ­- swing state polls have an error rate of 3.4 points, so there is room for the actual race to swing in Harris' or Trump's favor when they're within one or two points of each other.

He further noted that in 5% of cases, swing state polling can be off by 9.4 points, making things even less certain for people looking at the polls right now.

""So, the bottom line is, the state polling averages tell us- what it tells us is it's just a race that is too close to call. Maybe one candidate has an advantage over the other one. But the bottom line is, it is way too close to call and it will remain so,"" he said.

Still, Enten offered multiple hypothetical situations, the first one being what the election results would look like if the current swing state polling is 100% accurate. ""If the polls are exactly right, Kamala Harris gets 276 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 262 because she carries those Great Lake battleground states despite losing North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona.""

He then followed up by showing what would happen if polling errors matched those found in the 2020 election. According to Vanderbilt University, polls overstated President Biden's lead over Trump by 3.9 percentage in the two weeks prior to election day, calling it the ""largest polling error since 1980 when support for Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter was overestimated by 6 percentage points.""

Enten argued if today's polls had the similar errors of the last cycle, Trump could walk away with 312 electoral college votes to Harris' 226.

Conversely, Enten discussed what would happen if polling errors predicting a red wave in the 2022 midterm elections appeared on Nov. 5, 2024.

""What happens if we have a polling miss like 2022?"" he asked. ""Well, in that particular case, now, the winner has flipped again. And Kamala Harris wins in a blowout with 319 electoral votes because she retakes those Great Lake battleground states, carries North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona."""

That deal has seemingly evaporated as Iran's foreign minister visits the kingdom on Tuesday to discuss efforts to halt Israel's incursions into Gaza and Lebanon.

""Our dialogue continues regarding the developments in the region to prevent the shameless crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon, in continuation of the crimes in Gaza,"" Iran Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a video broadcast on state media.

He added: ""Starting today, I'll begin a trip to the region, to Riyadh and other capitals, and we will strive for a collective movement from the countries of the region... to stop the brutal attacks in Lebanon.""

The Saudis share a longtime strategic partnership with the U.S. and are the largest purchaser of its weapons. But in recent years, they've had a political rapprochement with Iran.

Last week, Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, reaffirmed their neutrality in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Iran has warned that if ""Israel supporters"" intervene directly, their interests in the region would be targeted. That could mean missile strikes on their oil facilities.

Iran rained some 200 missiles down on Israel last week, many of which were intercepted by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with U.S. assistance.

""The Gulf states think it's unlikely that Iran will strike their oil facilities, but the Iranians are dropping hints they might from unofficial sources. It's a tool the Iranians have against the U.S. and the global economy,"" Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator close to the royal court, said.

In 2019, drones attacked Saudi Arabia's key refinery at Abqaiq, briefly shutting down around 5% of the world's oil supply. Those drones originated in Iran, according to U.S. intelligence.

Prior to Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Biden administration considered a proposed deal, akin to the Abraham Accords, a major priority. This deal aimed to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, including security guarantees and cooperation on civil nuclear matters. For months, the White House had been saying the deal was nearly done.

The prospect of a deal was largely blamed as a catalyst for the Hamas attacks.

OPINION: WHY SAUDI ARABIA MATTERS MORE THAN EVER TO THE US

""I don't think we were ever really that close,"" Robert Greenway, former senior director of the National Security Council, told Fox News Digital.

""We were closest probably in the waning days of the Trump administration, but we knew that that would be a second-term issue if there was to be one, and obviously that didn't play out. I don't know that the Biden-Harris administration ever took it that terribly seriously.""

Just before the Hamas attack, a group of 20 Democratic senators made clear their opposition to the treaty, voicing concerns over Saudi Arabia's human rights record and that a peaceful nuclear energy program might one day be converted to a military one to produce a nuclear weapon.

And Oct. 7 changed the Saudis' calculus: they now demand a plan for a Palestinian state.

""If anyone believes there was a chance of getting the House or Senate in an election year with virtually no majority, getting anything as controversial as a security treaty, with Saudi Arabia - permission for them to enrich with our blessing and support - I don't know if anyone credibly believes that that was ever possible.""

Former deputy national security adviser Victoria Coates was optimistic that the Saudis could be brought back into the fold.

""From what I'm hearing from both sides, it's when, not if,"" she said. ""There are various reasons you might want to wait to find out what the makeup of the Congress is going to be... you're going to need supportive majorities in the Senate to get [a civil nuclear agreement] through."""

Two Jewish Democrats reflect on Congressional efforts to combat surge in antisemitism,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5125793/jewish-democrats-antisemitism-congress,2024-10-08T20:41:44Z,"Reps. Jared Moskowitz, Kathy Manning, Josh Gottheimer, and Dan Goldman speak at a press conference in April about allegations of harassment and antisemitism against Jewish students at Columbia University. Stefan Jeremiah/AP/FR171756 AP hide caption

As Congress continues to deal with the policy and political implications of Hamas' attack on southern Israel one year ago, lawmakers are also reflecting on the rise of antisemitism in the United States.

Jewish Americans represent about 2 percent of the population and were the target of 16 percent of hate crimes in 2023 - a surge of over 60 percent from the year before, according to the FBI's hate crime statistics report. Current figures are likely higher, given reports that anti-Jewish animus has been higher since Oct. 7 and the report only captures a few months of data post-attack.

North Carolina Rep. Kathy Manning and Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz, two Jewish Democratic lawmakers, are working to address the issue despite political divisions within Congress and their own party.

""There's been a change in this country from, you know, the swastika on a wall that happened once in a while or someone being accosted on the street once in a while to the point where you can't even keep up with all the antisemitic attacks that are going on,"" Moskowitz said.

Manning, who co-chairs the House bipartisan task force for combatting antisemitism, said she's been tracking the rise in anti-Jewish hate over the last year.

""I think it's important to remember the attacks began before Israel had any response, before they sent any troops into Gaza,"" she said. ""We saw people being threatened. We saw violent language used against Jews. And, of course, we've seen the eruption of antisemitic behavior on college campuses across the country.""

The rise in demonstrations on college campuses last spring was the subject of various committee hearings in the halls of Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought a Republican delegation to visit Columbia University. Manning and Moskowitz were part of a separate visit with Jewish Democratic lawmakers.

""We didn't go to Columbia because we had a problem with students protesting. They have every right to protest,"" said Moskowitz. ""We went to Columbia because Jewish students were afraid to go to school.""

Protesters on campuses maintained their aim was to show public support for the people in Gaza and to demand their universities divest from companies with ties to Israel.

""We've always been told that you can be anti-Zionist without being antisemitic. And I would say that you could. As it turns out, they're just not,"" Moskowitz said. ""And the reason why is they're not surrounding Israeli students going to class. They're surrounding a kid wearing a Jewish star going to class. They don't know his position on Israel. Maybe he's anti-Israel, but he's Jewish.""

He said the protests highlighted the need for Congress to step in.

""If what was happening on college campuses were not about Jews, if people in hoods were encircling Black kids, blocking them from class, or some right-wing extremist group was targeting the LGBT kids, we don't believe it would have gotten past lunchtime on the first day,"" Moskowitz said. ""We believe Congress would have acted.""

Congress has taken steps over the last year in response to rising antisemitism but there are ongoing divisions about what elements are most important to address at the federal level and which policies will actually lead to solutions.

In May, the House passed the Antisemitism Awareness Act, which would see the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism when reviewing complaints of discrimination in programs that receive federal financial assistance. The bill goes further than an executive order former President Donald Trump signed in 2019 and opponents say it could restrict free speech. The measure has not been taken up by the Senate.

Manning spent nine months with House colleagues and counterparts in the Senate negotiating what she calls the ""most comprehensive bill"" on antisemitism that incorporates the guidance outlined in the Biden administration's national strategy to counter antisemitism. The result is the Countering Antisemitism Act, which would establish a position in the White House to coordinate federal efforts to counter antisemitism across various agencies and to conduct a study that analyzes the prevalence of online antisemitic content. The bill would also appoint a senior official within the Department of Education to be responsible for addressing antisemitism on college campuses.

That bill has yet to be brought to the floor for a vote by Republican leadership.

Moskowitz says the issue more broadly has highlighted what he calls schisms within his own party.

""It was real easy for Democrats, right, when it was just [GOP Rep.] Marjorie Taylor Greene talking about Jewish space lasers to go call her out, or easy when Tucker Carlson has a Holocaust denier on his show to call him out,"" Moskowitz said. ""I didn't see the same level of interest on calling out the antisemitism when it was within your own tent.""

He said Democratic lawmakers weren't unified in their condemnation of some of the violent language being used on campuses.

""As soon as they saw there was division in our party, the Republicans jumped right in from a political issue, from a fundraising issue, and wanted to drive that wedge. We made it easy for them to do that, by the way, when there are people protesting in front of college campuses saying, 'go back to Poland, kill all the Zionists.' And like several of my progressive members are like, 'Oh, look, it's raining today.'

Manning said the events of the past year have brought Jewish members in the House closer together but support from colleagues has been uneven.

""What I have experienced is not antisemitism from my colleagues, but willful ignorance of what so many of us are experiencing,"" she said.

Moskowitz agreed.

""A lot of other members are scared to step out because they don't want to get targeted,"" he said. ""They don't want to get protested in their district and don't want police in front of their house, which I have 24-hours a day.""

He said that police protection began within weeks of October 7, based on death threats against him and his children, ages 7 and 10.

""It's not a pleasant time to be Jewish at the moment,"" he said. ""Almost every Jewish member has this story. My grandparents were Holocaust survivors. And there are bits and pieces of stories my grandmother's told me that are repeating themselves. Different - not the same, but similar threats. And Jews see and feel that. So we'll have to see what the new Congress wants to do. The schisms that exist on this issue are still going to exist.""

Manning adds she hears from Jews across the country worrying about what the future holds, and asking if Congress can help.

""I think so many Jews, particularly of my generation and older, carry all of those stories on their shoulders -- the history of the Crusades, and the Inquisition, and the pogroms and the Holocaust. When I talk to people about what the difference is today is all those other disasters that happened to the Jews were perpetrated by the governments of those countries. What's happening today in the United States, not only is it not perpetrated by our government, our government is trying to put into place structures to combat that antisemitism,"" she said. ""And that's the thing that gives me hope moving forward."""
Saudi Arabia | Fox News,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/saudi-arabia,2024-10-08T20:39:50Z,"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the largest sovereign state in the Middle East and makes up the majority of the Arabian Peninsula. The country is ruled by the Al Saud royal family along with a coalition of ultraconservative Wahhabi religious elites. Together, they enforce Islamic law and define themselves as an Arab Islamic State. The kingdom is home to Islam's holiest cities, Mecca and Medina.

Saudi Arabia is bordered by the Red Sea, Jordan, Kuwait, and Iraq while surrounded to its east by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It is the only country with a coastline on the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Mountains, arid deserts, and lowlands make up most of its terrain, and its largest city is the capital of Riyadh. The population of Saudi Arabia is more than 34 million people.

Approximately 8% of its total GDP is spent on the kingdom's military, which is ranked as the third largest army in the world, behind the United States and China. From 2015 to 2019, Saudi Arabia imported more firearms and military weaponry than any other country while possessing the highest quality military equipment in the Middle East, after Israel. Additionally, more than half of the weapons exports to the Middle East arrived in Saudi Arabia.

The current Saudi king, Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman have been criticized for human rights violations, participation in the Yemeni Civil War, and treatment of political opponents. Moreover, in 2018 the kingdom received international criticism after the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident journalist, and columnist for the Washington Post. He was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, to pick up visa papers. However, Khashoggi was strangled to death upon his arrival and dismembered by a hit team of 15 individuals closely associated with the crown prince. Leaders in the U.S. and abroad, such as President Joe Biden, condemned the assassination."
"Reporter's Notebook: With no government shutdown, it feels like Christmas in September",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/reporters-notebook-no-government-shutdown-feels-like-christmas-september,2024-10-08T20:39:29Z,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the latest news emerging from Hurricane Helene as FEMA struggles with funding.

Triangles of orange and yellow candy corn are now spread around the house. Reese's Cups have now morphed into chocolate and peanut butter pumpkins from their original, fluted wafer form. The dog regularly freaks out when you take it for a walk and some mechanical ghoul begins cackling in an evil laugh when you 'round a corner in your neighborhood.

The calendar flipped seamlessly from September to October. It's especially seamlessly in Congress. And while September is ""government shutdown season"" on Capitol Hill, Congress escaped unscathed this year. Bipartisan lawmakers approved a stopgap spending measure which keeps the lights on through Dec. 20. That's why those who toil on Capitol Hill - or for the federal government - can enjoy the ""Halloween"" season this October. They don't have to focus on ""Continuing Resolutions"" to keep the government afloat. They can instead embrace apparitions rather than appropriations.

September's salvation also rescued Thanksgiving next month. It's customary for Congress to approve a stopgap spending bill or two each fall. Depending on the congressional schedule - and if it's an election year - one might run the government through mid-October, or later. Another may punt until just before Thanksgiving or just afterward.

But this year's emergency spending plan is special. It funds the government for autumn. All of October. All of November. It expires just before Christmas. So does everyone on Capitol Hill get to celebrate Christmas? Don't bank on on it.

You got Halloween and Thanksgiving. Two out of three ain't bad.

""Why have we picked December 20th?,"" asked Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., during a meeting of the House Rules Committee prepping the temporary spending package. ""Because it's the same reason we always have (with) December 20th. Everybody up here is human. There are no AIs or robots in Congress. And when you get to December 20th, you're five days from Christmas. You're four days from Christmas Eve. And you desperately want to be there with your family. This is when the leadership here has the maximum influence.""

FORMER NIH OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF MAKING EMAILS 'DISAPPEAR' PLEADS FIFTH TO COVID SUBCOMMITTEE

Massie argues that bipartisan congressional leaders choose such a date so they can maximize their leverage over members. The proximity to the holiday helps leaders wrangle the votes to pass another spending plan - anything - to avoid a holiday government shutdown.

Massie said he's been in meetings where a Speaker of the House basically threatens Republicans that they'd better vote 'yes' on a spending measure.

""(He) walks in and says 'If you vote for this you can go home and unwrap presents with your kids. And if you don't vote for this, you're going to spend Christmas here with Nancy Pelosi.' And then the chants start. 'Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote!' Literally, people get enthusiastic to vote for something that they haven't read,"" said Massie.

The soupcon of jet fumes will permeate the Capitol in mid-December as lawmakers try to fund the government and avoid a shutdown over Christmas. The question is how long a spending plan might run? Deep into calendar year 2025? Maybe until February? Perhaps late March as some conservatives advocated? Or, will lawmakers actually reach an agreement on the 12 annual spending bills or even knock a few out, one by one?

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is ruling out an ""omnibus."" He's also spoken out about doing ""minibuses."" That's where they glom several spending measures together. It's not an ""omnibus."" It's smaller, hence the ""Volkswagen"" comparison.

What would Herbie the Love Bug say?

However, the length of another interim spending plan likely hinges on which party controls the House and Senate next year - as well as who won the White House. The wishes of the President-elect will prompt lawmakers to bend the spending bill in his or her direction.

But in September, the goal was to avert a shutdown - and hash out the hard stuff later.

""We're out of time. We cannot afford a shutdown,"" said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., last month. ""This path ensures Americans aren't needlessly punished with a costly shutdown and allows, importantly, the next president, to have a say in the appropriations process.""

Even though the Democratically-controlled Senate advanced zero spending bills on the floor this year, the Republican-operated House did a little better, approving five appropriations measures. But Cole partly blamed his own GOP colleagues for the legislative stumbles.

""We're the majority. The majority ought to be governing,"" said Cole.

He added that it was ""disappointing"" that the House GOP majority had to again rely on Democrats to avert a shutdown.

That's why Cole and others hope the House is able to knock out a few if not the remainder of outstanding spending bills after the election. Otherwise, a harrowing holiday season awaits.

Like Massie, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Tex., warned against ""a crazy, massive, omnibus train, which is the inevitability of doing something right before Christmas.""

So how is Johnson going to manage this? Especially with the distinct possibility of Congress having to boost FEMA with an ""immediate needs"" bill nearly as soon as lawmakers return in mid-November? Then there's the question of a shutdown in December. And that's to say nothing of approving some plan to address Hurriances Helene and Milton along with other natural disasters.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: ALL ABOUT THE POLITICS OF DISASTER RELIEF

By the way, if it's clear Democrats lost the Senate, failed to capture the House and lost the presidency, there's a good chance they'll balk at assisting Republicans with any spending bills. That could well launch the potential second-term of former President Donald Trump under a government shutdown.

There are headaches galore for Mike Johnson as he attempts to fund the government, address multiple crises, satisfy irate conservatives who are already grumbling about his leadership and possibly cling to power. Calling the wrong play could jeopardize Johnson's status in the Speaker election on January 3 if Republicans maintain the majority.

But, what is the right play call for Johnson? No one knows. Johnson tried to appease the right with a spending plan which included a provision to require proof of citizenship to vote last month. However, Republicans couldn't even pass their own bill. In other words, kowtowing to the margins doesn't automatically guarantee success in the House Republican Conference.

But regardless, there was little drama passing the interim spending bill to avoid a government shutdown in late September.

That opened the door for the denizens of Capitol Hill to enjoy the end of the rest of the month. Embrace Halloween in October. Even Thanksgiving.

Face it. Christmas came early this year. In September. There was no government shutdown.

Which is why actual Christmas could be a nightmare this year."

Deoleo : The World's # 1 Olive Oil Company Drives Sustainability With Supply Chain Partners,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmainwaring/2024/10/08/deoleo--the-worlds--1-olive-oil-company-drives-sustainability-with-supply-chain-partners/,2024-10-08T20:30:18Z,"There are three significant tensions in the global olive oil industry, all interrelated. The first is traditional versus sustainable farming techniques, where a great deal of education and workshopping has become essential to support farmers' progress. The next is the ratio of price to yield - closely tied to supply and demand - where some level of consistency is necessary to keep small farmers in business, and the industry as a whole afloat. The last is climate-related changes versus non-environmental changes the industry faces.

Dallas-based Deoleo North America, the parent company of globally recognized olive oil brands Bertolli, Carapelli, and Carbonell, is on a mission to balance out all those stressors simultaneously, creating and increasing value through every decision with its partners to serve the next chapter of the industry.

Bottom line, Deoleo's vision is to lead olive oil into a sustainable future. This starts with building strong supplier partnerships that embed sustainable farming practices across the multinational network of farms. Says North America CEO Thierry Moyroud, a global expert on opportunities to drive sustainability in the olive oil sector, ""We work closely with farmers, using our shared knowledge of olives to develop holistic solutions that promote their economic success while preserving and developing the land we all rely on.""

This leadership that ""puts the future first"" is critical, according to Moyroud, to end the cycle of environmental degradation. ""Sustainability, for us, is rooted in something much more important than a buzzword,"" he says. ""We are in a farming industry, which is a traditional industry -- but it requires a change. Else ... climate change, to mention one, will impact the future life of all those farmers, who have been doing this for generations, you know?""

Olive oil is integral to the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Those who farm it, make it, sell it, and consume the hundreds of millions of metric tons of the healthful substance across the globe, all depend on a steady and regenerative supply. ""As global stewards of this vital ingredient, we are committed to producing it responsibly and expertly,""Moyroud says. ""In ways that protect livelihoods, promote good health, and protect our planet.""

But some of the old ways of producing olive oil are not sustainable over the long haul. ""[Many olive farmers] have been passing the baton to the later generations -- and today? The climate is changing all across the world. It's already extreme in the Mediterranean basin, and it's going to impact, sooner or later, the North African countries like Tunisia and Morocco, but also the south of Spain, the south of Italy, Greece, and so on. In those places, olive oil [accounts for] a substantial amount of the agriculture that the community makes their living from,"" says Moyroud.

In fact, Deoleo, with 30+ brands in its portfolio, became the world's number one olive oil company, by working hard to reconcile the important traditions of its industry, with transformational innovations in sustainability, says Moyroud.

But that balance is exceedingly challenging in an industry where revenue - of course, based on a combination of yield and price - fluctuates so radically, he argues. ""So, if we are not anticipating those things"" with every change and innovation, ""we are not touching the essence of what sustainability is all about."" In other words, sustainability of the environment means nothing without the survival and success of individual farms. And that combined sustainability of farming and the farmers is the key to adding value to Deoleo's brands, our society, and our planet, says Moyroud.

Time is of the essence, he says. ""We think the earlier you begin to address those things, the less risk you're having for your global supply later. So, we started the journey at Deoleo in 2018 and we aim to have 70 percent [sustainability] by 2030. That's a 12-year span.""

The key pillars of Deoleo's sustainability mission are:

And they all come together in the company's approach to innovating toward that 70 percent goal with its partners. Deoleo employs 650+ people worldwide. Its products are sold in 75 countries. But most of the supply of olives comes from a narrow area where traditional farming techniques have served farmers for hundreds or even thousands of years -- places like autonomous Adalusia in Spain. Says Moyroud, ""You cannot show up one given morning, and tell those people that have been working hard to make a decent living all those years, tell them to start from scratch because they don't know anything about it.""

""You can't lecture people. You need to tag along with them, and take them with you on a journey where you say, 'This is why we are doing this.'""

""At Deoleo, we don't believe in the power of, 'Hey, because I'm going to buy olives from you guys, I'm going to tell you to do it this way. And if in twelve months you're not there, you're going to be in trouble.' That's not the way. We need to inspire people so that they follow the movement, they understand the purpose and why we are doing things [in a more sustainable way].""

Moyroud says he's not looking for perfection from his farmer-suppliers. Just dedication. ""True commitment.""

When it works best, it's a give and take, says Jose Antonio Bonache Aparisi, Deoleo's Corporate Affairs & Communications Director. ""What we discovered is this sustainability protocol helps our farmers adapt to [local] regulations. They're better at adapting to the risks that they are suffering,"" says Bonache, because they're looking through multiple lenses, such as culture, environment, and business efficiency.

""It's like a KPI list to complete all of the things that they need to do. And they discover after that, with the European regulations, for example, thanks to our sustainability protocol, now they can help re-collect subsidies from the European Union to adapt more of the system.""

Furthermore, says Bonache, the farm management talent pool improves exponentially, as ""in the past, probably you had a farmer using the traditional way. Now, you need to have knowledge about the capacity of new technology, environmental sustainability, and modern farming techniques. That increased the level of salaries, which has increased the level of the employees, and that's the perfect hook to maintain people on the ground in a small village in the south of Spain and South Italy.""

Moyroud agrees. ""That's our approach to sustainability."""
Harris Would Create A New Medicare Benefit For Long-Term Care,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2024/10/08/harris-would-create-a-new-medicare-benefit-for-long-term-care/,2024-10-08T20:30:01Z,"Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has backed an earth-shattering idea: For the first time, traditional Medicare would pay for personal assistance at home and related long-term care. Currently, only Medicaid and certain Medicare managed care programs provide long-term care benefits.

Harris endorsed the idea in an appearance on the television show The View and her staff heavily promoted her initiative to news organizations. She'd break down the six-decade wall between traditional Medicare and long-term care and potentially vastly expand government support for frail older adults and their families.

In her television appearance, Harris spoke passionately about being a caregiver for her own mother. She proposed having ""Medicare cover in-home health care,"" but it was clear from the rest of her remarks that she meant in-home long-term care. Medicare already covers home health care, though with many limitations.

No Details

But Harris has not offered any details of a plan. We don't know who would be eligible, what services would be covered, or what dollar limits, if any, would be placed on benefits. How would the program interact with Medicaid or with private long-term care insurance? She did say she'd pay for at least some of her initiative with Medicare savings from negotiating drug prices. A Harris staffer did not respond to a request for more information about her idea.

While Harris is not willing to disclose details of a plan, if she indeed has settled on any, we may be able to see hints of what she has in mind from new two papers written by influential policy experts who are well connected to top Democratic lawmakers.

Some Hints

One, published by the Brookings Institution in September, proposed making long-term care available to all Medicare beneficiaries who need assistance with at least two activities of daily living (such as eating, bathing, and transferring from a bed to a chair). Benefit amounts would be linked to income and assets so that higher-income, wealthier beneficiaries would pay more of the cost of their care than low-income people. Care would only be covered if it is provided through a licensed home care agency.

The paper's authors include Wendell Primus, a former top domestic policy aide to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Jonathan Gruber, who served as a senior Treasury Department official in the Clinton Administration; and Sherry Glied and Richard Frank, who held senior policy positions in the Department of Health and Human Services during the Obama Administration.

The second paper, published by Georgetown University in late September, was authored by Judy Feder, who served as a senior policy aide at HHS during the Clinton Administration, and Nicole Jorwic of the advocacy group Caring Across Generations.

They proposed a benefit that would cover those with a somewhat lower need for assistance, including those with cognitive limitations, as well as support for family members. They also said any plan should include ""a significant investment in building the workforce"" -- presumably through increased compensation or career advancement opportunities.

More Ambitious Than Biden

Whatever she does, Harris would be moving well beyond existing government support for long-term care and be far more ambitious than President Biden.

In 2021, the Biden Administration proposed increasing the federal government contribution to Medicaid long-term care by $400 billion over 10 years. Medicaid, which is run by the states with funding assistance from the federal government, does pay for long-term care, but only for those with very low incomes and very few financial assets.

But Biden's plan died in Congress. More recently Biden and Harris proposed a scaled down $150 billion version of the same idea. It too went nowhere.

Harris would take a very different path. Rather than expanding Medicaid long-term care, she'd create a long-term care benefit through traditional Medicare.

Medicare Managed Care

Despite common misconceptions, traditional Medicare does not pay for long-term care, except under very limited circumstances.

Various forms of Medicare managed care may pay for long-term care, however. Special Needs Plans do so. The PACE program, which generally benefits those eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, provides fully integrated long-term care and managed health care. But both have limited enrollment.

Medicare Advantage managed care plans, which currently insure more than half of all Medicare beneficiaries, may provide very limited long-term care-like services. But they are very modest, averaging less than $50-a-month.

Dipping A Toe

In 2023, the Biden Administration dipped its toe in the traditional Medicare long-term care world. It created a program called GUIDE, which pays Medicare providers such as physicians and therapists a monthly supplement for providing care navigation services and limited social supports to traditional Medicare recipients living with dementia and their families.

But that effort also is quite modest, limited only to those with dementia, and focused mostly on care coordination rather than personal care.

In her tight race for president, Harris is trying to win support of tens of millions of family caregivers. Creating a viable Medicare long-term care benefit surely would be an enormous help to those caregivers and a stunning shift in federal policy. But, poorly designed, it could be unworkable or a massively expensive give-away. If only we knew how Harris would turn her talking point into a real plan."
Meta Movie Gen To Change Social Media: Who Defines Who You Are,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/geruiwang/2024/10/08/meta-movie-gen-to-change-social-media-who-defines-who-you-are/,2024-10-08T20:29:57Z,"Meta has just dropped a hefty 90-page paper on its latest creation, Meta Movie Gen, a ""cast of media foundation models."" Though still locked in the lab, Meta announced its ambition of combining audio, image, video, and text into one seamless generative AI model.

Today's AI can already generate videos from text or images, sync soundtracks, and even align lip movements.

But generating sound effects from words alone that match a video's contents and atmosphere? That's been elusive.

Meta Movie Gen avowed to do all that -- and more.

You can edit an existing video by typing a simple prompt, add an audio element to a generated video, or transform an everyday selfie into an animated scene. Such an integration of all content modalities reminds us of the title of the film Everything Everywhere All at Once.

Trained on vast multimedia datasets, Meta Movie Gen cranked up the heat on competitors like Runway, Pika Labs, Luma AI, and OpenAI's Sora, all racing to redefine video generation.

The research team for Meta Movie Gen proposed new approaches to foundation models including co-training of images and videos, spatial-temporal compression in the latent space, rich text embeddings, bi-directional attention instead of causal attention, efficient inference using temporal tiling and others.

Though Meta asserts that its models are trained on ""licensed or publicly available data,"" there's still the lingering question: what proprietary troves of video and image data does Meta have access to that others don't?

Mark Zuckerberg confidently declared on Instagram that by 2025, Instagram users will be wielding this new app.

Likely, social media will experience the first wave of change.

Picture a travel post capturing the Northern Lights, but you're dressed for a Hawaiian beach instead of bundled in a winter coat -- all changed with a single text input.

Or imagine promoting your bakery with a cozy video of customers savoring cupcakes, without filming a single scene.

One can even fabricate a career highlight -- delivering a keynote speech or accepting a prestigious award.

""Reinventing"" realities soon, these digital manipulations might not be seen as ""deepfakes."" Instead, they'll be beautified as creative advertising and polished personal branding.

As Meta and others scale up their computing power, we'll see media models spinning out longer, more complex content.

Competitors will scramble to craft their own versions, reshaping industries from film to animation to gaming.

Still, even Meta's sample videos show where the technology stumbles.

The koala surfing, the fire-dancer twirling, the child flying a kite -- everything looks superficially convincing.

The lighting feels unnatural, the shading overwhelms, the movement stiffens, and the joy of play disappears in a homogenizing portrayal of a child running with their back turned to us.

Faces are locked in frozen smiles, textures too smooth and too shiny.

AI videos flooding social media, reality will soon be edited into a surreal perfection -- flawless fruits, wrinkle-free faces, overly groomed dogs.

Imagine a generation growing up in these machine-made fantasies, where the messiness of life is polished away.

Why read Romeo and Juliet when an AI can whip up a custom video adaptation?

Why learn to draw when AI can animate your vision with a single textual command?

Why practice piano when AI can compose a flawless performance, complete with your likeness?

What's missed in the pixels?

Even as AI advances, it struggles to replicate the nuance of real life experience, subtle shifts in emotions, and internal tensions of human struggles.

Meta Movie Gen, much like the capitalist production and reproduction of media that the German Philosopher Walter Benjamin critiqued in his influential essay ""The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,"" accelerates the decay of ""aura"" of our lives and artistic expressions.

As Benjamin argued, capital controlled, mass reproduction strips art of its authenticity and uniqueness. Meta's AI-generated videos will offer easily customizable, endlessly replicable spectacles, turning personal memories and identities into commodified illusions.

The result is a world where the original, genuine experience fades in favor of reproductions crafted for public consumption.

But the issue runs deeper. Benjamin's critique of the film industry's exploitation of the masses is mirrored here.

Media foundation models, controlled by profit-driven corporations, do not just create -- they manipulate. The allure of personalized, AI-generated realities is a product designed to benefit the tech companies and its shareholders, drawing users into a cycle of producing and consuming polished, curated versions of themselves.

This commodification of identity, under the guise of creativity, exploit genuine self-expressions.

Meta's grip on these models may mean that users lose control over their own representations, further alienating individuals from their authentic lives.

In a world awash with generated content, it's crucial we hold onto what makes us human -- our voices, our time, our presence interacting with others in the physical world.

Because no matter how vivid these digital creations may seem, they'll never replace the authenticity of being there for our loved ones."
5 Designers Making Rubbish Fashion,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gemmawilliams/2024/10/08/5-designers-making-rubbish-fashion/,2024-10-08T20:29:31Z,"Landfills, incinerators, and even our wardrobes are rammed with textile waste. Here are some designers from around the world transforming this into desirable wearables.

Who says waste can't be glamorous? From worn lifejackets to fly-tipped sofas, young designers from around the world are transforming leftovers into wearable items. Hong Kong's Redress Award, held in September, showcased the latest cohort of creatives prioritizing sustainability and circularity as much as desirability.

The award -- powered by the Asia-focused environmental NGO Redress, which seeks to accelerate the change to a circular fashion industry -- has an alumni community of over 300 finalists and semi-finalists across more than 40 countries and regions; over half are based in Asia. This edition saw Tiger Chung crowned winner, joining the newest generation of Redress Award alumni using non-linear design solutions to challenge and modernize the sector's traditional practices.

According to Dean, the founder of Redress, the world is ""awash with fashion's leftovers."" This is down to overproduction, overconsumption, and a disregard for a garment's longevity. A report from The Global Fashion Agenda and The Boston Consulting Group predicts that textile waste will increase by about 60% between 2015 and 2030. As a result, landfills, incinerators, and closets are ""rammed with textile waste, not to mention far flung developing countries, which are flooded with clothing cast-offs,"" she explained. And however bad it is today, ""fashion's excess is only getting worse.""

Luxury analysts globally agree that sustainable design solutions are crucial for the future. Yet, these challenges are still being neglected -- especially by countless mid to large-size brands who all too often put profits over sustainability. Until the ROI of circularity increases at the boardroom level, the solution perhaps lies with ""emerging talents"" suggested fashion consultant Felicia Garcia. ""These designers, especially from the Redress Award, are telling a story of renewal through their designs by transforming unused materials into innovative and unique new garments, thereby giving the materials a new life and use,"" she shared.

From dressing celebrities to the closing ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, here are some of the Redress alumni pioneering change.

Now the poster boy of upcycling, Kevin Germanier won the Redress Award in 2015. He founded his label three years later to offer elegant and sophisticated sustainable womenswear made of 100% ethical and upcycled materials: pearls, rocks, tulle, cotton, plastic thread, shoe base and so on. Germanier shows at Paris Fashion Week and the designer is the creation director of Prélude -- an initiative founded by LVMH to address the creative reuse of mainly unsold products from the biggest fashion houses.

Miranda creates modern silhouettes from upcycled silks which earned them a finalist spot in the Redress Design Award in 2022 as well as the People's Choice vote. They hold a BA in Fashion Design from Andrés Bello National University, Chile. Miranda draws inspiration from excess materials, notably kimono and obi silks, and states they are a sustainable fashion designer because they believe in ""the needed change it represents."" A previous collection featured upcycled leather jackets that belonged to their mother -- illustrating their very personal take on sustainable fashion.

Chung's unique ability to address some of the more problematic and difficult waste textiles into desirable pieces is a much-needed approach in the industry. So much so, that they won over 2024's judges the Redress Design Award. Chung holds a BA in Fashion Design from Nottingham Trent University and a Higher Diploma from the Hong Kong Design Institute. Under Chung's keen eye, hotel towels, airport felt, car seat covers, and old sofas are all valuable commodities. They focus on a ""people-centric approach to clothing,"" believing that ""people wear clothes, not the other way around.""

One of the earliest entrants of the award in 2015/16, Tsang's design USP celebrates imperfection and is based on Zen philosophy which respects the balance between nature and humanity. Tsang holds a Fashion Design degree from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and a Social Sciences degree from the City University of Hong Kong. The Japanese designer from Hong Kong has received international recognition.

Kaur was the People's Choice winner of the Redress Design Award 2023. Her work explores ""innovative design solutions that challenge traditional practices"" and ""inspire a more conscious approach to consumption."" Kaur holds a Postgraduate Diploma in Fashion Design from Pearl Academy, India. She uses unwanted garments with a cultural past, such as discarded turbans from Sikh men or cut-and-sew waste to create classic, wearable silhouettes that are wardrobe classics."
"Trump says Gaza 'could be better than Monaco,' but 'they never took advantage of it'",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-gaza-better-than-monaco-israel-hugh-hewitt-rcna174475,2024-10-08T20:25:45Z,"Trump also claimed he has been to Gaza. An aide later suggested that visiting Israel counted because ""Gaza is in Israel.""

Donald Trump said that Gaza ""could be one of the best places in the world"" -- better even, he said, ""than Monaco"" and lamented that people ""never took advantage of it.""

In an interview with conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, Trump said: ""It could be better than Monaco. It has the best location in the Middle East, the best water, the best everything,"" referring to the Palestinian territory, which has been bombarded relentlessly by the Israeli military for the past 12 months, creating a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.

""They never took advantage of it. You know, as a developer, it could be the most beautiful place -- the weather, the water, the whole thing, the climate,"" he said.

Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Jewish Democrats and denigrated Palestinians while claiming to be Israel's staunchest ally, said that Gaza was ""a rough place ... before all of the attacks and before the back-and-forth of what's happened over the last couple of years."" The Republican presidential nominee also claimed that he had visited Gaza, despite there being no record of him doing so, as president or otherwise.

Afterward, a Trump campaign official given anonymity by The New York Times said that Trump has been to Israel, stating incorrectly that ""Gaza is in Israel.""

Trump's estimation of the real estate potential of the Gaza Strip echoes that of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who said in an interview with the faculty chair of Harvard's Middle East Initiative in February that ""Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable."" Kushner also suggested that, if he were in charge, he would ""try to move people"" from Rafah, in the south of Gaza, into the Negev desert, ""so you can go in and finish the job"" of eliminating Hamas.

Trump's comments speak to how he might approach the fraught and widening tensions in the Middle East if he wins the election. They are also deeply disconnected from the realities of life in Gaza under Israel's extensive blockade and what human rights experts have called the illegal Israeli occupation of the West Bank. After Hamas assumed governance of Gaza in 2007, Israel removed its military presence and swiftly imposed an air, sea and land blockade. Israel has largely controlled who enters and leaves the Strip; severely limited the import and export of food, medical supplies, infrastructure materials and commercial goods; violently restricted access along the coast of Gaza; and cut off access to farmland. Before the current war, two-thirds of the population in Gaza was supported by food assistance.

Multiple conflicts between Hamas and Israel over the years have exacerbated those issues. Israel's current war in Gaza, launched after Hamas' attack killed 1,200 people in October 2023, has displaced more than 90% of the population in the Strip, according to the United Nations. Gaza health officials say at least 41,000 people have been killed."
Bureau Of Prisons To Restrict Mass Emails To Prisoners,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterpavlo/2024/10/08/bureau-of-prisons-to-restrict-mass-emails-to-prisoners/,2024-10-08T20:24:42Z,"In March 2020, the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General issued a report on the concerns of mass emails through its Trulinks (also called Corrlinks) email system to the general population. The Trulinks email system is used by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) inmates to communicate with families and friends. The emails do not allow for photos or attachments, but are simply text messages that provide information and updates. Over the years, the system has been used to communicate information to a broader group of prisoners related to BOP policy, legal actions and general information on incarceration.

Prisoners in BOP custody have limited information from the outside. While there are televisions and radios, there is no access to the Internet, something all of us rely on for information and news. Trunlinks has been used by family members to send information to those incarcerated. I am aware that many people do this with these Forbes articles written here.

During COVID-19, Trulinks was used to get news to prisoners about their family's wellbeing and to find out more information on how the spread of disease would affect the prison population. During that time, non-profit, and some for-profit groups found an eager audience to provide them with timely information on things like COVID-19, the First Step Act, and pending laws in Congress related to prisoners and criminal cases. Now the BOP is limiting the number of prisoners any one group can communicate with at any time.

The BOP issued a statement from BOP Public Affairs' Ben O'Cone stating, ""In response to an Office of Inspector General (OIG) audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' (FBOP) Monitoring of Inmate Communications to Prevent Radicalization (March 2020), the OIG recommended that the FBOP establish controls that mitigate the risk of individuals communicating with unknown and un-vetted parties and take steps, including the utilization of available technological features as found in TRULINCS, to reduce the risk of mass emails being receiving by high-risk individuals, including terrorists. As a result, the FBOP's Executive Team decided to reduce the number of emails that an outside party could send into a group of incarcerated individuals to ten. This measure was taken to comply with the OIG audit."" It would seem like a more sensible approach would be to restrict the emails and improve monitoring of certain prisoners so the larger group of prisoners could continue to enjoy those newsletters.

The OIG report O'Cone was referencing stated that the BOP needs to improve its monitoring of inmate communications. The BOP provides multiple communication channels to inmates, which may include email, phone calls, postage mail, and video sessions, depending on the individual's threat level. However, the OIG found that the BOP did not monitor all terrorist inmate communications as required by policy, and did not adequately prevent some inmates from circumventing certain communication controls. The result is that prisoners, even those who are communicating with non-terrorist prisoners, will not be able to receive email blasts of newsletters.

Non-profit groups and ad hoc criminal justice groups who support those in prison, most well-intentioned, are now concerned that they are not going to be able to provide information to people on the inside. Pamela Bailey operates her own small non-profit providing information to prisoners, many of whom are destitute and are looking for information. Bailey told me, ""These people are looking for information and our organization tries to provide information they can use. Now, I'm unsure how I can continue to do this manually for thousands of people I routinely write to and provide information for in prison.""

There are a number of non-profits out there who provide essential information to prisoners about things such as changes to the Sentencing Commission recommendations, court cases and even Supreme Court cases that change the landscape of incarceration.

There are larger non-profits that routinely give insights to prisoners on various issues. Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM) often sends out information on new policies or proposed policies that could change the incarceration experience. FAMM and other groups like ALEPH, send out thousands of emails to prisoners through Trulinks to connect them to policies or other agencies who may be able to advocate on their behalf. For many prisoners, news from outside organizations not only offer hope, but needed information to let them know their rights. With the First Step Act, these organizations, and others, have been important outlets for information where the BOP has fallen short. At this critical time, when many still have questions on the First Step Act, it looks like the flow of information into prison is about to get even slower."

A massive hurricane, Milton, is barreling toward Florida just two weeks after Helene made landfall and devastated a swath of the southeastern U.S. -- and the Atlantic hurricane season isn't over yet.

Get ahead of the next storm with these emergency preparedness tips.

National Weather Service forecasters predicted that this year's Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, will be one of the most active on record.

If you haven't already, take action to protect yourself and your family from disaster, says emergency manager Chauncia Willis of Tampa, Fla. ""Don't wait until the skies are gray. Think about what to do to survive right now.""

What Working Millennials Of Color Are Feeling About Project 2025,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasminebrowley/2024/10/08/what-working-millennials-of-color-are-feeling-about-project-2025/,2024-10-08T20:16:05Z,"Project 2025, a manifesto created by the conservative organization The Heritage Project and a playbook of likely actions to be taken within the first 180 days in office if Donald Trump is elected (despite his protestations about the plan). Although the sweeping proposal touches on everything from critical race theory to abortion bans, one of the most immediately concerning parts of the plan is how will affect the future of work for millennials workers of color.

Some of the agenda focuses on proposed changes to workplace policies that could adversely affect workers' pay, security, and right to organize against grievances.

For instance, Project 2025 outlines a concerted slashing to overtime pay for workers' leaving with smaller take home pay. Data shows millennials are still the hardest working generation in comparison to Gen X and Gen z, the two age group millennials are sandwiched between.

The plan also proposed that eliminating the Biden administration-led rule that raised the salary threshold to $58,656 and expanded the protection to 4.3 million more workers. Project 2025 reads like it is aiming to help business owners and investors save money over time by skimping on employee protections, but the plan could make way for larger financial disasters.

Project 2025 includes details that rolls back post-crisis policies that protect consumers, investors, and the stability of financial markets by limiting regulators' ability to step in during periods of volatility. This includes putting a stranglehold on the Federal Reserve's ""lender-of-last-resort"" function in which failing banks are able to borrow emergency funds to stay solvent.

An example of this can be seen in the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) crisis in which the Federal Reserve and other regulators stepped in to ensure the bank's customers would have access to their funds by the next day - beyond just the $250,000 guaranteed by the FDIC. The bank's potential collapse could've devastated a number of Black businesses and employees since Silicon Valley Bank has been one of the most pivotal in aiming to help narrow the funding chasm for Black founders, as ESSENCE points out.

""We all know that young Black founders get a fraction of the business loans and venture capital their non-Black counterparts get,"" Shila Nieves Burney of Zane VC says.

Zane VC, a firm that boasts an investment catalog of young startups aims to address the health equity gap, in the most effective way it can, through infusions of much needed capital. Nieves Burney says that if Project 2025's proposed actions are implemented, already vulnerable Black and Brown workers could be in dire straights.

""I'm sitting on the side of the table where Black women typically aren't seated,"" she says. ""I get to push against the narrative that Black founders don't exist and ensure they get the funding they deserve but my job will be made harder if these proposed restrictions get implemented.""

Another lynchpin in the workforce section of proposed initiatives of Project 2025 is its plan to address DEI, which is often described as an attack on America's progress by conservatives.

""The next conservative President must make the institutions of American civil society hard targets for woke culture warriors,"" Project 2025 authors write. ""This starts with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (""SOGI""), diversity, equity, and inclusion (""DEI""), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.""

Dominic K. Hawkins, Vice President Of Communications at the NAACP says the proposed roll backs to DEI efforts will cause great harm to the country.

""Project 2025's policies will weaken civil rights protections, increase workplace discrimination, and ultimately set us back years,"" Hawkins says. ""As a Black professional who has worked across private and public sectors, I've seen how DEI practices only strengthen organizations and give opportunities that our community might be barred from due to the legacy of enslavement and systemic racism. If Project 2025 is enacted, what's to stop companies from blocking my application even when I'm more qualified? Nothing! And there would be no federally powered recourse.""

He adds, ""On top of that, it could create a dearth Black leaders at the top of organizations, who can't then help guide operations and they wouldn't be able to serve as role models and mentors for the next generation. As a Black executive, I wouldn't be where I am today with out sponsors at the C-level. Project 2025 would seek to wipe that out.""

The far reaching plan not only has the ability to touch business owners and corporate leaders, but content creator community as well. Quentin ""Funky Dineva"" Latham and Patrick ""Mr. Jones X"" Jones both expressed their fear for what's to come if the project is fully rolled out.

""It's terrifying, honestly,"" Latham says. He hosts a video podcast on his Youtube channel, which boasts more than 440k subscribers. Although he generates income from his broadcasts, Latham shares that government sanctions on DEI-driven initiatives could affect growth opportunities, including strict censoring rules that could impact the way he creates content.

Jones, on the other hand, shares fears of how his overall safety could be affected since he is a public figure that often comments on hot-button political topics. His combined social media pages boast more than 100k followers.

""Some people that existed on the TikTok platform that weren't very fond of my messaging {about Project 2025 potential ills} found out where I lived and sent the law enforcement to my house, which is where I work,"" Jones stated. ""I do believe that action is a direct manifestation of that group feeling emboldened by the conservative right's anti-DEI push.""

Overall, he says this is the apt time for working millennials like himself to empower and educate themselves about the future of work, and how the upcoming election could affect it.

""Be willing to learn more about the policies that can affect your life and do something about it,"" Jones advises. ""Use that as a motivation to stay the course. Never stop having the important conversations because it could be the difference between living the life you worked for, or having it shift in ways you could never imagine."""

Welcome back to The Prompt,

As Hurricane Helene wreaks havoc in North Carolina and Florida, AI-generated images of victims and first responders are spreading on platforms like Instagram, Facebook and X, Forbes reported. An AI-generated image of a young girl stranded in flood waters holding a drenched puppy in her hand has more than a million views on X, Kevin Guo, CEO of content moderation platform Hive confirmed with me. The image is being used to spread misinformation about the federal government's response to the disaster.

Other AI-generated images of Hurricane Helene's aftermath, such as a man wading through water while holding a dog, law enforcement officials providing relief and Donald Trump in a life jacket trawling through muddy water, are also circulating on social media. Experts say such fake images could hurt humanitarian efforts and make it difficult for victims to find support and trustworthy information.

Now let's get into the headlines.

AI unicorn Character AI briefly hosted a chatbot with the likeness of a teenage girl who was brutally murdered 18 years ago, Forbes reported. The girl's father, Drew Crecente, got a Google Alert on Wednesday morning that someone had used his daughter's yearbook photo and her name to create the bot. ""It shocks the conscience, and it's unacceptable behavior,"" he said. The company removed the chatbot from its platform for violating its impersonation policies.

This comes after the once-buzzy startup's CEO Noam Shazeer was hired by Google in a massive $2.7 billion deal and its interim leader announced that it plans to stop training cutting edge AI models and instead focus on its consumer product.

Two computer scientists, Geoffrey Hinton and John Hopfield, were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing techniques that allow computers to understand information in a way similar to the human brain -- teaching systems to ingest vast amounts of data and identify patterns. Hilton, known as one of the godfathers of AI, and Hopfield used concepts from physics to train artificial neural networks, laying a foundation for the development of machine learning systems like ChatGPT.

Last week, OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion funding round at $157 billion valuation -- the largest venture capital funding round of all time. Thrive Capital led the round with participation from giants like Microsoft, SoftBank and Nvidia among others, according to The Wall Street Journal. With 250 million people using its star product, ChatGPT, the AI giant plans to use the fresh funding to increase its compute capacity and launch more products.

Also notable: Braintrust, which offers software that evaluates how an AI product performs, has raised $36 million at a $150 million valuation, Forbes reported. Early adopters of AI like Notion and Figma use Braintrust to determine how well its AI integrations are responding to prompts.

On a warm night in San Francisco earlier this week, Elon Musk stood on top of a small round coffee table, bathed in purple light. Flocks of AI engineers and researchers gathered around him, some sitting on a nearby stairwell, as the billionaire pitched them on joining his fledgling AI company, xAI.

At the event, a recruitment party for prospective employees, Musk's main selling point was speed -- touting the company's pace in developing products, and creating AI tools in a fast and nimble environment, comparing xAI to an SR-71 jet. ""No SR-71 Blackbird was ever shot down and it only had 1 strategy: to accelerate,"" Musk said, according to one attendee.

The location was apt: The Pioneer Building in the city's Mission district, a 122-year-old former truck factory, and most recently, headquarters of OpenAI, the juggernaut maker of ChatGPT led by cofounder Sam Altman. xAI had just moved into the building, Musk said, attendees told Forbes.

Musk has not been shy about his beef with OpenAI. He cofounded the company with Altman and others in 2015, before leaving three years later after an alleged internal power struggle. Since then, Musk has sued the company twice, accusing the company of abandoning its mission to build artificial intelligence to benefit humanity. (His latest suit was in August, after withdrawing a similar one in June.)

""He really wants to be the antithesis to OpenAI,"" one attendee, Marvin von Hagen, told Forbes when asked about main takeaways from the evening. ""They really want to go on and say, 'Okay, we are the good guys now.'""

Musk's remarks -- as well as the office location -- illustrate the looming role OpenAI plays for xAI. Musk held the event on the same day as OpenAI's annual Dev Day, which some have speculated to be more than a coincidence. At the event, Musk joked about building ""BasedGPT."" xAI cleared out OpenAI's furniture from the office the day before the event, but at least one remnant still remains: A printed-out photo cutout of OpenAI president Greg Brockman is hanging on the ceiling of one of the rooms, two attendees said. (Brockman is currently on leave from OpenAI until the end of the year.) Von Hagen estimated that he saw about 10 current OpenAI employees in attendance.

ChatGPT and other chatbots in its class are prone to regurgitate certain constructions of phrases in its responses. ""Today's fast paced world"" and ""play a significant role in shaping"" are among the top 50 overused words by large language models, according to an analysis by AI content detection platform, GPTZero, Forbes reported. AI-generated text is particularly difficult to catch and such repetitive phrases are one way of spotting machine-written materials, as I reported with my colleague Alex Levine at the start of this year.

Would you want a chatbot to be your wingman? Dating app Grindr bets you will. The app, with a user base of mostly gay and bisexual men, is testing an AI chatbot that will screen prospects to recommend dating partners, set up dates and keep a track of your conversations, the Wall Street Journal reported. On platforms like Tinder, some have already used chatbots to date for them, Forbes reported back in February. In one instance, a person built an auto-swiper and later used ChatGPT to chat with several women, one of whom he eventually married."
Congress Expected To Pass Law Requiring AM Radio In All New Cars,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2024/10/08/congress-expected-to-pass-law-requiring-am-radio-in-all-new-cars/,2024-10-08T20:15:52Z,"Congress is expected to vote on the AM Radio For Every Vehicle Act later this year. The bill would require all new automobiles to be equipped with an AM radio tuner and accessible to listeners at no additional cost. The proposed law comes at a time when several electric vehicle models including those from Tesla, Volkswagen, BMW and Volvo have not made AM radio available. The reason cited is the electromagnetic signals in EV's result in a distorted and low-quality sound on AM radio. Other EV models have been circumventing the issue by using cable shielding or placing the wires in an area that avoids the interference of AM radio.

Senator Ed Markey (D-MA), a supporter of the bill, has called AM radio, ""An essential tool in emergencies, a crucial part of our diverse media ecosystem, and an irreplaceable source for news, weather, sports, and entertainment for tens of millions of listeners."" Besides Congress, keeping AM radio as a standard equipment in cars has the support of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), several state attorney generals and the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB).

The law before Congress came at a time when Hurricane Helene struck the mainland United States. On September 26 Hurricane Helena was responsible for widespread damage including knocking out electricity, cell phone towers as well as destroying homes and roads. With 227 deaths, Hurricane Helene was the deadliest hurricane in the nation since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Two weeks later Hurricane Milton, another powerful hurricane, could become among the worst storms to hit Florida in over 100 years, with early estimated damages of $175 billion.

FEMA says AM radio continues to be a principal source for airing emergency alerts. During Hurricane Helene the hardest hit areas went without power and such forms of communication as cell phones, the internet and phone networks were knocked out. As a result, broadcast radio became the primary communication source for emergency information.

Pete Gaynor, a former FEMA Administrator, said on CNN, ""Right now, it's getting the essentials that humans need to survive, food, water, power, and telecom to make sure that they can get information and give information...Talking to some of my friends out there, the only way they've been getting information is through AM FM radio. And when you think about it, that is kind of the last resort kind of device that people think about. We take it for granted, but it's critical in disasters like this where you have to rely on that really simple AM radio to get information.""

Last year seven former FEMA officials wrote to Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, asking the federal government to keep AM radio in cars. In part the letter said, ""Should this continue, it will represent a grave threat to future local, state, and federal disaster response and relief efforts,"" Craig Fugate, who signed the letter told the Wall Street Journal, ""When all else fails, radio stations are often the last line of communications that communities have,""

FEMA notes, there are 77 AM stations across the country that are Primary Entry Points used for emergencies. These stations have direct access to FEMA and the National Weather Service (NWS) and cover about 90% of the country. There are over 4,000 AM radio stations in the U.S.

Also, in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, have co-written a letter asking Congress to support the bill mandating AM radio in cars. The letter highlights the importance of AM radio during emergencies and natural disasters, including hurricanes in Florida and tornadoes in Iowa. The letter highlighted life-saving safety measures AM radio continues to provide. Ten other Attorneys General from Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia have all expressed their support of the letter.

The NAB has begun a third wave of Public Service Announcement (PSA's) asking Americans to support the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act. These new ads were a call to action asking listeners to text members of Congress to support the bill. Previously, the NAB had run ads citing the importance of having AM radio in automobiles in April and June.

In an interview with Radio Ink, Alex Siciliano, SVP Communications, NAB said, ""These spots underscore the vital role broadcast radio plays in delivering free entertainment, news, sports, weather and life-saving information during emergencies. Hurricane Helene, one of the deadliest storms in decades, once again proved the power of broadcast radio - one of the only communication tools available when other systems fail.""

Of course, there are some that believe AM radio, which began broadcasting more than one century ago, has been supplanted by newer information technologies. The Wall Street Journal reported that The Center for Automotive Research estimates the passage of this bill would saddle EV carmakers with nearly $4 billion in additional costs by 2030. This would be an unfunded mandate paid for by consumers who don't want and won't use the devices. We don't need an AM radio bailout. We need a system to phase out licenses whose day has passed. In 2009, the FCC said AM radio was dying and is virtually non-existent with listeners under the age of 35.

Representative John James (R-MI) in a House committee meeting noted when the Emergency Alert System (EAS) was tested in 2023, 95% of people had gotten the message via cell phones and only 1% on AM radio. In an interview, Representative James said, ""The Emergency Alert System has never been more robust. The Integrated Public Alert Warning System, IPAWS, pushes alerts through -- in addition to AM radio -- through digital AM/FM radio, internet-based radio, satellite radio, (and) cellular networks."" James has called the AM Radio For Every Vehicle Act, ""An unfunded, unnecessary mandate for a problem that doesn't exist.""

With bipartisan support, the AM Radio For Every Vehicle Act is on track to become law. The bill has support of 262 House members, well over the half the 218 votes needed to pass. The bill also has 62 U.S. senators as co-sponsors, surpassing 60 votes, the number needed to avoid a filibuster. While the act has the support to become law, it must be passed before Congress adjourns at the end of the year. Otherwise, the bill will be required to start anew next year. Despite the likelihood of passage, Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), has yet to schedule a final vote."
Inside Project 2025 And Its Connection To Donald Trump,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2024/10/08/inside-project-2025-and-its-connection-to-donald-trump/,2024-10-08T20:15:42Z,"There has been a lot of discussion about Trump's connection to Project 2025, a 922-page document, written by the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation. Is the Democrat's assertion that Trump is connected to the effort, correct? What does Project 2025 actually say? Project 2025 contains a multitude of items, more than we can cover in this article.

Is Trump connected to Project 2025? According to the slightly left leaning newspaper USA Today, this is a false assertion (read more here). The slightly right leaning NY Post also refutes the notion that Trump is connected to it. CNN has gone on record to say that Harris has made false claims about Trump and Project 2025. She said Trump, if elected, would cut Social Security. While the document says very little about Social Security, it does not propose cuts in the program (read more here).

Why then are Democrats claiming a Trump connection to Project 2025? In this hotly contested political race, each party is looking for ways to attack the credibility of the other and instill fear in the electorate to garner votes. To accomplish this, each party has made assertions about their opponent with the hope that it will resonate in the minds of undecided voters. While there may be several reasons to be hesitant about a second Trump presidency, his connection to Project 2025 or lack thereof, isn't one of them. What is true about Project 2025? Here's what I found after reading much of the 922-page document.

The Heritage Foundation published Project 2025 in 2023. There were 34 authors, 276 contributors, and 2 editors. Among the contributors, about 71% of them worked for the federal government during the first Trump administration. Some worked closely with Trump himself.

What prompted the creation of Project 2025? The premise behind it is that the federal government is far too powerful and too inefficient. This is a widely held belief among Americans. However, there are a few items in the document that run contrary to the Democrats agenda. For example, Project 2025 would restore the definition of ""sex"" as ""biological sex at birth"" instead of ""sexual orientation and gender identity."" According to a Pew research poll from May 2022, 60% of those polled believe gender is determined by the sex assigned at birth. Yet, Democrats continue to define sex as ones ""sexual orientation and gender identity."" Thus, the document states, ""The CDC should immediately end its collection of data on gender identity, which legitimizes the unscientific notion that men can become women (and vice versa)...""

Another example involves abortion. Liberals promote abortion as health care. The Project 2025 document (page 455) states, ""It should fund studies into the risks and complications of abortion and ensure that it corrects and does not promote misinformation regarding the comparative health

and psychological benefits of childbirth versus the health and psychological risks of intentionally taking a human life through abortion."" Conservatives see the issue as more than a woman's right to choose. They see abortion as the taking of life. In general, conservatives are against abortion but do believe exceptions to protect the life of the mother, rape, incest are appropriate.

Project 2025 also exposes some conflicts of interest in the federal government. One such conflict is found in the National Institute of Health (NIH). It states, ""In 2018, it was revealed that a $100 million NIH study on the benefits of moderate drinking was funded by the beer and liquor industry."" It also points out how the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) owns half of the patent for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, among thousands of other pharma patents. It goes on to say that several NIH employees personally receive up to $150,000 per year from Moderna vaccine sales.

Project 2025 does have some controversial items within the document, but its overarching theme is that government has become too large, too inefficient, and there are too many agencies whose actions go well beyond their charter. In short, the document makes suggestions that would reorganize the federal bureaucracy, returning agencies to their original mandates.

Democrats have suggested Trump will enact its provisions if elected in November. While Trump may indeed implement some of the provisions of Project 2025, many of them are standard conservative ideals and not something from a horror movie as Democrats have suggested."
FTC And Congress Ramp Up Efforts To Rein In Drug Patent Evergreening,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2024/10/08/ftc-and-congress-ramp-up-efforts-to-rein-in-drug-patent-evergreening/,2024-10-08T20:15:38Z,"The Federal Trade Commission and Congress are ramping up efforts to rein in what they view as drug patent evergreening, a term referring to the continuing extension of patent rights on a specific product which serves to block generic and biosimilar competition from entering the market.

The United States patent system for pharmaceuticals aims to reward innovation by permitting drug companies to sell new medications on the market and bar other manufacturers from making generic or biosimilar versions for set periods of time. Once the patent expires, generics or biosimilars are allowed on the market, almost always at a lower list price than the brand name drugs.

Pharmaceutical companies can gain an average three years additional monopoly protection on branded drugs by filing secondary patents, a study published by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, indicates. Unlike primary patents, which apply to a drug's active ingredient, secondary patents can cover things like how the drug is administered, formulated or dosed and what disease(s) it will treat. Drug makers may also file for secondary patents by citing proprietary manufacturing processes.

A recently released paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that between 2000 and 2015 there was a 200% increase in patents filed by originator companies, often involving relatively minor changes to dosages, formulations and delivery mechanisms.

Experts have voiced concerns about what they see as ""systematic abuses of patent and regulatory systems,"" which lead to higher prices for patients than would have come about had lower-cost competition from generic or biosimilar entry not been delayed.

At the same time, alterations in dosages and formulations can't always be characterized as abuses of the system. They can impact health positively, through improved patient adherence and persistence. For example, in the HIV disease area, patients on single tablet regimens are more adherent and persistent than those on multiple tablet treatments.

However, a potential problem can occur when patent expiration dates get extended based on seemingly trivial items such as a plastic strap attached to a nebulizer, as was revealed during a CBS News 60 Minutes interview with Lina Khan, the Chair of the FTC. According to an FTC investigation, companies were listing patents for things like a cap or strap attached to an inhaler, which were unrelated to a drug's ingredients, dosing or formulation.

Asthma inhalers certainly aren't the only products being targeted by the FTC inquiry. Between 2005 and 2015, nearly three-quarter of new drug patents issued were for pharmaceuticals already on the market.

One area of particular concern for the FTC is biosimilars. According to industry analysts at IQVIA, biosimilars -- which are almost identical copies of brand name biologics and produce therapeutically equivalent outcomes -- can significantly reduce healthcare spending nationwide. Biosimilars are typically at least 30% lower in terms of list price compared to their original biologic counterparts. More optimal use could reduce prescription drug spending in the U.S. by more than $100 billion in the next five years. But to realize these savings, it will be necessary to remove so-called patent thickets that impede biosimilar uptake. Patent thickets reference the numerous patents drug companies may file to create hurdles to market entry for prospective generic or biosimilar competitors. They're long been recognized as impediments to biosimilar penetration. Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said six years ago that ""patent thickets that are purely designed to deter the entry of approved biosimilars are spoiling this sort of competition.""

And so, policymakers and experts across the political spectrum have urged bipartisan reforms that strike an ""appropriate balance"" between ensuring patents reward innovation while facilitating timely competition to make prescription drugs more affordable for patients.

One such expert, David Mitchell, a cancer patient and advocate, has frequently given testimony in Congress on the topic. He has highlighted how pharmaceutical firms may manipulate the patent system through strategies such as patent thickets, product hopping and pay-for-delay to prolong their monopolies and block lower-cost generic and biosimilar competition from entering the market. Product hopping is when a company switches a patient population from a branded product whose patent is expiring -- and therefore facing imminent competition -- to a different formulation of the original drug that has a later expiring patent. In a pay-for-delay situation, brand name drug manufacturers induce competitors to delay selling a generic or biosimilar version of a drug.

While the different approaches drug companies pursue to extend patents can result in higher consumer prices, they aren't illegal per se. And in defending intellectual property rights, the pharmaceutical industry maintains that patent reform isn't needed. The trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturing Association often cites the fact that more than 90% of prescriptions in the U.S. are for generics or biosimilars. The industry has also maintained that certain patent extensions follow important innovations, such as new, simpler routes of administration that may improve health outcomes for patients.

It's hard to find bipartisan consensus among lawmakers in Congress these days. But pharmaceutical patent reform is an area in which there's widespread agreement. Currently, there are multiple bipartisan bills in Congress which have passed out of Senate committees and that are designed to close loopholes in the patent system.

To illustrate, Senators have introduced a bill named the Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act, which aims to limit patent thickets and product hopping. The proposed legislation would authorize the FTC to enforce and impose limits on patent litigation involving prescription drugs. If enacted, the Act would seek to limit the number of patents that an originator biological product manufacturer can make a claim to in a patent infringement lawsuit against a company that wants to to sell a biosimilar version.

In parallel to what's being proposed in Congress, the FTC is directly challenging drug makers on what it deems are improperly listed patents in the Orange Book (an FDA publication containing approved products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations) regarding 20 brand name pharmaceuticals. The agency first announced in Sept. 2023 that it was pursuing clarification from drug manufacturers regarding these products' patents. The FTC sent warning letters to ten drug manufacturers this spring. It's not been publicly revealed if and how the companies decided to reply. And to date it appears that the FTC has not taken any enforcement action concerning the Orange Book challenges.

It remains to be seen, however, how much FTC can actually accomplish at the moment as patents are issued by the Patent and Trademark Office, while pharmaceuticals, including new dosages, formulations and delivery mechanisms, are regulated by the FDA. Nonetheless, it's clear from a letter written to the PTO in 2021 by the former Acting Commissioner of the FDA, Janet Woodcock, that the agency is seeking ways to work with the PTO to ""identify abuses of the system that can impede competition.""

In sum, the pressure is mounting in Congress and the regulatory agencies for changes to the pharmaceutical patent system. Time will tell just how quickly actual reform will come about with accompanying enforcement action."

Garth Brooks tells fans 'this thing is on' as he gears up to fight rape accusations,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/garth-brooks-tells-fans-this-thing-on-gears-up-fight-rape-accusations,2024-10-08T20:05:33Z,"Fox News' Chanley Painter reports the latest on the accusations and the country star's response.

Country singer Garth Brooks is speaking out for the first time since denying allegations of rape made by his former makeup artist last week.

The musician spoke candidly during his livestreamed weekly chat with fans, Inside Studio G, expressing his expectations going forward regarding legal proceedings.

""Lot's happened in the last two weeks. Let's address the elephant in the room, shall we?"" Brooks began.

GARTH BROOKS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT IN LATEST CONTROVERSY TO PLAGUE COUNTRY MUSIC SUPERSTAR

""This thing is on. It's gonna happen, and people are telling me it could be up to two years, OK?"" Brooks said of fighting the accusations. ""So my suggestion is, we all take a deep breath, we all just kind of settle in, and let's hold hands and take a trip together.""

""Because it is something that you cannot talk about... that's all we can say about it.""

""This thing is on. It's gonna happen, and people are telling me it could be up to two years.""

-- Garth Brooks

""So for those who joined us tonight to hear about that, I bid you a wonderful rest of your night, cause that's the last we can say about it. And for those people who want to stick around, holy cow people, Habitat [for Humanity]? I saw a different side of my bride [Trisha Yearwood] at Habitat. She was the power tool queen, and I gotta tell you guys, this might have been one of the greatest Vegas weekends too,"" he added.

Brooks has a residency at Caeser's Palace in Las Vegas. His next show is scheduled for Thursday.

Brooks' filed his own complaint against ""Roe"" for extortion and defamation, among other things, a month prior to her filing. In the document obtained by Fox News Digital, filed under ""John Doe,"" Brooks denied the woman's claims.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Brooks said for the past two months he had been ""hassled to no end with threats, lies, and tragic tales of what my future would be if I did not write a check for many millions of dollars.""

""It has been like having a loaded gun waved in my face,"" he stated.

""Hush money, no matter how much or how little, is still hush money. In my mind, that means I am admitting to behavior I am incapable of - ugly acts no human should ever do to another. We filed suit against this person nearly a month ago to speak out against extortion and defamation of character. We filed it anonymously for the sake of families on both sides. I want to play music tonight. I want to continue our good deeds going forward. It breaks my heart these wonderful things are in question now. I trust the system, I do not fear the truth, and I am not the man they have painted me to be.""

""I trust the system, I do not fear the truth, and I am not the man they have painted me to be.""

-- Garth Brooks

Wigdor LLP, the firm representing Roe, released a statement following the filing.

""We applaud our client's courage in moving forward with her complaint against Garth Brooks. The complaint filed today demonstrates that sexual predators exist not only in corporate America, Hollywood and in the rap and rock and roll industries but also in the world of country music. We are confident that Brooks will be held accountable for his actions and his efforts to silence our client through the filing of a preemptive complaint in Mississippi was nothing other than an act of desperation and attempted intimidation. We encourage others who may have been victimized to contact us as no survivor should suffer in silence."""
"23XI Racing, Front Row's Legal Gamble: Could It Change NASCAR Forever?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregengle/2024/10/08/23xi-racing-front-rows-legal-gamble-could-it-change-nascar-forever/,2024-10-08T19:56:52Z,"Denny Hamlin is a guy who wears a lot of hats: that of a NASCAR driver, racing for Joe Gibbs Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series; as a father to two daughters; and as a NASCAR team owner, specifically a co-owner of 23XI Racing alongside NBA legend Michael Jordan and Curtis Polk since 2020. And ever since he put on the team owner hat, Hamlin's become pretty skilled at doing a high-speed hat dance. He's met with the media as a winning driver, and he's stood in as a team owner when one of 23XI Racing's drivers clinched a victory.

It's mostly been champagne showers and smiles, congrats, and trophies. But then last week rolled around, and 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports -- NASCAR's last two Charter agreement holdouts -- filed an anti-trust lawsuit against NASCAR and CEO Jim France. They allege that NASCAR's leadership has been using ""anti-competitive practices to prevent fair competition in the sport.""

""Everyone knows that I have always been a fierce competitor, and that will to win is what drives me and the entire 23XI team each and every week out on the track,"" Jordan, who is arguably one of the greatest players in any professional sport, said. ""I love the sport of racing and the passion of our fans, but the way NASCAR is run today is unfair to teams, drivers, sponsors, and fans. Today's action shows I'm willing to fight for a competitive market where everyone wins.""

This past weekend at Talladega Superspeedway Hamlin appeared in front of the media or the first time since the suit was filed in the Western District of North Carolina. He had to wear his team owner hat and answer the inevitable questions about the legal action.

""Michael Jordan sent me an awesome clip from the 'Moneyball,' where John Henry was saying 'the first one through the wall always gets bloodied.'"" Hamlin said when asked about the lawsuit. ""But, in the end, it's because you're threatening the status quo and threatening people's jobs and things like that. I hope it's not seen that way, just seeing that this is certainly an opportunity for us to try to promote change in the sport that's positive for everyone.""

For those unfamiliar, 'Moneyball' is a 2011 film based on the true story of Billy Beane's analytics-driven approach to building a professional baseball team, the Oakland A's. When it first emerged, it was seen as revolutionary, shaking up the way teams were built and challenging the norms of Major League Baseball.

The core issue in this lawsuit seems to be that teams want a bigger slice of the revenue pie NASCAR collects. For years, many teams have claimed they're bleeding cash, losing their collective shirts, and teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. It's like that old saying from NASCAR Hall of Famer Junior Johnson: ""The best way to make a small fortune in racing is to start with a big one.""

Meanwhile, some folks say NASCAR is rolling in dough, pulling in cash faster than a Cup Series car roaring down Daytona's backstretch, leaving a cloud of dust and dollar bills in its wake. And that's the rub. According to critics, NASCAR has a money mountain and should be willing to share more of it with the teams that bring the show to life every weekend.

That may have some truth to it, but NASCAR's not a publicly traded company, so its financial records stay locked up tighter than a vault. It's a family business, after all, started by ""Big"" Bill France in 1947. And Big Bill wasn't exactly known for playing nice when it came to pushback from drivers or teams.

Driver Curtis Turner tried to form a union with business partner Bruton Smith in 1961 while they were building Charlotte Motor Speedway. They sought help from the Teamsters Union to form the Federation of Professional Athletes (FPA). Big Bill shut that down, banning any union-affiliated driver from racing on NASCAR tracks. The rest of the drivers fell in line, leaving Turner and Tim Flock as the lone holdouts. Both were banned from NASCAR for life, and Charlotte Motor Speedway went bankrupt just over a year after it opened. Turner and Flock were eventually reinstated, and Charlotte emerged from bankruptcy but Big Bill's message rang loud and clear.

Flash forward to 1969, and Richard Petty led 11 drivers to form the Professional Driver's Association (PDA). They boycotted the inaugural race at Talladega due to safety concerns over tires. Big Bill found enough replacement drivers to hold the race, and the PDA folded soon after. The iron-fisted rule carried on through to his son Bill France Jr. and now rests with Big Bill's youngest son, Jim France, the current CEO, who has to handle this latest uprising.

Of course, filing a lawsuit doesn't mean there'll be a trial. Often, these disputes lead to private discussions and out-of-court settlements. But sometimes, things head to trial, where a judge or jury makes the call. If that happens here, we might see some eye-opening revelations.

You can bet the plaintiffs will want to dig into NASCAR's books, hoping to back up their claim that NASCAR is sitting on a cash pile tall enough to make Mount Everest look like a hill in the Blue Ridge Mountains. They're looking for that 'ah-ha' moment to shout, ""See, we told you so!""

But this move could boomerang on the teams, too. NASCAR might want to take a peek at the teams' financials to see if they're really bleeding money or just trying to get a sweeter deal. And unless a judge seals the records, the rest of us might get a front-row seat to the financial reality of both sides -- something no one's ever seen before.

Don't count on it though.

Neither side is likely interested in airing out their finances. Instead, expect closed-door negotiations where no one's eavesdropping. And these discussions could get heated. On NASCAR's side is the fact that 13 other teams signed the new Charter agreement (even if some grumbled that they were ""forced"" into it), leaving 23XI and Front Row as the last two holdouts. The France family might just stick to their guns, let the two teams' Charters expire, and put them in a tough spot next season. It's a classic NASCAR power play: play by our rules or take a hike.

For now, the plaintiffs are all about trying to not only get a bigger share of the revenue but weaken what they see as a stranglehold on the sport by NASCAR. If they pull it off, it'd be historic -- a shake-up that could leave Big Bill France spinning in his grave.

But don't count on that, either. Hamlin admitted over the weekend he's not sure what the future holds for the lawsuit, or if it'll reach a point where no one wins.

""Yeah, I'm not really sure and can't speak to that part of it,"" he said. ""I think it's been stated in statements by Michael Jordan that he loves NASCAR. We've obviously invested heavily in NASCAR and reinvested what I got out of this sport as a driver back into it as an owner. Certainly, we love the sport, just would love to see change as well.""

Maybe Hamlin should revisit ""Moneyball,"" because the true story it's based on doesn't exactly have a fairy-tale ending. Sure, Billy Beane's analytics-based system inspired a great story, but there were more artistic liberties than there are pickup trucks in Texas.

In real life, Beane is now an advisor to the team. And the Oakland A's who have not won a World Series since 1989. And though some (including the movie's producers) credit his system, known as ""sabermatics"", with helping John Henry's Boston Red Sox win their first World Series in 2004 after 86 years, others bemoan the way the fundamental sport of baseball has changed to one that is driven by data-analytics. For the record the A's have all but abandoned the sabermatic system.

So, is 23XI's goal to fundamentally reshape NASCAR or just get a bigger paycheck for their efforts? Whatever the reason, Denny Hamlin's lost more races than he's won, Michael Jordan didn't win every game he played, and the Oakland A's never won another World Series. Sometimes, even the best stories don't have the endings we expect.

So, is 23XI and Michael Jordan's mission to fundamentally reshape NASCAR, or is it just about getting a bigger paycheck for their efforts? Either way, the gamble is a risky one. History has shown that going up against NASCAR's iron grip doesn't often end in victory. Hamlin has lost more races than he's won, Jordan didn't win every game he played, and the Oakland A's haven't lifted a World Series trophy since 1989.

Change is hard to come by, and sometimes, even the most well-intentioned battles end up as cautionary tales. But one thing's for sure: when Denny Hamlin and Michael Jordan decide to fight, they don't back down without leaving a mark -- win, lose, or draw."
Cannabis Compounds Show 'Promising Potential As Anti-Cancer Agents',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajherrington/2024/10/08/cannabis-compounds-show-promising-potential-as-anti-cancer-agents/,2024-10-08T19:56:32Z,"Compounds in marijuana including THC and CBD show ""promising potential as anticancer agents,"" according to a recent review of scientific literature. The review by an international team of researchers found several ways that compounds in cannabis can affect cancer, including limiting the growth and spread of tumors and other benefits.

To complete the review, nine researchers from universities in Pakistan, Portugal, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Romania and South Korea conducted a comprehensive search of several online databases for scientific literature that investigated the association between cannabis and cancer. The authors' search ""focused on peer-reviewed articles, review articles, and clinical trials discussing the anticancer properties of cannabinoids."" To be included in the review, articles had to be written in English and contain information on ""the mechanisms of action and clinical efficacy of cannabinoids in cancer.""

Through their analysis, which was published last month in the peer-reviewed journal Discover Oncology, the researchers determined that cannabinoids including delta-9 THC, cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG) showed ""promising potential as anticancer agents through various mechanisms.""

""Cannabinoids, including Δ9-THC, CBD, and CBG, exhibit significant anticancer activities such as apoptosis induction, autophagy stimulation, cell cycle arrest, anti-proliferation, anti-angiogenesis, and metastasis inhibition,"" the researchers wrote, online cannabis news source Marijuana Moment reported on Monday. ""Clinical trials have demonstrated cannabinoids' efficacy in tumor regression and health improvement in palliative care.""

While the researchers found ample evidence of the anti-cancer properties of cannabis, they noted that it is not clear exactly what is driving these benefits.

""Despite the evident anti-cancer properties of cannabinoids from numerous experimental results,"" review notes, ""the exact mechanisms of action still require extensive research.""

The researchers added that ""Despite the positive outcomes of using cannabinoids in cancer therapy, there remain significant gaps in knowledge regarding their modes of action, effects on the tumor microenvironment, and the physiology of the signaling pathways they affect.""

The authors noted that cannabis has been used medicinally for centuries, ""particularly in Asian and South-Asian countries."" But they also acknowledged that researchers and clinicians today face challenges taking advantage of the medicinal properties of cannabis, including the plant's well known psychoactive effects, regulatory obstacles and a need for more research on optimal dosing.

""By expanding our understanding of cannabinoid mechanisms and their interactions with cancer cells, we can better harness their therapeutic potential in oncology,"" the researchers concluded.

After reading the review, Benjamin Caplan, M.D., a cannabis specialist and the author of The Doctor-Approved Cannabis Handbook, says that ""the science is really impressive.""

Caplan explains in an email that the ""review highlights that cannabinoids like THC, CBD and CBG show significant anticancer potential by inducing apoptosis (cell self-destruction), reducing cell proliferation, inhibiting angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels), and modulating the immune response.""

The review also illustrates the need for continued research into cannabinoids and cancer, including controlled randomized trials to develop standardized therapeutic protocols. In existing research, ""significant differences in effects are observed based on concentration, cannabinoid type, and cancer type,"" Caplan notes. ""For example, THC can have both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on breast cancer cell proliferation depending on receptor activation pathways.""

""Cannabinoids interact with multiple pathways, sometimes leading to unintended pro-tumor effects,"" he writes. ""The review suggests caution, as these mechanisms are not fully understood and require further exploration. Indeed, the endocannabinoid system may be one of the pivotal 'drivers' of physiology, but we have yet to determine which elements stimulate or inhibit its effects."""
IndyCar's Arrow McLaren Announce Sponsorship Extension With SmartStop,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucemartin/2024/10/08/indycars-arrow-mclaren-announce-sponsorship-extension-with-smartstop/,2024-10-08T19:56:20Z,"The Arrow McLaren IndyCar team and SmartStop Self Storage REIT, Inc. - otherwise known as ""SmartStop"" - will continue as partners in the NTT IndyCar Series.

One New York Yankees star isn't pointing the finger at his own squad for Monday's brutal loss.

The Yanks mustered up just seven hits and went 1-for-6 with runners in scoring position -- from the fourth through the eighth innings, no one even got into such a spot.

The Kansas City Royals' four-run fourth inning was enough for K.C. to get by New York, 4-2, in Game 2 of the American League Division Series to tie the series before heading back to Missouri.

All four runs were charged to Carlos Rodon, who started off red-hot by striking out all three batters in the first. The Yankees got the tying run at the plate in the ninth, but the comeback fell short.

Jazz Chisholm Jr. got the attempted comeback started, belting a solo homer to lead off the bottom of the ninth, so perhaps he is feeling confident. However, he made a claim that the Royals don't have much to celebrate.

""Still feels the same like we're gonna win it. We're going to go out there and do our thing still. We still don't feel like any team is better than us,"" the infielder said.

""We had a lot of opportunities tonight. They just got lucky.""

That quote apparently got the attention of the Royals clubhouse -- Maikel Garcia appeared to take his own shot at Chisholm.

""We don't fear nobody,"" the Royals infielder posted on X. ""Don't celebrate too early.""

The Yankees are now 3-for-19 in their first two postseason games, a common bugaboo for their latest October woes.

Clarke Schmidt (2.85 ERA) will take the bump for New York, while Kansas City will return with Seth Lugo (3.00 ERA). But with Kansas City splitting in New York, they now have home field advantage for the rest of the series.

UK/Ireland IEEE Section Visit And IEEE Elections,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2024/10/08/ukireland-ieee-section-visit-and-ieee-elections/,2024-10-08T19:52:38Z,"Late September and early October saw me visiting the UK and Ireland section, attending a meeting of the IEEE Governance Committee and calling the candidates in the 2024 IEEE election to let them know about the results of their candidacies. The visit to the UK and Ireland Section was arranged by the section chair, Paul Cunningham, who did a great job organizing many meetings during my visits to Dublin, London and Liverpool and was my companion during these travels.

During my travels I gave talks to many IEEE and broader groups on IEEE's support of diversity and inclusion, IEEE STEM resources and IEEE efforts to help develop the future of education. I also spoke on IEEE's activities on artificial intelligence its standards program on ethical design of intelligent and autonomous systems. as well as sustainability and IEEE activities on climate change mitigation (following up on activities that 2023 IEEE President Saifur Rahman began). A call-out to Elizabeth Kelly from the IEEE for her help in putting all these presentations together.

On Thursday, 9/26 I met with Laura Burke, the President, and Damien Owens, Director General, Engineers Ireland in Dublin and attending the annual Engineers Ireland Presidential Address. We spoke about possible future collaborations. On Friday 9/27, I met with the Provost of Trinity College, Professor Linda Doyle, where we talked about engineering education and we spoke about IEEE's tryengineering program for STEM students, created by the IEEE Educational Activities Board as well as the IEEE task force on how technology will change technical education, chaired by Karen Panetta from Tufts University.

On Sunday, 9/29 we flew to London and met with local IEEE Life Member Committee members, Charles Turner and Roland Saam. After a nice lunch at the Royal Automobile Club, we visited five IEEE engineering milestones in London. These were for Benjamin Franklin's house where he conducted investigations on electrical phenomena including lightening, Maxwell's Equations at King's College, The First Public Demonstration of Television in 1926, Abbey Road Studios for the invention of stereo sound in 1931 and the Invention of Holography at Imperial College in 1947. The image below shows the four of us crossing the street in front of Abbey Road Studios.

There used to be an application on the IEEE history site where one could access an interactive map to find individual milestones, which isn't available any more. I spoke with the IEEE Young Professionals about whether they might work with the history committee so users can click on a link for individual milestones to go to a mapping application, like google maps, to help find milestones. In addition, the YP committee was interested in some type of gamification of milestones where, for instance, people could collect visited milestones, post selfies with these milestones and get on-line badges for the number of milestones that they have collected.

On Monday, September 30, we visited the IET headquarters in London and met with Ed Almond, the Chief Executive and Secretary, to discuss possible collaborations between the IEEE and the IET. A historian at the IET, Anne Locker, showed us around the facility with its historical exhibits and showed us original books by Vitruvius, Gilbert, Raleigh, Newton and including the original notebooks of Michael Faraday. A page from the Faraday notebooks is shown below. I also participated in an IEEE Women in Engineering event as well as an AI event in the evening.

On Tuesday, October 1, I met with IEEE student branches and affinity groups at Imperial College, South Kensington campus in London. After that we took a train to Liverpool where we participated in an IEEE Week Diverse Engineering and Technology Workforce of the Future Event and Networking at John Moore's University. Wednesday, October 2, I participated in a Skills Gap and Provision for the Workforce Future event at John Moore's University and then I met with IEEE Student Branches and Affinity Groups and participated at WIE awards. That evening we flew back to Dublin.

During our visits with IEEE student branches there were student branch counselors as well as student branch officers attending. This is important as the counselors usually remain after student branch officers have graduated. They play an important role in letting students know that IEEE is more than a student club and it can be their professional home, providing value throughout their career.

On Thursday, October 3, I spoke at Trinity College Dublin with the IEEE Student Branches and Affinity Groups and gave a presentation to the UK and Ireland section at their Excom meeting regarding IEEE priorities for 2024, our strategic plan for the IEEE for the next five years and in particular the need to retain more younger members partly through greater engagement with industry. I also met with TCD engineering research groups.

After this I went to the Royal Irish Academy where I recorded some videos about AI and then participated in a discourse with Orla Feely, University College Dublin, in the meeting room at the Academy where we discussed AI and Engineering: Research, Resources and Regulation. The image below is from the discourse at the RIA.

On Friday, October 4, I participated in a Technology, Sustainability, and Climate Change Event at TCD and met with engineering department heads and their students at the college. The next morning, October 5, I flew to Minneapolis to attend a day of the IEEE board of directors Governance Committee meeting, find out the results of the IEEE elections from the Tellers on October 7 and then call the candidates to let them know the results of the election.

My visit to the UK and Ireland IEEE section focused on meeting with student branches about having IEEE as their professional home, meeting with other engineering organizations and talking about important topics for the IEEE, including a talk at the Royal Irish Academy."

A package of crystal meth from Europe shut down a board of elections office in New York for hours this week.

The Dutchess County Board of Elections office shut down for three hours on Monday, when officials discovered a suspicious package from Europe, sparking a Hazmat team to respond to the office and investigate.

""It came in through UPS from Greece. Prior to Greece, the inner envelope had been around a few other countries as well including France and then UPS'ed to the Dutchess County Board of Elections,"" Republican Elections Commissioner Erik Haight told the MidHudson News. ""The FBI is involved and I know they will be working with the Dutchess County Sheriff's Office and State Police to determine who sent this to us and why.""

A bipartisan team of BOE employees flagged the suspicious package to commissioners, with the team then donning Personal Protective Equipment to further investigate the package before calling law enforcement. The Dutchess County HAZMAT team ultimately responded to the scene, according to a press release from the county's board of elections.

Kamala Harris' tough words on Iran confounds critics,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-iran-biggest-us-adversary-china,2024-10-08T19:40:49Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris told the women of ABC's 'The View' that she would put a greater emphasis on small businesses and crimes against women and children.

Vice President Kamala Harris had harsh words for Iran in an interview Monday evening as she said the regime is America's biggest foe.

In a sit-down with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" the Democratic presidential nominee was asked to name the U.S.'s greatest foreign adversary. ""I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. Iran has American blood on their hands.""

""This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles. What we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power. That is one of my highest priorities.""

Harris declined to say whether she would take military action if given proof that Iran is building a nuclear weapon.

""I'm not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment,"" she told Bill Whitaker.

The suggestion that Iran was the greatest U.S. adversary raised some eyebrows -- as China is thought by many to be foe No. 1.

""Iran is our biggest adversary, not China?,"" Mary Kissel, former adviser to ex-Sec. of State Mike Pompeo, wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

""Harris is completely clueless for claiming that Iran is America's greatest adversary rather than China,"" former Trump adviser Steve Cortes said.

""Really? It's not Russia? It's not China? A middle power is America's greatest adversary?"" Iranian nuclear researcher Sina Azodi questioned.

Harris also defended U.S. aid to Israel -- at a time when many liberals are calling on her to halt that aid or put conditions on it amid the rising death tolls across Gaza and Lebanon.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel,"" she said.

Harris highlighted threats from ""Hamas, Hezbollah... Iran,"" asserting it is ""without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks.""

Still, she held out hope that Israel and its enemies could get to a ceasefire deal.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done, which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire."" She added, ""We're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.""

""China is the far greater threat just about, I think, everyone's estimation,"" said Rob Greenway, a former Trump aide and senior director of the National Security Council. ""If you really do view Iran as a threat, then the behavior they've made makes absolutely no sense.""

Former President Donald Trump has blamed President Joe Biden and Harris for loosening sanctions on Iran, which he said made the U.S. adversary ""very rich in a very short period,"" and prompted the turmoil that began with the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023.

During a rally last week, Trump tore into the September 2023 prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Iran that facilitated a detainee swap in Qatar and resulted in the release of $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets from oil sales.

""If they have somebody who was kidnapped, it's always $6 billion. Whoever heard of that?"" Trump said. ""Somebody else gets like $4,000.""

Iran said it had reached a ""good understanding"" to access the money from a Qatari bank account on Monday.

The Biden administration, meanwhile, has long claimed it has not rolled back sanctions on Iran. But ""it's not enforcing any sanctions,"" according to Greenway. Iran is now bringing in nearly $36 billion per year from oil sales.

Last week, Iran rained down 200 missiles toward Tel Aviv, many of them intercepted by both Israeli Defense Forces and U.S. capabilities. Though Iran's proxies have long attacked both Israeli and U.S. postures, it was the regime's first direct attack on Israel since April.

Harris was sharply critical of Trump for pulling out of the Iran deal in 2018. President Joe Biden campaigned on returning to the deal, but failed to do so in office.

""[Iran] made a tremendous amount of money. They have had doors opened by the U.S. administration,"" Greenway said.

HARRIS' 'WORD SALAD' ON ISRAEL ALLIANCE

The Trump administration's policies ""brought them to the brink of financial collapse.""

After Biden rolled back sanctions on Iran, the regime went from 500 centrifuges needed to make a nuclear bomb to 7,000. It went from 5% enriched uranium to 60% (90% is needed for a nuclear weapon.) It went from exporting 400,000 barrels of oil per day in 2019 under the Trump administration's harsh sanctions to 1.7 million barrels per day today.

Reports also suggest renewed activity in two nuclear weaponization sites in Iran - Sanjarian and Golab Dareh.

Last week, Biden warned Israel to make sure its response to the Iranian missile attacks was ""proportional,"" and urged them not to go after Iranian nuclear facilities.

While speaking at a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, he said when Biden was asked about Israel attacking Iran, the president answered, ""'As long as they don't hit the nuclear stuff.' That's the thing you wanna hit, right? I said, 'I think he's got that one wrong. Isn't that what you're supposed to hit?'""

He added nuclear proliferation is the ""biggest risk we have.""

Trump said when Biden was asked about Israel and Iran: ""His answer should have been: 'Hit the nuclear first. Worry about the rest later.'"""

Former New York Jets quarterback and current NFL analyst Ryan Fitzpatrick shared a cryptic post on social media after his former team announced the firing of head coach Robert Saleh on Tuesday following back-to-back losses.

Jets' owner Woody Johnson announced the decision on Tuesday, which followed New York's disappointing loss to the team's one-time quarterback, Sam Darnold, and the Minnesota Vikings in London. The Jets' lifeless offense fared better than it did in the previous week's loss to the Denver Broncos.

""This morning, I informed Robert Saleh that he will no longer serve as the Head Coach of the Jets. I thanked him for his hard work these past three-and-a-half years and wished him and his family well moving forward,"" Johnson's statement read.

""This was not an easy decision, but we are not where we should be given our expectations, and I believe now is the best time for us to move in a different direction.""

Following the news, Fitzpatrick, who last played for the Jets in 2016, posted a video of the controversial moment that Aaron Rodgers appeared to reject Saleh's embrace during their Week 3 win over the New England Patriots.

The incident caused a stir on social media, with many suggesting a fractured relationship between the two, but Rodgers and Saleh quickly set the record straight.

JETS SECURITY HAD TO ESCORT ROBERT SALEH OUT OF TEAM BUILDING AFTER FIRING: REPORTS

""Part of the things that we've been talking about is to just get the defense a two-score lead,"" Saleh told reporters at the time. ""And it was a two-score lead, so I guess he just wanted to see something on defense. He just reminded me that we got a two-score lead.""

""He's not a big hugger usually. So, I didn't know he was going for the hug,"" Rodgers added. ""He likes to do the two-hand chest push as well. But he talks a lot about two-score leads. So I kind of just gave him a push and said 'two-score lead.' That's what happened.""

But then there was the issue of cadence - another flame both Rodgers and Saleh quickly had to extinguish.

""Rob and I have a great relationship,"" Rodgers said during an appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show."" ""We have since day one when I got here. We have text message conversations, threads that we're in, conversations about a number of different topics outside of football. We have a good friendship.""

Fitzpatrick's post on social media comes amid speculation that Rodgers may have had a say in Saleh's firing. Johnson said Tuesday that he spoke with Rodgers on Monday, but not regarding his decision on Saleh.

""At the end of the day, this was my decision and my decision alone."""

If you're a senior brainstorming personal statements, crafting supplemental essays, and drafting activities lists, or a younger student engaging in extracurriculars, selecting courses, and planning your summers, identifying and eliminating these missteps can save time and effort -- and level up your application strategy.

Whether you're vying for Ivy League admission or seeking to join the bustling community at a state school, here are five ""red flags"" that admissions officers will notice on your application -- and how to avoid them:

Admissions officers want to see that students have challenged themselves by taking the most rigorous courses available to them at their school, such as honors, Advanced Placement (AP), or International Baccalaureate (IB) classes. Opting to take easier courses could suggest that a student isn't prepared for the academic challenges of collegiate study -- particularly at Ivy League and other top-tier institutions. It is critical that underclassmen not only maintain good grades, but also deliberately select courses that will push them intellectually. This is especially important with regards to courses in a student's area of interest -- if you intend to study engineering but have not taken any advanced physics or chemistry courses throughout your high school career, admissions officers will likely assume that you lack adequate training in the discipline or that you are not aware of the demands of the subject. Starting sophomore year, identify and enroll in classes that will demonstrate your academic expertise and deepen your knowledge of your subjects of interest.

If you are in the height of the application process and fear that you lack the necessary course rigor, consider how you might highlight your pursuit of further learning outside of the classroom. Have you conducted independent research? Participated in a prestigious summer program? Taken an online course? Use your supplemental essays to highlight the academic value of these involvements and how they have uniquely prepared you for the demands of university study.

The majority of your time in college will be spent outside of the classroom, and admissions committees want to understand the kind of community member you will be on their campus. Top schools want to admit students with a history of contributing positively to their communities -- those who will continue to use their skills and knowledge to enact positive change in the world after they graduate. Therefore, a lack of activities or involvements outside of the classroom will be a red flag to admissions officers, conveying a lack of interest in helping your community or a dearth of experience leading and working with others. Keep in mind that you can show your commitment to bettering your community in both large and small ways -- and that admissions officers will evaluate your application in relation to the resources available to you. In other words, you don't need to petition before Congress, found a nonprofit, or invent a groundbreaking technology in order to make a difference; what matters is that your engagement in your community stems from your genuine passions and unique perspective on problems that impact those around you.

Starting freshman year, seek ways to connect with community members (whether your peers, teachers, or industry leaders in your field) and get involved with volunteer organizations or clubs that align with your interests. Junior and senior years, serve in leadership roles or found your own initiatives to address needs that you have identified through your engagements early in high school. Finally, as you craft your applications, be sure to highlight these community-oriented activities and articulate their impact on your perspective and values. However big or small, you should provide compelling descriptions of your contributions and their impact on your worldview.

Your extracurricular involvements should tell a story about your interests, skills, and growth. While students should use their freshman year to explore and experiment with activities and organizations outside of the classroom, their goal should be to hone their involvements around their core passions over the course of their high school careers. A resume filled with diverse, unrelated extracurriculars that are not connected by any narrative thread will confuse admissions officers and ultimately hurt your application.

Instead of joining a bunch of clubs for the sake of padding your resume, be intentional about selecting activities on the basis of your passions and interests. As you engage with these activities over time, seek to make a tangible impact that will be evident to admissions officers, whether by taking on leadership roles, mentoring younger students, or starting your own club or initiative. Additionally, when it comes to crafting your application, be sure to connect the dots for admissions officers -- even if your extracurricular involvements reflect the diverse or interdisciplinary nature of your interests, be sure to show admissions officers how you have (and will continue to) draw creative connections between your interests that will enrich your intended field of study.

Admissions officers are looking for students who will positively contribute to their campus culture and reflect their institution's values. Given that 67% of admissions officers ""believe that checking out applicants' social media posts on apps like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, X, and Threads to learn more about them is ""fair game"" to help them make decisions about who gets in"" (according to a 2023 study), what you post has the potential to influence your odds of admission. Inappropriate content -- whether it's offensive language, inflammatory comments, or evidence of risky behavior -- will raise concerns about your character and maturity, and can impact your admission status even after you get in.

Be sure that you are not posting anything you would not want Ivy League admissions officers to see. Additionally, avoid linking your social media accounts on your application unless they directly pertain to work you have done during your high school career (a small business you founded, a volunteer opportunity, an educational TikTok, etc.).

Finally, students should keep in mind that the personal and supplemental essays are their most direct opportunities to speak to admissions officers on their application. This means that the essays are critical components of your applications, and both their content and their execution can convey a lot about you as a person and applicant. Given the pressure that comes with these essays, many students fall into traps that can lead to unprofessional writing. First, in their desire to stand out, some students choose to write about ideas or experiences that they consider ""edgy,"" but these topics are often unnecessarily divisive and can place them out-of-step with the values or mission of the institutions to which they are applying.

Another trap that students can fall into is oversharing about personal experiences. While it's important to share challenges you've overcome, there's a fine line between vulnerability and trauma-dumping -- going into excessive detail about traumatic or tragic circumstances in the hopes of gaining admissions officers' sympathy. Everything you share in your essays should convey something about who you are now -- how you have grown, developed, and introspected through your life experiences -- rather than simply listing the difficult experiences you have gone through.

While applying to college can be stressful, some of the anxiety of the process can be relieved by understanding what top colleges are looking for -- and what they seek to avoid. Students should take these red flags into account as they build admissions profiles that they will be proud to submit when the time comes."
Pennsylvania 2024 Trump-Harris Polls: Harris Has Less Than 1-Point Lead In Polling Averages,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/08/pennsylvania-2024-trump-harris-polls-harris-has-less-than-1-point-lead-in-polling-averages/,2024-10-08T19:37:17Z,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are nearly tied in Pennsylvania, according to two new polls this week in the battleground state, where a win for either candidate could pave the way to the White House.

No Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948. If Harris wins Pennsylvania, and the trend of also winning Wisconsin and Michigan holds, she's all but certain to win the White House.

82%. That's the share of registered voters in Pennsylvania who said the economy is a major factor in their 2024 vote, followed by inflation at 78% and the state of democracy at 70%, according to the CBS/YouGov survey. The results are on par with the national electorate, according to a recent Pew Research survey of registered voters that found 81% of registered voters rate the economy as ""very important"" in the election.

Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Harris over her previous endorsement of a fracking ban -- Pennsylvania is the country's second-largest natural gas producer. ""Fracking? She's been against it for 12 years,"" Trump said during Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. Harris, who said during a 2019 CNN climate town hall while she was running for president ""there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,"" has said she's since changed her stance. During Tuesday's debate, she said she made ""very clear"" in 2020 that she's against a fracking ban, presumably referring to her vice presidential debate with Mike Pence, and noted the Inflation Reduction Act opened new gas leases -- reiterating a stance she took in a CNN interview last month. Harris didn't actually say she changed her own position on the issue during the 2020 debate -- instead she said then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden ""will not end fracking.""

Pennsylvania has a divided state legislature. The state's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, is widely popular in the state. Democrats also control the House, but Republicans hold the majority in the Senate.

Harris leads Trump in four of seven battleground states, while Trump is ahead in North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling averages that show margins of less than two points in all seven battleground states (Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin). If Trump maintains his leads in Arizona and Georgia, and wins North Carolina, as he's expected to, he would need just one of the ""Blue Wall"" states (Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin) to win the White House.

Problems With The Medicare Prescription Payment Plan On Medicare.gov?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianeomdahl/2024/10/08/problems-with-the-medicare-prescription-payment-plan-on-medicaregov/,2024-10-08T19:35:32Z,"The Medicare Prescription Payment Plan, also known as MPPP, MP3 or M3P, is a brand-new program that will take effect on January 1, 2025, the same day as the $2,000 cap on Part D out-of-pocket drug costs. The MPPP is like an installment payment plan for those who have Part D prescription drug coverage. They'll be able to spread the costs out over the year, instead of paying all at once.

The 2025 drug plan details are now available in the Medicare Plan Finder, along with information about how the MPPP works and charts that show what your drug costs might look like with or without this payment option.

Right before the section called ""Estimated Total Drug and Premium Cost"" on the plan details page, there is a paragraph about the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan. Click on ""Find out what your drug costs might look like with this payment option"" and then a box appears, ""How will my monthly bill be calculated?"" Because costs can vary by pharmacy, save, create a PDF, or screen-capture the chart for each pharmacy you selected. (Find the pharmacy name in the pulldown menu and click, ""Change."")

The chart includes explanatory text. Of note is this reminder, ""This table only includes the costs for your covered drugs. If you have drugs in your drug list that aren't covered, those costs aren't shown below."" Also know that the chart is a prediction of costs, based on the current drug regimen. Any changes during the year will affect the monthly amount.

The chart has two columns: one for monthly costs if you don't enroll in the program and the second, the costs if you do enroll. I put together four examples that likely reflect common situations.

The first example illustrates a very common scenario, those who will not hit the $2,000 cap. Without the MPPP, they would pay their share when getting medications every month. In the MPPP, they could face a range of monthly payment; in this example, from $3.38 to $111.33.

The second example is for an enrollee who takes five drugs, including one Tier 4. She will reach the $2,000 cap in the first month. If she doesn't enroll in the MPPP, she will pay $2,000 in January, compared to $166.67 every month through the year if she does.

The third example is for a man with two Tier 3 drugs included in his regimen, and he prefers mail order. If he doesn't enroll in the MPPP, he will pay $1564.82 in January and $435.18 in April. With the MPPP, he will face monthly costs of $127.11 to $175.45.

The fourth example shows the costs for an individual who takes 10 drugs, Tier 2 and Tier 3. According to the chart, he will face costs of almost $3,200 every month, a total of $38,286.12, if not participating in the MPPP. However, if enrolling in the program, the chart shows his costs would drop to $166.67 a month, a savings of $36,286.12, in the calendar year.

The MPPP is not supposed to save any money, let alone over $36,000. What's going on here? His chosen pharmacy is out-of-network and drug plans do not pay for any drugs from noncontracted pharmacies. This enrollee would be responsible for the full cost ($38,286.12) and the MPPP would not save him any money. Someone in charge needs to fix the calculation to exclude the cost of drugs from an out-of-network pharmacy.

The fifth example highlights a switch to an in-network pharmacy. He would pay different amounts for six or 12 months, depending on whether or not he enrolls in the MPPP. Both columns add up to $2,000, no cost savings.

Those who do not hit the cap (example 1) will most likely not enroll. They would go from regular, predictable cost sharing to monthly bills in different amounts.

In examples 2 and 3, the enrollees would pay $2,000 in two payments instead of 12. If they can afford it, that might be the less-hassle option. On the other hand, those with limited resources might choose smaller monthly payments.

Then there will be cases, as with example 5, when it takes more than one or two months to hit the $2,000 cap. The decision would likely depend on whether they prefer paying at the time of medication pick-up or when they get the bill."
The Best Sex Toys That Experts Recommend For Partner And Solo Play,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/best-sex-toys/,2024-10-08T19:27:48Z,"Determining the best sex toys on the market is a task best served with a heaping dose of subjectivity -- arguably more so than with any other product. Luckily, it's never been easier to experiment with an array of products to find the ones that work for you. We named the Magic Wand Rechargeable Cordless Vibrator the best sex toy overall, thanks to its powerful motor and impressive battery. If you're on a budget, we recommend the Maude Vibe, an ultra-quiet model that's easily portable. Those seeking extra comfort should try the Tabu Nuri, which has a unique warming function.

In addition to making sure a product is made with nonporous, body-safe materials (like pure silicone, stainless steel or ABS plastic), it's important to be aware of the sorts of sensations that you prefer, how intense of a sensation you're after or how portable you'd like the device to be. We chatted with several sex experts and educators to find the 15 best sex toys worth your money (at an array of prices, including high-end sex toys). We've also pulled together expert tips for cleaning your toys, selecting a personal lubricant and how to best introduce sex toys into partnered play.

At Forbes Vetted, we've researched, written and published roundups on dozens of wellness and self-care topics.

While it may seem like there are a head-spinning assortment of products and online retailers to sift through, there are a few key points to keep in mind while shopping for the sex toys that you'll ultimately enjoy the most. Here's what to consider:

One key thing you'll want to keep in mind is ensuring the products you use are made with body-safe materials, like 100% platinum-grade silicone, ABS plastic, stainless steel, glass (borosilicate or soda-lime) and elastomer (TPE/TPR). ""When it comes to 'body-safe,' the first thought that comes to mind is phthalate-free materials,"" says Finn. ""Phthalates are a group of chemicals used in plastics or rubbers to make them more pliable -- in the sex-toy world they're most commonly found in cheap materials like jelly rubber, but those chemicals can be endocrine disruptors and cause harm to our bodies, especially when used internally.""

Sex toys come in a variety of different shapes: Wand vibrators are oblong and narrow, while rabbit-style vibrators are designed with two separate prongs for dual clitoral and G-spot stimulation. Strokers and rings, on the other hand, feature circular openings for the shaft of the penis. Size varies, too. Larger sex toys are more powerful and may be suited better for partner play, while pocket-sized models are ideal for travel and spontaneous solo sessions.

New innovations in technology have widened the scope for sex toys. The Womanizer Premium 2 Suction Stimulator, for instance, uses advanced air technology to create a unique sucking sensation for enhanced pleasure. Meanwhile, the Lovense Nora is Bluetooth compatible and can be controlled via mobile app from anywhere. Another nice-to-have feature is waterproofness: Certain sex toys are designed to be fully submerged in water, so you can bring your play into the shower or bath.

A high-quality sex toy can cost anywhere from $50 to $200-plus. ""Things that can make a sex toy more expensive are things like materials, motors and tech and other features and capabilities,"" says Finn. ""More refined motors that offer things like deeper vibrations and multiple intensities and settings are going to be more expensive to produce, and many of these more expensive vibes will come with warranties to back themselves up and protect your investment in a good quality product."" If you're new to experimenting with sex toys and aren't sure exactly what you'll enjoy most, you might want to try dabbling in more affordable products before investing in something you're more likely to use regularly."

New poll shows Harris taking a slim lead over Trump thanks to support from a surprising group,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-poll-shows-harris-taking-slim-lead-over-trump-support-from-surprising-group,2024-10-08T19:26:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Increased support from Republicans appears to be one factor fueling Vice President Kamala Harris with four weeks to go until Election Day in her White House showdown with former President Trump, according to a new national poll.

The vice president and Democratic presidential nominee stands at 49% support among likely voters nationwide, with the former president and GOP nominee at 46%, in a New York Times/Siena College survey released on Tuesday.

According to the poll, Harris stands at 47% and Trump at 44% in a multi-candidate field. Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver each grabbed 1%, with roughly 7% supporting another candidate or undecided.

Harris' edge - which is within the survey's sampling error - is up from the New York Times/Siena poll from last month, when the two major party nominees were deadlocked at 47%.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

The top-line number in the new poll is in the range of most other national surveys, which indicate the vice president with a slight edge over Trump.

The poll indicates Harris' support among Republican voters stands at 9%, up four points from last month.

As she turns up the volume on her efforts to court Republicans disgruntled with Trump, Harris last week teamed up with the most visible anti-Trump Republican in the town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP.

Harris campaigned in battleground Wisconsin with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP who, in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot on the U.S. Capitol, has vowed to do everything she can to prevent Trump from returning to power.

""I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the audience as she formally endorsed the Democrat presidential nominee. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

Harris praised Cheney as a leader who ""puts country above party and above self, a true patriot.""

The campaign event took place in Ripon, Wisconsin, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

The new poll also indicated Harris consolidating her support among older voters, and for the first time taking a slight edge over Trump in being identified as the candidate of change.

That's crucial in a race where voters have repeatedly shared with pollsters that they think the country's headed in the wrong direction. And the Trump campaign, feeding off such polling data, has repeatedly tied Harris to President Biden and their administration in the nearly three months since she replaced her boss at the top of the Democrats' 2024 ticket.

The poll was conducted Sept. 29-Oct. 6, with 3,385 likely voters nationwide questioned. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 2.4 percentage points."
Floridians reconsider staying home as Hurricane Milton edges closer,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5145911/hurricane-milton-florida-preparations,2024-10-08T19:24:12Z,"SARASOTA, Fla. -- Chris Smith hustled to the entrance of his local Sarasota Walmart Tuesday afternoon looking to stock up on food, water and other supplies as Hurricane Milton approached the western Florida coast.

Smith, 62, said he's doing something different to keep safe from the storm: He's leaving his Sarasota home.

""I have a friend that lives downtown in one of the high-rise condos, so I can park my car at a higher level. There's no way that building's gonna be affected,"" Smith said.

Before driving over there, he is fortifying his home's windows. Seeing the massive destruction of Hurricane Helene, which was a Category 4 when it hit Florida nearly two weeks ago, has Smith feeling paranoid about this storm, he said.

""It's very serious,"" he said. ""And I never feel that way. With all the information, all the numbers and everything, it's going to be destructive,"" he said.

Communities like Sarasota, Tampa and Fort Myers, and others along the western Florida coastline, are bracing for what officials warn will be a life-threatening storm. Storm surges are predicted to reach up to 15 feet high and several towns were placed under a mandatory evacuation.

The National Hurricane Center and Florida officials are using dire language to communicate the storm's threat to residents. Surprisingly, the usually hurricane-hardened Floridians appear to be taking it seriously. Cameras with the state's Department of Transportation showed crowded highways filled with evacuees heading north away from Milton's trajectory Monday evening.

Smith, from Sarasota, said he'd normally consider driving away from his home and into Georgia, but saw the traffic and decided against it because he's concerned about potential gas shortages.

""The issue is you're driving and there's nowhere to get gas. Everybody's filling their take up. So I bet half the gas stations are empty,"" he said. And if he wanted to drive to Georgia, he believed it was unlikely to find a gas station with fuel.

Early Tuesday, Florida officials said there weren't fuel shortages, but that lines at gas stations have been long with increased demand.

""We have been dispatching fuel over the past 24 hours as gas stations have run out. We have an additional 1.2 million gallons of both diesel and gasoline that is currently en route to the state of Florida. Fuel continues to arrive in the state of Florida by port,"" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said during a press conference Tuesday morning.

At least one gas tanker truck was seen driving along the highway south to Sarasota with state police escorts.

GasBuddy's Fuel Availability Tracker showed that as of 11 a.m. ET, 43% of gas stations in the Tampa and St. Petersburg area run out of fuel. About 28% of stations in the Fort Myers/Naples area were out of gas.

In other areas of the state, it's not Hurricane Helene's recent devastation or fears of Hurricane Milton that are top of mind, but rather a storm from two years ago.

In Fort Myers, the fears of Milton impacting the city like Hurricane Ian did in 2022 are palpable.

At least 149 people were killed in Hurricane Ian due to flooding, brought on by 15-foot storm surges, and 155-mph winds. It was the third-costliest hurricane on record after Katrina and Harvey.

Robert Parker, 37, stayed in his house with his son and fiancé when Hurricane Ian hit. His property is near the Caloosahatchee River, an area prone to floods due to the storm surge. During Hurricane Ian, they almost drowned.

""My son was two at the time,"" Parker told NPR. ""I had to pull my fiancé, my son, and our dog out the window."" It took him a year and a half to rebuild his home, he said. But now he and his family are leaving it, at least for now. The handyman went to Home Depot on Tuesday morning to buy some plywood to put up as hurricane shutters in his house. They are staying in a hotel inland.

""We are going to board everything up and ride it out in a hotel,"" Parker said. ""And then as soon as the storm is done I gotta get back to the property and make sure everything is alright.""

But city officials continue to deal with residents refusing to evacuate. Fort Myers Mayor Kevin Anderson has been encouraging people to leave and to expect the worst due to the unpredictability of the storm. ""My suggestion is you prepare yourself like it's going to be a dead-on bulls-eye hit on Fort Myers,"" Anderson said in a video posted on Facebook Monday. ""Anything less would be a blessing.""

Linda Husz, a retail worker in downtown Fort Myers, said it seems people in her town have listened to the mayor's words.

""I know more people leaving this time than ever left,"" Husz told NPR. But she's not leaving. ""This is home and I want to guard the fort,"" Husz said, adding she had hurricane shutters and a generator. ""So I've given myself some degree -- whether it's false or not -- a sense of security, and I've done all I know to do."""
Caitlin Clark's new boss to change her team's brand to be 'like Apple' amid WNBA pros calling its fans racist,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/caitlin-clarks-new-boss-change-her-teams-brand-like-apple-amid-wnba-pros-calling-its-fans-racist,2024-10-08T19:23:35Z,"Nick Wright addresses the blatant racism overshadowing a historic WNBA season.

Caitlin Clark has brought so much attention and popularity to the Indiana Fever, that the team's new president has big ambitions for its brand.

The Fever's new president of basketball and business operations, Kelly Krauskopf, said she wants to make the Fever's brand like the tech company Apple, during her introductory press conference on Tuesday.

""We have a foundational player in Caitlin Clark, and we're going to continue to add to that. But I want this team to be a leader in the country and an enduring brand like Apple. We have a real opportunity here,"" Krauskopf said.

For Krauskopf, Clark's presence on the team gives the organization a chance to reach a new generation of fans. She plans to be very forward-thinking in terms of who the team will be marketing itself too. She suggested the team will look to move on to focusing on a new demographic, compared to the fans that it appealed to when it won its only WNBA championship in 2012.

""This is the moment where it takes a generation some time to get to that level,"" Krauskopf said. ""I would tell our players, 'Look, we're building this for someone else. We're building this for someone's 10-year-old daughter now,' because that's what you do. We wanted to keep moving it forward, pushing it forward and paying it forward.""

""I know what kind of support we have and we have it and that's where I feel empowered and very confident in the direction that we're going because we have that level of support.""

Krauskopf also pointed out that Clark was 10 years old when the Fever won its first title. Now she believes that Clark will give the team a distinct recruiting advantage as it looks to evolve its brand and grow its fan base.

""If you're a smart basketball player and you watch the way [Caitlin Clark] plays, you would want to play with her,"" Krauskopf said.

However, Krauskopf will be looking to give the Fever this reputation after a season in which multiple WNBA players have criticized the Fever fans and accused them of being ""racist.""

After the team's loss to the Connecticut Sun in the first round of the playoffs, multiple Sun players spoke out against Fever fans and alleged they used racist language against them.

""Honestly, it's been a lot of nonsense. I think in my 11-year career, I've never experienced the racial comments [like I have] from the Indiana Fever fan base,"" Sun player Alyssa Thomas said after the Sun won the series on Sept. 25. ""It's unacceptable, honestly. There's no place for it.""

Thomas went so far as to say the Fever must intervene to halt their fans' actions.

""We don't want fans that are going to degrade us and call us racial names,"" Thomas said. ""We already see what's happening in the world and what we have to deal with in that aspect. We come to play basketball for our job, and it's fun, but we don't want to go to work every day and have social media blown up over things like that. It's uncalled for and something needs to be done, whether it's [the Fever] checking their fans or this league checking. There's no time for it anymore.""

Fellow Sun player DiJonai Carrington, who gave Clark a black eye in Game 1 of the playoff series, insulted the Fever fan base after Indiana defeated Connecticut 84-80 on Aug. 28.

""The Indiana Fever have the nastiest fans in the [WNBA]. Ew,"" Carrington wrote in a post on X that night.

INSIDE CAITLIN CLARK'S IMPACT ON MEN'S BASKETBALL

Meanwhile, Clark's longtime rival and Chicago Sky rookie Angel Reese has accused Clark's fans, both for the Fever and her fans during Clark's college career at Iowa, of racism, death threats and even sending explicitly AI-generated images of Reese to her family members.

""I think it's really just the fans, her fans, the Iowa fans, now the Indiana fans, that are really just, they ride for her, and I respect that, respectfully. But sometimes it's very disrespectful. I think there's a lot of racism when it comes to it,"" Reese said during the first episode of her podcast on Sept. 5.

""People have come down to my address, followed me home, it's come down to that... Multiple occasions, people have made AI-images of me naked. They have sent it to my family members. My family members are like uncles, sending it to me like, 'Are you naked on Instagram?'""

Clark herself addressed the allegations of racism against Fever fans during the team's exit interview. However, Clark did not acknowledge that the individuals accused of racism are fans of her or her team.

""Those aren't fans. Those are trolls,"" Clark said.

Regardless, the influx of followers Clark brought to Indiana and the WNBA as a whole is undeniable.

The WNBA broke viewership and attendance records this year, spearheaded by Clark's presence on the team. The 14 most-watched WNBA games this year all included the Fever, and the team's season finale against the Washington Mystics on Sept. 19 broke the record for most-attended game in WNBA history with 20,711 attendees after it was moved to a larger arena.

Clark drew a WNBA record 1.84 million viewers to her first playoff game against the Connecticut Sun on Sept. 22, while competing with NFL Sunday. She followed it up with another record audience of 2.54 million viewers for Game 2. Clark and the Indiana Fever lost both those games, however, sending Clark home for the offseason.

However, once Clark and the Fever were eliminated from the playoffs, viewership plummeted. The first game between the Aces and Liberty, a rematch of last year's WNBA finals between two of the league's most popular and successful teams, drew an audience of 929,000, ESPN announced, which is 50% less than the Fever's Game 1 against the Sun.

Now Krauskopf will look to use that ammunition to build up the team's brand, all while accusations of racism against the fan base by other players may potentially continue."

Youth games were scheduled on the field from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., the Denver Gazette reported, citing the Pikes Peak Pop Warner Youth Football and Cheer website.

The victim was reportedly identified only as a 29-year-old male, according to reports.

It's not enough to just deliver the products and services promised; service leaders go above and beyond to surprise and delight their customers. To showcase the best of the best in that regard, Forbes will publish its second-annual Best Customer Service list on October 22.

It is an aspect of business that is forever changing -- and always impactful. Experts in customer service at Sprout Social and helpdesk ticketing provider Zendesk report current customer service trends include more personalization, artificial intelligence and automation to swiftly address questions and issues. And top companies on this list take pride in their successes; The UPS Store went so far as to buy expensive ads featuring its No. 1 position last year during the 2024 College Football Championship.

Forbes has once again partnered with data analytics company HundredX to create the list. A 12-month survey of 181,000 people in the United States provided 4.4 million ratings of more than 3,500 brands, evaluating companies on four factors: personal interaction, speed, services and resolution. The questions were tailored to different industries -- restaurants were rated on taste, for example, while retailers were rated on returns -- and companies were compared to their competitors. At least 400 reviews were required for eligibility, and the top 300 made our list.

On X Iran's Exiled Crown Prince Called For Peace In The Middle East,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/08/on-x-irans-exiled-crown-prince-called-for-peace-in-the-middle-east/,2024-10-08T19:16:34Z,"The exiled crown prince and self-proclaimed advocate for a secular democratic Iran shared a ""message to the friends of the Iranian people"" on Monday, calling for an end to the sectarian conflict in the Middle East and an end to the current regime in his homeland. Reza Pahlavi, who fled Iran with his family following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, took to social media to emphasize that the current fighting is ""not the Iranian people's war.""

Pahlavi further suggested that Iran bears the responsibility for the October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel and is fueling the regional conflicts.

""So I say to you, our friends across the Middle East -- our region deserves so much better. But in order to succeed, first, this regime, that has held us hostage for nearly half a century, must go,"" said Pahlavi. ""The Middle East is all too familiar with turmoil and upheaval. So, I know, you might fear change will bring chaos. But fear not -- we will not allow a power vacuum to follow the collapse of this regime.""

The exiled crown prince, who has more than 1.4 million followers on the platform formerly known as Twitter, also suggested: ""Peace is neither a relic of history, nor a distant dream, it is a promise we owe to ourselves and our children, and together we can make it a reality.""

His nearly four-and-a-half-minute-long video has been seen more than 7.7 million times since it was posted on Monday. It is unclear how many of those views could have been from within the Islamic Republic, given how tightly Tehran controls access to outside media, but the youth especially has sought out ways to access X and other Western social media platforms.

""Iran has explicitly blocked X since 2009, but it's estimated that some 70% of Iranians use VPNs to get around the general block on social media sites,"" explained Dr. Matthew Schmidt, professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven.

""Maybe five to seven million are estimated to use X, but these are highly suspect numbers,"" added Schmidt. ""In any case, Pahlavi's message on X was repeated on many other sites, especially Telegram, which is probably the most popular banned app in Iran. Some estimates say there are as many as 45 million users, which would be roughly half the population.""

Today, Pahlavi has no official standing in the Iranian government, while his family's history is also one with a fair amount of controversy.

""His message surely got through to enough Iranians to be widely spread through one means or another. What effect it might have despite this is another story,"" said Schmidt, who acknowledged that the Pehlavi family is historically not well-liked.

""But the Crown Prince has significant support today according to a number of surveys and experts. His platform of human rights and a liberal government garner considerable support,"" Schmidt noted. ""Millions of Iranians separate their hatred of his father from the son, and his message is a call to stand up for that liberal vision, to not fear the tumult of a revolution, and to look toward the different future he is trying to represent to Iranians.""

While his calls for change may be noble, some would suggest any future Iran may not want to include members of the exiled royal family.

""Reza Pahlavi is not who he appears to be,"" warned geopolitical analyst Irina Tsukerman, president of Scarab Rising. She questioned his leadership abilities given ""the fact that he has had no professional much less government experience of any kind that would make him suitable for leadership position.""

Pahlavi has shown to be quite effective in employing social media to amplify his messaging, and according to his critics even to increase the appearance of popularity. However, some of the efforts have only divided the opposition in his homeland.

""The Iranian regime has used Pahlavi's messaging effectively to discredit any sort of opposition, divide Iranians and foster internal hatred and amplify this message and downplay alternative opposition voices which call for a liberal federalized democracy or an equitable approach to governance that would include pluralistic voices of different backgrounds,"" said Tsukerman.

It is also unlikely that this recent video message or even dozens of similar messages from the one voice would be enough to start an Iranian spring -- and not because the calendar notes that it is October.

""In theory, social media should be effective in disseminating talking points, bypassing censorship, advancing cultural knowledge and understanding, and fostering interpersonal relationships,"" said Tsukerman. ""In reality, due to the many misconceptions about the nature of the society, the Western-centric approach, the Western fixation on identifying the one 'perfect' dissident or opposition group while ignoring the diversity of voices in Iran, and the exploitation of the medium and algorithms by nefarious actors, positive and measurable impact is very difficult to achieve.""

In other words, the medium may be only as good as the understanding and the policy behind it.

In this case, the Western perception of Iran and the pragmatic approaches that bypass frauds and wishful thinking is something that needs to realign first, added Tsukerman.

""Only then can the policymakers figure out how to reach the public rather than have the conversations hijacked by bots and assorted operatives,"" she continued. ""That requires a very dedicated and nuanced approach to both intelligence gathering and communications strategy. And of course, any sort of effective discourse will be undercut by regime efforts to shut down Internet access.""

Yet, social media could still find a way of spreading anti-regime information to those desperate for change within the Islamic Republic.

""Such messages bear repeating,"" said Schmidt, ""And in what is really best understood as a political campaign conducted from afar, that message is now being carried in the best possible way: face to face, across kitchen tables one conversation at a time."""

Big name festivals that used to sell out in minutes struggled to sell tickets this year, too, like Burning Man and Coachella.

"Time Being Money, Turnkey Residences Surge In Popularity",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffsteele/2024/10/08/time-being-money-turnkey-residences-surge-in-popularity/,2024-10-08T19:03:59Z,"Readers well informed about real estate trends aren't likely to have missed the many recent references to a paradigm shift in luxury homebuyers' preferences.

A survey from Opendoor revealed two in three homebuyers are seeking ready-to-move-in ""turnkey residences,"" Meanwhile, the real estate press has trumpeted the apparent increasing popularity of ""instant homes"" and pre-furnished condominiums.

Maybe it's the need to really let loose following an extended period of Covid lockdowns. Maybe it's the recollection of long waits for furniture or appliance deliveries. Maybe it's the realization the already well-heeled can always make more money, but even they can't create more time. Or perhaps it's the continuing desire among Americans for instant everything.

Whatever the catalyst, high-end buyers' preferences for hassle-free convenience are growing, but not at the expense of desire for exclusivity and comfort.

""Within our market, we have seen a significant increase in buyers seeking a turnkey lifestyle,"" says Hillary Ryan, residential sales executive of Stanley Ranch, Auberge Resorts Collection, located in Napa Valley, Calif.

There, the turnkey collection of 1,700-square-foot, two-bedroom villas bearing price tags that start in the $4 million range provides buyers with access to wine country lifestyles and Napa's natural landscape. They also gain access to the well-being facility called Halehouse, dining venues serving fresh fare from the onsite farm, and private tastings and artisan craft workshops.

Ultimate luxury: time

""For today's luxury homebuyers, it's important to understand that their ultimate luxury isn't just another beautiful home,"" adds Chuck Cary, vice president of sales and marketing at Kohanaiki, situated on the Kohala Coast of Hawaii's Big Island.

""Their ultimate luxury is time. Turnkey residences redefine opulence by allowing them to reclaim the time and energy that otherwise would be spent in a demanding construction process . . . It's possible to create a carefully curated home that can almost perfectly align with their style and design choices. In offering a turnkey product, buyers can immerse themselves in the luxury lifestyle at our private community today, without having to wait for their home to be built, an unparalleled offering in itself.""

Panama 6 at Kohanaiki, a $12 million six-bedroom residence, offers 3,814 square feet of interior space with plenty of opportunities to enjoy dramatic ocean panoramas.

Step in, enjoy

""The turnkey product is highly sought after,"" agrees Dan Scott, designated broker, Whitetail Club Realty LLC, currently marketing 370 Sunshine Drive, a 2,912-square-foot, two-story, three-bedroom-suite, four-season hideaway in the under-the-radar town of McCall, Idaho. ""It's appealing to second home buyers because they want to spend their time enjoying all that Central Idaho and Whitetail Club have to offer.

""[They don't want to] spend their time working with an architect, hassling with local governments to get project approvals and managing a builder until project completion. They want to step in and enjoy, leaving the legwork to professionals they trust to get it done quickly and correctly.""

The Fairways Townhomes at Whitetail Club provide more than the convenient experience of choosing a model, exterior color and interior design style, Scott points out. In the completion of the turnkey process, homebuyers at Whitetail Club are also provided furniture packages.

""If buyers commit early enough in the process, we allow modifications to finishes such as tile, countertops and flooring,"" Scott says. ""This gives buyers a touch of customization to make the home feel like their own but doesn't add stress or complicate the process, which is a nice option for certain people."""
How To Ensure You're Not Just Another Resume In The Pile,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianehamilton/2024/10/08/how-to-ensure-youre-not-just-another-resume-in-the-pile/,2024-10-08T19:03:49Z,"The job market is tight right now. Even the most qualified candidates are struggling to get noticed. Friends and colleagues tell me it is taking them months or even a year to land a position. So, what can you do to ensure you make it to the next level in the interview process? First, be sure your background is not too much of a stretch to land the jobs for which you apply. If it's not about lacking skills or experience, it's likely about cutting through the noise in a sea of applicants. So, ask yourself: What could be the missing link? It likely could be your level of curiosity, which could be the one critical thing you need to develop to get that coveted job.

The reality is, recruiters and hiring managers are on the lookout for candidates who stand out -- those who show a genuine interest in the role, team, and company culture. Not demonstrating curiosity can be a turnoff to recruiters. Curiosity goes beyond qualifications; it shows you're eager to learn, adaptable, and ready to bring fresh perspectives. In a LinkedIn survey, 92% of hiring managers said soft skills can be more important than hard skills, with curiosity being a top contender. Demonstrating curiosity can help ensure you are not just another resume in the pile.

In my work presenting to future graduates through university career centers, I often hear students ask, ""What questions should I ask in an interview?"" I tell them it's not about having a pre-set list; it's about being genuinely curious. For example, one student who landed a job at a top tech firm asked during her interview, ""What are the key qualities or skills that have been most valuable to people who have succeeded in this role in the past?"" This question not only demonstrated curiosity about the role but also opened up a conversation that led to showcasing problem-solving skills relevant to those challenges. Instead of generic questions, dig deeper to show that you're already thinking about the impact you could make.

Different stages of the interview process call for different kinds of curiosity. When speaking to students who are about to graduate, I often emphasize the importance of tailoring your questions to each interview stage. When initially talking to a recruiter, it is about gauging fit, so ask about the company culture, values, and what makes someone successful there. When you get to a hiring manager or potential colleague, shift the focus to how the department is evolving or what challenges they anticipate in the next six months.

Your resume and cover letter aren't just a place to list what you've done -- they showcase how you think. I encourage students to go beyond bullet points and weave in stories where their curiosity has led to a tangible outcome. Did you lead a project that solved a significant problem because you asked questions no one else did? Did your inquisitiveness lead to adopting a new technology or process that improved efficiency? Show how your desire to dig deeper created value.

I've seen the difference it makes when candidates approach networking with curiosity rather than neediness. Instead of saying, ""I'm looking for a job in marketing,"" try, ""I'm fascinated by how digital marketing strategies are shifting with AI. How is your organization approaching these changes?"" This approach is more likely to foster genuine connections that open doors.

Behavioral interviews can be a test of memorized answers. When asked about a challenging situation, you might say, ""I noticed a recurring issue and got curious about why it was happening. That led me to dig into the data, uncover a root cause no one had seen before, and propose a solution that saved us time and resources."" This not only answers the question but highlights your proactive and problem-solving mindset.

Companies today are looking for people who are genuinely invested in growing. Talk about the webinars, courses, or side projects you're pursuing, not because they're required, but because you're curious. Are you experimenting with data analytics on your own? Are you exploring new trends in design? These questions tell the interviewer that your curiosity runs deeper. It is important to highlight any passion projects during interviews.

In today's job market, curiosity is a powerful differentiator. It's what makes you memorable, what makes you relatable, and what makes you the kind of person a company wants on their team. When you lead with curiosity, you're not just applying for a job -- you're showing up as someone who's ready to learn, grow, and make an impact. So, ask the questions, dig deeper, and don't be afraid to show that you're genuinely interested. Your future employers will notice."
Tim Walz on whether he could be trusted to tell the truth: 'I think I can',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/tim-walz-whether-he-could-trusted-tell-truth-i-think-i-can,2024-10-08T19:03:28Z,"Minnesota Gov.

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was asked about whether he ""can be trusted to tell the truth"" during Monday's special election edition of ""60 Minutes.""

CBS News' Bill Whitaker told viewers that Walz ""has been criticized for embellishing or telling outright falsehoods about his military record and about his travels to Asia in the 1980s.""

During his sit-down with the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Whitaker highlighted Walz's comments during last week's vice presidential debate when he referred to himself as a ""knucklehead"" after admitting he was not in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre.

""Is that kind of misrepresentation, isn't that more than just being a knucklehead?"" Whitaker asked.

""I think folks know who I am and I think they know the difference between someone expressing emotion, telling a story, getting a date wrong ... than a pathological liar like Donald Trump,"" Walz told the journalist.

""But I think it comes down to the question of whether - whether you can be trusted to tell the truth,"" Whitaker followed.

""Yeah, well, I can. I think I can,"" Walz responded.

""I will own up to being a knucklehead at times, but the folks closest to me know that I keep my word,"" Walz added.

Walz has faced intense media scrutiny in recent weeks since Vice President Kamala Harris tapped him to be her running mate, particularly about various falsehoods he has peddled over the years.

During his appearance on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Walz shrugged off the criticism.

""I've got to be honest with you, Shannon. I don't think people care whether I used IUI or IVF when we talk about this, what they understand is that Donald Trump would resist those things,"" Walz told host Shannon Bream.

5 sets of NHL brothers who shared the ice as part of the same team,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nhl-brothers-who-shared-ice-part-same-team,2024-10-08T18:53:39Z,"Stanley Cup champion Mark Streit talks to Fox News Digital about his new assignment off the ice.

The NHL has a long history of welcoming brothers into the professional league. Sometimes, brothers become rivals on competing teams, while others have shared the ice as teammates. There have even been brothers who have basked in the glory of a championship win together, hoisting the Stanley Cup up high.

Since the NHL was organized in 1917, many brothers have shared the ice. Read on to learn more about a few brothers who also were teammates.

TEN MOVING SPORTS MOVIES BASED ON REAL PEOPLE AND THEIR IMPACTFUL STORIES

Starting off this list is the Sutter brothers.

There are actually seven brothers in the family, though only six played in the NHL: Brent, Brian, Ron, Duane, Rich and Darryl.

At one point or another, all six Sutter brothers played for either the Chicago Blackhawks or the St. Louis Blues.

STANLEY CUP: THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE NHL'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS TROPHY

Among the brothers, six Stanley Cups were won as players, including in 1982 and 1983, when Duane and Brent worked together on the Islanders for championship wins.

Rich and Ron were also teammates for a time, spending three years together with the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1980s and another three with the St. Louis Blues, coached by Brian.

Scott and Rob Niedermayer both found success in the NHL, including together on the same team.

They played together for the Anaheim Ducks and won the Stanley Cup in 2007.

Even though Scott and Rob grew up together, they have spoken about how the NHL actually brought them closer.

""I learned a few things about him I didn't know,"" Scott said in 2007, per The Hockey News. ""I got to know him a little better.""

""I see him in the dressing room. He's a little more talkative and fun-loving than maybe I've seen him before. That's one area that is a bit new to me,"" he went on to say.

Before becoming teammates, they spent many years apart.

""In hockey season, ever since we were 15 or 16, we went our separate ways,"" Rob said, per The Hockey News. ""We'd see each other a bit in the summer, but that was about it.""

""This is a lot better. We see each more often. It's worked out really well,"" he continued.

There are four Staal brothers: Eric, Marc, Jordan and Jared.

Multiple Sutter brothers have played for the Carolina Hurricanes.

In 2003, Eric was drafted by the Hurricanes, and won the Stanley Cup with the team in 2006. In 2013, Eric, Jordan and Jared all played for the team.

In 2016, Eric went on to play for the New York Rangers, where he joined his brother Marc. Eric and Marc also played together for the Florida Panthers.

NHL PLAYERS WILL RETURN TO OLYMPICS IN 2026

Jordan is the only brother still part of the NHL, and as of the 2024-2025 season, holds the title of captain for the Hurricanes.

The Richard brothers spent several years together as teammates.

Maurie, nicknamed ""Rocket,"" played his whole career with the Montreal Canadiens, from 1942 to 1960.

Henri, the younger brother, nicknamed ""Pocket Rocket,"" joined the Canadiens in 1955 with his brother. Henri won 11 Stanley Cups during his career, the most of any player, according to NHL Records. He retired from the league after the 1974-75 season.

HOCKEY HALL OF FAMER SPREADING AWARENESS ON HEART CONDITION THAT FORCED HIM INTO EARLY RETIREMENT

The Hughes brothers have taken the NHL by storm.

All three of the brothers were early picks in various NHL drafts.

Luke was the latest of the trio to join the NHL, as the fourth overall pick in the 2021 draft by the New Jersey Devils.

In 2018, the oldest Hughes brother, Quinn, was chosen by the Vancouver Canucks as the seventh overall pick. Jack was the first overall NHL draft pick in 2019, by the Devils.

DEVILS DEFENSEMAN LUKE HUGHES TO MISS START OF SEASON AFTER SUFFERING SHOULDER INJURY IN OFFSEASON TRAINING

Luke and Jack both play for the Devils, while Quinn remains part of the Canucks.

At the end of 2023, the three brothers all shared the ice for the first time.

""Of course you dream you're going to play with your brothers in the NHL one day,"" Jack said ahead of the game, per the New Jersey Devils' website. ""You're in the basement, hanging out, playing, but you never really think it's going to become a reality. For it to happen, it's definitely pretty wild. It's three kids in one game.""

The family became the ninth to have at least three brothers play the same game, according to the source. The last to do so prior to the Hughes brothers were the Staal brothers in April of the same year.

""I definitely didn't expect something like this to happen when we were kids, but it's really cool,"" Luke said. ""That's the dedication shown by our parents... how hard they worked and how hard the three of us worked too. It's going to be fun.""

""Of course, it's the dream,"" Quinn said of the game. ""We probably talked about it as kids playing mini-sticks and stuff but as far as this year, they're going to want two points, I'm going to want two points, and everyone's worried about their individual game.""

The Hughes brothers also made history as the first set of siblings to be on an EA Sports cover in 2024.

""We feel incredibly honored to be on the cover of NHL 25,"" said Quinn, per NHL.com. ""Being featured alongside my brothers is the sort of thing you dream about as a kid but could never imagine happening in real life."""

Hurricane Milton Live Updates: Here's What To Know As Storm Nears Category 5 Status -- Again,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/10/08/hurricane-milton-live-updates-heres-what-to-know-as-storm-nears-category-5-status-again/,2024-10-08T18:49:37Z,"Hurricane Milton is nearing Category 5 status -- again -- as it continues to move across the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida, where millions have been told to evacuate as forecasters warn it could be be ""one of the most destructive hurricanes on record"" for the west-central part of the state.

President Joe Biden addressed the country from the White House Tuesday morning and called Hurricane Milton ""a matter of life and death."" He encouraged Florida residents in the path of the storm to evacuate ""now"" and postponed a planned international trip to Germany and Angola ""in order to oversee preparations for and the response to Hurricane Milton."" Vice President Kamala Harris and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have been in a strange he-said-she-said about the incoming storm, with Harris accusing DeSantis of not taking her calls and ""playing political games"" Desanis said Harris ""has no role in this"" and that he's been communicating just fine with Biden, who also said he has been in touch. Biden said he gave DeSantis his personal phone number and told him to call if there is anything the federal government can do to help.

Tampa International Airport closed at 9 a.m. Tuesday with plans to reopen ""as soon as it is safe"" later this week and Orlando International Airport will close at 8 a.m. Wednesday. Almost 1,000 flights into and out of the United States were delayed as of Tuesday afternoon with another 700 canceled. More than 1,500 flights scheduled for Wednesday have been canceled, Reuters reported, and major airlines have told passengers they can change their plans without paying a fare difference. Walt Disney World Resort, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando were all open and running as usual Tuesday, but each company said they were monitoring the weather and will make adjustments as needed.

Milton will be the second major hurricane to hit Florida in two weeks. Hurricane Helene hit the state on Sept. 26, killing at least 20 in Florida, before going on to devastate parts of the southeastern United States. More than 220 people have died and hundreds more are still missing, with western North Carolina taking the brunt of flooding that the state's governor says wiped communities ""off the map."" In Florida, people are still working to clear debris from Helene as the next storm bears down. Ahead of Hurricane Milton, Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, ordered evacuations for areas near Tampa Bay and for all mobile and manufactured homes by Tuesday night. Lee County, home to Fort Meyers, issued a mandatory evacuation order for the island of Fort Myers Beach. Other mandatory evacuation orders have been issued in Pinellas County, Pasco County and Manatee County. DeSantis on Tuesday said he wasn't sure exactly how many people plan to evacuate for Hurricane Milton, but that he thinks those who saw Hurricane Helene will be particularly motivated to leave the area.

Federal Emergency Management Agency has said it is grappling with ""extremely damaging"" false narratives circulating about Hurricane Helene, which hit the U.S. two weeks ago. FEMA chief Deanne Criswell said misinformation about the storm and the federal government's response is the ""worst"" she's ever seen as former President Donald Trump and his allies slam the agency. Trump incorrectly claimed FEMA couldn't respond appropriately to the storm because it diverted so much money to helping migrants on the order of Vice President Kamala Harris. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the agency is ""meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have."" Other rumors include that FEMA has been withholding aid from areas that have historically voted Republican and that the agency is only giving $750 to disaster survivors to support their recovery."
John Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett could vote to uphold Biden's 'ghost guns' regulation,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ghost-guns-john-roberts-amy-coney-barrett-rcna174502,2024-10-08T18:46:39Z,"The chief justice and the Trump appointee sided with the government in earlier litigation on regulating the weapon kits. They might do so in the final ruling, too.

The Supreme Court split 5-4 last year when it temporarily approved the Biden administration's regulation of so-called ghost guns, pending a final resolution of the litigation. If Tuesday's oral arguments in the dispute are any indication, the justices could be on their way to fully allowing government regulation of the kits for making untraceable weapons.

Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett were in the majority last year alongside the court's three Democratic appointees, over the dissent of the remaining four Republican appointees. Roberts' and Barrett's questions at Tuesday's hearing suggested that their votes in the final resolution of the case could track their earlier votes.

To be sure, oral argument is never a guaranteed sign of how the court will rule, so we'll have to see how the justices come down in the decision, which is expected by late June.

But following the hearing, the challengers to the regulation might not feel great about their prospects. At one point, Barrett said one of their arguments sounded ""a little made up."" Roberts questioned their claim that the kits are enjoyed by people who like building guns in the way that people like working on their cars over the weekend. And the court's three Democratic appointees were expectedly favorable to the government, bolstering the possibility that the court's temporary vote last year could mirror its permanent one.

As I noted in a preview of the case, the appeal stems from a challenge to a 2022 rule from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that regulates the ghost gun kits and parts. The agency isn't banning ghost guns but rather wants to treat them like regular firearms, meaning they need serial numbers, licensed dealers and background checks. The legal question basically comes down to whether the agency is within its rights to regulate the kits under federal law, or whether, as the challengers argue, the agency acted beyond its congressional authorization.

Responding to the challengers' contention that ghost gun kits are for hobbyists, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar called that ""a questionable proposition, given that if it only takes 20 minutes, the hobbyist is probably not going to get his money's worth and won't actually have the experience of building a gun."" She also said that the claim is ""contradicted by the facts on the ground. Because what the evidence shows is that these guns were being purchased and used in crime. They were sold to be crime guns."""

A Florida woman accused of suffocating her boyfriend inside a suitcase prepares to stand trial next week after Hurricane Milton delayed the case.

Sarah Boone's request for professional hairstyling and makeup for her murder trial was denied by a judge last week because of security concerns about those products, CourtTV reported.

Boone, 46, has been charged with second-degree murder in connection with the 2020 suffocation death of her boyfriend, Jorge Torres, 42, at their Winter Park apartment.

Torres was found dead inside the suitcase at the apartment the morning of Feb. 24, 2020.

The Florida State Attorney's Office released a video allegedly recorded on Boone's cellphone, showing Torres' final moments as he shouted, ""I can't breathe,"" after allegedly being shut inside the suitcase during a drunken game of hide-and-seek.

Boone allegedly told law enforcement that she and Torres drank wine and played hide-and-seek when she passed out in her bed.

Boone had sought to suppress her initial interview with police from being used during the trial, but a judge denied that request, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

As predicted by space weather forecasters, mid-latitude auroras were visible on Sunday, Oct. 6 and Monday, Oct. 7, across the world.

Although not as strong as May 10's extreme G5 geomagnetic storm -- the most powerful for two decades -- the activity was photographed from as far south as Alabama in the U.S., according to SpaceWeather.com.

They were triggered by X-rated solar flares on Thursday, Oct. 3, that led to coronal mass ejections. Solar flares are bursts of electromagnetic radiation from the sun that travel at light speed, while CMEs are clouds of charged particles that take a couple of days to reach Earth on the solar wind. It's the latter's effect on Earth's magnetic field that causes the aurora.

NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center a G3 (strong) geomagnetic storm, though with witnesses across the U.S, it was likely a G4 (intense) display.

To see the aurora so far south is unusual. They're typically seen in polar regions at around latitudes of 70 degrees north and south, and only during periods of exceptional magnetic activity on the sun do displays reach as far as 40 degrees north and south.

The sun has been at its most active for 23 years and is about to strike its ""solar maximum"" -- the peak of the solar cycle -- which occurs roughly every 11 years.

Solar maximum was predicted to occur during 2025 during a weak cycle, but space weather experts' new window for solar maximum is between January and October 2024. It will only be confirmed in retrospect since it's measured by the number of sunspots -- dark areas on the sun's surface -- that are counted.

Although some geomagnetic activity is possible on Tuesday, Oct. 8, it's not forecast to be particularly strong nor visible in the U.S. No geomagnetic activity is forecast for Wednesday, Oct. 9, nor Thursday, Oct. 10, but Earth-orbiting satellites detected an X2.1 class solar flare at Oct. 7, so that could change.

Multiple telecoms giants have been hacked by a Chinese government cyber espionage unit commonly referred to as Salt Typhoon, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. The paper cited individuals familiar with the matter, who said China had tried to access systems that police use to intercept traffic for criminal investigations. It's unknown if the hackers also compromised systems used to intercept traffic abroad.

Among the victims were AT&T, Verizon and Lumen Technologies. None commented on the attacks.

This highlights a potential blind spot in America's critical networks: the ""backdoors"" enabling law enforcement to have some level of remote access to telecoms companies when they're ordered to carry out a wiretap. ""When commercial entities build systems that capture or can access mass data, hackers & intelligence services will come for them,"" John Scott-Railton, a cybersecurity researcher for the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, wrote on X.

Short seller Hindenburg Research has taken a short position on gaming company Roblox and claimed that it both inflated user metrics and failed to protect children from harmful content. Hindenburg, which has a reputation of putting out research on public companies it bets against on the stock market, also accused Roblox of allowing an ""X-rated pedophile hellscape"" as the firm discovered ""requests to trade child pornography and engage in sexual roleplay fantasies with children"" on the site.

The allegations have caused Roblox's share price to fall, but the company slammed the short seller's report as ""misleading,"" telling the Wall Street Journal, ""We firmly believe that Roblox is a safe and secure platform and in the financial metrics we report.""

Harvard researchers have added facial recognition to Meta's Ray Ban augmented reality glasses, identifying individuals just by looking at them, based on their online profiles. The scientists combined the glasses with the Pimeyes facial recognition software and other tools, which made it possible to instantly display people's personal information, including their address and contact details, 404 Media reports.

The Washington Post has an investigation looking at multiple cases where cops apprehended someone partly based on a facial recognition match and didn't disclose using the tech, even though it's previously been associated with wrongful arrests. The reporting itself reveals some of this opacity-the Post filed document requests from more than 100 police departments, but only 30 provided arrest records.

Jen Easterly, head of the DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), says that there's zero chance of hackers influencing next month's presidential election. ""Malicious actors, even if they tried, could not have an impact at scale such that there would be a material effect on the outcome of the election,"" Easterly told The Associated Press. She said the technologies used to handle ballots had never been more secure.

The AP has a longform read on how IronNet, a company cofounded with a former NSA chief and packed with ex-US intelligence staff, fell apart. The business promised to find hackers and weaknesses on clients' networks but collapsed thanks to what sources described as dubious business practices, poor products and ""associations that could have left the firm vulnerable to meddling by the Kremlin."""
The Power And Prescience Of Octavia Butler's 'Parable Of The Sower' : 1A,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/1210938285/1a-10-08-2024,2024-10-08T18:40:09Z,"It's 2024. Extreme weather events due to global warming have overwhelmed parts of the United States. Water is increasingly scarce. The mass migration of people in search of more livable conditions has caused political tension and border closures. A drug epidemic spreads across the country. And a candidate for president promises he can fix the country's problems with more religion and fewer regulations.

That's the premise of Octavia E. Butler's novel Parable of the Sower, which was published in 1993.

The novel contains a powerful and poignant vision of the United States of the future, one that rings scarily true in the present. The 2024 of Butler's 1993 work isn't so far away from the 2024 in which we'll all currently living. Butler published a sequel, Parable of the Talents, in 1998. Both feature a protagonist named Lauren Olamina, a young woman trying to survive and make a life for herself.

What can we learn from Butler's novel? What makes both Sower and Talents so enduring as a series of speculative science fiction? And what does it mean that our world more and more bears resemblance to works of apocalyptic fiction?"
'60 Minutes' defends handling of Hunter Biden laptop coverage as it hits Trump for skipping interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/60-minutes-defends-handling-hunter-biden-laptop-coverage-hits-trump-skipping-interview,2024-10-08T18:39:44Z,"CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley addressed former President Trump's absence from the ""60 Minutes"" election special.

""60 Minutes"" defended its coverage of the Hunter Biden laptop scandal while taking a swipe at former President Trump for skipping an interview for its traditional election special.

CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley addressed the behind-the-scenes drama that unfolded between the network and the Trump campaign leading up to the now-scrapped sit-down.

Pelley said that the campaign ""offered shifting explanations"" for its apparent reversal.

""First, it complained that we would fact-check the interview. We fact-check every story,"" Pelley said. ""Later, Trump said he needed an apology for his interview in 2020. Trump claims correspondent Lesley Stahl said in that interview that Hunter Biden's controversial laptop came from Russia. She never said that.""

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Pelley was likely referring to comments Trump told reporters last week when CBS News announced the former president would not be appearing on ""60 Minutes.""

""Last time I did an interview with them, if you remember, they challenged on the computer. They said the laptop from Hell was from Russia. And I said it wasn't from Russia, it was from Hunter. And I never got an apology. So, I'm sort of waiting,"" Trump said. ""I'd love to do '60 Minutes.' I do everything. I mean, I do you right now, right? And you're tougher than '60 Minutes' frankly. The laptop from Hell was from Hunter. It wasn't from me ... Lesley Stahl, we got into a little bit of an argument on the camera, talking about that and other things. And you know, they really owed me an apology.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREED TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Pelley didn't mention how Stahl dismissed the laptop scandal during her interview with Trump shortly before the 2020 election.

At the time, Trump insisted that then-candidate Joe Biden was ""in the midst of a scandal,"" referring to reports about the email's contents showing his involvement in his son's overseas business dealings.

""He's not,"" Stahl replied.

""Of course he is, Lesley,"" Trump sternly doubled down.

""No, c'mon,"" Stahl continued to reject the president's claim, before lecturing him, ""This is '60 Minutes' and we can't put on things that we can't verify.""

CBS News eventually went on and verified the infamous laptop in 2022. Numerous other mainstream media outlets dismissed or downplayed the laptop initially before eventually acknowledging its authenticity.

Pelley also doubled down on CBS News' assertion that Trump ""backed out"" of the interview after the Trump campaign insisted it never committed to one.

""The Trump campaign had told us that the interview would be this past Thursday at Mar-a-Lago. They also asked us whether we would meet 78-year-old Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was grazed in an assassination attempt. We agreed,"" Pelley told viewers. ""On September 9th, Trump's Communications Director Steven Cheung sent a text that said, quote, 'I'm working with our advance team to see logistically if Butler would work in addition to the sit-down.' 'Sit-down' meaning the interview in Florida. Days later, Cheung called to say, quote, 'The president said yes.' Then, a week ago, Trump backed out.""

Last week, Cheung denied Trump had ever officially accepted the invitation, posting on X, ""There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in."""
Opinion | A tit-for-tat war with Israel will not turn out well for Iran,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/iran-regret-attack-israel-missiles-hezbollah-rcna174375,2024-10-08T18:37:58Z,"Last week, and for the second time this year, Iran launched a missile strike against Israel. This one, however, the military equivalent of poking a sleeping bear, is likely to provoke a fearsome Israeli response.

Iran's first direct attack in April, which targeted non-civilian areas and was telegraphed in advance, looked more like a demonstration project than a serious strike. It was Tehran's response to Israel assassinating a top Iranian general in Syria, but it appears to have been purposely narrowed to prevent a significant Israeli retaliation. Israel delivered a token response (attacking a single long-range air defense system) and, at least for a time, the threat of greater escalation diminished.

Last week's strike, a response to the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah (a close ally of Iran) in a southern suburb of Beirut was qualitatively different. Iran fired missiles directly at civilian areas of Tel Aviv -- and sent millions of terrified Israelis into their safe rooms.

From a military standpoint, the Iranian attack accomplished little. While it caused some damage to targeted intelligence and military bases, there were few civilian casualties (A Palestinian man in Jericho died in the attacks, and two people were injured in Tel Aviv). More important, it barely put a dent in Israel's military capabilities.

According to Yonatan Touval, a foreign policy analyst at Mitvim, an Israeli think tank, ""Iran might have thought this was a measured strike it could get away with, and that at worst would provoke a symbolic counter-strike. But Israel perceives this differently and will likely launch a major retaliatory strike.""

As a geographically small country, deterrence has long been an essential element of Israel's strategic mindset. It has generally responded with disproportionate military force to acts of war. The response to Iran's missile attack will likely be no different. Touval said, ""Israel cannot let this pass if it is to reestablish deterrence and convey the message that it is not a sitting duck waiting to be hit at will.""

As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday, Oct. 8, ""Iran made a big mistake tonight -- and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and to retaliate against our enemies.""

But there's another consideration for Israel's leaders. For years, Israel has wanted to launch a military strike on Iran to diminish or even out wipe out the country's nuclear program. Successive U.S. administrations have consistently discouraged Israel from doing so. Indeed, the attention devoted to the Iranian nuclear program -- and the signing of the Iran nuclear deal in 2015 by the Obama administration -- was motivated, in large measure, by a desire to avoid a conflict between Israel and Iran that could potentially drag in the United States.

But with last week's strike, Iran handed Israel a casus belli and legal basis for an attack, and the U.S. will be hard-pressed to stop Israel from responding. While it will be difficult for Israel to hit Iran's nuclear targets without direct U.S. involvement, one can imagine significant Israeli attacks on Iran's military and even economic infrastructure in an effort to humiliate the regime in Tehran.

So why did Iran do it?

Iran's decision-making seems to have been influenced not by military considerations but by reputational ones. Nayyera Haq noted last week in an MSNBC column that ""despite new leadership in Iran, there remains the long-standing need to appear strong in the Middle East and also on the world stage.""

To be sure, Iran was in a difficult situation, but it was one it created. For a year, Iran has supported Hezbollah as it, unprovoked, sent thousands of rockets and missiles into Northern Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas. Perhaps Hezbollah and its patrons in Iran believed that Israel would not aggressively respond (yet another deadly miscalculation). But once Israel launched a major military attack, taking out Nasrallah and most of Hezbollah's leadership, and employed an audacious attack in which it blew up pagers that killed and wounded thousands of Hezbollah fighters, Iran's choices went from bad to worse.

""Doing nothing"" in response to the killing of Nasrallah would send a message that Israel could bloody its nose with no repercussions. But ""doing something"" risked unleashing another Israeli military strike. Iran chose the latter course -- and by doing so likely made a huge strategic error. Provoking a much stronger military rival is never a good idea. Iran has now opened the door to a military retaliation that will likely cause significant physical damage and could, ironically, undermine the regime in the eyes of Iranian civilians. What has Iran's expansionist foreign policy, support for terrorist networks and nuclear program brought the country other than economic devastation -- and now likely physical pain?

Iran's leaders likely believed they had no choice but to ""do something,"" but their apparent failure to fully consider how the missile strike would be viewed in Israel -- and the potential ramifications -- has put a target squarely on the country's back.

The same is true of Israel, it must be said. Any military response to last week's attack will need to be calibrated in order to prevent significant escalation. Ever since then-President Donald Trump foolishly pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, there has been no international monitoring of Iran's nuclear program. So it's impossible to know how far along Iran is in producing the fissile material necessary to construct a nuclear weapon. While it's highly unlikely that Iran is close to having a nuke that it can actually deliver, Israel may still want to tread lightly for fear of pushing Iran's leader into a desperate position.

Still, that doesn't mean Israel will sit this one out. Iran has provoked a far stronger military rival that has been itching at the chance to attack them. The consquences will be dire."
Melania Trump speaks out about how autism rumors affected her son: 'Irreparable damage',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/melania-trump-speaks-autism-rumors-affected-son-irreparable-damage,2024-10-08T18:34:07Z,"Former first lady Melania Trump opens up about her life before, during and after the White House in a sit-down interview on 'Fox & Friends.'

Melania Trump is speaking out about previous rumors that her son, Barron Trump, has autism.

In her memoir, ""Melania,"" which was published on Oct. 8, the former first lady writes about her son being bullied after comedian Rosie O'Donnell tweeted about him appearing to have autism.

In the tweet, which was later deleted, O'Donnell wrote, ""Barron Trump autistic? If so, what an amazing opportunity to bring attention to the AUTISM epidemic.""

UNIQUE THERAPY HELPS SOME YOUNG PEOPLE WITH AUTISM INTERACT BETTER WITH OTHERS

O'Donnell also shared a 2016 video of Barron Trump at the Republican National Convention.

In the viral video, which has also since been deleted, the creator had added captions implying that the boy, who was 10 at the time, had autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

""I was appalled by such cruelty,"" Melania Trump writes in the book. ""It was clear to me that she was not interested in raising awareness about autism. I felt that she was attacking my son because she didn't like my husband.""

WORLD AUTISM AWARENESS DAY: HOW YOU CAN SHOW YOUR SUPPORT IN 2024

""There is nothing shameful about autism (though O'Donnell's tweet implied that there was), but Barron is not autistic,"" she added.

""Barron's experience of being bullied both online and in real life following the incident is a clear indication of the irreparable damage caused.""

The former first lady also described the experience as ""devastating.""

""It felt like my heart was breaking into pieces.""

The memoir, ""Melania,"" is published by Skyhorse Publishing and distributed by Simon & Schuster.

Dr. Agnesa Papazyan, aka Dr. Aggie, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles specializing in autism and neurodiversity, spoke with Fox News Digital about the potential harms of someone publicly suggesting that someone has autism.

""Speculating publicly about diagnoses such as ASD also perpetuates harmful stereotypes.""

""Publicly speculating about whether someone has autism based solely on how they act, talk or behave can have negative implications -- not only on the individual, but also the broader autism community,"" she said.

""It makes the individual feel judged, misunderstood, excluded and stigmatized against.""

Even when the speculation is well-intentioned, speculating can frame the person's behaviors or ways of communicating as abnormal or ""weird,"" or as something that needs a label, Dr. Aggie cautioned.

""Speculating publicly about diagnoses such as ASD also perpetuates harmful stereotypes.""

'OUTGROWING' AUTISM? FOR SOME KIDS, THE DISORDER SEEMS TO DISAPPEAR BY AGE 6, 'ENCOURAGING' STUDY FINDS

Given the complexity of the autism spectrum, Dr. Aggie emphasized that diagnoses should only be made by trained professionals -- ""not through social media, by a friend or by strangers on the internet.""

""Making assumptions about others based on surface-level observations can lead to misdiagnosis, which not only impacts the person in question, but can also add to misconceptions about autism itself,"" she noted.

""This can also lead to unfair treatment of the individual and create unnecessary barriers or judgments in their personal and professional life.""

The doctor also emphasized that autism symptoms vary widely from person to person.

""The spectrum nature of autism means that some individuals may be highly verbal and have exceptional cognitive abilities, while others may have significant communication or sensory challenges,"" she said.

""This variation is especially pronounced among children, as developmental milestones can differ widely.""

Nechama Sorscher, PhD, a clinical psychologist in New York City, agreed that these types of claims can be harmful.

""Speculating that someone has autism is similar to insinuating that someone has physical or mental health challenges without clear evidence,"" she said.

Nearly one in every four students reports being bullied, according to Sorscher.

""Being a kid is already difficult enough, but for Barron, he is in the national spotlight and subjected to constant scrutiny,"" she said.

""A rumor like having autism could certainly have created a very difficult environment for him.""

More than 60% of children and young adults with autism experience bullying, Sorscher pointed out.

North Carolina residents will see changes to early voting after Hurricane Helene,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/north-carolina-residents-see-changes-early-voting-after-hurricane-helene,2024-10-08T18:33:53Z,"Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier explains how disaster declarations in counties are causing closures for some boards of elections offices on 'Special Report.'

North Carolina election officials are adjusting their voting rules to ensure residents in areas impacted by the recent hurricane damage can vote early in the upcoming election.

Hurricane Helene made a damaging sweep across the southeast, covering swing states that had already started early voting.

But the storm caused severe damage to several predominantly red counties and early voting centers as focus shifted to disaster relief.

On Monday, the North Carolina Elections Board passed a bipartisan emergency resolution that reformed the state's early voting process in 13 counties. Notably, all except one, Buncombe, voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020.

The adjustments include changing or adding voting sites and maintaining their availability, extending the hours when a voting site is open, and adding or reducing days that any site is open within the early voting period, according to the election board.

Voters in these counties will also have more time to request an absentee ballot, with the deadline being Nov. 4.

RESIDENTS IN KEY NORTH CAROLINA DISTRICT REVEAL HOW THEY THINK THEIR COUNTY WILL VOTE IN NOVEMBER

The state's elections board identified 13 counties in western North Carolina as the most impacted by the hurricane.

The counties that will see the changes applied to their early voting processes include: Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Haywood, Henderson, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Transylvania, Watauga, and Yancey.

Voters in these counties will now have the option of turning in absentee ballots to another county's election board, rather than following previous protocol that mandated they only submit their ballots to their local counties.

Trump narrowly won North Carolina in 2020 by roughly 1.4 percentage points, and early voting has since been made a focus of Republican ground game efforts this cycle, the state's GOP told Fox News Digital in a recent interview.

The former president, however, told Fox News that he believes despite the storm's impact, voters will still turn out for the election.

""I believe they're going to go out and vote if they have to crawl to a voting booth,"" Trump told Fox News' Laura Ingraham in an interview that aired Monday. ""And that's what's happening.""

The former president added that his daughter-in-law, who co-chairs the Republican National Committee (RNC), is working on helping North Carolinians in impacted areas cast their votes.

""Lara is working on it. Other people are working on it, and we're trying to make it convenient for them, but they just lost their house,"" Trump said.

"Georgia football's Colbie Young faces battery, assault on unborn child charges",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/georgia-footballs-colbie-young-faces-battery-assault-unborn-child-charges,2024-10-08T18:33:37Z,"Colbie Young on Tuesday became the latest Georgia football player to face legal issues.

The wide receiver was arrested on misdemeanor charges of battery and assault of an unborn child, per Athens-Clarke County Jail records. Young was booked into the Athens-Clarke County detention center shortly after 4 a.m. ET. His bond was set at $2,500.

One Georgia football program employee and 10 players have been taken into police custody for some sort of driving-related incident within the past 22 months.

Young spent the 2022 and 2023 seasons playing for the Miami Hurricanes, racking up 939 yards over the two years. He also hauled in 10 touchdowns at Miami before deciding to transfer to Georgia in December 2023.

Georgia athletic department spokesperson Steven Drummond declined to offer further comment on the arrest.

""This is a pending legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time,"" Drummond said in a statement to ESPN.

VANDERBILT QUARTERBACK AFTER HUGE ALABAMA UPSET: 'WE WANT A CHANCE AT THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP'

A woman, who was listed in the incident report as Young's ex-girlfriend, informed authorities that she arrived at the football player's apartment around midnight on Oct. 8 to talk about the status of their relationship.

According to the complaint, the 20-year-old woman stated that Young ""grabbed her left arm near her biceps and triceps and physically pulled her out of his room."" She alleged that the wide receiver was ""using derogatory terms and being demeaning of her,"" before claiming he closed and locked the door to his bedroom.

The woman said she was gathering her personal items when a friend called her cellphone. After answering the call, the woman told investigators that, ""Mr. Young came out and grabbed her from behind. She said that he picked her up and began to squeeze her torso and abdomen very hard. She said she felt like [Young] was trying to harm her.""

The woman was taken to a local hospital after an officer noticed some bruising and redness. She ""had a bruise and discoloration on the bottom right side of her chest where it meets the abdomen. She also had redness on her right flank. No injuries were noted on the arm where she said Mr. Young grabbed her,"" the officer reported.

Young pushed back against the accusations that he grabbed the woman, saying he simply walked her to the door when he noticed the discussion became elevated. He also told police that the woman did not receive the injuries ""from him.""

""Colbie Young was arrested last night after he asked his ex-girlfriend to leave his apartment,"" Kim Stephens, an attorney representing Young told ESPN. ""He did not make physical contact with her in any way that could ever be considered a crime. I expect Mr. Young to be fully exonerated once our investigation is complete and the truth revealed.""

Young has 149 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns so far this season.

Wide receiver Rodarius ""Rara"" Thomas, whose transfer to Georgia was announced one year before Young's, was arrested on misdemeanor battery charges in January 2023. Thomas transferred from Mississippi State just one month prior to being taken into police custody.

Thomas accepted a plea deal, but was dismissed from the football program this past offseason after he was arrested on multiple family violence charges in a separate case. He was initially suspended from the football team on an indefinite basis, in accordance with the school's policy after felony charges are filed against an individual.

""He can no longer be part of the football team,"" Georgia football head coach Kirby Smart said in August following his meeting with Thomas upon the receiver's release from jail on bond. ""He understands that. We wish him the best moving forward."""
Walt Disney World Still Open Ahead Of Hurricane Milton -- As Storm Projected To Take $150 Million Toll,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/08/walt-disney-world-still-open-ahead-of-hurricane-milton-as-storm-projected-to-take-150-million-toll/,2024-10-08T18:33:30Z,"Walt Disney World has not yet announced any theme park closures ahead of Hurricane Milton -- even as the storm is projected to tear through Central Florida -- with a Goldman Sachs report released Tuesday projecting Disney is likely to take a nine-figure hit financially from the oncoming storm.

The Orlando area is now under a hurricane warning, with hurricane force winds expected Thursday morning and tropical storm force winds projected to continue through Thursday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service as of 11 a.m. EDT Tuesday. Wind speeds are expected to reach between 74 to 100 miles per hour, in line with a Category 1 or 2 hurricane, with at least six to ten inches of projected rainfall. The National Weather Service urges local residents to ""prepare for considerable wind damage"" and has called the projected wind speeds ""life-threatening,"" also warning of the possibility of tornadoes.

If Goldman Sachs' estimates are accurate, CNBC notes Hurricane Milton would be the costliest Florida storm to Disney since Hurricane Irma in 2017. The company said its parks segment lost $100 million due to that storm, which caused Walt Disney World to close for two days and also canceled multiple sailings on Disney Cruise Line. Walt Disney World has closed at least seven times in the past due to hurricanes, according to USA Today.

Universal Resort Orlando announced Tuesday afternoon it will close at 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday and remain closed Thursday, canceling its popular Halloween Horror Nights events on Wednesday and Thursday. Legoland Florida Resort and SeaWorld Orlando will both be closed on Wednesday and Thursday, and Busch Gardens Tampa is now closed through Thursday. Orlando International Airport will be closed for commercial air travel starting at 8 a.m. on Wednesday, but will remain open to receive any flights containing emergency relief aid."
Moving At The Speed Of Safety --  Gatik Ups The Ante For Driverless Debut,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardbishop1/2024/10/08/moving-at-the-speed-of-safety--gatik-ups-the-ante-for-driverless-debut/,2024-10-08T18:33:16Z,"Gatik AI Inc., the dominant player in autonomous middle mile logistics, unveiled their approach to safety readiness for commercial deployment of their driverless freight services today. Working with external partners, the AV startup has created a comprehensive safety case development and assessment process to ensure that Freight-Only operations (deliveries without a human driver onboard) are safely operating on public roads.

Framing their approach as an industry first, Gatik says this initiative ""underscores Gatik's dedication to setting the highest standards possible for safety in autonomous trucking.""

Gatik stresses that undergoing an independent safety case assessment prior to establishing their Freight-Only network is a critical exercise for an autonomous transportation company to undertake. ""Such an exhaustive process ensures that all key stakeholders, including customers, federal, state and local government, the first responder community and the public have confidence in the independently verified safety of Gatik's technology and deployment practices,"" said the company.

Gatik says it is committed to launching Freight-Only operations at scale across North America once it satisfies the thorough evaluations performed on its autonomous driving system by an independent third party.

""The assessment of our safety case goes beyond a basic review of safety practices and mission statements,"" said Gautam Narang, Gatik's CEO. ""We are assessing our complete autonomous ecosystem to ensure safety in the real world, not just on paper. Our goal is to create safer roads for everyone. We're taking the bold step of mandating an external assessment of our safety case to not only hold ourselves accountable but to help establish a best practice for the entire industry. Now, we encourage our industry peers to adopt this approach.""

""While we applaud the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) leadership in establishing the Voluntary Safety Self-Assessment (VSSA) process, we at Gatik have chosen to go far beyond what a VSSA calls for with this incredibly comprehensive assessment,"" said Dr. Adam Campbell, Gatik's Head of Safety. ""Our Safety Case approach is tangible, comprehensive, and leverages the benefits of Gatik's B2B short haul use-case to safely scale across our freight networks. Arriving at this moment in our safety journey has taken eight years because we move at the speed of safety and learn from our extensive experience in real-world deployments.""

Gatik serves the middle-mile logistics space, providing autonomous transportation-as-a-service and prioritizing safe, consistent deliveries and streamlining freight movement by reducing congestion. The company focuses on short-haul, B2B logistics for Fortune 500 retailers and in 2021 launched the world's first fully driverless commercial transportation service with Walmart. Gatik's Class 3-7 autonomous box trucks are commercially deployed in multiple markets including Texas, Arkansas, and Ontario. Gatik is partnered with industry leaders including Isuzu Motors, Cummins, Ryder and Goodyear. Founded in 2017 by veterans of the autonomous technology industry, the company has offices in Mountain View, Dallas Fort Worth, Arkansas, and Toronto.

Customers Planted The Seed

Gatik's driverless vehicles are designed to operate in semi-urban and highway settings, i.e. everywhere except dense inner-city environments. A typical operation involves carrying goods from a distribution center to regional retail stores to maintain inventory.

Gatik is already running freight for Kroger, Loblaws, Walmart, and others. Their logo's are proudly displayed on these driverless-intent trucks.

In an interview with CEO Narang, I asked what role the customer's voice has played in developing Gatik's ambitious safety certification approach. ""It all started with Loblaws in 2022 when we were making plans to release an early fully-driverless version of the Gatik driver on Toronto's streets. Loblaws called for a third-party assessment prior to starting operations,"" he said. Narang elaborated further, ""Over a three-month period, the external safety evaluators created and executed a framework to assess Gatik's technology by applying existing industry standards from ISO, SAE, NHTSA, NIST, and the UNECE. Suffice it to say we passed the assessment with flying colors, declaring that Gatik's fully driverless technology posed no unreasonable risk to operate on public roads.""

""The Loblaws experience planted the seed for the much more ambitious process announced today,"" he said. ""Work has been underway since that time to develop the safety framework. Customers have been involved in every step of the process.""

You Can't Beat An External Assessment

Central to this effort, Gatik has engaged two companies that, combined, provide the expert resourcing and independence necessary to scale safety.

Edge Case Research, a leading global autonomy risk management provider, has already deployed dedicated resources and personnel to implement its DevSafeOps® process to support system development, testing, and safety engineering. ECR's customers include the Defense autonomy community as well as Automated Driving System (ADS) developers. Chris Urmson, Aurora CEO, sits on their Board of Directors.

""Edge Case Research is proud to partner with Gatik in their pursuit of the highest safety standards in autonomous trucking,"" said Michael Wagner, CEO at Edge Case Research. ""Their commitment to independent safety assessment sets a benchmark for the industry. We hope others in the space will follow suit in this transparent approach and believe it will contribute to building public trust and ensuring the safe integration of autonomous vehicles on our roads.""

ECR is working side-by-side with the Gatik team to define and fulfill the safety requirements. This is an incredibly detailed process involving over 160 parameters. The end game is to fully satisfy safety requirements across all key areas with ""objective evidence"" of safety claims; nothing less is acceptable.

Separately, TÜV SÜD, a globally recognized independent testing, inspection, and certification organization with extensive experience in autonomous system safety assurance, has been engaged to assess the results of the Gatik-ECR safety implementation. Founded in 1866, TÜV SÜD is a longstanding independent testing and certification organization addressing a comprehensive range of safety evaluations, including electromagnetic compatibility, product safety, battery safety, shock and vibration, and medical devices for industries including rail, medical tech, telecom, automotive, aerospace, defense, and even gnarly rides at theme parks.

""TÜV SÜD has developed its reputation of providing credible and independent safety assessment expertise for over two decades with more than 300 experts across the globe. Our collective experience has been brought to bear in developing comprehensive autonomous vehicle safety assessment programs. As Gatik embarks on its expansive safety journey, we are excited to provide assessment services as they prepare for scaled Freight-Only deployments,"" said Dr. Fabian Schober, CEO of TÜV SÜD America.

Release of the driverless tech on public roads doesn't happen until Gatik's results have been reviewed and approved by TÜV SÜD. Who knows what gremlins will crop up? And how much time will it take to address them? The process will iterate until Gatik has fully satisfied the requirements of its safety case assessment, which will provide the green light to deploy safe Freight-Only operations in public traffic.

Unlike previous process-heavy safety industry approaches, Gatik's approach is to go beyond process analytics to then create data which is vetted by an expert third party.

What Is UL 4600 And Why Does It Matter?

The Gatik / ECR / TÜV SÜD approach centers on a unique autonomous driving safety standard denoted as UL 4600. This standard, developed and published by Underwriter Laboratories, ""seeks to specifically address the ability of autonomous products to perform safely and as intended -- without human intervention -- based on their current state and sensing of the operating environment. Reliability of hardware and software necessary for machine learning, sensing of operating environment, and other safety aspects of autonomy are also addressed,"" according to the UL website. Across the road autonomy space, UL 4600 is viewed as the only comprehensive system safety standard for SAE Level 4 vehicles. However, the principles and processes detailed by UL 4600 must be implemented carefully and in a highly detailed manner.

Safety Portfolios - Lots Of Them

Gatik's assessment will encompass over 700 identified safety portfolios and must be completed and closed before Gatik can achieve Freight-Only operations at scale.

It will address key pillars of AV safety: organizational safety culture, engineering quality (functional, behavioral and operational safety of the self-driving system), cybersecurity, vehicle safety, and Safety Case conformity to UL 4600.

The Gatik Safety Case focuses on three pillars: the Autonomy Readiness Measure represents the degree to which autonomy software is ready for and validated for the Operational Design Domain; the Platform Readiness Measure addresses capabilities of the hardened vehicle platform including redundancies and hardware reliability; the Operational Readiness Measure (which includes a Site Readiness Measure and a Network Readiness Measure) represents comprehensive operational safety and preparedness for freight-only deployment.

This is serious safety geek territory.

Gatik's comprehensive Safety Case process intends to allow traceability and transparency to all claims of safety that are made. By using Edge Case's Open Autonomy Safety Case Framework as a starting point, Gatik is working to conform with the UL 4600 standard. They emphasize that including all facets of the technology (i.e. operational and organizational) in the safety case points to the breadth and depth of safety efforts being undertaken that go well beyond any requirement imposed by regulations.

Perspective

As part of the company's commitment to transparency across all aspects of its approach to safety, Gatik's announcement notes that the company will be publicly sharing information on progress made towards completion of the safety case program prior to deployment of Freight-Only operations.

Across the AV space, dialogue and analysis in recent years has focused on showing that a driverless vehicle is ""better than a human driver."" Yet Mr. Narang and his team are adamant that this is just the bottom rung of the ladder and much more rigorous analyses must be done. He encourages his industry peers to take a similar approach as their UL 4600 implementation which is assessed by outside safety experts.

Gatik's safety process is one of - if not the - industry's most rigorous and comprehensive safety assessments ever conducted by independent parties. It is reasonable to assume that the process, in some form, can be applied across robotaxis, long-haul trucking, and any other public road use case, not just their middle-mile operations.

The question must be asked, how can a third-party independent assessment not be part of the final decision to launch a driverless vehicle?

Clearly, Gatik and their partners feel that their safety validation process should be adopted broadly across the AV space. Nothing of its sort has been announced by any other ADS developer.

But that doesn't mean it hasn't been implemented by others. While no other ADS developer has publicly discussed a such a process, this - or a similar approach - could be happening behind the scenes elsewhere.

For instance, Aurora leverages an approach which they contend ensures the rules of the road are followed by the Aurora Driver. Sterling Anderson, Aurora's Chief Product Officer who helped launch Tesla Autopilot in 2015, notes that Aurora's Verifiable AI has built-in checks and balances that they say is superior to black-box AI (as touted by Tesla and others). ""We understand why our system reacts the way it does - and when it doesn't, we have a path to figure it out. We believe Verifiable AI is the only way to build a safety case around AVs, which we've been saying since 2018,"" he said.

For Gatik's part, upon completion of its safety process, the company ""will be entirely certified and independently verified that its fully driver-out autonomous freight delivery fleet operates in compliance with respected industry safety standards.""

No doubt there have been customers for Gatik (and for other ADS developers) who might have been skittish about fielding autonomy even though they were attracted to the operational gains it could provide. One can imagine that a new wave of customers will come knocking once Gatik's externally-validated safety certification has cleared the way for scaled-up driverless operations. And as others in the industry take similar steps, we'll see an uptick in adoption of autonomy for freight operations across the board.

According to a McKinsey analysis of future freight transportation published last month, the United States will have the fastest AV adoption rate globally, with autonomous heavy-duty trucks accounting for 13 percent of trucks on the road in 2035. Gatik's light-duty vehicles could be considered within this prediction as well.

By self-mandating an external assessment as exhaustive as described in today's announcement, Gatik hopes to set a new standard for the entire AV industry to follow. Other approaches exist as noted above. There could certainly be several legitimate approaches to safety validation.

However it goes, some consistency in safety verification methods for self-certification of commercial driverless vehicles across the industry would provide even more momentum to the transition to autonomy for road freight. Importantly, this could also give impetus to regulators in the U.S. to publish an AV Safety Framework, creating some regulatory ""solid ground"" which so far has been sorely lacking in the U.S."
Inside A Loft In One Of The Best Examples Of Cast-Iron Architecture In New York City,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/yjeanmundelsalle/2024/10/08/inside-a-loft-in-one-of-the-best-examples-of-cast-iron-architecture-in-new-york-city/,2024-10-08T18:28:00Z,"Timothy Godbold's design of an apartment for a family of four in the Cast Iron House in Tribeca mixes industrial charm with modern elegance.

Australian-English interior designer Timothy Godbold's design of a four-bedroom loft in the Cast Iron House on Franklin Street renovated by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban masterfully blends industrial heritage with modern luxury. Drawing inspiration from the Tribeca building's iconic cast iron facade, Godbold infuses the 4,250-sqft, dual-level loft with a sophisticated yet understated esthetic, using a palette of neutral tones and rich textures to create a warm, inviting space. His design embraces the loft's expansive, open layout, allowing natural light to flood the interiors and highlighting its soaring ceilings. A curated mix of contemporary furnishings and vintage accents adds depth and character, while sleek finishes and artful detailing evoke a sense of refined elegance, making the loft both functional and timeless. The reflective gold surfaces of the closets in the walk-in dressing area are a nod to the glamor of 1970's cult cinema - a recurrent Godbold influence - while geometric forms are repeated throughout the loft, echoing Art Deco motifs, but also a futuristic ambiance coupled with elements of Italian Modernism.

What was the most important consideration when you first started designing the loft, and the overarching main idea you tried to achieve?

The overarching main idea was to create a functional space for a young family that also likes to entertain, while maintaining the unique and irreplaceable character that an ex-industrial space like this presents.

Who are the homeowners, what are their professions and how many children do they have?

The homeowners are a young family working in finance. They have two children; one who was born in the middle of bringing this project to fruition.

Describe to me your creative process from the time the homeowners commissioned you to the final design. How did they come to work with you? What did you ask them before you started the design process, how did you help them discover their own personal design esthetic and how did you work together?

This family was a referral from a friend of theirs who follows me on Instagram and also mentioned as a topper that I have beautiful cats. They came to work with me with the knowledge that I like a fair amount of creative independence and integrity when bringing my creative practice to life. They had a base idea of their own personal design esthetic. However, working with me I think clients open themselves up to a project that is fluid and alive, and that often brings about results that surprises them, and that even surprises me. That is the beauty of a creative practice that is allowed room to breathe and suggest. We present everything in 3-D models so they get an instant visual reference of my sometimes wild ideas.

What were the inspirations behind your creative process?

The main inspirations for this project were a 1970's sci-fi series that imagines a futuristic environment within a space that is informed by Italian industrialism and its foremost designers, such as Joe Colombo. With this, I of course married the industrialism of the architectural space, as well as some Art Deco elements and a series of geometric shapes to create and add texture.

What is the building's history?

The original all cast-iron textile factory, constructed in 1881, holds historical significance in SoHo. The preservation efforts of groups like the Friends of Cast Iron Architecture, led by Margot Gayle, successfully led to the designation of a large part of SoHo as a historic district in 1973 and as a national historic landmark in 1978. SoHo boasts the largest collection of full and partial cast-iron buildings globally, amounting to approximately 250 existing examples. These cast-iron buildings were pioneering in their influence on skyscraper development, introducing innovations like curtain wall construction, standardized prefabricated building elements and repeating bays. One notable innovation within a cast-iron building was the installation of the world's first public passenger elevator by Elisha Otis at the E.V. Haughwout Department Store in SoHo.

Tell me about the original architecture of the building and the unique architectural features, as well as the remodeling undertaken by Shigeru Ban. How did you take into account the architecture and character of the building when doing the interior design?

Shigeru Ban created a very clean, chic canvas that was ideal to be able to create a custom interior without demolishing the whole apartment. I think my work complemented his esthetic. One example of these apartments that always gives me a headache are the structural columns. Nonetheless, in creating a living space that is comfortable, a column creates spatial disruption. To solve this, I made a custom dining table floated directly off the column that references an industrial-style table from the 1930s by Hans and Wassili Luckhardt and Alfons Anker. In this way, I added in new design elements that perfectly riffed off the architectural industrial elements and paid homage to their character.

From where did you source the furniture and which brands' or designers' furniture did you use and why?

Most of the elements in the space are custom made. For example, a series of stucco and marble walls in the double-height living room I created, as well as most of the furniture throughout the home, including the stone furniture in the living room upholstered with custom Brutalist fabric made in England, and most of the rugs, including a special rug designed to outline the furniture in the same space.

Did the homeowners have any unusual requests that you accepted, or did you have to bring them round to your way of thinking if their request didn't reflect their lifestyle and personality?

They definitely came round to my way of thinking when they saw that the results were aligned with what they wanted. I have a clear design vision that comes to the forefront no matter the creative project I work on; it is my visual identity even if many projects ultimately become singular in their own way. Their knowledge and understanding of this process gave them trust."

Compensation Rates Chart for Temporary Full or Partial Disability Benefits Permanent Disability Benefits What To Do After a Work Injury FAQ About Workers' Comp in South Carolina

Show more

In South Carolina, employees who get hurt on the job must make a workers' compensation claim. They cannot sue their employer under personal injury laws. However, they can get benefits regardless of whether their employer did anything wrong -- as long as they can prove they developed a work-related injury or illness.

Workers should be entitled to payment of medical bills and temporary or permanent disability benefits if they suffer a workplace injury that impairs their ability to work. However, not every employee understands the details of the state's workers' compensation laws.

The South Carolina workers' compensation charts below provide insight into the benefits available and the ways that injured workers can recover compensation after a work injury. It's important to be aware, though, that each individual settlement is based on factors specific to the situation. Those include the nature and extent of injuries and the strength of the claim.

Compensation Rates Chart for Temporary Full or Partial Disability Benefits

In South Carolina, when your injury causes you to miss work for seven or more days, you are entitled to temporary disability benefits equal to two thirds of your weekly salary. However, there is a maximum weekly benefit you are allowed to receive, regardless of how much you earn. This maximum changes over time.

The chart below shows the maximum weekly benefits workers could receive from South Carolina workers' comp for the past 10 years. It can help you to understand what income you're likely to get if you miss out on earning a paycheck due to your work-related injuries.

You may receive less than this amount if two thirds of your average weekly wage equals less than the maximum.

Partial Temporary Disability Benefits in South Carolina

If you are only partly disabled by your work injury and your work abilities are limited, you may receive temporary partial disability benefits. These benefits are equal to two thirds of the difference between your preinjury wages and what you can earn with your injuries. You are still subject to the maximum benefits listed in the table above.

How Long Can You Receive Temporary Disability Benefits?

Most injured workers are limited to receiving no more than 500 weeks of temporary total disability benefits under South Carolina Code section 42-9-10.

This 500-week limit applies unless you are ""totally and permanently disabled"" as a result of a compensable injury that has caused you ""physical brain damage"" or that has left you a paraplegic or quadriplegic. In these circumstances, you can receive benefits for life.

Eligibility for partial temporary disability benefits is also subject to maximum time limits. You are allowed to receive temporary partial disability benefits only for a maximum of 340 weeks under South Carolina Code section 42-9-20.

Permanent Disability Benefits

If you have reached maximum medical improvement and are permanently disabled, you are allowed to receive permanent total or partial disability benefits depending on the severity of your impairments.

In certain cases, you are entitled to permanent total disability benefits when your injury has caused significant damage.

You are presumed to be totally and permanently disabled if you lose:

both hands, arms, shoulders, feet or hips 50% of the use of your back vision in both eyes

Once a disability is deemed total and permanent, you can receive permanent disability benefits. However, you are still subject to a 500-week cap on benefits. This is a combined cap with temporary disability benefits. If you already received temporary benefits, those weeks count against you.

As mentioned above, if you are a paraplegic or quadriplegic or have physical brain damage, you can receive lifetime benefits for total disability.

Permanent Partial Disability Benefits

If you are partly disabled and have reached maximum medical improvement, you can receive partial disability benefits for a set number of weeks at the same rate as your temporary partial disability benefits. There is a limit to the number of weeks these benefits can continue based on your percentage of impairment.

If you have certain specific injuries, this is considered a scheduled loss and the law specifies the number of weeks benefits will be available. The South Carolina workers' compensation chart below shows some examples of how many weeks of benefits you are entitled to, based on scheduled losses.

What To Do After a Work Injury

If you have suffered a work injury in South Carolina, there are a few key steps you should take.

Report Your Injury

If you are hurt at work in South Carolina, you should report your injury as soon as possible. You have 90 days from the time of the incident to make a report to your employer or you risk being denied benefits.

The sooner you report the injury, the better. A long delay can raise questions about whether your injury is really work-related or whether you're exaggerating the extent of your damages.

Receive Medical Care

You should get prompt medical attention when you suffer an injury at work.

Your employer has the right to select your doctor when you are making a workers' compensation claim. However, you can choose any approved doctor if your employer offers multiple options. You may also be able to request a second opinion or a switch to a different doctor if you are dissatisfied with the care you are receiving.

Getting prompt medical attention can help you to minimize the damage resulting from your injuries. It can also make it easier to prove that you really suffered the damage you're claiming, since your doctor will keep medical records.

Document Your Impairments

If you want to maximize your workers' compensation benefits, it'll be up to you to prove how severely you're disabled and show how your disability impacts your ability to work. As a result, it's important to ensure your injuries are documented.

You should report all symptoms and medical issues to your doctor so those details become part of your medical records. You may also wish to consider keeping a pain journal. You can use this to show how your injuries affect your quality of life and your ability to perform routine daily tasks.

Get Legal Help

Workers' compensation claims can be complicated, especially as employers and insurers often have incentive to try to deny legitimate claims or to pay as little as possible.

You should make sure you have a trusted advocate on your side to help you through the process of navigating your workers' comp claim and protecting your legal rights.

Your workers' compensation attorney can assist with issues that may arise such as questions about how severely your injuries have impacted you. If you want to settle your workers' comp claim, your lawyer can also work to negotiate a fair offer from the insurer and can assist you in understanding what your case is worth so you don't accept less money than you should.

If you still have questions about South Carolina workers' compensation laws, check out some answers to FAQs below.

FAQ About Workers' Comp in South Carolina

How is a workers' comp settlement calculated in South Carolina?

A number of factors go into calculating workers' comp settlements. Your settlement should be enough to cover your medical bills and loss of wages. It should also compensate you for the specific injuries you have endured as a result of your injuries on the job if you are temporarily or permanently disabled. You can agree to settle a workers' comp claim if you and your employer's insurer can agree on an appropriate amount of compensation.

Which body part has the highest value in a workers' compensation claim?

If you are a paraplegic or quadriplegic or suffer physical brain damage as a result of a work injury, you will get the highest value of benefits in a South Carolina workers' comp claim. You are entitled to lifetime benefits under these circumstances.

Does workers' comp pay for pain and suffering in South Carolina?

Workers' compensation does not pay for pain and suffering in South Carolina. You are entitled to receive compensation for your medical care costs as well as for total or partial permanent disability or temporary disability. The more severe your injuries, the longer the period of time you are entitled to receive benefits.

Should you hire a South Carolina workers' compensation lawyer?

It's a good idea to get legal help from a local attorney if you have suffered a work injury. For example, if you live in Charlotte, North Carolina, the best Charlotte work injury lawyers can provide you with invaluable advice in pursuing a claim for compensation.

Your attorney can help you to understand what your case is worth and make sure you get the money you deserve.

Tua Tagovailoa will consult experts during bye week as Dolphins aim QB to return,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tua-tagovailoa-will-consult-experts-during-bye-week-dolphins-aim-qb-return,2024-10-08T18:22:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Mike McDaniel is still not getting caught up in timelines when it comes to the status of Tua Tagovailoa, but the Dolphins coach gave an update on Miami's No. 1 quarterback as the team heads into its bye week.

""There's some expert consultation that he has scheduled for this week,"" McDaniel said Monday, ""and then we'll address -- the final stages of protocol won't be achieved until we bring him back off IR (injured reserve).""

Tagovailoa was placed on injured reserve on Sept. 17 after suffering his third diagnosed concussion in two years during a Week 2 game against Buffalo.

McDaniel said Tagovailoa will need to practice first before clearing concussion protocol. When asked if the team has been advised to hold Tagovailoa out longer even after he's been cleared to return, McDaniel said he has received ""nothing negative"" from experts.

""But we're still in the process,"" McDaniel added. ""We don't rush that process, and we don't try to do anything that negatively impacts that.""

For now, the Dolphins are sticking with Tyler ""Snoop"" Huntley as their starter.

Huntley looked much more comfortable in his second start for Miami, completing 18 of 31 passes for 194 yards on Sunday in a 15-10 victory over New England.

It was far from the Dolphins' best football, McDaniel and players noted, but it was a win that Huntley said ""everybody in the locker room needed"" after a three-game losing streak.

""We just had to overcome our mistakes,"" Huntley said, ""and we knew once we overcame them, we were going to do good things. We just have to hone in on the details, and it will be better.""

Huntley threw an interception that led to the Patriots' only touchdown of the game. Miami botched three special teams plays. A mistimed snap by center Aaron Brewer went over Huntley's head for a 20-yard loss that stifled another scoring opportunity.

Despite the overall sloppiness of the offense, McDaniel doesn't want to continue shuffling quarterbacks. Skylar Thompson, who won the backup job in the preseason, started in Week 3 but hurt his ribs and hasn't played since.

Huntley is Miami's fourth quarterback to take snaps this season, but he has impressed McDaniel with his command of the offense.

""As it stands right now, I feel happy with the way Snoop went from managing the offense, so to speak, his first outing,"" McDaniel said, ""to executing the offense (on Sunday). And that's to his credit, so I feel pretty good about how fast he's developed. ... The operation was better but not as good as it could be, and you hope that with continuity, there's improvement in that.""

The Dolphins will try to get healthier during their bye week. Tagovailoa is eligible to be activated from injured reserve after Miami's Week 7 trip to Indianapolis.

Texans star receiver Nico Collins is 'week to week' with hamstring injury,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/texans-star-receiver-nico-collins-week-week-hamstring-injury,2024-10-08T18:22:47Z,"Texans star receiver Nico Collins is 'week to week' with hamstring injury

The Houston Texans improved to 4-1 with a thrilling victory over Buffalo on Sunday for their best start since opening the 2012 season with five straight wins. But the win came with a cost as Nico Collins, who leads the NFL with 567 yards receiving, injured his hamstring and will likely be out this week.

Collins left the 23-20 victory Sunday after scoring on a 67-yard reception late in the first quarter.

Coach DeMeco Ryans didn't answer directly when asked if he would play on Sunday, but his answer made it sound as if Houston could be without him for a while.

""He's in good spirits (but) of course, with the hamstring, it takes a couple of weeks for a hamstring,"" Ryans said Monday. ""So we'll evaluate that on a week-to-week basis to see when we can get him back.""

If he's unable to play Sunday, it will put even more stress on an offense that is already without running back Joe Mixon. He had 159 yards rushing in the team's opener but was injured in Week 2 and hasn't played since. Ryans said he's improving but was unsure when he'd be back.

The Texans built a 20-3 lead against the Bills but struggled offensively for most of the second half with Collins out.

Quarterback C.J. Stroud threw an interception and had his first fumble this season on a sack in the fourth quarter to allow the Bills to tie it, before Ka'imi Fairbairn's 59-yard field goal won it on the final play.

""The first half went really well. We were moving the ball like we wanted, running the ball,"" Stroud said. ""In the second half ... we were just shooting ourselves in the foot again, just taking penalties. I missed a couple of reads on my throws and had the two turnovers. When you play like that, you give them opportunities to come back.""

Stefon Diggs led the Texans with six receptions for 82 yards Sunday and Stroud complimented his play and the contributions of the rest of the team's receivers. But he admitted that losing Collins really changed things.

""I think he is the best receiver in football,"" Stroud said. ""When he gets out of the game, it definitely is tough on us. A lot of things are predicated toward him and planned for him.""

Ryans agreed and said it will take a team effort to make up for the loss if Collins can't play.

""Nobody has to go out and be Nico,"" Ryans said. ""There's one Nico, he's done a great job of that and now whoever is next when your number is called, make the plays that you're supposed to make.""

The Texans must wait to see if Collins has recovered before they travel to New England on Sunday for the first of consecutive road games. If he can't go, Diggs and Tank Dell will need to do more against the Patriots to pick up the slack.

Alive on paper but dead in reality--why fewer people may be reaching advanced age,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5133252/alive-on-paper-but-dead-in-reality-why-fewer-people-may-be-reaching-advanced-age,2024-10-08T18:22:03Z,"In some areas of the world, people may not be living quite as long as researchers once thought, according to new research. JohnFScott/Getty Images/E+ hide caption

There are places in the world that are vaunted for having an outsized number of long-lived individuals. A lot of attention has been paid to puzzling out how all these people have reached such an advanced age.

A new pre-print study that has yet to be formally peer reviewed proposed these places may have surfaced, at least in part, as a result of clerical error or fraud.

Here's the crux of the problem: to tell how old someone is, people rely on documents. ""There's no way to validate a human age against a physical measure,"" says Saul Justin Newman, a research fellow at Oxford University.

""If you go into a hospital without paperwork, there's no machine in there that says, 'Oh, bing!' and knows your age,"" he says. ""So if you get consistently wrong errors in your paperwork, they're undetectable.""

When Newman examined U.N. data from 236 states and nations, he found errors connected to centenarians -- people ages 100 and above -- all over the world. Certain countries had more detailed accounting than others.

""The best predictor of where 100-year-olds are within Okinawa [Japan] is places that have had their cities bombed by the Americans, burning the birth records,"" he says. ""So the more bombing you have, the more 100 year-olds you have.""

There are other examples. ""Forty-two percent of centenarians in Costa Rica turned out to be lying in the census,"" Newman says. ""At least 72 percent of the centenarians in Greece disappeared when they did an audit.""

On paper, some of these folks were alive. ""But dead in reality,"" Newman says. ""You know, I had a lady reach 103 in a freezer.""

Some of these errors may not actually be errors. Newman says to picture yourself jobless and broke.

""And then your father dies or your mother dies at the age of 95,"" he says ""Their pension check turns up the week after they're dead. All you have to do for that pension check to keep turning up in perpetuity is not register the death. Very easy thing to get away with.""

Newman says this is the reality that he's surfaced. The places on the planet that seem to have residents reaching super advanced age are rife with pension fraud, which obscures how old they were whenever they did pass away.

Not knowing how long people actually live has all sorts of ramifications. ""We're all the time using these old age data to estimate how many old people we're going to have to take care of,"" Newman says, ""and project how many hospitals we need in the future.""

""It really is an important study because it pushes the field to scrutinize the data more rigorously,"" says Raya Kheirbek, who wasn't involved in the research. She's chief of geriatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. ""But the conclusions may overstate the extent of errors.""

While this work doesn't necessarily contradict thinking on longevity, she's concerned it could add complexity to an already nuanced field and that it may cast doubt on what she says is legitimate research, including a set of U.S. studies showing what people who do reach 100 have in common -- that they age more slowly, as do their kids.

""This robust data does not depend on birth certificates from areas of unreliable records,"" she says, ""highlighting the significant role of genetic and environmental factors in longevity."" Kherirbek says these factors might include exercise, social engagement, mental resilience, and diet -- ""moderation in all areas.""

Kheirbek says there are other explanations for age inflation, like the inevitable loss of documents. Take Spain, for instance.

""During the civil war,"" she says, ""many birth records were kept in government agencies and churches and they were all destroyed. So that is a complicating factor in age verifications.""

Newman agrees. He says these errors, and bad record keeping arise for all sorts of reasons, from war to fraud to bureaucracy.

He uses this analogy: ""Imagine you had the Hubble space telescope,"" he says, ""and a percent of the stars turn out to be dust on the lens.""

Newman says his hope is simply to wipe down that lens."

Smith was set to release a debut album in 2025 with the record label Bella Union.

Simon Raymonde, the label's owner, also shared a touching tribute to the late singer on social media.

""She had so much more to experience and to give this world but we are grateful that she got to experience so very much in her 17 years.""

-- Nell Smith's family

""We are all shocked and devastated to hear of the sudden and tragic passing of our artist and dear friend Nell Smith, over the weekend in British Columbia,"" Raymonde wrote on behalf of the label.

The statement continued, ""Nell was just 17 and was preparing for the release of her first solo record in early 2025 on Bella Union, made in Brighton with Penelope Isles' Jack and Lily Wolter. Her first release was an album of covers of Nick Cave songs recorded with fellow Bella Union artistes The Flaming Lips back in 2021 entitled, 'Where The Viaduct Looms.'""

""While we all try and come to terms with the awful news, and out of respect to Nell's grieving family, we are unable to make any further comments at this time. The Bella Union Family.""

Smith's connection with The Flaming Lips began in 2018 when she was just 12. She attended one of the band's shows in a parrot costume, which was spotted by Coyne, according to Billboard.

That led to an ongoing friendship between Smith, her family, and Coyne, who encouraged her to learn guitar.

The COVID-19 pandemic derailed plans to record together, but Coyne suggested Smith record covers of Nick Cave's work, leading to their 2021 album, ""Where the Viaduct Looms,"" featuring Smith singing backed by The Flaming Lips.

Coyne told the outlet at the time, ""It is always great to meet excited, young creative people. With Nell, we could see she is on a journey and thought it would be fun to join her for a while and see if we could get things going."""

Walgreens Is The Latest Employer To Embrace Student Loan Benefits,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2024/10/08/walgreens-is-the-latest-employer-to-embrace-student-loan-benefits/,2024-10-08T18:18:19Z,"Plus, another 'September surge' in the job market, managers are willing to pay higher starting salaries for in-office personnel and how Marianne Markowitz climbed the financial corporate ladder.

Did you know that employers can match your student loan payments with contributions into your 401(k)? Thanks to Secure Act 2.0, which took effect January 1, employers can now offer extra retirement savings to young workers making student loan payments, even if the employee is not contributing to their retirement account on their own.

On Thursday, Walgreens became the latest large employer to embrace this benefit, offering it to the company's more than 300,000 employees. This means that Walgreens will match up to 4% of eligible pay for workers who are paying down student loans, even if they have not contributed directly to their 401(k) themselves.

Employees who've worked at Walgreens for one year and have completed 1,000 hours of work are eligible.

The program has been lauded as a win for young workers who have to choose between saving for retirement or paying off debt. At Walgreens, roughly 30% of the company's employees are facing financial debt from higher education, according to the company, including more than half of its pharmacists. On average, pharmacists have $170,000 of student debt, according to the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, making it one of the professions with the highest debt.

While other major employers--including Verizon, Kevin Hart-owned Hart House, Chipotle and Abbott Laboratories (a medical devices and healthcare company)--are offering the same benefit, its adoption has been slow, according to Bloomberg. The hesitance is largely due to employer's compliance and logistics concerns in its implementation, even after the IRS issued additional guidance in August.

As the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness plan moves through the courts, student loan 401(k) matching could be a major help to the 42.8 million Americans paying off student loan debt. But the key question remains: Just how many employers will implement it?

In other news, another hurricane is scheduled to make landfall in the south this week. To all of those in the path of Hurricane Milton, please listen to local officials and I hope you stay safe.

Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week!

Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter

A career financial expert, Marianne Markowitz is the founding CEO of First Women's Bank, a Chicago-based bank focused on serving women. Fresh off the heels of announcing the launch of the FWB Collective, a resource hub for women to launch their own businesses, I spoke with the First Women's Bank CEO to speak about her career in finance and focus on banking for women, working with small businesses, and what she learned working in both the private and public sectors. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Before starting First Women's Bank, you had some impressive stints as a risk and treasury manager in the private sector before heading up the Small Business Association. What did you find was the biggest pain point in the transition from private to public employers?

You know, it's interesting because I expected there to be more pain points than I actually experienced. Up until that point, the Small Business Administration (SBA) was the smallest organization I'd ever worked for--even Barack Obama's presidential campaign was larger. So as a federal agency, you were able to actually shape that agency, which was really interesting as an entrepreneurial-focused group. So I didn't experience that many pain points. Now, if I'd joined a much larger agency that would have been different! But the SBA is a unique agency in how it mirrors the private sector more because most of its partners are in the private sector, and works with over 4,000 banks.

Oh interesting! What's your advice to someone who may be considering a similar move, jumping into working with federal or government agencies?

There's a lot of doors into the public sector, so it's likely there is one that fits most people's backgrounds. I would say if you're inclined to serve at all, then it's a fit for you. It's all about service, and it's an amazing way to build a career. It's hard to explain, and you can't understand the scale of your impact when you're in the public sector (almost like you can't explain what it's like having a baby until you do!). You get to touch and impact so many lives with the work you do, it's an amazing place to build a future.

Between starting First Women's Bank and working in banking, you've had the experience of both being a founder but also climbing the corporate ladder. What is one thing you learned during that time that really helped you reach the C-Suite both as a CFO at the Obama presidential campaign and now as the founding CEO?

The next step is not only the one that is right above you. Sometimes I think we only see our careers linearly. But often moving side to side and gaining other experience will prepare you to move up, and it may not be the immediate channel that you see right ahead of you.

The other thing is sometimes, our work doesn't give us the opportunity or positions that we're ready for. Sometimes, it doesn't give us the opportunity to lead, or that's not part of your particular job at the time. So look outside your day job and find opportunities. We don't make the time to do that early enough in our career. Go find a nonprofit, get on a board, because when I look at a résumé I look at all of that. Where is the leadership in this résumé? It may not be in your position, but it happened because you did something that was really important to your job that aligned with your values outside of work.

Also, show up to the employee resource groups!

That's a good point -- leadership doesn't have to be in your job description to become a leader. What is one unique thing you look for in not only new hires, but women who come to the bank looking for funding or loans?

As women, we can often have disruptions in our career. We've got live events that we're balancing with that, and those disruptions can make for zig-zags in our résumés. That's something we really understand at First Women's Bank, and we give a lot of credit to the portability of experience and how we underwrite someone's ability to lead a business. It's something we really acknowledge, even if their career doesn't play out in a linear fashion. That's one way we really acknowledge and show up for women.

Trump Media executives were able to sell their shares in the company beginning on Sept. 19, when the lockup period -- a standard procedure for public companies aimed at preventing certain shareholders from selling shares for a period of time -- ended. But when the lockup period ended, Trump dispelled concerns that he would divest, which could drive down the company's share price, saying ""I'm not selling, I love it."" Shares are up almost 80% from their low in September. The company is still far below its peak of over $66 a share after it went public on March 26 by combining with blank-check firm Digital World Acquisition Corp. Trump Media has reported strikingly low revenue, but it has often been considered a highly volatile ""meme stock,"" or a stock that became popular through social media and has price changes in response to non-earnings developments, like the assassination attempts on Trump or his performance in presidential debates.

Last week, Trump Media revealed in a regulatory filing its chief operating officer, Andrew Northwall, resigned in late September. The company did not say why Northwall left but said it would be transitioning his duties internally. Northwall said in a post on Truth Social he was grateful to Trump and ""being part of TMTG has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career."" The same day his departure was announced, ProPublica reported the company was forcing out executives amid internal allegations of mismanagement."
The Numbers Behind Netflix Canceling 'Kaos' After Just One Season,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2024/10/08/the-numbers-behind-netflix-canceling-kaos-after-just-one-season/,2024-10-08T18:17:54Z,"Kaos may have an adoring legion of fans, but it wasn't enough to save the dark comedy series from cancelation. After just one season, the show, which premiered on Aug. 29, 2024, has already met its end, despite spending multiple weeks in several Top 10 rankings in several countries.

The show's ambitious attempt to retell Greek mythology in a modern-day setting won many people over and received great reviews, but in the end (as I'll soon detail), the viewership numbers weren't there to guarantee a second and third season like the show's creator, Charlie Covell, intended.

The series starred Jeff Goldblum as a paranoid, insecure Zeus, who stands at the center of a power struggle between the gods and humanity -- an effort spearheaded by Prometheus and a group of humans including Eurydice, Ariadne, and Caeneus. Despite its dynamite cast that included the likes of Janet McTeer, Cliff Curtis, David Thewlis and Aurora Perrineau, the show failed to secure a second season, leaving fans disappointed.

The cancelation was first revealed in a now-deleted Instagram post by Perrineau, who played Eurydice, confirming the show's fate to her followers. You can read the full post over on What's On Netflix, but here's a small selection:

""For one of the first times in my life, I have found myself really proud. I'm, of course, proud of everyone's work and the care they gave to this project, because, let me tell you, they left everything on the floor. But I've also found myself proud of me, and that is something I've struggled with. When I got cast, I couldn't believe that someone SAW me. A girl who's not only a minority but also a survivor of SA -- and you're telling me that someone thinks I could be one of the leads of a show, have agency, my own mission, and be desirable enough to be the love interest to not only one amazing human but two? I was worthy of that? Everything that happened from that point forward really changed my perspective.""

When someone in the comments section of her post asked if the show was canceled, Perrineau signaled that it was. Then, earlier this morning, Variety confirmed the show's cancelation.

Kaos was initially envisioned as a three-season arc by Covell, who explained in an interview that the first season's finale set up several potential storylines for future installments, including the weakening of Zeus's power and the rise of Prometheus as a new leader. Covell expressed optimism that the first season, despite not ending on a cliffhanger, would leave enough room for progression as the show would continue to develop its characters and story.

As is always the case with these cult-obsessed shows, the continuation of Kaos relied upon its viewership numbers (What's On Netflix goes into great detail about this, by the way). While Kaos' first four weeks on the global Top 10 charts was promising, its performance was ultimately inconsistent and didn't display the sustained growth Netflix expects from its multiple-season shows.

In its debut week, Kaos ranked #3 on Netflix's English-language TV chart, accruing 22.8 million hours viewed, which translated to about 3.4 million views. The second week was best for the show, with it pulling in 39;.2 million hours viewed, aka 5.9 million views -- a 72% increase from the previous week.

From there, however, it was a slow and inevitable decline, with the numbers dropping by 43% in the third week to 22.4 million hours viewed (3.4 million views), then decreasing further in the fourth and final week with 14.5 million hours viewed (2.2 million views). Kaos accumulated approximately 98.9 million hours viewed, or 14.9 million total views.

While a steady decline is expected of most shows, this sort of drop-off lined up with other recent shows that got canceled by Netflix. The streaming service's renewal decisions are primarily based on viewership in those first 28 days. Shows need to not only bring in a large audience, but they must also retain that audience to grow. And, per the drop in the show's second week, Kaos failed to achieve this. After its second week peak, the drop in viewership suggested that engagement was quickly waning.

Additionally, Netflix reclassified ""Kaos Season 1"" to just ""Kaos,"" signaling a shift its status to a limited series. In the past, this has typically indicated (as we saw in this case) that Netflix no longer views the show as a long-term investment."
Better. A Better Life. A Better World. A Single Word That Makes Things Better.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/esri/2024/10/08/better-a-better-life-a-better-world-a-single-word-that-makes-things-better/,2024-10-08T18:17:45Z,"As a 23-year-old graduate student, I worked in a place that shaped the rest of my life. It was Harvard's Lab for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis. It was 1968. The desktop computer wouldn't be introduced for nine years. Across all of Harvard, there was just one computer shared by the entire university.

The Lab was a special place. It was the brainchild of Howard Fisher, an architect who sensed the magic of combining computers and geography -- to draw a new kind of map.

Extraordinary amid the tumult of the late 1960s, the Lab was a gathering place for computer scientists and mathematicians, geographers and social scientists, urban planners and designers -- working together.

I was there day and night, learning how to turn all kinds of data -- from geographic features to traffic flow to pollution data -- into information that a computer could put on a map.

It was exciting. It was fun. We were on the verge of the digital revolution. We were helping spark that revolution right there in the Lab.

It was there that Fisher taught me the way to push forward was not to worry about making things the best. The software didn't have to be perfect. The graphics didn't have to be perfect. The printed maps didn't have to be perfect.

They just had to be better. They had to be better than what anyone could do at that point, and better than we had done last week or last month.

The opportunity to use these new mapping tools, to understand them, to see their limits and their gaps, and then to make them better in the next round -- that created the motivation. It created the gravitational force that pulled us along.

Yes, the early software was complex. And the early maps were monochrome, made on dot-matrix printers.

But the ideas were modern. We understood the possibilities of what maps could do. It was nearly limitless. Maps could show us the world in all new ways. Maps could tell stories.

Just as important, Howard Fisher had freed us from the trap of making it perfect to start. Instead, we needed to make it better with each iteration.

The way to transform maps, the way to create the golden era of what we now call ""geographic information systems"" (GIS), was what better could get us.

More than five decades after my work in the Harvard Lab, we have done more than make maps better. We have figured out how maps can make the world better.

We now have leaders in business and government infusing GIS technology into everything, all levels of analysis and operations and decision-making -- to make it better.

We can now make maps that help us solve almost every problem.

These are maps that guide emergency responders and aid organizations in staging supplies and evacuating neighborhoods. They simulate ripple effects of supply chain shifts. They show businesses like Amazon where to locate a warehouse to use less energy or Chik Fil A where to open a drive-thru to reach more customers. During the pandemic, these maps gave real-time updates of global infection rates.

The port of Rotterdam runs on high-precision mapping called a ""digital twin."" So does the San Francisco International Airport.

As climate change puts land and people at risk, companies as diverse as Walmart and AT&T have used sophisticated GIS mapping to literally predict the future: Both have mapped their critical facilities, then layered on detailed climate models that predict flooding, extreme heat, and wildfires. They can see which facilities are most at risk 5 years from now, or 20 years from now, and protect those facilities today.

It's the possibilities we dreamed of, working in the Harvard Lab. And it's even beyond the vision that inspired us in 1968.

There's another great example in this system called the Data in Emergencies center, or DIEM. It's a GIS mapping and analysis tool the United Nations uses to address food emergencies.

DIEM can spot the potential for a mass food crisis, or even starvation. Analysts gather data on every country, on the ground and from satellites. They look at farming, livestock, rainfall, drought, transportation, and conflict to quickly dispatch food aid where it's needed most.

For the 27 countries most at risk, or already in food crisis, the monitoring and response moves in near real-time. When the Kakhovka Reservoir in Ukraine was destroyed in June 2023, it unleashed a cascade of water 18 feet high that flooded an area four times the size of Washington, DC. It left 1.4 million acres of productive farmland without irrigation -- washing the topsoil, and the people, from that land. This sent a food crisis across Ukraine and the entire region, raising crop prices around the world.

It was the kind of event the DIEM was designed to help manage. And DIEM is possible because of sophisticated GIS mapping technology.

Digital maps are driving another vital trend: Transparency. So much important information is now publicly available, with GIS as a huge driver of public data and open-source analysis. All this widely available data allows us to get better at mapping, so we can understand what's happening now and see solutions for the future.

When you see the problems so clearly, they become impossible to ignore. That's the opportunity, the imperative, that better creates.

Better is what we all want. For ourselves, for our organizations, for our communities.

That notion of being better gives us a sense of possibility, of optimism.

We all can get better -- as people, as a society. We can understand the world as it is now, see into the future so we know what the world is becoming, and then we can adapt -- better.

We need to adapt in the smallest ways. And we need to adapt in the most sweeping ways. Maps help us do this.

We can adapt to new circumstances, make progress, and create a better world. In fact, I believe, we can map for ourselves a better future."
Crypto.com Signals Texas As Emerging Powerhouse Beyond Bitcoin Mining,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/beccabratcher/2024/10/08/cryptocom-signals-texas-as-emerging-powerhouse-beyond-bitcoin-mining/,2024-10-08T18:17:43Z,"Texas strengthens its industry dominance as Crypto.com establishes its new North American headquarters and continues its unparalleled bitcoin mining power.

Texas is quickly emerging as a global hub for cryptocurrency, solidifying its position with the recent move of Crypto.com's North American headquarters to the Lone Star State. As one of the largest crypto exchanges makes its shift, Texas maintains dominance in its bitcoin mining hash rate, further cementing its role in the digital currency landscape.

Crypto.com's president of North America, Jim Grabow, said, ""We have decided to set up a North America HQ office outside the greater Dallas area.""

The momentum drawing the cryptocurrency industry to Texas extends well beyond major exchanges. The state now boasts the highest global bitcoin mining hashrate, with companies like Riot Platforms, with a mining site in Rockdale, TX, playing a significant role.

Local leaders, including Rockdale's interim mayor, Ward Roddam, are optimistic, calling it a ""digital energy boom"" poised to benefit rural communities like his own. With growing public support, 76% of Texans believing in crypto's potential to create new economic opportunities, according to Coinbase, the next frontier is regulatory clarity.

On October 8th, 2024, Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The suit claims the SEC is overstepping its legal boundaries by treating most crypto transactions as securities, except for Bitcoin and Ether. Crypto.com is also seeking clarity on regulating crypto derivatives by petitioning the SEC and CFTC to confirm how these products should be regulated.

All eyes are on Texas' upcoming 89th legislative session in January 2025 to see how the state will navigate its rising prominence in the crypto world.

As Texas rapidly positions itself as a global leader in cryptocurrency, the recent relocation of Crypto.com's North American headquarters marks a pivotal moment. This move, alongside the state's surging bitcoin mining hash rate, showcases Texas' growing influence in the digital currency ecosystem.

Bitcoin miners have found a stronghold in the Lone Star State, benefiting from its favorable energy landscape and political climate.

Local officials are openly embracing this shift. Rockdale, Texas, once a coal-dependent community, now symbolizes how cryptocurrency can create new economic opportunities for regions previously left behind by industrial decline.

However, the road ahead is contingent on regulatory clarity. The upcoming 89th legislative session will be critical in determining how Texas navigates its expanding role in the crypto space. Policy decisions will likely influence whether the state can fully capitalize on its growing status as a crypto powerhouse."
ABC's Kimmel fails to disclose fundraising for Harris campaign during friendly Walz interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/abcs-kimmel-fails-disclose-fundraising-harris-campaign-friendly-walz-interview,2024-10-08T18:17:38Z,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz shared a laugh with host Jimmy Kimmel after the Democratic vice presidential nominee made a comical gaffe during his first appearance on late-night TV.

ABC late night host Jimmy Kimmel interviewed Democratic vice-presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., Monday night without disclosing that he has both endorsed and led fundraising for the Harris campaign.

The ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" host hosted a celebrity-studded fundraiser in June that raised tens of millions of dollars for the then-Biden-Harris campaign and lent his name to a Harris campaign fundraising email last month, in which he endorsed Harris for president and trashed former President Trump.

Viewers would have missed those details in his interview with Walz, where they talked about the Harris campaign's vision for America, softened the vice-presidential candidate's recent gaffes with jokes and slammed the Trump campaign.

The anti-Trump late night host made no mention that he is backing the Harris-Walz campaign while giving Walz a late night network platform to speak to voters.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

During the interview, Kimmel called Walz a ""really nice man"" that the country needs, and referred to him as ""America's sweetheart.""

In turn, Walz told Kimmel about his campaign's positive vision for the country, noting that they will ""turn the page"" on the Trump era.

""For me, and being an eternal optimist, I always say that. I supervised a high school lunchroom - you're an optimist or you're dead,"" he said, adding, ""This idea that look, we get to turn the page on that, and I plan on waking up on November 6 with Madam President.""

Kimmel poked fun at Walz's last line, stating, ""I want to be clear, you won't be waking up together."" ""No,"" Walz replied laughing, as the host shot back, ""Unless you guys have gotten closer than we thought.""

""I have a problem about not being specific with my language. So thank you for that, specifically right,"" Walz responded, referencing the fact that he has been criticized for inaccurate claims about his career which he has chalked up to having ""misspoke.""

That Kimmel conducted a softball interview with Walz is no surprise considering how much the comedian has supported the Democratic presidential ticket.

JIMMY KIMMEL SAYS BIDEN'S TRUMP JOKE WAS CLEVER 'FOR A GUY WHO CAN'T PUT TWO SENTENCES TOGETHER'

In a joint September email from Kimmel and the Harris campaign that Fox News Digital recently obtained, the host stated, ""Sorry to break your cold little heart, Donald, but I endorse Kamala Harris for president. I've had the privilege of interviewing our Vice President several times. She is a kind, brilliant and delightful person who cares very much about our country.""

The email provided links for recipients to send money to the Harris-Walz campaign, and added another message from Kimmel. ""I want my four children to know I was on the right side of history (which is the left side). We need to protect our kids from the self-serving trolls who pretend to be fighting for 'freedom.' I believe in truth, justice and all the stuff we learned from Superman. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are our best hope in this battle for sanity.""

Kimmel also hosted a June fundraiser for the Biden-Harris campaign that featured celebrity guests George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and others, along with former President Barack Obama and raked in over $30 million for the Democratic ticket.

Kimmel's network, ABC, has also been scrutinized for its connections to the Harris-Walz campaign, as Dana Walden, a senior Disney executive whose portfolio includes ABC News, is one of Vice President Kamala Harris' ""extraordinary friends,"" according to a report in the New York Times. Walden and Harris have known each other since 1994, while their husbands, Matt Walden and Doug Emhoff, have known each other since the 1980s.

The executive has donated to dozens of Democrats and contributed to Harris' political campaigns since at least 2003, when she ran for district attorney in San Francisco. She went on to donate to her subsequent campaigns for California Attorney General and U.S. Senate, as well as her 2020 White House bid. Harris even credited the Waldens for her marriage at a fundraiser in April 2022, which was held at their home in Los Angeles.

Ali Velshi: Trump's Project 2025 would unleash an imperial presidency,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-project-2025-power-presidency-supreme-court-rcna174366,2024-10-08T18:10:54Z,"Republicans are trying to create a federal government that answers only to the president and a president who answers to no one.

In July 2019, then-President Donald Trump offered his take on the constitutional limits of the presidency, telling a crowd of teenagers and young adults at the Turning Point USA Teen Student Action Summit in Washington that the Constitution gives him the right to do ""whatever I want as president.""

Five years later, in July, the Supreme Court handed down its ruling on Trump v. United States and sided with Trump, declaring that presidents were immune from criminal prosecution for ""official acts,"" a term the court chose not to define.

Trump and the court's conservative majority were in lockstep with each other but out of step with two centuries of constitutional precedent. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, ""The relationship between the President and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably. In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law.""

And according to Project 2025, the conservative playbook for a second Trump presidency, the president should be a king, with every lever of government serving him alone. The blueprint vows to slash the federal workforce and replace what's left of it with Trump loyalists. That's because all sorts of policy laid out in this handbook would be impossible to implement without loyalty to a president and an administration -- not to the Constitution -- across the government, especially because some of its plans are so radical that pesky things like, say, expertise would simply get in the way.

Page 21 of Project 2025 states, ""The next Administration must not cede such authority to non-partisan 'experts.'"" It proposes achieving that goal by removing protections for thousands of career civil servants, often experts in their fields, and replacing them with politically loyal appointees who answer only to the president.

So picture, hypothetically speaking, a scientist who studies the effects of chemicals in our water being replaced with someone who has no scientific background but a solid track record of supporting Trump's ideas.

Across the 900-plus pages of Project 2025, this strategy is spoken in code. On page 552, for example, it suggests, ""The Director of the FBI must remain politically accountable to the President.""

""Politically accountable"" is code for obedient. That's what they want -- an FBI that works at the whims of the president, arresting his political opponents, journalists, prosecutors, critics and even judges who don't do their bidding.

Remember, one of Trump's first big scandals as president was firing FBI Director James Comey for not publicly saying Trump wasn't under investigation in the Russia probe. That's according to the Mueller report.

""Political appointees,"" Project 2025 code for ""our guys,"" are to replace civil servants at every level possible. This would leave Trump unchecked if he is enabled to go after his perceived enemies, which he has promised to do time and again on the campaign trail. In total, ""political appointees,"" aka Trump's would-be goons, are mentioned in the massive book 99 times.

In the chapter on Homeland Security, on page 136, Project 2025 suggests that when a leadership role is vacated and the next person in line is a career civil servant, that person should be passed up for a political appointee.

On page 45, discussing the kind of person who should run the Office of Budget & Management, Project 2025 writes, ""No Director should be chosen ... who is not aggressive in wielding the tool on behalf of the President's agenda, or who is unable to defend the power against attacks from Congress.""

""Attacks from Congress"" should be the telltale sign here that no one involved in Project 2025 has any interest in a government of checks and balances. Congress is a co-equal branch of government, according to our Constitution. But according to Project 2025, Congress should bug off, too.

In the chapter on the State Department, it's put more bluntly. Page 173 states, ""The main suggestion here is that as many political appointees as possible should be in place at the start of a new Administration.""

Transforming our federal government from groups of qualified experts to unblinking yes-men would mean serious breakdowns in our government's ability to serve. For example, when Americans need crucial aid from federal agencies, the difference between civil servants and political appointees shows:

Just days ago, a former policy director on the National Security Council during the Trump presidency alleged that Trump initially refused to approve disaster aid for California during its deadly 2018 wildfires. The official told Politico's E&E News, ""We went as far as looking up how many votes he got in those impacted areas ... to show him these are people who voted for you."" Trump wound up reversing his decision.

In the playbook's forward, Project 2025 makes four promises for the next conservative presidency, the second being, ""Dismantle the administrative state and return self-governance to the American people."" So the architects of Project 2025 must have been overjoyed when the Supreme Court assisted them in this effort, too, by overturning the 40-year precedent of the Chevron doctrine, which allowed federal agencies broad ability to interpret and enforce regulations.

With the administrative state weaker than it's been in four decades, the time is ripe for the broad structural changes Project 2025 seeks. In concert with the Supreme Court's summer decisions, Project 2025 could create a federal government that answers only to the president and a president who answers to no one."

Hurricane Milton has left West Coast Floridians scrambling as some residents have already evacuated.

On Monday, Hurricane Milton strengthened from a Category 1 hurricane to a Category 5 hurricane with winds predicted to reach 180 mph, FOX Weather reported.

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) warns that Milton poses an ""extremely serious threat"" to Florida with life-threatening impacts.

AS HURRICANE MILTON THREATENS FLORIDA, FOOD AND DRINK ESSENTIALS FOR HUNKERING DOWN DURING THE STORM

""It's worth emphasizing that this is a very serious situation, and residents in Florida should closely follow orders from their local emergency management officials,"" the NHC advised on Tuesday.

Residents can check their evacuation status and flood zone risks on county websites, official social media accounts and FloridaDisaster.org's ""Know Your Zone"" map, which is run by the Florida Division of Emergency Management.

Hurricane and disaster preparation experts recommend having basic emergency supplies and ""go-bags"" ready before severe weather or natural hazard arrives.

While residents in hurricane zones may have prepared emergency supplies that'll last if they're sheltering at home, here's a list of items that should be stashed away in go-bags if an evacuation has been ordered for a hurricane or another catastrophic disaster.

The U.S. Department of State recommends packing five item categories in a go-bag: money, medical items, personal belongings, documentation and optional weather gear.

- Multiple currencies if evacuating from a foreign port

- Safe deposit keys

- Government travel card if applicable to eligible government workers

- Glasses and contact lenses (with carrying case and cleaning solution)

MILTON COULD BECOME AMONG MOST DESTRUCTIVE HURRICANES FOR WEST-CENTRAL FLORIDA, INCLUDING TAMPA, NHC WARNS

- Passport(s) and visas if evacuating from a foreign port

- Marriage, birth, adoption and naturalization certificates

- State Department ID (applicable to government workers only)

- Driver's license and/or state ID

- Auto insurance policies, registrations and title if applicable

In flood-prone areas, evacuees might want to consider:

With hurricane evacuations being time-sensitive, some might opt to purchase go-bags or additional items for their already-packed go-bags as they make their way to safer zones where evacuations haven't been mandated.

Supplies may be limited at most retail locations, but there are a number of disaster survival brands that could be in stock at discount department stores, wholesale clubs and sporting goods shops.

Pre-packaged go-bags with multi-day emergency supplies are made by Ready America, which can be found at select Walmart stores; Life Gear, which can be found at select Costco stores; and Wise Company, which can be found at select Bass Pro Shops.

The problem(s) with the probes into the Trump rally shooting,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-probes-trump-rally-shooting-rcna174529,2024-10-08T18:10:45Z,"The official congressional investigation into the Trump rally shooting is struggling, but the unofficial congressional investigation is vastly worse.

Nearly three months after being targeted by a would-be assassin, Donald Trump returned to Butler, Pa., over the weekend for a follow-up campaign rally. The event also served as a reminder that members of Congress are investigating the incident from July, hoping to come to terms with how the former president was nearly killed.

How's that process going? Not especially well.

There is, of course, an official congressional task force, with bipartisan membership, though House GOP leaders stacked the panel with some very conservative conspiracy theorists. It was against this backdrop that the task force invited two other House Republican conspiracy theorists to testify as witnesses during an official hearing, prompting a Democratic boycott.

But if the official congressional investigation is struggling, the unofficial congressional investigation is vastly worse.

As we discussed in late August, two GOP members -- Arizona's Eli Crane and Florida's Cory Mills -- announced that they were overseeing a ""parallel investigation"" because they ""don't trust the federal government to actually do the job necessary.""

Crane added in an interview around the same time that he was concerned that government officials might've been involved in the shooting -- a radical idea that even other Republicans have avoided.

But as The New York Times reported, the Arizonan is determined to pursue his rather off-the-wall theories -- for which there is no evidence -- including bizarre claims that there might be a secret mole within Trump's Secret Service detail; the FBI might hide the truth; the would-be assassin might've had confederates; and the second would-be assassin might've been an ""asset"" of a foreign adversary who was being ""handled.""

Literally everything we know about the incidents suggest Crane's theories are baseless. He doesn't appear to care.

At this point, some might be inclined to shrug. An odd congressman is wasting time pursuing odd ideas, which has a familiar ring to it. But consider this tidbit from the Times' report:

And therein lies the rub: Key House GOP officials aren't embarrassed by Crane and his weird conspiracy theories, they're encouraging Crane and his bizarre pursuits.

Indeed, when Democrats recently boycotted a task force hearing, it was in large part because the official investigation panel agreed to give Crane a platform.

I won't pretend to know what will become of the investigation, House Republicans aren't exactly inspiring confidence."
Jets security had to escort Robert Saleh out of team building after firing: reports,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jets-security-had-escort-robert-saleh-out-team-building-after-firing-reports,2024-10-08T18:10:15Z,"NFL insider Jordan Schultz stops by The Facility to dive into the latest on Robert Saleh's firing, including why New York Jets Owner Woody Johnson solely made the decision and what is next for the Jets and Aaron Rodgers.

Robert Saleh was reportedly escorted out of the New York Jets' team facility after he was fired as head coach on Tuesday, according to multiple reports.

The most recent head coach to be fired by the Jets, Adam Gase, was fired after the conclusion of his second season and was reportedly not removed by security.

The Jets have not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.

The team's owner, Woody Johnson, released a statement shortly after the firing was announced, in which he said defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich will serve as the interim head coach for the remainder of the season.

""This morning, I informed Robert Saleh that he will no longer serve as the Head Coach of the Jets. I thanked him for his hard work these past three-and-a-half years and wished him and his family well moving forward,"" Johnson said.

""This was not an easy decision, but we are not where we should be given our expectations, and I believe now is the best time for us to move in a different direction. Jeff Ulbrich will serve as our Interim Head Coach for the remainder of the season. He is a tough coach who has the respect of the coaches and players on this team.

""I believe he along with the coaches on this staff can get the most of our talented team and attain the goals we established this offseason.""

SAINTS' KHALEN SAUNDERS, BROTHER OF TAYLOR SWIFT BACKUP DANCER, RECORDS 1ST CAREER INTERCEPTION VS CHIEFS

Saleh is now planning to go on vacation with his family before preparing to interview for defensive coordinator jobs during the next hiring cycle, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

Saleh's dismissal came more than a day after the Jets lost to the undefeated Minnesota Vikings in London. The offense has sputtered through the first games with a presumably healthy Aaron Rodgers under center for the team.

New York is 25th in points scored and 27th in yards gained while having a top five defense.

Rodgers has performed like a 40-year-old quarterback who is coming off of an Achilles tear. He has 1,093 passing yards, seven touchdown passes and four interceptions.

Saleh was hired to be the Jets head coach in 2021 after four successful seasons as the San Francisco 49ers' defensive coordinator. But Saleh was 20-36 with New York and never won more than seven games a year while at the helm.

His tenure was plagued by inconsistent quarterback play after the team's third-round draft pick in 2021, quarterback Zach Wilson, played poorly and was benched multiple times across his first three seasons and Rodgers was injured in the first game of last season."
New poll reveals which voter group are fueling Trump to a narrow edge over Harris in battleground,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-poll-which-voter-group-fueling-trump-narrow-edge-over-harris-battleground,2024-10-08T18:07:48Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former President Donald Trump holds a razor-thin two-point edge over Vice President Kamala Harris in battleground Arizona, according to a new public opinion poll.

Fueling the former president's margin appears to be support from voters age 50 and over.

Trump stands at 49% among likely voters in Arizona, with Harris at 47%, according to an AARP poll conducted Sept. 24-Oct. 1 and released on Tuesday. According to the survey, Green Party candidate Jill Stein grabs 1% support, with 3% undecided.

The survey points to a generational divide.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

""Among voters 50+, Trump is ahead by 7 points, driven by a 14-point lead among voters 50-64,"" the poll's release highlights.

Harris holds a 4-point advantage among voters under 50, according to the survey, ""while the race is a tossup with seniors.""

The poll also points to a gender gap in Arizona which favors Trump.

The former president and Republican nominee is up 11-points over the vice president and Democratic nominee among men, but down only 6 points among female voters, the survey indicates.

The survey is the latest to indicate a margin of error race between Harris and Trump in Arizona, a state President Biden narrowly carried over Trump in the 2020 election.

Arizona's one of seven crucial battlegrounds whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's White House victory four years ago and are likely to determine if Harris or Trump win the 2024 election.

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP IS WINNING KEY VOTERS IN TWO CRUCIAL SOUTHWEST BATTLEGROUNDS

The survey was released on the eve of the kick-off of early in-person voting in Arizona.

The major party vice presidential nominees - Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota - each hold campaign events in Arizona on Wednesday. Harris returns to the state on Friday.

Besides being a crucial presidential swing state, Arizona is also holding one of a handful of competitive Senate elections that will decide if the GOP wins back the chamber's majority.

The AARP poll indicates Democratic Senate nominee Rep. Rueben Gallego holding a 51%-44% lead over Republican nominee Kari Lake, a former news anchor who narrowly lost the state's 2022 gubernatorial election.

The AARP poll was conducted by the bipartisan polling team of Fabrizio Ward (Republican) & Impact Research (Democrat). The firms interviewed 1,358 likely voters in Arizona. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points."
'League Of Legends' 14.20 Patch Notes Bring Teemo ASU And Free Skins,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/10/08/league-of-legends-1420-patch-notes-bring-teemo-asu-and-free-skins/,2024-10-08T18:05:35Z,"Riot Games has released the patch notes for League of Legends update 14.20, and they bring with them the Teemo ASU update and the start of the 15th anniversary celebrations that offer up a free skin just for playing some games.

We'll get to the free stuff first, as I'm sure that's what everyone cares about. The 14.20 patch notes kick off the Player Days celebration, which is basically a big party for the 15th anniversary of League of Legends. There's more coming around the internet in the next few weeks, but the main part is a set of 10 rewards you can unlock just by playing.

Starting from the launch of patch 14.20 and running until October 28, there will be an in game event that will reward you with freebies providing you play at least one game. The full list of 10 rewards is below, and providing you play on 10 different days during the event, you'll get all the rewards. There's some fun freebies up for grabs, but the highlight is a free skin in the form of the Ann-Sivir-sary Skin. It's difficult to complain about a free skin, so I won't!

The other big talking point from the patch notes is the Teemo ASU update, that brings a new animation rig, animations, SFX, VO, and VFX to the most annoying champ in the game. Some of his skins are also getting updates and have been un-vaulted, so be sure to pick them up while you can. Then, there's his brand new theme song that will play when you enter the Rift as Teemo (please don't enter any of my games as Teemo).

As usual with LoL patch notes, there are a ton of champion balance changes and as I'm pushed for time today I've only looked at the champs I play. The bad news for me is the Jhin and Singed get nerfs in this patch, but they have been pretty strong for the last two weeks, so it's not the end of the world. You'll have to check out the full patch notes if you want to see all the changes.

After the changes in the last major patch, there are also a lot of balance tweaks to items, with both nerfs and buffs depending on how they have been used in the weeks since. Hopefully these should add a little variety to item choices going forward, which is never a bad thing."
Matt Barnes And Stephen Jackson Talk Success Of 'All The Smoke' Podcast And Their Long-Term Career Objective,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/djsiddiqi/2024/10/08/matt-barnes-and-stephen-jackson-talk-success-of-all-the-smoke-podcast-and-their-long-term-career-objective/,2024-10-08T18:05:22Z,"Former NBA stars Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson have made quite the impact in the podcasting space.

While athlete podcasts are all the rage these days, with Travis and Jason Kelce recently inking a $100 million deal for their podcast, New Heights, that wasn't always the case just a few years ago when Barnes and Jackson started All The Smoke in October of 2019.

Although Barnes and Jackson never had aspirations or defined objectives of becoming notable figures in the media space once their playing career ended, that's exactly what happened. The two former NBA stars have a strong social media audience for their podcast, with two million followers combined across YouTube and Instagram. They recently hosted presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, for an episode and notably featured the late great Kobe Bryant in his last interview before his passing.

The 44-year-old Barnes -- who leads a lot of the business operations behind the scenes of All The Smoke -- explains how the podcast came together.

""At the time, I didn't really know what a podcast was,"" Barnes explains in a one-on-one interview. ""Stak (Jackson) and I we were both working for ESPN and FOX back and forth between those networks and we received a lot of positive feedback. We met up at my place in the Bay Area watching the game one day and I was just like, 'Hey, let's do a podcast.' He was like, 'What's a podcast? I told him, 'I don't really know, but I think it's more lax and you might be able to have a drink.' He kind of started laughing and said, ""Hey I'm in.'

Barnes then details that he met Showtime Sports digital programming executive Brian Dailey through Aaron Newman, who produced the ""The Resurgence: DeMarcus Cousins"" documentary. From there, the deal quickly came together with Showtime Sports.

""It sounds crazy how easily it came together when I really didn't know what I was doing,"" says Barnes. ""But that's how it came together. They took a big chance on us and we were able to create something special. Our first season we got 'Sports Podcast of the Year,' put our foot down in the sports podcast space and it's almost like we're the OG's of the game now. Because at the time, it was Knuckleheads -- featuring former NBA stars Darius Miles and Quentin Richardson -- and there was really no other sports podcasts. Now, everywhere you turn, there's a new sports podcast coming out. I love the growth of the space.""

Barnes once again hammers home that he and Stak really didn't know what they were doing when the started the podcast on Oct. 8, 2019.

""When we started out, we really didn't know what we were doing or what it was and we were just free-styling,"" says Barnes.

Jackson himself admits that he didn't see the podcast developing into the well-oiled machine that it is today.

""No, not at all,"" Jackson says when asked if he envisioned becoming a podcasting gaints. ""There's a lot of things in your life you never predicted. Even the George Floyd stuff, I never predicted to be in that space. I knew that I had a hunger to do something on television after basketball, whether it was sports or acting, whether it was anything.

""But the opportunity came -- Rachel Nichols gave me the opportunity -- to work with her on the show on ESPN and it just spearheaded from there. We came up with the idea -- All The Smoke -- we didn't know it was going to blow up the way that it did. But we met all of the right people that helped us bring this together and it's just been growing.""

To commemorate the five-year anniversary of the podcast, Barnes and Jackson are releasing a book titled exactly how their podcast is framed, All The Smoke from Simon & Schuster on Tuesday, Oct. 8. The book features quotes from notable athletes and celebrities who have appeared on the podcast such as Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal, Kevin Garnett, The Game and Ice Cube.

The two are currently on a book tour which will feature an interactive fan experience with a live taping of All The Smoke in cities such as New York and Philadelphia (Oct. 9). They previously held a live taping in Chicago back in June.

The pair have been close friends since they teamed up to lead the ""We Believe"" 2006-2007 Golden State Warriors squad. That team is best known for upsetting the No. 1-seeded Dallas Mavericks, becoming just the third No. 8 seed in NBA history to beat a No. 1 seed. Barnes signed with the Warriors just prior to the start of the season while Jackson was traded to the team from the Indiana Pacers in the middle of the year.

""I knew him from competing against him, but I didn't really know him,"" says Barnes. ""I wouldn't even call him a friend at that point, it was just he was in the league, I was in the league. As soon as he got to the team, he and I hit it off instantly. We both like to partake in cannabis, that was kind of the common ground outside of basketball, we just started hanging out and getting to know each other better.""

Barnes explains how the passing of his mother at the start of the 2007-08 season is when the two really became ""brothers.""

""From teammates to friends to brothers and I think really when our friendship became brothers was after that season, my mom died at the very beginning of the next season,"" says Barnes. ""Even though the organization was great, Stak went out of his way daily to text me, call me, come by the house, watch TV with me, bring me food, come smoke with me and just kind of be that shoulder for me as I was trying to grieve through the loss of my mom. Obviously my mom and his mom connected -- they were really close. So it was almost like a real family affair and that's when we went from teammates to brothers.""

Jackson agrees with Barnes' sentiment that their ""brotherhood"" grew following the untimely passing of Barnes' mother.

""When I got there (to Golden State), I was a guy that was looking to re-brand myself,"" explains Jackson following his trade to the Warriors in 2007. ""But I wasn't looking to change. And Matt was the guy who accepted me for who I was. Our mothers clicked immediately, I think that made our brotherhood grow and then his mother passed so quick. I was there for him the whole time and I made it a point to be there for him.

""That's how our relationship built. I think a lot of times when you have relationships built off real-life issues, they're more genuine than if you just have a relationship playing basketball together. That was a tough experience for him and I was glad I was able to be there for him and I think our relationship has been solid ever since -- regardless of it was doing a podcast or anything. We have a brotherhood beyond any show or any type of business, we just love each other that type of way.""

While the All The Smoke podcast is a success in itself, the popularity of the podcast has led to creation of the All The Smoke Productions. The production company was founded in January of 2024 by Barnes and Dailey after the closure of Showtime Sports last December. The production company features a number of podcasts and partnerships under its umbrella, including The 25/10 Show featuring former NFL stars LeSean McCoy and DeSean Jackson, All The Smoke Fight -- a division dedicated to the fight game -- and a partnership with The LeBatard Show featuring veteran radio show host and TV personality Dan LeBatard.

It's all a part of the process of transforming the brand from a podcast entity into a full-fledged media production company.

""It's going to be a slow burn, but we want to be a full-fledged production/media company,"" explains Barnes. ""We're also on the political side, we do some political content, we're in talks for the golf space, I'm bringing in more talent for people in the MMA space, we sold our first show to Amazon, we're picking up two amazing documentaries that I don't really want to speak on right now, because I don't want to jinx it, but they're going to be really big and I'm excited about them.

The goal was obviously to get off the ground with what we knew, which was building podcasts and the ecosystem we've created, but our goal is to be a full-fledged company, production house, studio and media company.""

Jackson wants to continue to grow the All The Smoke Fight division as one of his long-term objectives while making their production company the ""Black Barstool Sports.""

""Long-term goals, big plans in the fight space,"" says Jackson. ""Just trying to take the blueprint that Showtime made and try to build on that and make it bigger and better. With All The Smoke and our production company, we want to be the Black Barstool Sports. We want to be able to do things like that -- build our brand.

""We have a lot of different angles. Brian Dailey is adding something new to our production company by the minute. We're just growing, we just want to be the best in every aspect of our production company. I think we're heading to that, because we all have a certain respect for each other, and when it's family like that, things can't help but work.""

While All The Smoke Productions continues to do that and expand with its talent and production roster, one thing that is undeniable is that the media space is transforming. Prior to recent years, it was the media -- mostly writers and TV personalities who had no experience playing pro sports -- that dictated the narrative and the perception of athletes.

That is now no longer the case, as Barnes points out -- which is part of the reason he entered the media world, particularly the podcasting space.

""Media wasn't in the plans in my day from '02 to '17, there was kind of a weird relationship with media and players and the narrative always being spun,"" explains Barnes. ""I wasn't really a fan, I had some people that I liked and respected in the space, but the overall sports media, I wasn't a fan. I've seen what they've done to me and my teammates over the years. How stories were told and how they were written or told on these platforms.

""I was kind of against the whole thing. but a friend of mine told me, 'If you don't like it, why don't you help change it? Get into it.'"" I don't feel like you need those machines (ESPN, FOX, etc.) anymore to get your point across, to go viral, or to really freely speak your mind."""

Taylor Swift Becomes World's Richest Female Musician: Here's Who Is Right Behind Her,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/08/taylor-swift-becomes-worlds-richest-female-musician-heres-who-is-right-behind-her/,2024-10-08T18:05:15Z,"Taylor Swift leapfrogged singer and beauty mogul Rihanna to become the world's richest female musician following the blockbuster success of her Eras Tour, as other female artists, including Madonna and Beyoncé, rank just outside the billion-dollar club.

Swift, 34, became the first musician to become a billionaire solely based on the value of songs and performances in 2023. Forbes estimates her music catalog is worth $600 million, and her tours and royalties have pocketed her another $600 million. She also owns an estimated $125 million in real estate. Her jump to billionaire status was driven largely by her ongoing Eras Tour, which began in March 2023 and is set to conclude in December. Last year, Forbes estimated the first leg of the Eras Tour alone earned her $190 million. The Eras Tour became the first ever concert tour to surpass $1 billion in total gross, Pollstar reported in December.

Rihanna, 36, became a billionaire in 2021, Forbes estimated, largely because of the value of her stake in Fenty Beauty, the cosmetics company she launched in 2017. She owns a 50% stake in the company, as well as an estimated 28% stake in lingerie brand Savage X Fenty. Both companies are named after the singer, whose real name is Robyn Fenty. She launched her latest beauty line, Fenty Hair, in June. Forbes ranked Rihanna as the 74th most powerful woman in the world in 2023. The rest of her wealth comes from her music catalog -- she has 14 Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits, the third-most of any artist, only behind The Beatles and Mariah Carey. She performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2023, a brief break from her years-long hiatus from her music career. She hasn't released an album since her 2016 album ""Anti.""

Jay-Z is the richest musician on the Forbes billionaire list, with an estimated net worth of $2.5 billion. He's the first rapper to make the ranks. His wealth largely comes from his liquor business: He sold a 50% stake in his champagne brand, Armand de Brignac, to French luxury goods company LVMH in 2021 for at least $300 million, and a majority stake in his D'Usse cognac brand to Bacardi for $750 million in 2023. Forbes ranked Jay-Z as the fifth-richest celebrity in the world in April. Forbes reported Bruce Springsteen became a billionaire in June, with an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion. The New Jersey legend made much of his wealth from his music catalog, which he sold to Sony in 2021 for $500 million. Outside of music, Kim Kardashian ($1.7 billion) and Oprah Winfrey ($3 billion) both rank ahead of Swift and Rihanna as the world's richest female celebrities.

As Swift's wealth and fame have ballooned, so has her reputation as one of the world's most powerful people. Forbes ranked her the fifth most powerful woman in the world in 2023 -- making her the highest-ranked entertainer, and putting her in the company of the world's most influential political and business leaders -- citing the impact her Eras Tour has had on local economies and the dedication of her fan base, known as Swifties. Swift was also named the 2023 Time Person of the Year, and she has been considered an influential figure in politics. Her endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris was credited with a spike in visits to vote.gov, a voter registration website.

Two AI Pioneers Get This Year's Nobel Prize In Physics,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2024/10/08/two-ai-pioneers-get-this-years-nobel-prize-in-physics/,2024-10-08T18:05:14Z,"Geoffrey Hinton from University of Toronto and John Hopfield from Princeton University both received this year's Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for their research in the field of artificial intelligence. Specifically, the duo was recognized for their foundational work in neural networks, which laid the groundwork for today's large language models and generative AI.

Hinton is widely recognized as the godfather of artificial intelligence, and he made headlines last year when he quit working for Google so he could more freely speak against the risks of AI -- a technology he played a significant role in creating.

Hinton was instrumental in developing a technique in the '80s called backpropagation, which enables algorithms to learn. Here's how the concept works.

If you were teaching a robot to distinguish between different animals, its learning process consists of three major steps:

So after many repetitions, where tens of thousands of images may be reviewed, the robot gets better and better at finding the correct animals -- which is basically how computers ""learn.""

John Hopfield's contribution was regarding the concept of ""associative memory"" where he developed a type of computer memory that works a lot like the human brain. His associative memory model is similar to a huge connect-the-dot picture, where every dot stands for some information.

What Hopfield did, was to get computers memorizing and recalling information closer to the way human brains do it. As a result, he enabled the software to be more pattern-recognizing and piece-filling-in algorithms.

Both Hopfield's and Hinton's research paved the way for AI as we know it today.

The annual honor comes with a cash award of $1 million from a bequest left by the award's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The winners within each category -- economics, physics, peace, literature, medicine and chemistry -- are all invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, to commemorate the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896.

Aside from establishing the award, Nobel is best known for inventing dynamite."

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' celebrity friends are likely ""scrubbing their social media"" after the disgraced music mogul was accused of sex trafficking.

As Tony Buzbee - the attorney who is representing over 100 accusers making claims against Combs - prepares to file sexual assault lawsuits, the lawyer claimed he has ""no doubt"" A-list celebs are attempting to ""distance themselves"" from the singer.

""I have no doubt that there are people right now who know that they were somehow involved in this - who are now scrubbing their social media, who are searching their memories, who are deleting their texts, probably deleting pictures and trying to distance themselves from this,"" Buzbee told Law & Crime.

""And we know who they are, or we will find out who they are,"" he added. ""This is not something that's going to happen overnight, but I think we're at the tip of the iceberg here.""

DIDDY'S CELEBRITY FRIENDS ARE QUIETLY SETTLING WITH VICTIMS AHEAD OF IMPENDING LAWSUITS: LAWYER

Combs' famous friends are allegedly settling with victims outside of court to ensure they are not named in impending lawsuits, according to Buzbee. The Texas-based lawyer has plans in the works to sue several celebrities who allegedly helped the musician cover up sexual abuse that occurred at his parties.

""If you were attending one of these parties, if you will, and you attended before, or you knew what was going to happen - that is, you knew that a particular drug was being used in drinks that was causing people to be coerced and taken advantage of - and you were there in the room, or you participated, or you watched it happen and didn't say anything, or you helped cover it up, in my view, you have a problem,"" Buzbee said during an appearance on TMZ Live.

Some celebrities have already settled, he claimed.

""In every single case, especially cases like this, we collect our data, collect our evidence, do our due diligence, spend time with the victim, and then, because it's in the best interest of the victim, we attempt to resolve these matters without the filing of a public lawsuit, and we have done that already,"" Buzbee explained.

""We've done that with a handful of individuals, many of which you've heard of before, and we'll continue to do that.""

Buzbee is representing 120 victims, some of whom were minors at the time of the alleged sexual abuse. The youngest accuser was 9 years old, with another 15-year-old alleged accuser.

Buzbee claimed the alleged abuse began as early as 1991, with reported incidents happening into 2024. Victims, who are scattered around the country in states including California, Florida, Georgia and New York, came forward after Combs was indicted by federal prosecutors.

Combs' legal team denied the allegations put forth by Buzbee in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

""As Mr. Combs' legal team has emphasized, he cannot address every meritless allegation in what has become a reckless media circus,"" Combs' attorney, Erica Wolff, stated. ""That said, Mr. Combs emphatically and categorically denies as false and defamatory any claim that he sexually abused anyone, including minors. He looks forward to proving his innocence and vindicating himself in court, where the truth will be established based on evidence, not speculation.""

Combs was charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and transportation to engage in prostitution in an indictment unsealed Sept. 17. If found guilty, he faces a minimum of 15 years behind bars or a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Authorities alleged Combs ran a criminal enterprise through his businesses, including Bad Boy Entertainment, Combs Enterprises and Combs Global, among others. He used ""firearms, threats of violence, coercion, and verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse"" to fulfill his sexual desires, according to the unsealed indictment obtained by Fox News Digital.

Combs and his employees would ""intimidate, threaten, and lure female victims into Comb's orbit, often under the pretense of a romantic relationship. Combs allegedly then used force, threats of force, and coercion, to cause victims to engage in extended sex acts with male commercial sex workers that Combs referred to as, among other things, 'Freak Offs.'""

Lawyers for Combs denied the allegations and have maintained the rapper is innocent.

Created by Shawn Ryan (The Shield) and based on the novel of the same name by Matthew Quirk, The Night Agent follows Agent Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) as he is thrown into a vast conspiracy about a mole at the highest levels of the United States government. To save the nation, he plunges into a desperate hunt for the traitor, while protecting former tech CEO Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan) from the people who murdered her aunt and uncle.

Following its premiere on March 23, 2023, The Night Agent emerged as the third-most-viewed debuting series on Netflix in its first four days. At present, it ranks as the 7th most popular English series on Netflix of all time, with a reported 98.2 million views in its first 91 days. Reported views on a streaming service are a metric that measures how many times a piece of media has been viewed on that platform within a specific time period.

In its first month, The Night Agent ranked No. 1 in the Global Top 10 for four consecutive weeks and reached the No. 1 spot in the Top 10 for 87 countries.

Ten new episodes of The Night Agent, which is produced by Sony Pictures Television, have been ordered.

The following are picture highlights of the upcoming second season of The Night Agent."
Floridians prepare for the worst as Hurricane Milton quickly approaches,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/floridians-prepare-worst-hurricane-milton-quickly-approaches,2024-10-08T18:00:48Z,"Treasure Island, Florida resident Chuck Fuller shares how his community, which is in the direct path of Hurricane Milton, is preparing and how the storm has left many with no choice but to evacuate.

Floridians are finishing last-minute preparations as Hurricane Milton approaches, with the storm expected to have life-threatening impacts from Wednesday into Thursday.

Milton, now a Category 4 storm, had maximum sustained winds of 150 mph and was moving in an east-northeast direction at 9 mph, the hurricane center said in a Tuesday update.

Milton is expected to bring a deadly storm surge, destructive winds and flooding rain, Fox Weather reports. Forecasters warned of a possible 10- to 15-foot storm surge in Tampa Bay. It is the highest surge ever predicted for that location and has led to evacuation orders for communities all along the coast.

The storm could also bring widespread flooding, with 5 inches to a foot of rain forecast for the Florida peninsula, and even up to 18 inches in some places.

FEMA HEAD DENIES AGENCY IS SHORT ON MONEY FOR DISASTER RELIEF BECAUSE FUNDS WENT TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

Eleven Florida counties under mandatory evacuation orders are home to about 5.9 million people, according to county-level population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau.

Media outlets showed masses of cars attempting to evacuate Florida's west coast on I-75 and State Road 56. Some are heading toward the Orlando metro area, where one resident is prepared to sell her home should it flood again.

11 TENNESSEE FACTORY WORKERS SWEPT AWAY IN HELENE FLOODWATERS, COMPANY RESPONDS TO EVACUATION DECISION

""We are trying to prepare our home best we can inside and pack up to leave to go to my daughters',"" Winter Springs resident Denise Rossignolo-Brown told Fox News Digital. ""It's all so disheartening at our ages we are dealing with this.""

The hurricane is going to impact communities still reeling from Hurricane Helene just weeks ago, and will likely devastate areas hit by Hurricane Ian in 2022.

Rossignolo-Brown said that, after Ian, she and her family could not even enter their home for three days due to high water levels.

""It was a total nightmare,"" she said.

Over the weekend, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 51 of the state's 67 counties.

President Biden approved the state's pre-landfall emergency declaration request on Monday, which allows the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures.

Tampa Mayor Jane Castor issued a dire warning for those who choose to stay behind in mandatory evacuation zones as Hurricane Milton barrels toward Florida.

""Helene was a wake-up call, this is literally catastrophic,"" Castor said on CNN. ""If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you are going to die.""

Before this Atlantic hurricane season started, forecasters said everything lined up to be a monster busy year, and it began that way when Beryl was the earliest storm to reach Category 5 on record. Then, nothing.

Opinion | I'm a Republican strategist. Here's why Kamala Harris' campaign gives me confidence.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-campaign-election-close-race-rcna174311,2024-10-08T17:45:17Z,"The vice president has set herself up well but she'll need to finish strong.

There is no playbook for a three-month presidential campaign but, if there were, it would look like what Vice President Kamala Harris has done so far.

The closeness of the race has led some Monday-morning quarterbacks to argue that the problem is Harris has not done enough interviews. She has actually done quite a few, including tough ones with CNN's Dana Bash, the National Association of Black Journalists and ""60 Minutes""; and less hard-hitting ones with local news outlets in swing states and popular podcasts targeted at key demographics, such as Hispanics and young women.

Still, this complaint has circulated enough through the news and social media, the Harris campaign has scheduled more national media interviews for her and her running mate, Tim Walz, who even went on ""Fox News Sunday.""

It's possible that these interviews may help sway the sliver of undecided voters who are still looking for a sign. At the least, they may keep the pundits and pontificators at bay, especially if they prove to be uneventful. At a minimum, it's another chance for Harris to get her message out in the final weeks of the campaign.

But let's be clear: This is not how the race will be won. The campaign has internal polling that shows much more than the publicly available polls what the head-to-head race looks like, which voters are still gettable and what messages are motivating them. It has behind-the-scenes efforts to reach out to supporters by email, text message, social media, phone calls and knocking on doors. And it has millions of dollars in ads rolling out daily.

What the public and the press see of a campaign are just the tip of the iceberg. And in my 35 years of experience as a strategist, I've learned that things look much different on the inside. A campaign is like a marriage; you never really know what's going on unless you're in it. And while I don't know what it's like inside the Harris headquarters any more than the next pundit, the way the campaign has gone so far gives me confidence in how things are going there."
Brother of Saints wide receiver Chris Olave questions lack of use in loss to Chiefs,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/brother-saints-wide-receiver-chris-olave-questions-lack-use-loss-chiefs,2024-10-08T17:43:46Z,"The Kansas City Chiefs will play the New Orleans Saints on Monday Night Football, and Patrick Mahomes is hoping to have a big game. Nick Wright, Chris Broussard, and Kevin Wildes discuss the potential for Mahomes to break out.

Fantasy football owners are not the only ones criticizing NFL coaches this season.

New Orleans Saints wide receiver Chris Olave had a lackluster performance in Monday night's 26-13 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, which followed his season-best performance against the Atlanta Falcons last week, when he recorded eight receptions for 87 yards.

Olave, 24, was targeted just four times and had just two receptions for just 10 yards, matching his season-low in Week 1 against the Carolina Panthers. He was targeted just once in the first half on Monday.

Seemingly unhappy with the low production, Olave's brother, Josh, posted a brief message on social media.

""1 target?"" he said in a post on X.

Derek Carr completed 18 passes for 165 yards, two touchdowns and an interception before leaving in the fourth quarter with what appeared to be an oblique injury. Star running back Alvin Kamara managed just 26 yards rushing on 11 carries, and third-year receiver Rashid Shaheed led the team with four receptions for 86 yards and one touchdown.

Netanyahu confirms Nasrallah's replacement dead: 'Thousands of terrorists' killed,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-confirms-nasrallahs-replacement-dead-thousands-terrorists-killed,2024-10-08T17:43:32Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Tuesday that Hezbollah's intended replacement of its former leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed late last month, has also been ""taken out.""

""Today, Hezbollah is weaker than it has been for many, many years,"" Netanyahu said in a message tailored directly to the ""people of Lebanon.""

""We've degraded Hezbollah's capabilities, we took out thousands of terrorists, including [former Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah's replacement, and the replacement of his replacement.""

BIDEN WHITE HOUSE HAS 'VERY LOW' TRUST IN NETANYAHU REGIME, URGES TRANSPARENCY: REPORT

Netanyahu said Iran has ""conquered"" Lebanon to ensure Hezbollah serves Tehran's interests in the region by turning it into a ""stockpile of ammunition and weapons"" serving as a pseudo ""Iranian military base"" on Israel's border.

""Now you, the Lebanese people, you stand at a significant crossroads. It is your choice,"" he continued. ""You can now take back your country. You can return it to a path of peace and prosperity.""

""If you don't, Hezbollah will continue to try to fight Israel from densely populated areas at your expense,"" the prime minister added. ""Free your country from Hezbollah.""

Netanyahu did not explicitly say what it would take to stop Israeli strikes on Hezbollah in Lebanon, but earlier on Tuesday the group's deputy leader Naim Qassem suggested he may be open to a cease-fire without the inclusion of Gaza in the negotiations.

Netanyahu's announcement regarding the death of Hashem Safieddine, who sat as the head of Hezbollah's executive council and was most likely slated to be the group's next leader, comes as Israeli forces expanded their incursion westward along the border in Lebanon.

1 YEAR AFTER HEZBOLLAH STRIKES, ISRAEL REINFORCES TROOPS AND QUESTIONS MOUNT OVER 'LIMITED' OPERATION

Though Safieddine was not as well-known as Nasrallah, who served as the leader of Hezbollah for more than 30 years, his close ties to Iran and his outspoken behavior following the Hamas attacks against Israel on Oct. 7,2023 cemented him as a top target of Jerusalem's.

It is not clear how or where Safieddine was allegedly killed, though the announcement of his death followed an update provided by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) which said ""hundreds of terrorists"" had been ""eliminated"" since the 98th Brigade first entered Lebanon last week.

The brigade, which is made up of paratroopers, commandos as well as top soldiers of the 7th Brigade and the Yahalom Unit, has been targeting and dismantling Hezbollah strongholds, weapons depots and tunnel routes used by Hezbollah's elite Radwan Forces near the border with Israel.

The IDF has said it will carry out a ""limited, localized, targeted"" operation in Lebanon, but as Israeli forces continue to hit Hezbollah strongholds well north of the border including the capital city of Beirut, concerns are mounting that Lebanon could see similar destruction to that caused in Gaza, with one U.N. official referring to the strategy of bombardment as the ""spiral of doom,"" reported multiple outlets Tuesday.

Internally displaced people from southern Lebanon have been pouring into Beirut following Israel's increase in strikes three weeks ago, followed by the incursion earlier this month.

Beirut mayor Abdallah Darwich urged a cease-fire to be reached between Hezbollah and Israel and told the BBC on Tuesday there was ""no safe place in Beirut,"" warning that the capital city had reached the ""limit of its tolerance.""

""You do not know who is living in this building or that building, so you do not know if there is a target there,"" he said. ""You can no longer say Beirut is safe. Where the next Israeli target is, nobody knows.""

Roughly 1.2 million people have been displaced in Lebanon since the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel escalated last month. More than 400,000 people have fled Lebanon into Syria, and roughly 1,400 have been killed based on numbers provided by the Lebanese Health Ministry and the number of combatants believed to have been killed by Israel. Some 70,000 Israelis have been forced out of the country's northern communities since the start of the conflict."
Sting's New Power Trio Make Their NYC Debut,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidchiu/2024/10/08/stings-new-power-trio-make-their-nyc-debut/,2024-10-08T17:42:56Z,"For the first time in over 15 years since the Police played their final show at Madison Square Garden, Sting returned to the Big Apple on Monday and performed again as part of a power trio. Rathern than a reunion with former Police bandmates Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers, Sting's new group included his longtime guitarist Dominic Miller and drummer Chris Maas -- which is why the legendary singer-bassist's latest tour of North America is appropriately titled Sting 3.0.

Monday's kickoff of Sting's three nights at the Brooklyn Paramount (which resumes on Wednesday) was very successful as he and his bandmates played a focused and economical set of solo and Police songs, hearkening back to the minimalism that Sting's previous band became famous for (Even the stage setup didn't distract from the music).

Launching with the classic ""Message in a Bottle,"" the British musician offered a balanced set of his biggest hits (among them ""Fields of Gold,"" ""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,"" ""Walking on the Moon"" ""Desert Rose"" and ""All This Time"") and deep cuts (including ""Shape of My Heart"" and ""Why Should I Cry for You"").

Along with the popular solo and Police material, Sting performed his latest single that he recorded with Miller and Maas, the anthemic rocker ""I Wrote Your Name (Upon My Heart)"" -- perhaps a tease of more new material from the trio. He also unveiled a rare song from the past: a reworking of the haunting ""I Burn for You,"" which the Police first recorded for the soundtrack to the 1982 film Brimstone and Treacle.

Near the end of the set and during the encore, Sting performed his two biggest songs from his Police days, the iconic ""Every Breath You Take"" and ""Roxanne"" - the latter of which incorporated a jazzy interlude. He concluded the evening by playing guitar on the reflective ballad ""Fragile"" -- which, along with another song from earlier in the set, ""Driven to Tears,"" provided a very sobering moment given the current state of the world.

The show captured Sting in very good - even humorous -- spirits through his banter with the audience between songs. With tremendous support from Miller and Maas, Sting's singing and bass work sounded stronger than ever as indicated by this first night of his Brooklyn shows. Like the Police, Sting's power trio delivered no-frills and energetic musicianship that yielded entertaining results."
Texas AG demands Biden-Harris admin help verify citizenship of nearly 500K registered voters,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-ag-demands-biden-harris-admin-help-verify-citizenship-nearly-500k-registered-voters,2024-10-08T17:30:36Z,"Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus discuss on Hannity

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has written to the Biden-Har­ris administration urging it to provide data that would help identify up to half a million people who could be erroneously registered to vote in the state but not be a citizen.

Paxton, a Republican, said that the Biden-Har­ris administration has ""legal obligations"" to hand over such information so that the Lone Star state can help determine the citizenship status of certain registered voters who do not have a state of Texas-issued driver's license or identification card since those are only issued after citizen checks.

Non-U.S. citizens lawfully present cannot legally vote but can lawfully apply for and receive a driver's license or ID card.

Paxton said he is investigating those registered voters so Texas can be in compliance with federal and state election laws which prohibit non-U.S. citizens from voting. He penned his letter Monday to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Ur Jaddou.

ARIZONA LAW REQUIRING PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP TO VOTE SUPPORTED BY 24 STATE AGS IN EMERGENCY STAY WITH SCOTUS

""I demand full cooperation from the federal government to ensure that any noncitizens remaining on Texas's voter registration rolls are identified,"" Paxton said in a statement. ""The Biden-Harris Administration is legally obligated to assist States in doing so, and it is imperative that we use every tool available to uphold the integrity of our elections.""

Paxton said that while it is a crime for noncitizens to register to vote, federal law paradoxically creates opportunities for non-citizens to illegally register to vote while also prohibiting states from requiring voters to have proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections.

He said it is particularly troubling given the current scale of the illegal immigration and that the Senate has not passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act (""SAVE Act""), which would allow states to ensure that votes are being cast legally by eligible voters. He said that requiring proof of citizenship is a commonsense measure that helps identify illegal registration.

Paxton has obtained a list of approximately 454,289 Texas registered voters who have never had their citizenship verified. The list is derived from the Texas Secretary of State's (SOS) computerized list of voters the office is required to maintain.

THOUSANDS OF NONCITIZENS REMOVED FROM VOTER ROLLS, DOZENS OF LAWMAKERS WANT ANSWERS FROM GARLAND

""Although I have no doubt the vast majority of the voters on the list are citizens who are eligible to vote, I am equally certain that Texans have no way of knowing whether or not any of the voters on the list are noncitizens who are ineligible to vote,"" Paxton wrote in the letter.

""Indeed, a recent SOS audit verified that over 1,300 noncitizens were registered to vote in the four randomly chosen counties that were subject to an election audit -- and that is just what was verifiable. That is 1,300 too many when so many of our federal, state, and local election are decided by a handful of votes.""

Paxton has been trying to crack down hard on non-citizens voting.

In August, his office's Election Integrity unit executed searches in three South Texas counties as part of his ongoing probe to investigate fraud and ballot harvesting allegations.

In the same month, Gov. Greg Abbott announced 6,500 potential noncitizens had been removed from the voter rolls since 2021. Approximately 1,930 had a voter history.

Republicans have raised concerns about voter integrity issued and non-citizens being registered to vote ahead of the 2024 presidential election.

Officials in Oregon announced Monday that they have identified an additional 302 people on the state's voter rolls who didn't provide proof of citizenship when they were registered to vote. The announcement comes just two weeks after officials in the Beaver State said 1,259 possible noncitizens have been registered to vote since 2021, bringing the total number of mistaken registrations to 1,561.

Last month, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that nearly 98,000 people whose U.S. citizenship has not been confirmed will be allowed to vote in the upcoming state and local elections."
Frances Tiafoe Curses Out Chair Umpire Over Violation At Shanghai Masters,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2024/10/08/frances-tiafoe-curses-out-chair-umpire-over-violation-at-shanghai-masters/,2024-10-08T17:30:16Z,"Tuesday was not Frances Tiafoe's finest day on a tennis court.

The U.S. Open semifinalist directed a barrage of expletives at the chair umpire after losing a match at the Shanghai Masters.

Tiafoe targeted umpire Jimmy Pinoargote with about 10 expletives in a minute-long tirade after his 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 (5) loss against 61st-ranked Roman Safiullin in a third-round match.

The ATP rule book calls for fines of $60,000 at Masters 1000 tournaments.

A tour spokesman told The Associated Press no decision has yet been made on the matter.

The 17th-ranked Tiafoe was angered by being docked his first serve for a time violation at 5-5 in the decisive tiebreaker.

Pinoargote judged that Tiafoe was not making a genuine attempt to serve when he tossed the ball in the air at the baseline. Tiafoe at first protested before continuing to play.

Two points later, the match was over and he congratulated Safiullin at the net before turning toward the umpire's chair and shouting the first expletives.

Tiafoe passed to the other side of the net toward his chair and shouted that the umpire had messed up the match.

The 26-year-old American said he had been battling on court for thee hours for his livelihood, peppering his words with more expletives.

Before leaving the court, Tiafoe added: ""Never again.""

Tiafoe could face fines for verbal abuse of an official and for using obscenities. The tournament can take away some of his prize money, and the case could also be sent to the ATP Member Fines Committee for further investigation.

Safiullin advanced to face Novak Djokovic in the round of 16.

Tiafoe had a stellar run of form in the summer reaching the final of the Cincinnati Open, where he lost to Jannick Sinner, then reaching the semifinals at the US Open where he lost in five sets to fellow American Taylor Fritz."

PIZZA + PURPOSE

Caroline D'Amore's career trajectory has taken her from DJing around the world to walking the runways of Diane von Furstenberg to becoming a finalist on Gordon Ramsey's ""Food Stars"" in 2023, to now being known as the pink-haired activist Pizza Girl,

Prior to the pandemic, her products were sold in over 100 stores, but given the challenges that came with sourcing organic ingredients during the pandemic, she had to stop production.

D'Amore credits her daughter with inspiring her to re-launch Pizza Girl in 2021. D'Amore now has built a successful brand of pasta sauces and a countertop pizza oven, which sold out within days of the launch. She opened a store in Venice Beach, California, with a second location slated for early 2025. Her company champions quality, authenticity and social responsibility. She challenges the status quo, showing that women can lead in any industry they choose, from the boardroom to the kitchen and beyond.

D'Amore didn't always feel this confident. ""Pizza Girl started out of the frustration of not feeling heard as a young girl in my Italian pizza family,"" she explained. She was even admonished not to put the word ""Girl"" in the name of her company. Her response? Not only is it called ""Pizza Girl,"" everything from the pizza boxes to the ovens are pink.

D'Amore started using her Instagram platform to talk about more than just pizza after the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023. By sharing personal experiences from her visits to Israel in December 2023 and February 2024, D'Amore has used her business platform for broader social impact.

ROOTED IN FAMILY

Chelsea Bowers and Emily O'Neill, two native Montanans, are forging their own path. Growing up with strong entrepreneurial spirits, both had businesses rooted in hard work and long hours -- Chelsea with a professional house-painting business and also assisting with hunting trips, and Emily with a catering and Dutch Oven camp cooking venture. When Chelsea married Emily's brother Phillip in 2010, the two became not only sisters-in-law but also powerful business partners.

In 2017, Chelsea and her mother, Denise, decided to start a flower shop in Livingston, Montana. The venture soon blossomed into Rooted in Montana. Though Denise eventually left due to health issues, Chelsea and Emily took a leap of faith. They credit prayer, perseverance and adaptability for helping them transform Rooted in Montana into a thriving business.

Since its inception, Rooted in Montana has expanded to offer houseplants, event florals and custom wedding designs. The sisters-in-law, now seasoned entrepreneurs, have designed flowers for almost 300 weddings and overcome challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which required them to step up their leadership and advocate for themselves and their customers.

O'Neill remembers that time: ""We were persistent when it came to the covid shutdowns in our little town. I actually called the governor's office and said that I thought that our business was an 'essential' business. This was after I got off the phone with a woman whose father passed away in Livingston, and they lived on the East Coast and weren't able to fly."" O'Neill wanted to help the woman honor her father's memory at a time when life was greatly disrupted.

Residents of the town of Livingston were adamant that businesses should be open while being respectful about safety concerns. Eventually, O'Neill heard back from the governor's office that while they could not have customers in their shop, they could offer contactless delivery. ""That was a really good day,"" recalled O'Neill.

Chelsea Bowers and Emily O'Neill's journey embodies the determination that defines so many women entrepreneurs. Their story is a powerful reminder on International Day of the Girl of how important it is to empower young girls to dream big, take risks and forge their own paths in business and beyond.

HITTING THE AIRWAYS

Julia Howe, the inspiring teen founder of the podcast Hitting The Wall, is a powerful example of how young women can make an impact in today's world. While enrolled in WIT - Whatever It Takes, a mentorship and training program for teenage entrepreneurs, Howe created the podcast to shed light on issues that often go unnoticed -- mental-health struggles, societal pressures and the importance of self-care, especially among young women.

Howe's stories of being an endurance athlete fuel meaningful conversations and demonstrate the resilience and strength that align with the values celebrated on International Day of The Girl. Her mission resonates with young girls worldwide, encouraging them to embrace their vulnerabilities and turn them into strengths. Howe's work was recently recognized as a ""force for good"" by Frigo Cheese Heads Build a Bright Future program.

Through Hitting The Wall, Howe provides a platform for voices that are often silenced. Not only does she share her own experiences on the podcast, but she also invites experts and advocates to provide listeners with practical advice and support, particularly connected to self-worth tied to body performance and appearance.

In sports, many girls push beyond their limits, with 8 in 10 showing signs of Relative Energy Deficiency, including disordered eating, menstrual issues, and risks to cardiovascular and bone health. This harmful cycle forces them to prioritize performance over well-being, leading to unhealthy training habits.

By equipping the Hitting The Wall audience -- primarily young women -- with the knowledge and tools to navigate these complexities, Howe is inspiring a global community of young women. Her work embodies the spirit of International Day of The Girl, which focuses on advocating for girls' rights, challenging gender norms, and ensuring that young women everywhere are heard, valued and empowered to make a difference. Howe explained, ""On the podcast, we talk about the things people often shy away from: disordered eating, burnout, body image. We show girls that they aren't alone in these experiences but also give them strategies to navigate them. What we most want to show these girls is that strength doesn't just come from winning races. True strength is knowing when to prioritize your health, your mind, and your well-being.""

In a world that still grapples with gender inequality and societal expectations, the achievements of these women serve as powerful reminders of the importance of empowering young girls. Their stories reflect not only personal triumphs but also a collective movement toward a future where women can lead in any industry they choose. As we honor the International Day of the Girl, let us take inspiration from these change makers and strive to create a supportive environment where every girl can dream big, embrace her unique journey and become a catalyst for change."
How Enterprise Technology Executives Create Relevance In The Age Of AI,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2024/10/08/how-enterprise-technology-executives-create-relevance-in-the-age-of-ai/,2024-10-08T17:29:38Z,"According to a recent report by IBM, less than half of C-level executives believe that their IT organizations are effective at delivering basic services. In 2013, 64% of CEOs had confidence in their company's IT departments to ""deliver basic service"". This year, that confidence plummeted by 77%, according to CIO Magazine. Now, CEO confidence in IT departments stands at just 36%. And even IT leaders are doubting their own impact, with survey respondents showing a 47% drop in confidence over the course of the last decade. Why are enterprise executives losing faith in IT teams? And how are CIOs battling back for relevance, at a time when confidence in IT is threatened?

The 2024 State of the CIO report shows that 87% of CIOs are now more involved in leading digital transformation efforts - viewing the Chief Information Officer role as a ""changemaker"" for technology initiatives. ""CIOs must align with business goals, ensuring that technology directly supports revenue growth, operational efficiency and improved outcomes,"" according to Ray Sharp, CIO at Katherine Shaw Bethea Hospital in Dixon, Illinois. While AI is reshaping entire industries, its presence is also impacting how CIOs contribute to the leadership conversation.

Anjali Shaikh agrees with Sharp. She is an MD and the CIO Program Experience Director at Deloitte Consulting. At a time where confidence in IT departments is slipping, enterprise executives have to look at new ways to create value. ""Many CIOs have built years of credibility and trust by blocking and tackling the traditional responsibilities of the role,"" she tells CIO Magazine. ""They're now being brought to the conversation as business leaders to help the organization think through transformational priorities because they're functional experts like any other executive in the C-suite."" The key to creating relevance here is cross-functional collaboration, according to Sharp. ""Working closely with other C-suite executives, at the enterprise level, is key.""

From collaboration comes understanding, according to The IBM Institute for Business Value. ""[CIOs] must build multidisciplinary teams to bring [innovative and relevant] strategy to life, encouraging the experimentation and fresh ideas that inspire employees and delight customers."" However, 53% of CIOs say that other execs in their organizations view tech as ""no more than moderately important"" to innovation. This approach from enterprise execs seems either lazy or uninformed, given the way that AI is influencing every aspect of business today.

For CIOs nationwide, AI involvement has increased by 45% in the past year, according to the State of the CIO report. Today, that number is rising: 80% of CIOs say that they will be more involved with AI/machine learning over the next year. Key tasks, according to 71% of CIO respondents, include formulating AI apps. ""In healthcare, CIOs can use AI to improve diagnostic accuracy, enhance patient monitoring and streamline administrative workflows,"" Sharp says. But he also emphasizes the importance of cybersecurity and data privacy. ""This protects the organization's reputation and ensures patients' trust in the safety of their personal health information."" Whether patients or customers, privacy is vital.

The key to creating confidence for CIOs starts with the oldest tool in business, not the latest. Technical knowledge doesn't mean much if it is not paired with the ability to listen. Leadership in IT will leverage advanced technical tools, but those initiatives all begin with a conversation. From effective communication comes effective implementation.

CIOs serve as the arbiters and guides to a brave new world that's powered by LLMs and AI - a role that is now more relevant than ever. Yet, enterprise execs don't see the value of the IT department, according to industry surveys. The challenge facing tech departments might be summarized in two words. These two rob brands of their impact, and job seekers from their next opportunity. Those two words? ""Don't know.""

If people don't know what you can do, from a standpoint of service, how do people get what you have to offer? How does relevance increase? Accessing innovation around tech starts with the human element - and that's always discovered in a conversation. ""Leaders must amp up their outreach to the organization,"" according to IBM, ""on what and how technology can deliver."" Paradoxically, delivering the latest enterprise technology begins with the oldest tool in business: a powerful conversation."
Mortgage rates have dropped. Should you refinance your home?,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/g-s1-26348/mortgage-rates-have-dropped-should-you-refinance-your-home,2024-10-08T17:28:33Z,"As interest rates have dropped, refinancing could make sense, or not. Here's what to know before you decide.

J Studios/Getty Images hide caption

Mortgage rates have dropped significantly in recent months, and that means one thing for those who bought a home in the last couple years: It might be time to refinance.

Refinancing your mortgage means swapping your current interest rate for a new one. This is typically done if rates have fallen a good amount since you took out a home loan or last refinanced. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now just above 6%, down a full point from where it was in May.

Most homeowners won't feel the need to do anything. Nearly 60% of Americans with mortgages have rates below 4%. But if you bought recently at a higher rate, you could now be in a position to cut your monthly payment significantly.

Even small changes in rates can make a big difference, says Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a U.S. government agency. ""Now that rates have been falling, we project that millions of people can save big money every month if they're able to refinance,"" he says.

For example, on a $500,000 mortgage, you'd save $329 on the monthly payment with a 6% versus a 7% rate.

Interested in seeing if you can save money on your mortgage? Here's what to know about refinancing - and how to think about timing.

The first step is to do some online research to get a rough idea of how a lower rate could change your monthly payment. You'll also want to:

Refinancing does cost money: expect to pay several thousand dollars in closing costs, as you did when you first bought the home. Benjamin Balser, a mortgage broker in Alexandria, Va., says refinance costs for a typical home in Washington, D.C., tend to start at about $2,000, while in Virginia, they're upward of $3,000.

Keep in mind that these online calculators are only giving you an estimate. To get results tailored to you, you'll need to reach out to some mortgage brokers and loan officers. Which brings us to the next step.

When you refinance, you could stick with your current lender or go to a new one. The new lender pays off your old mortgage when you take out your new loan.

To get the best rate, shop around for quotes. Ask your friends, coworkers and neighbors to connect you to their lender and get rates from them.

Getting the best rate is partly a numbers game, says Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac.

""Even identical borrowers applying on the same day with the same lender will often get different rates - and it's hard to figure out why,"" he says. ""You just have to make sure you get enough quotes, because one of them may come in that's lower than the others.""

There's also an alternative to refinancing that may be available, depending on your lender: a mortgage reset. Some banks and credit unions allow you to reset your mortgage rate to the current market rate, often for a flat fee, without having to jump through the hoops of a refinance.

Ask your lender if this is an option, because it won't be for all mortgages.

People often refinance to lower their monthly mortgage payment. But there are other reasons you may want to go through this process.

Because refinancing means taking out a new loan, the loan term can be changed.

If you are two years into paying off your 30-year mortgage, you have 28 years left on it. But if you take out a new 30-year loan, you're starting the 30-year clock over again. That can be a little dispiriting.

If your financial situation has improved or the new lower rates make it possible, you could see about moving to a shorter-term loan, like 15, 20 or 25 years. A shorter term means paying off your mortgage faster and paying less total interest.

Ask potential lenders what terms are possible, and assess what your monthly payment would be.

When mortgage rates are moving around, it's hard to know when to refinance. Should you go for it as soon as it's clear it'll save you money? Or should you wait to see if rates drop further?

Your decision to refinance depends on your personal circumstances as a borrower, for example, how long you intend to own the home. But if the numbers are in your favor now, Khater says he'd go for it.

""Forecasting rates is very difficult. There's a lot of turbulence, both in the financial markets and in geopolitics that could drive rates higher from here. From my perspective, I would take the opportunity and pull the trigger.""

In other words, if you can save $300 a month by refinancing now, he says you might as well hedge your bets and do it. If rates fall another full percentage point, you could always refinance again later.

And you may not realize this, but as a homeowner, you're already paying for the option to refinance. It's baked into the mortgage rate you're paying -- the risk to your lender that you may decide to refinance your loan someday. So take advantage of it if it can save you money."

It is unclear exactly why a CNN promo would put him in a difficult spot. CNN's parent company is Warner Bros. Discovery, which also owns TBS, TruTV, Max and TNT.

Costas joined CNN as a sports contributor in 2020 and has been either a studio host or calling baseball games for TBS since 2021. The promo Costas was asked to read may have put him in a tight window broadcasting wise.

Garcia finished 4-for-5 with an RBI. Hampson was 2-for-2 on the night.

President Biden is warning Tuesday that Hurricane Milton ""could be the worst storm to hit Florida in over a century.""

The Category 4 hurricane is currently located off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and is forecast to make landfall Wednesday night in the Tampa area along Florida's west coast, bringing devastating winds and storm surge.

""This could be the worst storm to hit Florida in over a century. And God willing, it won't be,"" Biden said. ""But that's what it's looking like right now.""

""I have urged everyone currently located in Hurricane Milton's path to listen to local officials and follow safety instructions... if you're under evacuation orders, you should evacuate now,"" Biden added.

Biden says he spoke to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Tampa Mayor Jane Castor last night and ""made it clear to them they should reach out, including to me directly, with everything else they may need as they see this storm hit.""

The president says DeSantis has informed him that ""he's gotten all that he needs"" following the passage of Hurricane Helene through Florida and ahead of Hurricane Milton.

Do I Really Need Pet Insurance? What Every Pet Owner Should Know,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/pet-insurance/do-i-really-need-pet-insurance-what-every-pet-owner-should-know/,2024-10-08T17:21:28Z,"Imagine this: Your playful puppy swallows a sock and the vet recommends emergency surgery to treat the intestinal blockage. The potential cost? Anywhere from $2,000 to $10,000.

As a pet owner, unexpected medical expenses can be overwhelming -- not only are you worried about your pet's well-being, but you're also facing significant costs.

With veterinary costs rising, more pet owners are turning to pet insurance for peace of mind. By the end of 2023, 6.25 million pets were insured in North America -- a 16.7% increase from the previous year and more than double the number in 2019, according to the North American Pet Health Insurance Association (NAPHIA).

This raises an important question: Is pet insurance a must-have or just another unnecessary expense? Here's what every pet owner should know before making a decision.

One of the top reasons pet owners opt for insurance is to protect against unexpected medical expenses. Veterinary care costs have been rising rapidly, with prices increasing by 6.3% from July 2023 to July 2024 -- more than double the average rise seen across other consumer goods, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

While routine visits like annual check-ups might not break the bank, unexpected accidents or emergencies can quickly lead to bills that stretch into the thousands. Here's a breakdown of what some veterinary procedures might cost you:

Given that even a standard vet visit for something like an ear infection can cost between $100 and $150, it's easy to see how expenses can quickly pile up. With an average monthly price of $51 for dogs and $27 for cats, pet insurance may help you focus on your pet's health rather than the size of the vet bill.

It's not just for emergencies either -- pet insurance can also make routine care more accessible, encouraging regular check-ups and early intervention to help prevent severe health issues later on.

Ultimately, pet insurance doesn't just protect your wallet -- it can offer peace of mind, helping you avoid heart-wrenching decisions between your finances and your pet's well-being.

Pet insurance plans typically fall into two categories: accident-only and comprehensive, each offering different levels of coverage depending on your needs.

Beyond these two main types of plans, some pet insurance companies let you customize your policy with wellness add-ons and packages for routine and preventative care.

For example, Lemonade pet insurance allows you to select from various optional add-ons to round out your accident and illness plan, including coverage for vet visit fees, dental illness, behavioral therapy, physical therapy and end-of-life expenses, in addition to packages that can help cover the expected costs of routine vet care. You can also customize your reimbursement rate, deductible and coverage limit, which can give you more control over your monthly premium and level of coverage.

Most pet insurance policies work on a reimbursement model. After paying your vet bill, you'll submit a claim and can receive reimbursement based on the specifics of your plan -- minus any deductible or co-insurance.

As with any insurance policy, it's important to review the fine print. Policy exclusions may include pre-existing conditions, breed-specific health issues and elective procedures such as cosmetic surgeries. Understanding these limitations can help you avoid any surprises when filing a claim.

Several factors can affect your pet's insurability and the cost of your policy, including:

It's also worth exploring options to make pet insurance more budget-friendly. Lemonade, for instance, offers a multi-pet and bundle discount for policyholders with Lemonade renters, homeowners, car or term life insurance. These savings can go a long way in making pet insurance more affordable, helping you get the coverage you need without breaking the bank.

Pet insurance can help offset the financial burden of unexpected veterinary bills, but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Whether it's right for you depends on factors like your pet's age, breed and activity level, as well as your comfort with potential vet expenses.

Many pet owners find insurance valuable for young, active pets or breeds prone to costly health issues. For others, it offers peace of mind, knowing they won't have to choose between their savings and their pet's health in case of an emergency. If you decide to get pet insurance, consider comparing different plans and providers.

Fortunately, shopping for pet insurance can be easier than ever. Companies like Lemonade aim to offer a seamless digital experience, letting you choose coverage options, get quotes and sign up within minutes -- all from the comfort of your couch. This convenience can make it easier to find a policy that meets your pet's needs and aligns with your financial goals."
"What Is The K-1 Visa? Definition, Elements And Examples",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/legal/immigration-law/what-is-k1-visa/,2024-10-08T17:21:21Z,"Here are the steps required to allow a foreign national fiance(e) to come to the U.S. on a K-1 visa.

A U.S. citizen must take the first step, filing a Form I-129F, Petition for Alien Fiance(e). This form requests that USCIS formally recognize the relationship between the citizen sponsor and the foreign national.

USCIS may request additional evidence of the relationship's validity to ensure the couple is not entering into a fraudulent marriage. Once the agency is satisfied that the couple is in a real relationship, it will approve Form I-129F and send the approval to the National Visa Center (NVC).

The NVC will forward the approved Form I-129F to the U.S. embassy or consulate in the foreign national's home country. This opens the door to the foreign fiance(e) submitting a request for a K-1 nonimmigrant visa.

The embassy or consulate will schedule a visa interview for the fiance(e) and provide notification about when it is scheduled. The foreign national must attend the interview and the consular or embassy official will decide whether to issue the visa. If they issue the visa, it gives the fiance(e) six months to come to the United States and allows for one entry into the country.

The key factor in whether the official issues the K-1 visa is whether they believe the relationship is valid.

Once the visa has been approved, the foreign national can come to a port of entry to request admission and will undergo inspection. If admitted, the couple has 90 days to get married. Once the marriage is complete, the foreign national spouse must file Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status to apply for a green card."

""We're diversified here,"" laughed dairy farmer Tom Oberhaus in an interview with Fox News Digital.

He explained that he and his wife are conservative Republicans who have been sure of who they were supporting in the 2024 election for a long time.

""There's no question in our mind that our four years under Trump management was much better than the three and a half years under Biden management - or whoever is, you know, that's the great mystery is, who is actually running the government right now?"" he asked.

They previously voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020.

One issue he has with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat presidential nominee, is that she vouched for President Biden's cognitive ability.

""It bothers the heck out of me that we're thinking about electing a person that just six weeks ago... told us 'Oh, Biden's on top of it. He's really aggressive and really knows what he's doing,'"" Oberhaus said.

""We all seen that in the debate, you know, he's past his time,"" he said of Biden's June debate with former President Trump that preceded his campaign suspension.

Critics have claimed Trump is bad for farmers, pointing to his fondness for tariffs and his past trade conflict with China. But Oberhaus said the tariffs, which ramped up in 2018, ""certainly didn't hurt us.""

""We're much better off with tariffs than having that government printing press printing out money,"" he added.

At Cozy Nook Farm, Oberhaus said their biggest struggle has been inflation. ""We've been [eaten] alive by inflation,"" he claimed.

He explained that they do not set their own prices, and they tend to ""run a couple of years behind everybody else.""

They're now paying ""twice as much for tires and fuel and feed and everything else."" However, ""our milk price stays the same, until just now in the last month that it finally came up.""

""Little town of Whitewater 35 minutes away,"" he said. ""It's a town of, what, 15,000 people? And then they got a thousand new immigrants.""

Local Wisconsin outlets reported that last year Whitewater Police Chief Daniel Meyer and City Manager John Weidl penned a letter to Biden, asking for help after the ""rapid increase"" of about 800 to 1,000 immigrants since 2022.

""As a municipal government, our focus is not on legal status, but rather ensuring we are providing the resources expected of a municipality to all residents of the City. Unfortunately, we are increasingly finding it difficult to do that,"" the letter reportedly read.

""How do you handle that?"" asked Oberhaus.

As for those who argue that with strict immigration enforcement there would result in fewer people to work on farms, he called it ""baloney.""

Markets Project Smaller 2024 Interest Rate Cuts On Better Jobs News,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/08/markets-project-smaller-2024-interest-rate-cuts-on-better-jobs-news/,2024-10-08T17:17:05Z,"With recent, stronger jobs data, markets expect the remaining anticipated interest rate cuts of 2024 to be 0.25% moves. That's down from expectations that both November and December Federal Open Market Committee meetings could see 0.5% cuts. Fixed income market expectations are tracked by the CME FedWatch Tool.

There was concern that the U.S. unemployment situation could weaken further. However, the Employment Situation Report for September showed clear improvement. Unemployment fell slightly for the second consecutive month to 4.1% and nonfarm payrolls rose 254,000. That's over 200,000 jobs added for the first time since May.

Now, the FOMC will see another jobs report on November 1 before its next meeting on November 6-7 and that data could change things. Inflation numbers will matter too. Nonetheless, for now, U.S. unemployment data is more positive than generally anticipated and inflation continues to trend lower.

This matters because if unemployment were to rise significantly, then the FOMC may be prompted to cut rates quite rapidly. That would be to try and reduce the risk of a recession. On the most recent data, a steep rise in unemployment is not happening.

Of course, inflation appears to be returning to the FOMC's 2% annual target, so that creates some momentum for less restrictive monetary policy. However, if the jobs market continues to appear robust, then there's perhaps a little less urgency for interest rate cuts.

The remaining scheduled FOMC interest rate decisions of 2024 are on November 7 and December 18. Currently, fixed income markets expect both to result in 0.25% interest rate cuts. That would leave short term interest rates at 4.25% to 4.5% by the end of 2024 or 0.5% lower than current levels. The risk of a slightly larger or smaller interest rate move is balanced, but currently further 0.5% cuts in 2024 are viewed as unlikely just as is the scenario of the FOMC choosing to hold rates steady at either meeting.

In two recent speeches, policymakers have signaled confidence in monetary policy and advocated for a more gradual approach to interest rate cuts.

New York Fed President John Williams said that: ""The current stance of monetary policy is really well positioned to both hopefully keep maintaining the strength that we have in the economy and the labour market, but also continuing to see that inflation comes back to 2 per cent,"" in an interview with the Financial Times on October 7.

St Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, said: ""My baseline outlook is for continued economic expansion over the next several quarters, supported by a gradual easing of monetary policy and accommodative financial conditions."" At a speech in New York on October 7.

There is still more key economic data to come before the FOMC's next scheduled meeting on November 6-7. Primarily, that's the jobs report for October and inflation reports for September.

So far, the jobs markets appears to be performing better than expected since the FOMC last met, and inflation continues to trend lower. If that economic outlook continues, then it appears likely the FOMC will cut interest rates at its two remaining meetings of 2024, but only by 0.25% at each, rather than the previously estimated 0.5%."
"How To Prepare For Aspen Ski Season, According To A Local Expert",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaredranahan/2024/10/08/how-to-prepare-for-aspen-ski-season-according-to-a-local-expert/,2024-10-08T17:17:01Z,"While renowned North American ski towns range from Stowe, Vermont to California's Mammoth Lakes, few destinations can match the extravagance of Aspen. Established back in the late 19th century as a silver mining town, this Colorado community has morphed into a world-class tourist destination over the past half-century, with no shortage of lavish restaurants and fascinating museums to explore during a visit -- and when it comes to accommodations, The Little Nell is tough to beat. Located just a few steps away from the downtown gondola, this polished property is perfect for ski season, with amenities like a dedicated concierge team and an on-site wine bar that's particularly popular for après-ski.

For Forbes, The Little Nell's Lead Concierge Carol Hooper offers insight into how to plan the perfect Aspen winter getaway, highlighting a wealth of seasonal events across Aspen as well as on-property offerings for visitors to enjoy.

How did you become a member of the Concierge? What does a typical day look like for you at The Little Nell?

I feel fortunate to have become a concierge 20 years ago in Aspen, which I've enjoyed since the first day on the job. I have been a member of the global professional association of hotel concierges (Les Clefs d'Or) for over 15 years. I lead a team of concierges at The Little Nell, and our goal is to create unique and tailored experiences for each of our guests from their arrival until their departure. We contact guests six to eight weeks prior to their arrival to build, guide and book their requests.

Once they arrive, we welcome them and present them with a printed itinerary. The best part of being a concierge is the direct interaction we have with our guests one-on-one. We make great efforts to make these interactions count, which enables us to get to know our guests at the highest level. We have so many guests who return year after year, as we have come to be part of The Little Nell family. We are always grateful to have the opportunity to welcome them back.

Do you have any travel tips and tricks for guests coming for ski season?

The secret for guests coming to The Little Nell is to plan well in advance, as availability can be limited for reservations and experiences. A benefit for guests of The Little Nell is experiencing insights from our concierge team who are experts in our fields, in Aspen offerings and in creating custom itineraries. Based on guests' personal preferences, we assist by listening, recommending, organizing and booking special plans for their stay.

We carefully guide the guests through the process of navigating the ski areas with advance purchasing of lift tickets and booking ski rentals and group or private lessons. Additionally, we share valuable information about what is currently happening in Aspen during their visit, from on-mountain lunches to dinners around Aspen to unique wine experiences in The Little Nell cellar to signature treatments at The Spa at The Little Nell and more. Our goal is to ensure our guests get the full Aspen experience that they'll enjoy the most.

What ski gear do you recommend for travelers?

For ski rentals, our sister brand ASPENX offers a dedicated fitting time, premium skis (Völkl and Kästle), heated boots, poles and helmets. Located in Aspen Gondola Plaza and Base Village in Snowmass, the Aspen Collection ski shops feature bespoke retail items, limited-edition elevated rental equipment and complimentary food and beverage offerings from coffee, tea and breakfast items in the morning to wine and beer in the afternoon.

New this season is ""the Wagner Ski Experience,"" which offers demos of powder or all-mountain skis from Telluride-based Wagner Skis. After your demo, if you would like to purchase a pair, you will have a one-on-one with the owner Pete Wagner to design the right size and style for you. Guests of The Little Nell will find these skis on display in the ski concierge this season and at ASPENX.

Are there any other enjoyable activities to explore in the area or on the property during ski season?

There are a plethora of events, activities and experiences. Throughout the season, there are fun festivals such as Wintersköl (which is moving to mid-December this year from January), the Audi Ajax Cup on December 30th, Winter X Games from January 23rd to 25th and so much more. For culture and music, Aspen is filled with exceptional art galleries, and music can be found all over town from Belly Up to the Bud Light Hi-Fi concerts and select après-ski and late-night offerings. One can downhill or cross-country ski, snowmobile, paraglide, hot air balloon, sleigh ride, ice skate and more.

For families on Snowmass Mountain, an experience called Ullr Nights entails riding the Elk Camp Gondola on select nights to Elk Camp Restaurant for outdoor winter activities such as snow tubing, riding the Alpine Coaster, roasting s'mores and having hot chocolate by a bonfire. Enjoy an à la carte culinary celebration from 5:00 PM to 7:30 PM which is sure to please any palate, along with snowcat dinners. Adventure through the forests and marvel at Aspen's magical views by snowshoeing in the winter. We have a partnership with Audi to offer our guests complimentary snowshoes and the use of an Audi Q8 or a fully electric e-Tron to venture on a snowshoeing tour.

Unique snowcat dinners are available at Lynn Britt Cabin in Snowcat throughout the season. Snowcat powder tours for advanced skiers offer challenging terrain and tree skiing. Champagne lunches flow at Cloud 9 at Aspen Highlands. Finally, The Little Nell's award-winning wine program wouldn't be possible without our knowledgeable team of sommeliers who offer private wine tastings in our world-famous wine cellar along with dinner wine pairings for unique dining.

How does the dedicated ski concierge service help alleviate stress for guests? In what ways does your role collaborate with the ski concierges?

We work very closely with The Little Nell ski concierge team, which is composed of five longtime professionals who know our guests well from their visits in the morning as they start their ski day and in the afternoon when they return. The ski concierge space is just steps from Aspen Mountain's Silver Queen Gondola, where ski and snowboard boots are stored and heated overnight.

Ski and snowboard tunes are available on-site, and the ski concierge can arrange for complimentary intermountain ski transfers, generate lift tickets, book ski lessons and sign them up for our private snowcat on Fridays with Aspen Mountain Powder Tours. Finally, a unique experience is offered for our skiers daily -- First Tracks -- offering early access to the slopes with a ski instructor to ski the beautifully-groomed corduroy conditions as the sun is coming up over Aspen. A very peaceful, fun and glorious run!

What are your top tips for preparing for the ski season?

Arriving at nearly 8,000 feet in Aspen from lower elevations can present challenges with the high altitude and dry climate. It is important to be well-rested and stay hydrated. I would advise guests to come to Aspen as fit as possible, working out legs (through squats and lunges) and core mobility for strength. Cardiovascular training for endurance and perhaps yoga to gain flexibility and strength. All of this will set up the guest for a fulfilling and treasured memory of skiing in Aspen.

How can hotel guests unwind after a day of skiing?

I believe ending a long day of skiing with a massage can be a great way to transition into the evening. Our beautifully-renovated spa offers massages and facials. Perhaps after your rejuvenating massage, go to the lounge area in the hotel and sit by the fireplace, enjoying a special cocktail or our famous Little Nell hot chocolate. Relax and reflect on the wonderful day's activities. The Wine Bar is another option, featuring the best après party in a cozy venue with Alpine chic decor and an array of seating arrangements. Our DJ spins vinyl records during happy hour on Thursdays through Sundays, while dedicated service, a full menu of wines by the glass and bottle, craft cocktails, light bites and more are available daily."
A True Texas Ranch Looks To Lasso $80 Million,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-global-properties/2024/10/08/a-true-texas-ranch-looks-to-lasso-80-million/,2024-10-08T17:16:51Z,"A century ago, several thousand spectators gathered on the south lawn of the Texas Capitol in Austin to witness the unveiling of a new monument. The bronze monument, titled Texas Cowboy, captures a rider gripping the reins of a rearing horse, one hand raised in the air, clutching a ten-gallon hat -- the pose a perfect snapshot of the ""'yeehaw"" moment. During the ceremony, the governor hailed the monument as a fitting tribute to ""the daring, the dash, and the bravery of the Texas cowboy, knight of the saddle and king of the prairies for so many years."" His words were met with resounding applause. Yet, the cheers weren't for the future -- they were for a nostalgia-filled past.

By 1925, the era of cowboys in Austin was already coming to a gradual end. The arrival of railroads half a century earlier had industrialized the city, diminishing the need for large-scale cattle drives and traditional cowboy roles. By the mid-20th century, many of the sprawling ranches in and around Austin had been sent to the slaughterhouse, with housing developments and commercial spaces getting all the grazing rights. The city's eventual rise as a technology and innovation hub further solidified this transformation.

But the cowboy spirit in Austin hasn't entirely ridden off into the sunset. While actual cattle herders have mostly disappeared from the Texas capital, many self-identified cowboys and cowgirls still roam the city's streets, not by profession but by mindset. What was once defined as an occupation has evolved into a lifestyle, an attitude shaped by core values of individualism, grit, and a deep connection to the land. This cowboy ethos is reflected in everything from Austin locals' love for outdoor pursuits and wide-open spaces to their enduring embrace of Western fashion and rodeo culture.

For those cowboys and cowgirls, however, who want to move beyond attire and attitude, a rare Texas ranch in Dripping Springs, just outside of Austin, is the real deal. At 3.6 square miles (2,367 acres), 7040 West Fitzhugh Road packs more gallop than any other available holding in Greater Austin. The landscape is pure Texas -- rugged and sprawling -- and the 13 longhorns grazing the land are included in the sale.

In the saddle, expect adventure. Riding trails by lakes and creeks cut through hillside fields where wolves, deer and turkeys roam. At the center of the estate lies a hacienda-style home with comforts not typically associated with ranching properties: a 500-bottle wine cellar, an impressive outdoor kitchen and a swimming pool. A short walk from the three-bedroom main residence are barns, pens and riding rings, as well as a guest home. And, naturally, an airplane hangar.

""A ranch of this size and proximity to a major city center is a rarity in any market,"" says broker associate Eric Moreland of Moreland Properties, who holds the listing. ""But even if you could find a property with comparable acreage and the amenities in, say, Los Angeles or Tampa, it wouldn't possess the grit unique to a true Texas ranch that this one has. It wouldn't have that feeling of unbridled freedom.""

Of course, freedom doesn't come free. At $80 million, the listing is one of the most expensive properties in the entire state. Such are the costs of owning one of the few remaining remnants of Austin's cowboy frontier."
6 Financial Matters To Discuss With Older Family Members,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cicelyjones/2024/10/08/6-financial-matters-to-discuss-with-older-family-members/,2024-10-08T17:16:50Z,"Discussing money, health, and mortality with loved ones can be incredibly difficult. Despite the discomfort you may feel, these discussions are critical to build trust and ensure the wellbeing of all the generations in your family. These are the six financial matters you should be discussing with your older family members.

Nobody wants to admit that they didn't plan well, but many Americans are ultimately unprepared for retirement. When I speak with young professionals, many express concerns about their aging parents and whether they may need to support them financially, but few understand what that need looks like because they haven't discussed it.

For older family members, particularly ones who may be dependent on you for support if their funds ran out, it's critical to understand their:

Let's say you're looking at an older family member who has $5,000 in monthly expenses, receives a net income of $3,500 from Social Security, and can sustainably take a net income of $1,000 per month from a $300,000 retirement account.

In this case, we're looking at a $500 shortfall every month, which would likely mean they're depleting their retirement account at an unsustainable rate and risking running out of retirement assets altogether. Since it's a smaller issue today, the remaining family may be able to provide that additional $500 per month to extend the life of the retirement assets or work with the older family member to make some budgeting or investment changes today.

Down the road, $1,500 per month in today's dollars might be a much more substantial burden for the family to try to shoulder.

You'll also want to understand if your older family member has any debts, including mortgages, credit card debts, business loans, personal loans, auto loans and student loans. If they do have debts, you'll want to understand their plans for repayment. If the debts are substantial and have high interest rates, they may want to consider debt consolidation or working with a debt specialist.

One of the biggest mistakes I see among the older generations is a failure to invest according to risk tolerance and financial goals. Either investors will hold onto mostly cash and lose substantial purchasing power to inflation, or they will take on way too much risk for someone who needs their assets for income. Inquire about your family member's asset allocation, income goals, and tolerance for risk to determine if their investment portfolios are acting as intended. If there is no coherent plan or things look off, encourage them to speak with a qualified financial professional.

If your loved one is charitably inclined and can easily pay for their own expenses, implementing charitable giving in their plan can create both tax and estate planning efficiencies. Discussing their favorite charities and causes they are passionate about can also lighten the mood and bring you closer during an otherwise heavy conversation.

As we age, our health can often decline, which drives up healthcare expenses. In the United States, individuals become eligible for Medicare when they turn 65 years old. They also have the option to add additional plans beyond the basic coverage to decrease their financial risk if they do become very sick. Inquire about what your family member has in place to be able to plan for potential costs.

Many people over the age of 65 will also have a need for long-term care coverage, which traditional Medicare does not cover. If a person can't do some basic activities of daily living and they need support every day, that care is called long-term care. It can be incredibly expensive, so try to understand if your loved one has insurance to cover this need or sufficient assets to self-insure. Usually, a surplus of about $400,000 in retirement funds will mean they may be able to self-insure.

Lastly, it's good to know if your loved one has any life insurance in place. If it is permanent coverage, the life insurance could be accessible during their life and provide a tax-free benefit to solve for financial issues they may leave behind when they pass, like burial costs, debts, and other expenses.

Lastly, it's critical to understand if your loved one has done estate planning. At a minimum, they need to have a will in place to dictate their final wishes. However, having a will still subjects many assets to probate. Probate is a lengthy and public legal process whereby the courts dictate how assets are dispersed. It can take years. Probate can be avoided by having a trust in place, putting necessary assets in the name of the trust, and correctly designating beneficiaries on all accounts with a direct beneficiary.

As your loved one ages, it may also be necessary to add in healthcare directives to dictate their medical care preferences and even medical or financial powers of attorney to provide support when they may not be able to make decisions for themselves.

Telling you or another trusted member of your family where to find these documents, along with information needed to access accounts, can make a medical or financial crisis easier to endure.

Discussing these financial matters can help ensure that both you and your older family members are better prepared for the future. It can also provide peace of mind knowing that everyone is on the same page regarding financial planning and management."
ICYMI: Florida Braces For Hurricane Milton : 1A,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2026/01/01/1249798981/zz-1a-bonus,2024-10-08T17:14:23Z,"BRYAN R. SMITH/AFP via Getty Images.

Millions in Florida and across the southeast are bracing for the arrival of Hurricane Milton.

On Monday, the storm was upgraded to Category 4 hurricane over the southern Gulf of Mexico. The storm's expected to landfall on Wednesday suggests a path of movement that includes Tampa and Orlando.

Mass evacuations are underway less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene swamped the coastline. How are those in harm's way preparing for another storm with life-threatening power?"
Biden cancels overseas trip as Milton bears down on Florida; DeSantis tells VP 'it's not about you Kamala',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-cancels-overseas-trip-milton-bears-down-florida-desantis-tells-vp-its-not-about-you-kamala,2024-10-08T17:08:04Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

With a second powerful hurricane in less than two weeks bearing down on Florida, President Biden on Tuesday canceled an upcoming international trip in order to oversee federal storm preparations and response efforts.

As the death toll rises and nearly 200,000 people remain without power or running water over a week and a half after Hurricane Helen tore a path of destruction through the southeast United States, Hurricane Milton - an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm - is on course to slam into Florida on Wednesday.

""Given the projected trajectory and strength of Hurricane Milton, President Biden is postponing his upcoming trip to Germany and Angola in order to oversee preparations for and the response to Hurricane Milton, in addition to the ongoing response to the impacts of Hurricane Helene across the Southeast,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement on Tuesday.

The president was scheduled to leave for Berlin on Thursday, followed by a stop in Angola before returning home on Oct. 15. The trip would have marked Biden's first stop on the African continent during his tenure as president.

EYE OF THE STORM: BACK-TO-BACK HURRICANES IMPACT HARRIS-TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL RACE

Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, the president called Milton a potentially ""devastating"" storm that could be one of the worst to hit Florida in a century. He also urged anyone under an evacuation order to ""evacuate now, now, now.""

""It's a matter of life and death,"" Bien emphasized.

Biden also said he spoke on Monday with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, adding that the conservative governor had been cooperative and that he gave his personal phone number to DeSantis.

When asked about the federal storm response, DeSantis said during a news conference on Monday that ""we have gotten what we need from the feds... the president has approved what we asked for... I'm thankful for that.""

""Everything we've asked for from President Biden, he's approved,"" DeSantis highlighted.

The governor reiterated those comments Tuesday morning in an interview on ""Fox and Friends.""

""Every request that we've made - I've been in contact with the president, I've been in contact with the FEMA director,"" DeSantis highlighted. ""All of our requests have been answered.""

While DeSantis has complimented the president's actions, he has taken aim at Vice President Kamala Harris. The Democrats' presidential nominee on Monday - reacting to reports that the governor had refused to take her calls regarding federal storm efforts - described him as ""selfish.""

When asked about the dispute, DeSantis argued in his ""Fox and Friends"" interview that ""my focus has not been on dealing with Kamala Harris. I saw the news report. I didn't know that she tried to contact me. But I'd also say it's not about you, Kamala. It's about the people of Florida. My focus is exactly where it should be.""

""I've worked on these Hurricanes under both President Trump and President Biden. Neither of them ever tried to politicize it. She's never called on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president until apparently now. Why all of a sudden is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown any interest in the past? We know it's because of politics. We know it's because of her campaign. I have zero time to entertain these political games,"" DeSantis charged.

The war of words appeared to be triggered by reports from NBC and later ABC News on Monday afternoon that the Florida governor was not taking calls from Harris regarding storm recovery efforts, citing unnamed aides to the governor who said the calls seemed political in nature.

When asked a couple of hours later, DeSantis said he was not aware Harris was trying to reach him.

""I didn't know that she had called. I'm not sure who they called. They didn't call me,"" he said. ""It wasn't anything that anybody in my office did, in terms of saying it was political.""

Speaking around the same time, as she departed the nation's capital for New York, the vice president took aim at DeSantis.

""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations...is just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris charged. ""It is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first.""

However, DeSantis, pushing back in his Fox News interview, argued that ""Harris is not even in the chain of command. She has no role in this. The idea that I should be...worrying about her when I'm focused on the task at hand is quite frankly absurd.""

When asked if his vice president has been helpful as the federal government deals with back-to-back dangerous hurricanes, Biden nodded and told reporters ""yes.""

Harris, speaking on Tuesday on the popular daytime program ""The View,"" said ""I have called and talked with, in the course of this crisis, this most recent crisis, with Democrat and Republican governors.... So, obviously, this is not an issue that is about partisanship or politics for certain leaders, but maybe it's for others.""

With four weeks to go until Election Day in November and Harris and former President Donald Trump locked in a bitter margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene -- North Carolina and Georgia -- among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election - the politics of federal disaster relief are once again front and center on the campaign trail.

Trump, for a week and a half, has been repeatedly attacking Biden and Harris over the federal response to Hurricane Helene, and making unproven claims.

On Monday, Harris clapped back, accusing Trump of pushing ""a lot of mis and disinformation.""

Mayorkas rips 'politicized' atmosphere over FEMA disaster response amid GOP criticism: 'It sows distrust',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayorkas-rips-politicized-atmosphere-over-fema-disaster-response-amid-gop-criticism-it-sows-distrust,2024-10-08T17:07:54Z,"Lawrence Jones views the devastation from Hurricane Helene.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who has been a political lightning rod for controversy during the Biden-Harris administration, on Monday pushed back against what he claimed was ""intentionally false information"" about the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) work.

""I have not seen it ever before at this level,"" he said on MSNBC, speaking to host Jen Psaki. ""You and I both remember a time when an extreme weather event, a natural disaster, actually brought people together. Now, unfortunately, tragically, quite frankly, it is politicized.""

Both DHS and FEMA have been under fire over their response to Hurricane Helene, with claims that it has diverted resources to illegal immigrants, has been delayed in its response, and is out of money.

SPEAKER JOHNSON RIPS 'LACK OF LEADERSHIP' IN BIDEN ADMIN'S HELENE RESPONSE: 'ALARMED AND DISAPPOINTED'

Much of the controversy was triggered last week when Mayorkas said FEMA ""does not have the funds to make it through the season."" He went on to say that the agency has the money for ""immediate needs"" but is concerned about not having a stable supply of funding. Congress recently freed up $20 billion for the disaster fund, but officials have called on Congress to pass a supplemental spending bill.

Critics quickly pointed to FEMA's role in distributing more than $650 million in funds to help illegal immigrants as part of its Shelter and Services Program (SSP). Former President Trump recently accused the Biden administration of stealing FEMA money ""for their illegal immigrants.""

However, the Biden administration has noted that that funding, which comes from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and is congressionally appropriated for grants to local governments and nonprofits, is entirely separate from the significantly larger Disaster Relief Fund.

""No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,"" FEMA said in a release this week.

HURRICANE HELENE: NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS FIGHT FOR THEIR SURVIVAL AS BASIC GOODS BECOME SCARCE

It has still faced questions from some Republican senators about whether its ""entanglement"" in the border crisis has affected its operational readiness.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., meanwhile, told Fox News Digital last week that the administration has ""failed in that response.""

""They are scrambling to cover their egregious errors and mistakes. And there's an effort to blame others or blame circumstances when this is just purely a lack of leadership and response,"" the speaker said.

FEMA also faced backlash last week after its unearthed emergency management ""equity"" blueprint went viral. The number one goal listed in the Biden-Harris agency's priorities is to ""instill equity as a foundation of emergency management.""

According to FEMA's plan, ""Diversity, equity, and inclusion cannot be optional.""

This week, FEMA has been pushing back against claims that FEMA grants have to be repaid, that it is restricting airspace for rescue and recovery operations, and that it is distributing aid based on demographic characteristics. It has published a fact sheet to check some of those claims.

Mayorkas, who was impeached by the Republican-led House this year, on Monday again stressed that there is help available for those who need it, and warned of the effects of misinformation.

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

""What happens is the people who are victimized by the natural disaster are the ones who will suffer,"" he said. ""It sows distrust in their government, and therefore they don't seek the help that they truly need.""

""We have funds to put in their pockets to be able to help them address immediate needs. These individuals are not seeking that relief because of the disinformation, the intentionally false information they are receiving.""

He also said the misinformation hurts the workforce.

""These are individuals who are putting their lives on the line to search and rescue for victims of Hurricane Helene, a hurricane of historic magnitude,"" he said. ""It is very sad.""

Critics have pointed to his handling of the historic crisis at the southern border, including his fueling of a since-debunked controversy about Border Patrol agents on horseback allegedly mistreating Haitian migrants, when judging his record."
Meet The Eclipse Chasers On The World's Most Remote Island,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/10/08/meet-the-eclipse-chasers-on-the-worlds-most-remote-island/,2024-10-08T17:05:53Z,"Last Wednesday's ""ring of fire"" was visible from Easter Island, the world's most remote landmass, 1,200 miles from the next.

The first solar eclipse since April 8's total solar eclipse across North America, seen by 50 million, just a few hundred dedicated eclipse chasers saw this one. It triggered clickbait articles with shock headlines like ""Wednesday's eclipse might be the worst ever,"" the evidence being that not many people would see it. Just 175,000 lived within the path of this one, but that's normal. It was April 8 that was the outlier.

The general public -- and almost all journalists -- do not understand eclipses, but what really confuses both are eclipse chasers. Like me.

I have seen eight total eclipses and two ""rings of fire"" and what I don't know about eclipses and eclipse chasers is not worth knowing. We have a reputation for being wealthy jet-setters, hedonists who spend big just to glimpse the infinite for a few minutes as the moon perfectly aligns with the sun in exotic locations. We have lazy journalists to thank for that, for we are many and varied.

Last week, many of us were on Easter Island to watch an annular solar eclipse -- a ""ring of fire"" -- which happens when a distant, smaller-looking moon crosses the sun's center, but can't cover all of it. The peak ""ring"" event lasted under six minutes. It was spell-binding. Not as impactful as a total solar eclipse, but incredibly beautiful. What I also got to do is to spend some time with some of the world's most committed eclipse chasers.

""What I absolutely love about eclipse trips is that there are people you only ever meet somewhere obscure on the other side of the world,"" said Mike Frost, astronomer-guide with Astro Trails. ""I have good friends I've met in India, Indonesia, Svalbard and many other places, and we know we'll probably meet again somewhere else in the world.""

However, when it comes to eclipse day, things get serious. ""Some people like to go away, set up their equipment, and not be bothered by everybody else,"" says Frost. ""But for many others, conviviality is part of the fun.""

It's actually possible to do both.

Patrick Poitevin and his partner Clare Gardner enjoyed the eclipse with the locals in Hanga Roa. Poitevin has seen a whopping 25 totals and 12 ""ring of fire"" eclipses. ""It was perfect! We walked down to the beach with our gear, set up our two telescopes just behind the moai and out of the wind,"" he said. ""Clare could see annularity a few minutes before the time predicted."" That was a surprise, though Poitevin knew his view of the eclipse through an H-alpha telescope meant it would be extended. Eclipses are said to begin when the moon crosses the sun's disk, its photosphere, but through an H-alpha telescope, the observer sees the chromosphere, so the eclipse always starts slightly earlier. ""Exactly where the eclipse started, there was a layer of prominences,"" he said.

Prominences are filaments of plasma and magnetic field extending from the sun, which right now -- close to solar maximum -- are a daily sight in H-alpha. ""I was expecting a minute and a half or so for chromosphere thickness, but it was quite a bit earlier with that layer of prominences."" Poitevin's latter analysis revealed that thanks to the prominences, for him, the partial eclipse began 4 minutes and 7 seconds before the moon began to cross the photosphere.

Poitevin and Greenwood have plans to see and study 2025's two partial solar eclipses in either the U.K. or Iceland and then Tahiti.

The latter destination may signal that eclipse chasing is indeed about luxury travel to exotic locations, but that's missing the point. Most chasers travel modestly, make financial sacrifices and overcome personal challenges to experience an eclipse. Indeed, that's the whole point. Meet Mandie Adams, from Southend-on-Sea, England -- author of the hair-raising ""Chasing the Eclipse & Other Adventures"" (and Miss April in the Dull Mens Club calendar) -- who's traveled to 14 totals with her trusty stuffed companion Dinky Doo. Remarkably, last week's eclipse was her second trip to Easter Island, but this one acted as closure on her last, a disastrous camping trip with bad weather and a missing festival organizer.

""There were worms in the water, no food, no toilets and no showers. We were stranded on the side of a volcano,"" she said. ""Locals were taking us in because they felt so sorry for us."" Despite the hardships, Adams enjoyed the 2010 eclipse. ""The eclipse itself was amazing -- it was the only part of the trip that went well,"" she said. That and her belly dancing afterward, she added.

There was no belly dancing 14 years later, but unlike last time, she got to see the island's incredible moai and properly explored the island. ""Arriving at the airport the day before this eclipse was surprisingly emotional -- all the bad memories came flooding back,"" she said.

In my group of 59 people, I met wealthy surgeons and business owners. I met teachers. I met retired people on their first post-work trip. I met people who had never traveled nor seen an eclipse, just to see what the fuss was about. Some were avid collectors who ticked off eclipses, but they also collected countries, stamps, badges, piers, Lego, and even Stonehenge replicas. Every one one of them -- from all walks of life from across the globe -- treated the event with the reverence it deserved, but they had fun.

While some had telescopes, others projected the eclipse through slotted spoons hastily purchased in Santiago supermarkets to throw ringlet shadows on the floor. They all had something in common. They shared the event, memories of past events and plans for future trips. Future plans mostly came with the qualifier ""if I can afford it."" As one chaser told me, you buy a new car or you travel to see an eclipse. Not both.

As I boarded the five-hour flight back to Chile, I pondered on the confusing power of an eclipse. They're just moon shadows and really only mean something because people make them matter. Eclipse chasing - or, technically, ""eclipse intercepting,"" as Frost calls the hobby -- is, in practice, as much a social as a scientific event. Eclipse chasers that there is a place in the world, every six months or so, where they can go and be part of something, meet people from across the world that they have something in common with.

Back in London a few days later, I went to see a huge moai called ""The Stolen One"" in the British Museum and met up with another chaser, Lesley Bound, a veteran of nine totals and a collector of eclipse stamps, who summed up eclipse chasing perfectly. A reporter asked her about the distance and effort involved in eclipse chasing and asked ""isn't it an expensive hobby?"" Bound replied, simply: ""I could play golf instead.""

Eclipse chasing proves you can go anywhere, do anything and be part of an unlikely community. You just need to keep on asking the same question: when is the next eclipse?"
This Sleek Golf Rangefinder Quickly Goes The Distance,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottkramer/2024/10/08/this-sleek-golf-rangefinder-quickly-goes-the-distance/,2024-10-08T17:05:45Z,"My golf bag typically stores 14 clubs, a dozen balls, some tees, ball markers, gloves and a couple of pullovers. But one thing you will never find in there: A rangefinder. Having played golf since age five, my father instilled in me the importance of being able to judge shot distances by eye. And as I've told many doubters before - and proceeded to prove it - I'm pretty sure I'm accurate within three yards for most shots. My other general issue with using rangefinders: I shake involuntarily. Like really bad. Of the many handheld rangefinders I've tested before, I just cannot lock in on the target because of the shakes.

But regardless, I opted to try out the new Blue Tees Golf Series 4 Ultra model, which sells for $299 - and provide a non-biased review. Billed as the company's most advanced laser model ever, it features several impressive technologies, including an OLED display, active distance tracking, brightness control, auto-depth filter, pulse vibration when it finds the distance, a magnetic strip to clasp to a golf cart frame, 1,200-yard range, weather-resistant body, and a slope switch that you can toggle back and forth depending on if you are playing in a tournament that doesn't allow slope distance factoring. When you have slope on, the device takes into account elevation changes on a hole and tells you how long your shot is really going to play - rather than just provide the true distance. Sort of like having a caddie.

All of this is great. But the real test comes in how fast and accurate the distance it provides is. And this device features something called flag lock capability up to 350 yards away. That means using its automatic depth ability, it can tell you instantly how far the pin is once you get it in frame. Even with my shakes, it seemed to work for me but not to the point I could call it reliable. It kept locking in on a number that seemed right, but not to the point I was willing to swing until I was able to manually eye the distance. Usually, the Blue Tees number was close to what I thought was the true number. Again, in this case, don't use my experience as your barometer. I'm sure this works accurately for most everyone else. In fact, I had my friend test it out and he said it worked fine. I also tested it against the GPS screen in a cart, and it was relatively consistent.

I love the sleek black look of this device, and the feel. It's lightweight, yet has enough substance in your hands while you're using it. Trust me, there are ultra-light models out there from other brands that I think are too lightweight. You need to have some heft to it, or else the average person can easily shake it around. And this model seems just right. This one also comes with three batteries - one to use immediately and the other two as replacements. And I'm happy the viewfinder is adjustable for brightness, because the red and green markers in the viewfinder can be a little visually jarring when you first hold it up to your eyes. It also comes with a nice case and carabiner clip so you can easily hang it from the towel hook on your golf bag."

Show more Show less

There are factors beyond your driving experience, address and occupation that affect the price you pay for car insurance. And one of them is the insurance group that your vehicle belongs to. Here's everything you need to know about car insurance groups and how they work.

How do car insurance groups affect your premiums?

The price you pay for motor cover reflects how much risk your insurer believes you pose. The higher your risk, the more likely it is you'll make a claim and cost them money. Higher risk policyholders therefore, quite logically, pay more for cover than lower risk policyholders.

Insurers use information about you and your vehicle to assess your risk. For example, people with less experience on the roads are statistically more likely to be involved in collisions and to file claims. Similarly, policyholders in certain parts of the country are more likely to have their vehicles vandalised or stolen.

While these factors about you and your personal circumstances form a large part of your risk profile, your vehicle matters too. Its power, value and security dictate how likely it is to be involved in an accident or stolen.

Rather than creating a risk profile for every individual make and model, insurers assign cars to a group of vehicles with a similar risk profile, and your insurer factors this 'group' rating into their quote.

Thatcham Research, which has been in charge of the 50-group system for the last 25 years, is replacing it with a data-driven model that looks at five 'insurability' assessments. This Vehicle Risk Rating System (VRRS) will run alongside the current system before taking full effect in in 2026.

VRRS uses real-world data to reflect each vehicle's risk to insurers and, unlike the 50-group system, it will dynamically change according to data insights from the insurance industry itself.

VRRS is based around five risk assessments: Performance, Damageability, Repairability, Safety, and Security. You can read more about the change on this page - look for the 8 October 2024 update.

How do car insurance groups work?

Every car in the UK falls into one of 50 car insurance groups.

Cars in group 1, such as the Volkswagen Up, are the cheapest to insure. Cover gets more expensive as you move up through the groups. Those in group 50, such as the current top model Range Rovers, are the most expensive to insure (although, as stated, insurers also take the driver's circumstances and attributes into account).

The following table shows two of the cars located in each of the groups from 1 to 10.

How are groupings determined?

A vehicle's grouping is determined by a panel that includes the Association of British Insurers (ABI), Thatcham Research and the Lloyd's of London Market Association. They assess the vehicle across a range of eight categories to determine its grouping:

Damage and parts costs Repair costs and times New car values Parts prices Car performance Safety Bumper compatibility Car security

These address the following points:

Performance - the vehicle's top speed and rate of acceleration determine how fast it can go and how quickly it can go from standing or low speed to high speed. Vehicles with higher top speeds and faster acceleration tend to be placed in higher car insurance groups than those with lower top speeds and slower acceleration Safety - the vehicle's safety features, such as Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) and collision warning technology, reduce the likelihood of it being involved in an accident. Those with the most and latest safety features tend to be grouped lower than those lacking in safety features. Also, the structure and placement of your vehicle's front and rear bumpers will determine how it fares in a collision, and has an effect on its grouping Value - the higher a vehicle's value, the more an insurer potentially must pay out in the event of a total write-off. New cars and higher value cars can make your insurance more expensive as their value partly determines their grouping Security - vehicles with advanced security features are more difficult to steal and are therefore less likely to be the subject of an insurance claim. For this reason, better security features push a vehicle further down the 50 insurance groups and result in cheaper cover Parts and repairs - vehicles with parts that are expensive to repair or replace, or those that tend to take more man-hours to repair, are most likely found in the higher groups because they increase the cost of a potential pay-out. By contrast, those with cheap parts and short repair times benefit from cheaper insurance.

What are the cheapest cars to insure?

If driving from A to B in the cheapest way possible is your main objective as a road-user, you'll need to select a car that falls into the first 10 insurance groups.

These range from the Fiat Panda, Vauxhall Corsa, and Volkswagen Up which are all in group one, through to the Audi A1 hatchback, Fiat Punto Evo and Ford Ks Plus Active in group 10.

While a whole range of other factors will influence your car insurance premiums, as a rule of thumb the lower the car insurance group - even within the first 10 groups - the cheaper it will be to insure.

Are electric cars included in car insurance groups?

Electric cars are treated no differently when it comes to being categorised into car insurance groups. Each will fall into one of the 50 according to the specifications outlined above.

Even though EVs are deemed to be safe and better for the environment, they can feature in higher groups compared to diesel and petrol cars of the same class and size.

This is partly down to the fact that, while numbers are rising, EVs are still in their relative infancy. This means that carrying out repairs or finding replacement parts - such as their large batteries - can be more difficult than with a standard fuel-powered car, making them more expensive to insure.

Can I change my car insurance group?

Although you can make your vehicle more secure and more powerful, doing so won't change its insurance grouping. However, these kinds of modifications should be disclosed to your insurer and could have an effect on your premiums - good or bad.

Making your vehicle more secure with a Thatcham-approved security device, for example, could save you some money on your insurance. Increasing your car's top speed, however, could have the opposite effect.

The main use of insurance groupings is for when you are considering a car purchase - the dealer or manufacturer's product information will specify. Once you know the group, you can get a sense of how much your insurance premium is going to be affected by your decision.

Clearly, aiming for a car in a low group will help out if you as a driver are deemed to be a high risk insurance proposition, as the perceived low risk attached to the car won't bump up your premiums further.

And if you see that your preferred car is up there in the group 30s and 40s, at least you know what to expect when you run a quotation.

How can I cut the cost of car insurance?

In addition to opting for a vehicle in a low car insurance group, there are other ways of keeping the cost of your car insurance down. The first one is not to simply accept your current car insurer's renewal quote.

Although from January this year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) ruled that insurers will no longer be allowed to charge existing customers more for their renewal than they'd charge a new customer for the equivalent policy, you may still be able to get a better deal at a different insurer. And it costs nothing to check on a comparison website.

If it's feasible, paying your premium upfront rather than in monthly instalments will also result in a saving, since insurers charge interest on what is essentially a loan you take out when you choose to spread the premium payments.

Increasing the amount you're willing to pay in voluntary excess towards the cost of any claim you make can also drive down premiums. Just bear in mind that this is on top of your policy's compulsory excess, and the total excess you pay should always be affordable.

Kamala Harris's 'joy' is quietly turning to panic for Democrats,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-harriss-joy-quietly-turning-panic-democrats,2024-10-08T16:59:02Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In the days after Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential election to be replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris, there was real joy among Democrats across the country. That was not just a made-up media story, I saw it, but with less than a month to go, the joy is gone and a quiet panic is setting in.

In the first week of August I was, appropriately enough, in Harrisburg, Pa. and Democrats I spoke to were ebullient and effervescent at the change atop the ticket. One woman told me of calling her mother to celebrate together the chance at a Black female president.

Other left-leaning voters told me that they didn't love how Biden had been shown the door but that they felt Harris could turn the race around and take down Donald Trump. For about a month, it sure looked that way.

5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM KAMALA HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

In San Francisco, most voters I spoke to, red and blue alike, felt like Harris was likely to win, that the Democrats' stalled campaign had called AAA, gotten a jump, and was back on the road.

Harris had erased the lead Trump had over Biden, quickly eclipsing him as the frontrunner and much like a new restaurant opening in a small town, voters were eager to give her a try.

While Republicans and some in the media were frustrated by her unwillingness to do traditional interviews or hold so much as one press conference, her arrogant advisers smirked and said basically, ""So what? She's winning.""

Well, she's not winning anymore, and with her back against the wall appeared on ""60 Minutes"" this week, showing voters the real reason why she is camera shy when it comes to tough questions.

Asked if she and the Biden administration had lost America's influence with our Middle East ally Israel, the veep once again proved herself to be a walking, talking salad bar, here is what she had to say:

""Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.""

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

The most generous interpretation of this odd assemblage of verbiage is that she is saying, ""we're trying,"" the more likely one is that she has no idea what she is talking about.

Over the past two weeks in my travels, it has been increasingly difficult to engage Democrats about the presidential race, much like a fan whose team has dropped a few playoff games and who is avoiding the sports page, they just don't want to talk about it.

As one lifelong Democrat in Ohio who I did get to talk to put it, ""I don't know, she's just kind of there.""

It is hard to say exactly when the shine started wearing off the Harris penny, when joy gave way to frustration, but the failure of the Teamsters to endorse her, and the massive union's internal polling showing Trump with a lead seems significant.

It was only after that, that I started hearing Democrats uttering words that seemed unthinkable back in August, namely, ""Maybe we should have stuck with Biden."" Ouch.

Biden himself even joked about it at a press conference, something he is at least still capable of, quipping ""I'm back in.""

Harris spokespeople are busy trying to talk Democratic voters down off the bridge, they insist she still leads in the polling averages, she has a war chest worth more than Fort Knox, and a ground game that Trump can only envy.

These points are all true, and the latter may prove decisive. The Harris movement may be Astroturf and not grassroots, much like her crowning as the nominee, but those busloads of supporters in matching teachers' union T-shirts are the same machine that gets out the vote.

But still, there is no mistaking that the thrill is gone.

It is not clear what Harris can do to reverse the clear trends favoring Trump today, ""60 Minutes"" wasn't it, and her appearances on podcasts, late night shows, and ""The View"" make her look like she is pitching a new Rom Com, not running for president of the United States.

The only answer left may be for Harris to make this fight uglier and dirtier as the clock runs out. If the joy is gone, and it is, the only thing left to do may well be to rage and rage, against the dying of the light."
Confident Whoopi Goldberg introduces Kamala Harris on 'The View' as the 'next President of the United States',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/confident-whoopi-goldberg-introduces-kamala-harris-the-view-next-president-united-states,2024-10-08T16:58:39Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with 'The View' on Tuesday for her first live interview since accepting the Democratic nomination for president.

""The View"" co-host Whoopi Goldberg introduced Vice President Kamala Harris as the ""next President of the United States"" on Tuesday in her first appearance on the talk show since becoming the Democratic nominee.

""Twenty-eight days to go until the election, so we are thrilled that joining us right now, for her very first talk show appearance and live TV interview since accepting the Democratic presidential nomination, please welcome back, the next president of the United States,"" Goldberg said as Harris walked out to Beyonce's song, ""Freedom.""

Harris scheduled interviews on ""The View,"" ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" and with radio host Howard Stern on Tuesday, who have all expressed open support for Harris or Democrats in general.

After the interview, Goldberg told her co-hosts she was ""basking in the light"" of Harris.

""It's pretty remarkable, I mean I remember when Obama was running and my mother said to me, 'never in my lifetime thought I would ever see a Black man run and win,'"" Goldberg said, before referencing Donald Trump's ""Black jobs"" comment.

""I vote we put this woman into that Black job,"" she declared.

Co-host Ana Navarro, a Republican who has supported Democratic candidates since 2016 and hosted night two of the Democratic National Convention, asked Harris bluntly at the end of the interview if she would come back on the show ""when"" she's elected president.

Harris told the co-hosts she would.

Harris told the hosts she couldn't think of anything that she would have done differently than Biden in the last four years when pressed by Hostin.

""If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?"" Hostin asked.

Harris responded, ""there is not a thing that comes to mind."""
"As Hurricane Milton threatens Florida, food and drink essentials for hunkering down during the storm",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/hurricane-milton-threatens-florida-food-drink-essentials-hunkering-down-storm,2024-10-08T16:58:32Z,"St. Petersburg resident Danielle Jensen joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss how she and her family were impacted by Hurricane Helene as Hurricane Milton barrels toward the Florida coast.

With Hurricane Milton expected to impact Florida, residents are being urged to prepare.

Milton is forecast to make landfall as a major hurricane along Florida's Gulf Coast early on Thursday. There are some recommended food and drink items that every household should have during and after a storm.

Read on for five items that FEMA and other organizations suggest people have at home before a storm approaches.

CELEBRITY CHEF JOSE ANDRES HELPS SOUTHEAST RECOVER FROM HURRICANE HELENE

Every home should have at least one gallon of water, per person, per day, on hand during an emergency, FEMA, the Florida Division of Emergency Management and the American Red Cross' online pamphlets say.

""Consider storing at least a two-week supply of water for each member of your family. If you are unable to store this quantity, store as much as you can,"" FEMA and the Red Cross advise.

Under normal circumstances, a person needs half a gallon of water per day, they said -- but nursing mothers, children and those living in hot environments need even more.

""To prepare the safest and most reliable emergency supply of water, it is recommended that you purchase commercially bottled water. Keep bottled water in its original container, and do not open it until you need to use it,"" FEMA and the Red Cross said.

'IS IT SAFE TO DRINK TAP WATER?': ASK A DOCTOR

When a water supply runs low, do not ration water, publications by those agencies note.

""Drink the amount you need today and try to find more for tomorrow.""

Hidden sources of water in a person's home include a ""hot water tank, pipes and ice cubes.""

""You should not use water from toilet flush tanks or bowls, radiators, waterbeds or swimming pools/spas,"" FEMA and the American Red Cross advise.

Canned foods are especially useful as they often have a long shelf life and can typically be eaten straight from the can without cooking, FEMA and the American Red Cross said.

15 EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS SUPPLIES EVERYONE SHOULD CONSIDER GETTING

""Canned food can be eaten right out of the can. If you heat it in the can, be sure to open the can and remove the label before heating,"" FEMA and the Red Cross said.

Do not eat food from a can that is dented or swelling.

Instead, throw these products away, the organizations recommend.

At minimum, a person should seek to have a three-day supply of food at home in case of an emergency, FEMA and the Red Cross said.

AS HUNGER NUMBERS INCREASE, FOOD PANTRIES IN AMERICA MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER

Also, it's advised to have a manual can opener and disposable utensils on hand.

Protein options that do not require refrigeration are another great thing to have on hand during a storm.

Florida's Division of Emergency Management recommends a seven-day supply of ""nonperishable packaged or canned foods and beverages.""

These include peanut butter (and other nut butters), canned tuna, canned turkey, canned chicken, nuts and jerky, according to the website for the Houston Food Bank Nutrition Education Department.

Protein helps a person feel full and reduces a person's appetite - all while boosting metabolism, according to the website Healthline.

""As for what types of food to include, take into consideration dietary restrictions, allergies and food preferences,"" Stephanie Fox, a spokesperson for the Red Cross, told Fox News Digital.

Rather than go out and buy gallons of milk before a storm, stock up instead on shelf-stable varieties, the Houston Food Bank said.

Both dairy milk and milk alternatives (including almond, rice and soy) have shelf-stable versions.

Shelf-stable milk is pasteurized and packaged differently than other types of milk, according to the website for Horizon Organic, a milk producer.

""Shelf-stable milks are safe to store at room temperature, so you can keep them in the pantry.""

""With UHT pasteurization and airtight, no-light packaging, our shelf-stable milks are safe to store at room temperature, so you can keep them in the pantry,"" Horizon Organic said.

""UHT pasteurization"" is a process that uses very high temperatures to kill bacteria, it said.

Still, just like typical milk, these products do expire and should be consumed before the best-by date, it said.

Baby food, powdered formula and special dietary needs for the elderly are important to consider when preparing for a weather diaster, said Fox from the Red Cross.

It is also good to have food on hand that people enjoy eating.

""Familiar foods are important. They lift morale and give [people] a feeling of security in times of stress,"" FEMA and the Red Cross said.

""Try to include foods that they will enjoy and that are also high in calories and nutrition. Foods that require no refrigeration, water, special preparation or cooking are best.""

Eric Adams Indictment: Here Are All Of The Investigations Into His Administration As Top Officials Resign,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2024/10/08/eric-adams-indictment-here-are-all-of-the-investigations-into-his-administration-as-top-officials-resign/,2024-10-08T16:57:08Z,"As Eric Adams faces allegations of illegally soliciting donations for his campaign, earlier probes into other high-ranking officials of his administration allowed investigators to close in on the New York City mayor amid broad federal scrutiny of the city's government.

Prosecutor Hagan Cordell reportedly said last week it is ""quite likely"" Adams will face unspecified additional charges as there are ""several related investigations here.""

Eric Ulrich, New York City's former buildings commissioner under Adams, was indicted last year on 16 counts of bribery, conspiracy and filing false financial information. Ulrich allegedly used his position to provide access to city officials and favors for $150,000 in cash and other gifts, which included season tickets to the New York Mets and discounts on real estate, according to an indictment. He has denied the claims and pleaded not guilty. Dwayne Montgomery, a former police inspector and colleague of Adams', pleaded guilty in February to a conspiracy charge alleging he funneled tens of thousands of illegal funds to Adams' 2021 campaign.

New York City Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan said Monday he would resign by January, citing personal reasons. Lisa Zornberg, Adams' chief legal counsel, resigned earlier this month after saying she could ""no longer effectively serve in my position."" Neither Vasan nor Zornberg indicated their resignations were because of any ongoing investigation.

Adams, 64, was indicted on five charges alleging he sought out and accepted illegal contributions to his 2021 mayoral campaign. Prosecutors claim Adams received gifts from the Turkish government in exchange for speeding up the process of building a high-rise consulate building for Turkey. Adams also defrauded the city by using donations from straw donors -- those who illegally use someone else's funds to make a political contribution -- to receive more than $10 million in matching funds, according to the indictment. Earlier Thursday, federal agents searched Adams' residence at Gracie Mansion and seized some of his electronic devices, according to the Times. FBI agents first seized some of Adams' devices in November, though details of the agency's investigation were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear whether the probe was targeting Adams. Amid an investigation into Adams and other city officials, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., called for Adams to resign because she does ""not see how [he] can continue governing New York City."" In a video statement, Adams claimed the charges are ""entirely false, based on lies,"" and dismissed calls for his resignation."
Pharrell wanted to tell his story through Legos -- here's why,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5140107/pharrell-williams-legos-piece-by-piece,2024-10-08T16:55:51Z,"Though it may seem like a strange choice on the surface, it felt natural for the musician Pharrell Williams to tell his life story through Legos. ""My earliest memories were the Lego sets that my parents would get me when I was really, really, really young,"" he says. ""Whether you actually really build what the set is all about or you're just putting pieces together ... it's just magical.""

As a kid, Pharrell lived in the Atlantis Apartments, a densely populated public housing complex in Virginia Beach, Va. Outsiders were afraid to go into his neighborhood, but for Pharrell, the place was special, teeming with talent and fun.

""There were a lot of athletes that were incredibly gifted, a lot of artists that were incredibly gifted,"" he says. ""You know, you talk about carbon? ... That heat, that pressure, that time produced a lot of diamonds.""

The new animated film, Piece By Piece, uses Legos to trace Pharrell's early life as a boy fueled by creativity and drawn to music. Directed by Academy Award-winner Morgan Neville, the unusual biopic charts Pharrell's trajectory to becoming a Grammy-winning songwriter, performer and producer who's collaborated with artists like Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Britney Spears and Beyoncé. Perhaps a story as colorful as his can only be told in such a flamboyant way.

On his synesthesia, which causes him to see color when he hears music

If you take it back to when you were born, all of your nerve endings -- sight, sound, smell, taste, feeling -- they were all connected. And then when you turn 1, those nerve endings, they prune. And sometimes some of them stay connected. And the ones that stay connected give you synesthesia. And when they're connected, they send ghost images and ghost information to the different parts of the brain. And so you end up ""hearing"" a color or ""seeing"" a sound.

On writing ""Milkshake,"" sung by Kelis

The shapes [I see] are hard for me to explain, but it sort of zig zags. And those synth lines are yellow and brown for me. ... And the yellow it goes from bright to mustard, marigold, and then there is just very stark brown. ...

That song came from a trip that I went to in Brazil, and I just, like, lost my mind. I'd never seen so many beautiful women. They were just everywhere. And forgive the objectification, when I say that. But that was the impression that it made on my mind at that time, I don't know, 20 years ago. ... I'd never seen anything like that. Where am I? And if you could put that energy and feeling if that could be sort of transmuted [into a song]... that was the attempt.

On writing a song for Prince that he rejected

He was different. He was one of those people that, like, he's a musical savant. There's not an instrument he couldn't pick up and play. He's a brilliant writer. Vocally, he's incredible. He was an incredible performer and he wrote and produced for so many people. ... [He was] like, ""Do you own or your masters? If you don't own your masters, we can't work together."" ... I never heard anyone say that before. Then his other thing was he wanted to sort of talk about religion. And I was like, interesting. And now I do own all of my master recordings. And I'd be happy to square off in a conversation about the business of religion versus the necessity of faith.

On his falsetto singing voice

I had a problem with my voice for many, many, many years because I didn't feel like I had found my voice. I always thought that my tone sounded like Mickey Mouse. The next time you listen to ""Frontin',"" picture Mickey Mouse -- you can't unsee it.

On writing ""Happy""

The song is a sarcastic answer ... for a rhetorical question: How do you make a song about someone so happy that nothing can bring them down? ... When Despicable Me 2 came out [the studio] couldn't get it to work [on the] radio because it was alien. It didn't sound like anything else. ... [Radio] didn't play it until we did the video six months later, when the song was included on a DVD ... and there was a budget to do a video for the song. Since we loved it as a companion piece to sell the DVD.

On why being in water helps him write music

When you're in the shower, you know, and the water's just consistently running and it creates an effect of white noise. And that's the reason why you can think clearly when you shower. ... Ideas come. Or sometimes people sing in the shower - that's the reason why they do it is because that consistent noise, that white noise is particularly freeing to the part of your mind that wants to just iterate and not be environmentally distracted. So running water, being near water, being in water, a bath, a pool, seeing the ocean, standing in the shower, washing my hands in the sink. It does it for me."
A new foreign policy dividing line emerges in Republican politics,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-foreign-policy-dividing-line-emerges-republican-politics-rcna174507,2024-10-08T16:49:53Z,"As Donald Trump and JD Vance celebrate Hungary's Viktor Orbán, a growing number of Republican senators are pushing back in the opposite direction.

In last month's presidential debate, Kamala Harris bested her Republican rival on a variety of fronts, but one point seemed especially brutal. ""I have traveled the world as vice president of the United States,"" the Democratic nominee said, ""and world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump.""

Given a chance to respond, Trump clung to a curious defense. ""Let me just tell you about world leaders,"" he replied. ""Viktor Orbán, one of the most respected men -- they call him a strongman. He's a tough person. Smart. Prime minister of Hungary.""

In other words, the former president wanted to present proof that he wasn't an international laughingstock, and he immediately touted the support he's received from Orbán -- a Russia-aligned leader who's aggressively chipped away at Hungary's democracy.

Trump's rhetoric was not, however, surprising: The Republican has spent months turning to Orbán for validation, publicly celebrating him, having private conversations with the Hungarian, and even welcoming Orbán to Mar-a-Lago. The more the prime minister's authoritarian takeover of his country generated international outrage, the more Trump extended his over-the-top support to the prime minister.

His running mate has made similar comments. As recently as May, for example, Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio appeared on CBS and said the United States ""could learn from"" Orbán when it comes to targeting universities. (It fell to ""Face the Nation"" host Margaret Brennan to remind the senator that the Hungarian strongman has ""seized control of state universities"" and put them under the control of foundations run by his allies.)

But as unsettling as the GOP ticket's embrace of Orbán is, it would be a mistake to assume the entirety of the party is aligned with the prime minister. The Hill reported over the weekend:

The five Republican signatories were Arkansas' John Boozman, Maine's Susan Collins, Texas' John Cornyn, North Dakota's John Hoeven, and Kansas' Jerry Moran.

The joint statement was no doubt well received by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who's gone to extraordinary lengths to try to drag his party away from Orbán.

It was five months ago, for example, when the Kentucky Republican, still hoping to salvage what remains of the GOP's traditional foreign policy vision, condemned Orbán and urged fellow conservatives to reject the far-right strongman. McConnell pushed the same line in July, reminding his party that Orbán is ""completely in bed with the Chinese and the Russians.""

A few weeks ago, the Senate Republican reiterated the message, declaring, ""I've spoken before about Hungary's decadelong drift into the orbit of the West's most determined adversaries. It's an alarming trend. And nobody -- certainly not the American conservatives who increasingly form a cult of personality around Prime Minister Viktor Orbán -- can pretend not to see it.""

The letter from five senior GOP senators last week suggests McConnell has allies within his party on the issue, but it's clear that Trump and Vance are pushing in the opposite direction. Indeed, the more Orbán's Republican critics denounce the Hungarian's Russian ties and hostility toward democracy, the more one wonders whether Trump sees the criticisms as praise.

Either way, those looking for meaningful divisions in the Republican Party's vision for the near future should start here."
Forget AirPods 4: Apple AirPods Pro 2 Just Dropped To Best-Ever Price,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/10/08/forget-airpods-4-apple-airpods-pro-2-just-dropped-to-best-ever-price/,2024-10-08T16:47:58Z,"AirPods Pro 2 are the premium in-ear headphones from Apple. As part of the fall Amazon Prime Day, they have just dropped in price so much they're currently available to Prime members for less than the latest regular AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation.

This is the best price Amazon has ever offered AirPods Pro 2, undercutting previous prices by around $20 and more than £80 off the regular $249 price.

The current offer sees the earbuds on offer for just $168.99, which represents a 32% price cut over the regular sticker price. So, what's the catch?

Well, you do have to be an Amazon Prime member to snag this deal, which means there's no catch at all if you're already a Prime member.

However, if you aren't then you need to sign up and that costs $14.99 a month, or $139 a year. You may feel this rather dents the benefit of this low price, and you'd be right, except that joining comes with a 30-day free trial, and you can cancel at any time.

Smart buyers join for free and cancel before the 30 days are up -- you could even cancel as soon as you've completed your purchase, and still get the benefits of Prime for the remainder of the 30 days. And, not to big up the service, you also get free delivery on more than 300 million items, some of them available to customers in the right locations on same-day delivery. Of course, Amazon is hoping you don't cancel, but you can.

As for the AirPods Pro 2, they're at a heck of a price. After all, the new AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation are priced at $179, about $10 more than this price. Because they're new, you won't find discounts on the new AirPods 4 just yet, and that's the case with the model with ANC on Amazon right now. The entry-level AirPods 4 are discounted, from $129 to $119, an 8% price cut.

But, here's the thing, while the noise cancelling on AirPods 4 with ANC is great, it's much better on the AirPods Pro 2, which have other benefits over AirPods 4 as well. If you were even thinking of spending $179 on AirPods 4, go for AirPods Pro 2 while you can pick them up at this price."
"FEMA Blasts Misinformation: The Campaign To Politicize Hurricane Helene, Explained",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2024/10/08/fema-blasts-misinformation-the-campaign-to-politicize-hurricane-helene-explained/,2024-10-08T16:47:54Z,"Misinformation about Hurricane Helene, which ravaged the south last week is the ""worst"" chief administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency Deanne Criswell has seen, she said as former President Donald Trump continues to spread falsehoods about the federal response to the disasters.

Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text ""Alerts"" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.

FEMA recently launched a website dedicated to correcting misinformation about the response to Helene on which it corrects falsehoods, encourages people to be ""aware of rumors and scams and (to share) official information from trusted sources.""

Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida's Big Bend region on Sept. 26. It has killed at least 220 people across six states and caused extreme damage in a number of towns in the southeast, including Asheville, North Carolina, the AP reported. Millions of people were without power in the days following the storm, and more than 111,000 people were still without power in North Carolina as of Tuesday, according to poweroutage.us. The Biden administration mobilized 1,500 troops to assist National Guard and federal personnel in their recovery responses, and had given out more than $137 million in federal assistance as of Sunday. Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris visited the southeast last week to survey the damage and meet with leaders, and Trump visited Valdosta, Georgia, and said he brought ""truckloads of things"" like water and equipment to Georgia, Reuters reported. Trump almost immediately made the response to Helene political when he visited Georgia -- a key battleground state in November -- and alleged Biden had not called Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, despite Kemp saying earlier that day he had spoken to Biden. The president responded by saying Trump's lies were ""irresponsible"" and that the White House was doing everything it could to assist in recovery.

""It's un-American,"" Biden said Tuesday of political figures who spread misinformation about the hurricane response. ""It misleads people, it puts people in circumstances where they panic, where they really really really worry, they think 'I'm not being taken care of.'""

Harris criticized Trump for continuing to spread misinformation, saying on Monday it was ""extraordinarily irresponsible"" of him to push false information about what is available to survivors and those impacted by the storm, the Associated Press reported.

Harris also criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for not taking her calls about the incoming Category 4 Hurricane Milton, saying ""people are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations ... is utterly irresponsible."" DeSantis later pushed back on Harris' criticism, saying ""she has no role in this"" and that he has been in touch with President Joe Biden to prepare for Milton.

How misinformation spreads with Hurricane Milton. Milton is expected to make landfall in Florida on Tuesday as a Category 4 hurricane after being downgraded from a Category 5. Officials have warned ""Milton will remain an extremely dangerous hurricane when it reaches the state,"" and much of Florida was under hurricane warnings, hurricane watches or tropical storm warnings as of Tuesday afternoon."
"Lexus, A Rare Sales Winner In Europe, Looks For RZ 300e Boost",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2024/10/08/lexus-a-rare-sales-winner-in-europe-looks-for-rz-300e-boost/,2024-10-08T16:47:53Z,"European auto sales charts are filled with red ink as economies totter but a rare positive story surrounds Toyota's premium subsidy Lexus, which will be helped by its newest electric vehicle, the RZ 300e.

Late last year Lexus said it wants to become a 100% electric vehicle brand globally by 2035. Even earlier in Europe, perhaps by 2030 if market conditions allow. Since then EV sales momentum has slowed considerably, but Lexus hasn't signalled any change of plan.

Americans will be more aware of Lexus than Europeans. Lexus has been a huge success in the U.S. since its inception in 1989, as the brand built a reputation for keen attention to customer service and excellent engineering. Last year Lexus sold 355,600 vehicles in the U.S., but only 69,200 in Europe.

Europeans are said to be more brand-conscious than Americans, and it's a hard sell in the premium market if you don't have a BMW, Audi, Mercedes or Porsche nameplate. Other manufacturers too had a tough time moving into the upmarket sector, and much shareholder money has been squandered by the likes of Renault, GM's Cadillac, Ford Europe, and Nissan's Infiniti as they sought huge upmarket profit margins. Nissan pulled Infiniti out of Europe in 2020. Honda never even bothered to try and sell its Acura vehicles here. Other pretender brands like Stellantis's DS, and Hyundai's Genesis look to be fighting a losing battle.

Lexus sales in Europe (the EU, EFTA and U.K.), in amongst a tidal wave of either negative results or anemic progress, are up nearly 30% at 47,500 in the first eight months of the year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Last year sales almost doubled but were still way behind 2019's pre-Covid high of 90,000.

Lexus has said it wants to raise sales to 100,000 a year but hasn't said when.

These numbers can't compare with BMW's 510,000 (up 10%), Mercedes 430,000 (up 0.5%) and Audi 450,000 (down 8.5%) in the first eight months, but Lexus certainly is winning the momentum race. This must have something in common with the impressive success of parent company Toyota, which increased sales through August by 12.7% to 620,000 compared with the same period last year, largely based on its expertise with hybrids. Other mass car makers barely held on to plus figures. Lexus shares with Toyota a preponderance of hybrids and plug-in hybrids in its lineup.

Jamel Taganza, vice-president of French auto consultancy Inovev, said Lexus is way behind the German competition in the race to electrify. Lexus has two EV ranges, the RZ and UX, while Mercedes has 10, Audi five, and BMW seven.

Taganza said electrification is not a current priority for Toyota or Lexus, but it will be. China is now less important for Toyota as local EV brands have assumed control, Europe is uncertain about EVs, while the U.S. profile is currently low.

""So Toyota (and Lexus) is in a position of a follower, looking at the development of markets but waiting to see how they develop before proposing new products. However, it doesn't mean that Toyota is doing nothing,"" Taganza said in an email.

Matt Schmidt, of Schmidt Automotive Research, said Lexus needs to bolster its EV offering because in the premium sector this can account for almost half of the market.

""The RZ 300e will help Lexus maintain market share in markets that have rapidly transitioned to EVs at a great pace and slightly faster than expected, especially the Nordic markets where Toyota traditionally had a high market share,"" Schmidt said.

""If you don't have an EV in your line-up, you're neglecting almost 50% of the market on average. The RZ is a good second attempt following the half-baked UXe, which had some charging speeds from yesteryear,"" Schmidt said in an email exchange.

The RZ is essentially a higher-trim Toyota BZ4X, according to Schmidt.

""Lexus gives a good barometer of how difficult it is to penetrate the German stranglehold of the European premium market. Lexus has always played the long game - the very long game - of trying to establish some form of brand equity, keeping pricing stable, and going after value rather than volume,"" he said.

Benjamin Kibies, Senior Automotive Analyst at Germany's Dataforce, said Lexus's determination to stay in Europe is paying off, while it leads Toyota's EV development.

Toyota has been criticized for lagging behind the electric revolution, but the recent unexpected slowdown in EV sales has left the company looking more far-sighted than laggardly.

""Lexus is the only Japanese premium brand remaining in Europe and so far their will to stay has paid off. They are growing alongside the Toyota brand and currently make up 7.1% of combined Lexus/Toyota sales, compared to 2.9% back in 2004 and 5.6% in 2014,"" Kibies said in an email.

""When it comes to EVs, Lexus makes up for 16% of Toyota/Lexus combined sales, thus spearheading the group's electrification effort. Lexus can also serve as a test lab for the group's EV innovations,"" he said.

Inovev's Taganza said Toyota is very strong and can develop thermal engines for the rest of the world and improve its European EV lineup.

""At the end of 2023, Toyota announced that they will launch 6 new EVs by 2026 and announced a new electrical architecture from 2026. On this date, the Japanese carmaker expects 20% of its global sales to be 100% electric, or around 2 million vehicles sold in 2026.""

""And we can expect that some of these future models will also have a Lexus badge,"" Taganza said."

How the Know Your Value contest helped this woman transform into a workplace leader,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/know-value-contest-helped-woman-transform-workplace-leader-rcna174426,2024-10-08T16:40:56Z,"Danielle Oceguera, 25, won Mika Brzezinski's Grow Your Value contest in 2018.Miller Hawkins

In 2018, a colleague encouraged 25-year-old Danielle Oceguera to apply for Mika Brzezinski's Know Your Value bonus competition -- a contest that awards $25,000 to the woman who can best articulate her value in a 60-second pitch to the Morning Joe co-host. At the time, the master's degree student had a few doubts.

Oceguera, and Oakland native, had just transitioned into a coordinator role in the talent department at Stanford University, and was hesitant to put herself on stage, in front of a national audience.

""I would never describe myself as a confident person or someone that was willing to freely express their ideas or see value in their ideas,"" she recently told Know Your Value.

Despite her initial lack of self-confidence, Oceguera was accepted as a contestant to Know Your Value's San Francisco event, and went on to win the live pitch competition and claim the cash prize. But she admitted the biggest reward wasn't the money -- it was the personal change that the contest sparked in her.

""When I went into the Know Your Value [conference], it was quite literally such a life-changing experience, because I was, I was just a different person,"" she said. ""I'm a friendly person, but I didn't talk in meetings. I didn't speak up to my supervisors. I didn't want to engage in those types of conversations, or even higher-level thinking conversations, because I just thought I wasn't smart enough, or I wasn't articulate enough.""

Oceguera spoke about her difficulties asserting herself. ""I'd be in meetings and I'd see a problem, or I'd see something that we should be anticipating, but I would literally not say anything at all, just because I didn't think that it would add value.""

Growing up as a third-generation Latina, respecting authority and ""keeping her head down"" were cultural traits that subconsciously followed her into the workplace. ""I was the youngest person in the office,"" she recalled. ""It doesn't come natural for me to speak up ... you don't want to be contradictory, because you should be grateful for the job that you have.""

As one of the only Latinas in her workplace, Oceguera struggled to envision her own progression in leadership. ""It just felt like something very far away, like I didn't really see myself as a leader at Stanford,"" she said. ""And the Know Your Value experience gave me a lot of vocabulary around what my value really was.""

Learning her value helped her earn the $25,000 grand prize, which she used, in part, to pay for her education. ""That whole experience was really pivotal for me,"" Oceguera said.

She received body language training from behavior expert Janine Driver, confidence development skills from communications expert Chris Ulrich, and personal style tips Gravitas founder and CEO Lisa Sun. Oceguera and two other finalists were given a crash course to prepare for their live pitch competition.

Ultimately, the confidence she honed during that time led her to become a better advocate at work. ""If anyone asked about the number one characteristic to describe me, it would probably have been 'helpful,'"" she said. ""So my value was in helping others, but I didn't do very much to help myself at the time. Post the Know Your Value [conference] ... I learned a lot about myself.""

During her winning pitch -- in front of Brzezinski and 600 conference attendees -- Oceguera advocated for ""the voiceless and underrepresented communities.""

Almost six years later, she has done just that. She now focuses on growing middle management at Stanford, helping staff climb the ladder, get promoted and gain key leadership skills. Oceguera was part of the university's talent development team that spearheaded an important DEI initiative to create more inclusion and a sense of belonging for underrepresented communities at the elite institution.

Reflecting back on all the work she's done to help university staff find their own voice and grow their value, she credits her 2018 experience the most. Now, when she talks to young people -- especially from immigrant backgrounds like hers -- she shares the same lessons she learned from the Know Your Value conference.

""I let them know that the reason they're here is because they deserve to be here, and I encourage them to speak up in meetings [and not to be afraid],"" she said. ""What you have is important for us to learn, and your experience is important."""

Google Confirms New Gmail Security  Boost For 2.5 Billion Users,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/10/08/google-confirms-new-gmail-security--boost-for-25-billion-users/,2024-10-08T16:34:27Z,"Trust is essential, I hardly need to tell you that. Trust in email is doubly so because it can make the difference between staying protected and falling victim to malware or compromise. Google operates the biggest free email provider on the planet, Gmail, with more than 2.5 billion active users. So, when the rules around trust involving bulk sender authentication change, it's a big deal. I've covered these changes multiple times since they were first announced a year ago now, and Google will detail just how successful they have been at the annual Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group conference in Toronto on Oct. 09. I've been given a sneak preview which I am able to share ahead of time.

Neil Kumaran, the group product manager of Gmail security and trust, has trusted me with details of just how successful the rule change, first announced 12 months ago, impacting bulk senders of email to Gmail users has been.

Since the introduction of the new rules in April 2024, Kumaran said, there has been an ""unprecedented improvement in the fundamental security of email as a result of these requirements on bulk senders.""

The numbers are, frankly, hugely impressive:

It's probably worth repeating that last statistic; it's not a typo: yes, 265 billion fewer unauthenticated messages were sent. That means hundreds of billions less opportunities for malware to be distributed, for spam to be received, for email to be both dangerous and annoying.

Although necessarily technical in nature, the new rules that Google imposed starting April 01, 2024, accrue to three simple and realistic outcomes:

In other words, if you are sending email to Gmail users, bulk email, then you must be able to prove that you are who you say you are. Authentication must be a foundational part of email security, and that's what Google has set out to achieve with these rules for bulk sender authentication.

""An environment without strong authentication is one where spam and malicious activity are much more likely,"" Kumaran said, ""these improvements represent a huge boost to the health of the email ecosystem by dramatically reducing the types of messages often used for spoofing and phishing attacks."""
Pioneers of AI win Nobel Prize in physics for laying the groundwork of machine learning,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/science/pioneers-ai-win-nobel-prize-physics-laying-groundwork-machine-learning,2024-10-08T16:32:39Z,"Hopfield and Hinton laid the groundwork for the machine learning revolution, according to Mark Pearce, a member of the Nobel physics committee.

Two pioneers of artificial intelligence -- John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton -- won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for helping create the building blocks of machine learning that is revolutionizing the way we work and live but also creates new threats for humanity.

Hinton, who is known as the godfather of artificial intelligence, is a citizen of Canada and Britain who works at the University of Toronto, and Hopfield is an American working at Princeton.

""These two gentlemen were really the pioneers,"" said Nobel physics committee member Mark Pearce. ""They ... did the fundamental work, based on physical understanding which has led to the revolution we see today in machine learning and artificial intelligence.""

NOBEL PRIZE GOES TO 3 PHYSICISTS FOR WORK ON QUANTUM SCIENCE

The artificial neural networks -- interconnected computer nodes inspired by neurons in the human brain -- the researchers pioneered are used throughout science and medicine and ""have also become part of our daily lives, for instance in facial recognition and language translation,"" said Ellen Moons, a member of the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Hopfield, whose 1982 work laid the groundwork for Hinton's, told The Associated Press Tuesday, ""I continue to be amazed by the impact it has had.""

Hinton predicted that AI will end up having a ""huge influence"" on civilization, bringing improvements in productivity and health care.

""It would be comparable with the Industrial Revolution,"" he said in an open call with reporters and officials of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

""Instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it's going to exceed people in intellectual ability. We have no experience of what it's like to have things smarter than us. And it's going to be wonderful in many respects,"" Hinton said.

""But we also have to worry about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control.""

The Nobel committee also mentioned fears about the possible flipside.

Moons said that while it has ""enormous benefits, its rapid development has also raised concerns about our future. Collectively, humans carry the responsibility for using this new technology in a safe and ethical way for the greatest benefit of humankind.""

Hinton shares those concerns. He quit a role at Google so he could speak more freely about the dangers of the technology he helped create.

""I am worried that the overall consequence of this might be systems more intelligent than us that eventually take control,"" Hinton said.

For his part, Hopfield, who signed early petitions by researchers calling for strong control of the technology, compared the risks and benefits of machine learning to work on viruses and nuclear energy, capable of helping and harming society.

Neither winner was home when they received the news. Hopfield, who was staying with his wife at a cottage in Hampshire, England, said that after grabbing coffee and getting his flu shot, he opened his computer to a flurry of activity.

""I've never seen that many emails in my life,"" he said. A bottle of champagne and bowl of soup were waiting on his desk for him, he added, but he doubted there were any fellow physicists in town to join the celebration.

Hinton said he was shocked at the honor.

""I'm flabbergasted. I had no idea this would happen,"" he said when reached by the Nobel committee on the phone. He said he was at a cheap hotel with no internet.

3 WIN NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS FOR WORK TO UNDERSTAND COSMOS

Hinton, 76, helped develop a technique in the 1980s known as backpropagation that has been instrumental in training machines how to ""learn"" by fine-tuning errors until they disappear. It's similar to the way a student learns from a teacher, with an initial solution graded and flaws identified and returned to be fixed and repaired. This process continues until the answer matches the network's version of reality.

His team at the University of Toronto later wowed peers by using a neural network to win the prestigious ImageNet computer vision competition in 2012. That win spawned a flurry of copycats and was ""a very, very significant moment in hindsight and in the course of AI history,"" said Stanford University computer scientist and ImageNet creator Fei-Fei Li.

""Many people consider that the birth of modern AI,"" she said.

Hinton and fellow AI scientists Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun won computer science's top prize, the Turing Award, in 2019.

""For a long time, people thought what the three of us were doing was nonsense,"" Hinton told told the AP in 2019. ""They thought we were very misguided and what we were doing was a very surprising thing for apparently intelligent people to waste their time on.""

""My message to young researchers is, don't be put off if everyone tells you what are doing is silly.""

And Hinton himself uses machine learning in his daily life, he said.

""Whenever I want to know the answer to anything, I just go and ask GPT-4,"" Hinton said at the Nobel announcement. ""I don't totally trust it because it can hallucinate, but on almost everything it's a not-very-good expert. And that's very useful.""

Hopfield, 91, created an associative memory that can store and reconstruct images and other types of patterns in data, the Nobel committee said.

""What fascinates me most is still this question of how mind comes from machine,"" Hopfield said in a video posted online by The Franklin Institute after it awarded him a physics prize in 2019.

Hinton used Hopfield's network as the foundation for a new network that uses a different method, known as the Boltzmann machine, that the committee said can learn to recognize characteristic elements in a given type of data.

Bengio, who was mentored by Hinton and ""profoundly shaped"" by Hopfield's thinking, told the AP that the winners both ""saw something that was not obvious: Connections between physics and learning in neural networks, which has been the basis of modern AI.""

He said he was ""really delighted"" that they won the prize. ""It's great for the field. It's great for recognizing that history.""

Six days of Nobel announcements opened Monday with Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize for their discovery of tiny bits of genetic material that serve as on and off switches inside cells that could one day lead to powerful treatments for diseases like cancer.

The prize carries a cash award of $1 million from a bequest left by the award's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.

"Trump White House Stopped FBI From Fully Investigating Brett Kavanaugh Claims, Senate Report Says",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/08/trump-white-house-stopped-fbi-from-fully-investigating-brett-kavanaugh-claims-senate-report-says/,2024-10-08T16:31:05Z,"The Trump administration blocked the FBI from conducting a thorough investigation into the sexual assault allegations that came out against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing, Democratic senators allege in a new report, claiming the Trump White House limited the probe's scope and left out potential corroborating evidence.

""The Trump White House controlled the scope and conduct of the supplemental background investigation, specifically engineering it to exclude evidence that could have corroborated the allegations against Kavanaugh,"" Whitehouse's report claims.

The Senate report cites communications showing FBI investigators were confused by public statements by Trump and members of his administration claiming that the agency had ""free rein"" to conduct its investigation and interview whomever was relevant, given the limited instructions the FBI received to only interview certain witnesses. When it comes to ""supplemental"" investigations into a nominee's background, the FBI can only investigate what the White House tells it to, the report notes, so the FBI could only have the flexibility that Trump claimed if his administration specifically told that to the FBI. FBI personnel asked the Trump administration if their directive had changed, given the then-president's public statements, but a Trump administration staffer said ""only that the White House would be in touch if it had additional guidance,"" the report alleges.

Attorneys for Blasey Ford and Ramirez criticized the FBI investigation in light of the new Senate report in statements Tuesday to The Washington Post, with Blasey Ford's lawyers Debra Katz and Lisa Banks saying it ""confirms what we long suspected: the FBI supplemental investigation of then-nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh was, in fact, a sham effort directed by the Trump White House to silence brave victims and other witnesses who came forward and to hide the truth."" Ramirez's attorney John Clune told the Post the report was ""really disappointing since our client was so candid about something that was a pretty awful experience."" Blasey Ford has maintained her allegations against Kavanaugh over the years, writing in her 2024 memoir she believes the justice ""must know"" what happened between them, ""even if it's hazy from the alcohol."" She also argued Kavanaugh ""categorically denying"" the allegations made Blasey Ford feel ""more certainty than ever"" that he ""had not gone on to become the consummately honest person befitting a Supreme Court justice.""

The Senate report calls for new protocols to be put into place so that any future investigations into political nominees won't face the same issues, arguing the Kavanaugh probe shows the current process ""can be easily manipulated to prevent a thorough investigation into potentially disqualifying allegations against a nominee."" Senators propose there should be more transparency in any supplemental FBI investigations, with ""clear, written procedures"" for how these kinds of probes should operate and the FBI required to inform the Senate of the exact investigative steps the agency took.

While senators began investigating the FBI's Kavanaugh probe in 2018, it took years to complete because of ""executive branch obstruction,"" the report claims, alleging the White House refused to provide information. Even after Trump left and President Joe Biden took office, ""complete answers to the Senators' questions were few and far between,"" the report alleges, suggesting the executive branch still either didn't provide requested information or gave only incomplete answers. Senators were finally given 600 pages of communications between the Trump White House and FBI only in Nov. 2023, the report notes, which it suggests is only because Whitehouse suggested he would withhold supporting the Biden administration's nominee to lead the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel until his requests were responded to.

Kavanaugh was narrowly confirmed to the Supreme Court in 2018 in a 50-48 vote as the sexual assault allegations became a national controversy. Blasey Ford came forward with her allegations in an interview with the Post in Sept. 2018, which quickly became the main focus of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing even as the then-nominee vehemently denied her claims. Senators backing Kavanaugh repeatedly pointed to the FBI's investigation and its lack of findings to justify supporting the justice, with the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee releasing a report in 2018 claiming ""there was no evidence to substantiate any of the claims of sexual assault made against Justice Kavanaugh."" Democrats have long raised concerns about how the FBI handled the claims against Kavanaugh, and Whitehouse's Senate report follows several years of news articles and reports suggesting investigators did not do their due diligence. Whitehouse slammed the probe as being ""politically constrained and perhaps fake"" in 2021 and called for the Justice Department to investigate it. The Rhode Island senator also asked FBI Director Christopher Wray about the investigation during a Senate hearing in August 2022, at which Wray confirmed the FBI had taken ""direction"" from the Trump Administration over who was interviewed in the probe."

Sam's Club's New Cashierless Store Is Retail Innovation At Its Finest,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2024/10/08/sams-clubs-new-cashierless-store-is-retail-innovation-at-its-finest/,2024-10-08T16:22:39Z,"Sam's Club has long been one of the most innovative retailers in America. However, since its new CEO Chris Nicholas took over the helm last year, that moniker is now coming into question.

Because the phrase ""one of"" is a disservice.

Sam's Club isn't one of the most innovative retailers. It may now just be the single most innovative retailer out there.

Case in point: the new store it plans to open in Grapevine, Texas later this month.

According to a recent interview with Nicholas at Groceryshop (see above), Sam's Club plans to open a new store that will have . . . wait for it . . . no checkout lanes.

It's bold. It's unprecedented. And it's an idea that shows that Sam's Club is unafraid to fail.

According to Nicholas, the new store is part of Sam's Club's broader strategy to ""pioneer the future of retail,"" i.e. to create a store that is a physical manifestation of the company's vision for a fully digital engagement across its operations, and here is how it works.

The new store replaces traditional checkout lanes with a digital-first shopping experience where customers use Sam's Club's popular Scan & Go smartphone app to make purchases as they shop (an app that remarkably 30% of Sam's Club shoppers already use chainwide). When customers finish shopping they can then simply exit the store via computer vision-based archways (see photo below) that cross-check their carts against their digital receipts, thereby enabling them to avoid lines altogether.

The point is that the store is a testing ground to understand the puts and takes of omnichannel warehouse club retailing.

For example, Nicholas mentioned that the absence of traditional checkouts allows Sam's Club to reimagine its floor space. The area typically occupied by cash registers instead will showcase online-only items, ranging from towering Christmas trees to dazzling lab-grown diamonds, all of which allows customers to interact with products they might otherwise only see on a screen.

The new store design also plans to allocate more space for the preparation of online orders. Store workers will have approximately four times the area to assemble orders for curbside pickup and home delivery, reflecting the company's commitment to evolving with consumers' increasing proclivities to shop via e-commerce.

But perhaps, most importantly, the store helps Nicholas and his team understand ""friction,"" a word Nicholas used over and over again in the interview. By walking out on the thin branch of innovation without a net, Sam's Club will get a better understanding of what trade offs customers are willing make in exchange for a more convenient, time saving, and easy shopping experience.

If 30% of Sam's Club shoppers already use Scan & Go regularly, is it a bridge too far to force everyone who visits one particular store to shop that way? Or does it risk alienating the 70% of shoppers who don't use Scan & Go?

Sam's Club will never know the answer to these questions unless it tries.

It very well could be quite alarming to Grapevine shoppers as they enter the store for the first time, but, newsflash, Sam's Club has already run this experiment, too. It knows the downside risk of this approach from its first concept store, Sam's Club Now, that opened back in 2018 and that also required all shoppers to shop via its Scan & Go app.

And, yet, for some odd reason, the sky never fell with Sam's Club Now, and instead Sam's Club Now helped Sam's Club learn how to perfect its Scan & Go app and how to deploy computer vision technology to improve the experience for both its employees and its shoppers. None of which would have likely happened had Sam's Club not been willing to take a similar bold chance six years ago.

So put that in your pipe and smoke it Chicken Little.

As revolutionary as a checkout-free warehouse club experience may sound, what Sam's Club plans to unveil later this month is, in reality, far more evolution than revolution, and that's the beauty of it.

Nicholas and Sam's Club are designing for the Sam's Club experience not of tomorrow but for 10 or 15 years down the road. They are designing for a future in which shoppers are more tech savvy than they are today and one in which Gen Z and Millennials hold even more spending power.

Or said another way, it is concept store work at its finest.

Sam's Club is taking the risk of opening a single store that could fail for the option value of learning about what disrupting itself could look like at a time when so many other retailers are busy burying their heads in the sand and are just happy doing things incrementally better with each passing day. Through successive concept stores -- first Sam's Club Now and then this new Grapevine store -- Sam's Club's realization of its store of the future is much more in focus than it is at other retailers, and particularly compared to its biggest rival, Costco.

There's clearly something in the water at Sam's Club and the rest of the retail industry would be wise to say to itself, ""I'll have what Sam's is having."""

Key metrics:

Tesla is a multinational American corporation specializing in electric vehicles, energy storage and solar panel manufacturing. The company has been at the forefront of transitioning to sustainable energy and transportation.

Tesla remains a top stock pick for November, driven by its continued innovation in the electric vehicle (EV) market and its expansion into new sectors.

Key metrics:

JPMorgan Chase is one of the largest and most complex financial institutions in the United States. It is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing, and asset management.

JPMorgan Chase remains a top stock pick for November, bolstered by its robust performance across diverse business segments and adept navigation of the complex economic landscape. The bank's recent third-quarter 2024 earnings report exceeded analyst expectations, with net income rising to $13.7 billion, up 8% from the previous quarter. This strong performance was driven by solid consumer banking results and increased net interest income due to higher interest rates.

The bank's investment banking division has shown resilience in a challenging market, maintaining its top position in global investment banking fees. JPMorgan's recent expansion of its middle-market banking services in Europe has begun to yield results, with the bank gaining market share in a traditionally underserved segment.

JPMorgan's continued investment in technology is paying off, with its AI-powered digital assistant for wealth management clients seeing rapid adoption rates. The bank's blockchain-based payment network, JPM Coin, has processed over $1 trillion in transactions year-to-date, demonstrating the potential of this technology to transform financial services.

The bank's strong capital position, with a CET1 ratio of 14.5% as of the third quarter of 2024, provides a solid foundation for growth and resilience against economic uncertainties. This strong capital base has allowed JPMorgan to increase its dividend by 5% in 2024, marking the 13th consecutive year of dividend growth.

As the Federal Reserve signals a potential end to its rate-hiking cycle, JPMorgan is well-positioned to benefit from a stable interest rate environment. The bank's diversified business model, spanning consumer banking, corporate and investment banking, commercial banking and asset and wealth management, provides resilience against sector-specific downturns.

JPMorgan's strong risk management practices, evidenced by its performance during recent banking sector turbulence, and its ""fortress balance sheet"" philosophy instill confidence in its ability to weather potential economic headwinds. With signs of financial stability emerging and the potential for a ""soft landing"" scenario, JPMorgan benefits from increased lending activity and potential upticks in consumer spending and business investments.

Given its strong financial performance, technological innovation, and potential to benefit from the current economic environment, JPMorgan Chase presents a compelling choice for investors seeking exposure to the financial sector with a blend of stability and growth potential.

The five stocks highlighted in this article-Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla and JPMorgan Chase-represent diverse sectors and offer unique growth potential. From technology giants driving AI innovation to leaders in e-commerce, cloud computing, electric vehicles and financial services, these companies are well-positioned to capitalize on significant market trends. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, these stocks have demonstrated solid fundamentals and growth prospects, making them attractive options for investors in November. Conducting thorough research and considering your investment goals before making investment decisions is essential."
"250 companies, schools and organizations pledge to provide overdose antidote naloxone",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5145832/250-companies-schools-and-organizations-pledge-to-provide-overdose-antidote-naloxone,2024-10-08T16:20:08Z,"White House officials say more than 250 companies, universities, labor groups and other organizations have joined a national effort to reduce drug overdose deaths. They've agreed to stock free doses of the medication naloxone, also known as Narcan, that quickly reverses most fentanyl-opioid overdoses.

The list of participants joining the national naloxone push includes major corporations like Amazon, the National Hockey League, and United Airlines as well as some universities. Labor and contractor organizations have also signed on, along with restaurant and hospitality trade groups.

""From airlines to classrooms, from offices to sports arenas, we are grateful to have hundreds of voluntary commitments from organizations and businesses across the country,"" said Dr. Rahul Gupta, the Biden administration's drug czar, in a statement Tuesday morning.

According to the White House, Amazon will position naloxone medications at work sites that employ more than 500,000 workers. The NHL is encouraging teams to include naloxone in the medical kits kept on hand at hockey stadiums around the U.S.

The announcement comes as fatal overdoses have seen the biggest improvement ever recorded, with drug deaths declining by roughly 10% over the last 12 months, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Some experts believe the spread of naloxone is contributing to that decline. Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved over-the-counter sale of Narcan without a prescription.

White House domestic policy advisor Neera Tanden said in a statement the federal government hopes to see naloxone available in ""as many homes, workplaces and communities as possible.""

In recent years, fatal overdoses spiraled upward, with roughly 110,000 drug deaths reported in 2023. Most of those deaths were caused by fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid that's often mixed with other toxic chemicals.

Beginning in late 2023, the number of fatal overdoses began to decline sharply. Drug policy experts say the improvement appears to be accelerating in 2024, with drug deaths in some states, including Missouri and Ohio, down by more than a third.

Naloxone is considered to be one possible cause, but researchers say they're not yet sure why the hopeful shift is happening or how long it will last. Other factors may be the wider use of opioid treatment medications Suboxone and methadone and a reported disruption of the illicit street fentanyl supply in some parts of the U.S.

Public health officials have celebrated the decline in deaths, but also note that fatal overdoses remain high. Some demographic groups -- including Black men, older Americans, and Native Americans -- have actually seen increases in drug deaths in 2024.

In his statement, Gupta said the U.S. ""must double and triple down on our efforts now more than ever"" to help people survive the opioid crisis."
Hispanic voters rail against 'dishonest' Biden-Harris border record as poll shows Trump gaining in key states,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hispanic-voters-rail-against-dishonest-biden-harris-border-record-poll-shows-trump-gaining-key-states,2024-10-08T16:15:54Z,"LAS VEGAS - Hispanic voters at a pro-Trump event in Nevada ripped the Biden-Harris administration on immigration following news that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants charged with rape and murder are in the United States.

""The current administration are very, very responsible,"" Demesio Guerrero, a Trump supporter at a GOP Hispanic outreach event in Clark County, Nevada, told Fox News Digital in response to a question about recently released ICE data showing tens of thousands of illegal immigrants with sexual assault and murder convictions are living in the United States.

""They are like traitors of the United States. Because you know what, all the crimes, all the innocent Americans that are dying every day in many, many, many cities in the United States are the result of those criminals being loose.""

Blanca Fox, a Trump campaign volunteer originally from Guatemala, told Fox News Digital that the Biden administration should have warned the American public about the ICE numbers.

HARRIS SURROGATES TRY TO EXPLAIN AWAY 'FLIP-FLOPPING' IMMIGRATION POLICY

""They're being like so dishonest right now with the whole country,"" Fox said. ""Everybody is hurt and they don't see the reality that Kamala Harris has been for four years in the [vice] presidency and all we have is like problems. We have no solutions with them. We're not against people to come to the United States, but the legal way, if you come to look for a better future, do it the right way and don't come and commit crimes and be a problem.""

Lydia Dominguez, a Trump supporter from Clark County who spoke on a panel at the Latinos for Trump event, told Fox News Digital that ""there is a crisis occurring at the border.""

HARRIS SUPPORTERS SAY SHE'LL FIX IMMIGRATION, BLAME TRUMP FOR BORDER CRISIS

""Between the drugs, the human trafficking, and now the millions of illegal immigrants that we have crossing over that we have not vetted or that have actually been charged for murder in other countries,"" Dominguez said. ""So it's alarming what's happening at the border.""

""They say that that's only a very small group,"" RNC Hispanic communications director Jaime Florez told Fox News Digital about criminal illegal aliens in the United States. ""You know, try to explain those statistics to the parents of the girl that was killed in the University of Georgia. When 10 million people come into this country without being vetted in any way, it is impossible to think that no criminal is going to come among them.""

A Las Vegas resident called the current status of the southern border ""terrible,"" pointing out that ""anyone can declare"" asylum and ""they're just allowed to come in."" Former Texas congressional candidate Rolando Rodriguez told Fox News Digital that he grew up around the border and explained that today it is a ""disaster like never before in the history of this nation and probably in the history of the world.""

This week, a pair of Suffolk University/USA Today surveys showed that Harris leads Trump among Hispanic voters in the key swing states of Nevada and Arizona, but also showed Trump has made gains with younger male Hispanic voters compared to four years ago.

LAKE RIPS BIDEN-HARRIS 'DOUBLE WHAMMY' POLICIES AFFECTING ARIZONANS : 'DRIVEN US OVER THE CLIFF'

""So far, Harris is falling short of the 24-26 point advantage that Joe Biden carried with Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada in 2020, according to the exit polls from those states,"" Suffolk University Political Research Center director David Paleologos highlighted. ""This Democratic shortfall is largely due to young Hispanic men.""

The Hispanic voters who spoke to Fox News Digital expressed a similar sentiment to what was highlighted in the polling and said they expect Trump will increase his numbers with Hispanic voters in 2024, in part because of the immigration crisis.

""President Reagan used to say Hispanics are Republicans. They just don't know it yet,"" Florez told Fox News Digital. ""We're finding out. I think that many Hispanics that are Democrats found out that the Democratic Party has taken them for granted for way too long. They have made us promises that they never fulfilled, including immigration reform that President Obama promised never happened.""

""We had a great time, it was a very prosperous time for us when President Trump was in the White House,"" Florez added, noting that Hispanic household income was up during the Trump presidency.

""I'm sure that Trump is going to win Nevada. Definitely."""
Coastal Floridian warns others to 'get out' as Hurricane Milton closes in: 'We have no idea' what's coming,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/florida-braces-milton-coastal-resident-warns-others-get-no-idea-coming,2024-10-08T16:15:24Z,"Treasure Island, Florida resident Chuck Fuller shares how his community, which is in the direct path of Hurricane Milton, is preparing and how the storm has left many with no choice but to evacuate.

Hurricane-battered Florida braces for yet another round of storm surge and damaging winds as potentially catastrophic Hurricane Milton barrels toward the state's west coast.

Treasure Island sits directly in the storm's projected path, putting residents like Chuck Fuller on high alert after already facing the wrath of Hurricane Helene.

Fuller, speaking to Fox News early Tuesday, said he plans to evacuate ahead of the storm's landfall, and he's urging others to ""get out"" as well.

""There's nothing much that we can do... We've never seen a storm of this magnitude. They said it's probably been over 100 years,"" he told ""Fox & Friends First"" co-host Carley Shimkus.

FLORIDA ISLAND BRACING FOR CAT 5 HURRICANE MILTON AFTER GRAPPLING WITH HELENE: 'TOWN IS ABSOLUTELY DEMOLISHED'

""One of the most terrible reasons [for] the loss of lives is drowning,"" he continued, speaking of the storm surge threat. ""So just please get out and be safe.""

Residents of the Sunshine State are making their way either inland toward shelters or safer areas in other states, packing interstate highways as they heed warnings to flee.

Fuller's area, already battered by Hurricane Helene late last month, now grapples with destruction, sewage in the streets and the mounting pressure to do what they can to ward off the damage Milton could cause.

""I have a warning for those that might be seeing this that are still in the barrier islands. We've become very complacent because over the years, the storms have come in and [there was] not much damage, maybe a little water. We've never had any water in our house but maybe some wind damage. The first year we sandbagged, we moved the cars, nothing happened and then so on and so on, so you become complacent,"" he said.

HURRICANE MILTON TO INTENSIFY AND SWELL IN SIZE BEFORE UNLEASHING ON FLORIDA AND MORE TOP HEADLINES

""But I can tell you, heed the advice of the officials and get out because, we have no idea [what's coming].""

Preparing for Millton has involved boarding up homes, building barricades using sandbags and doing ""a lot of praying,"" Fuller said, adding that, after Helene, the area can't afford to ""take any chances.""

Milton jumped to a category five on Monday before dialing back to a category four storm hours later. The storm is expected to make landfall late Wednesday."

Bell, along with Mark Gardener, Loz Colbert and Steve Queralt were early pioneers of shoegaze, alongside contemporaries like Slowdive and My Bloody Valentine. Eight-minute anthems like ""Leave Them All Behind"" were Top 10 hits in the U.K., but the Ride of today has fused shoegaze with another love: the '80s synth pop of Depeche Mode and Talk Talk.

CSD CEO Chris Soukup Talks Deaf People And Communication In Interview,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenaquino/2024/10/08/csd-ceo-chris-soukup-talks-deaf-people-and-communication-in-interview/,2024-10-08T16:06:11Z,"The Communication Service for the Deaf (CSD) is an agency in existence since 1975. On its website, the agency describes its ethos as communication being central to ""everything we do."" CSD believes in collaboration's immense power, saying ""frequent, open, and honest dialogue"" while adding it prioritizes ""accessible communication methods to meet everyone's needs."" Notably, CSD eats its own dog food -- a Silicon Valley colloquialism referring to companies using software internally before unleashing it externally -- as it's a Deaf-led social impact organization, led by CEO Chris Soukup. The company works in myriad levels of advocacy for the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community, helping people get jobs, gain access to equitable education, and lots more.

CSD's raison d'être is super simple: ""We want to create a better world for deaf and hard of hearing people.""

In a recent interview with me conducted via videoconference, Soukup explained his organization is not a traditional 501c3 nonprofit; rather, he likened it to a ""constellation of companies."" Some of those so-called ""constellation of companies,"" he emphasized, are for-profit entities. Money-grabbing (or lack thereof) notwithstanding, Soukup told me the central conceit to CSD's work over the last several decades has been innovating all the ways in which Deaf and hard-of-hearing people access communication. Soukup has spent the entirety of his career, a quarter-century, with CSD and said the experience has proven ""quite the ride.""

""I'm proud of what we've done in the past, and I'm excited about and worried about the potential and promise and opportunities at the present and in the future,"" he said.

Soukup hails from an extensive Deaf family, with numerous members of his clan being Deaf except for his CODA mother. Many people in his family lived their formative years as disabled people living without the protections of the Americans with Disabilities Act. (It really is telling that the ADA is only 34 years old. It speaks volumes about the societal perception on disability.) As such, Soukup said his older family lived their lives forced to face communicative barriers without much, if any, recourse for breaking them down. Some of Soukup's earliest memories involve his grandparents coming to his house with a checklist of to-do items, for which his mom would make calls and act as the in-house interpreter. Leaning on other people -- like your hearing children -- for communication was ""the reality in the pre-ADA era,"" Soukup said.

The ADA, he said, was a seminal moment in terms of mandating equitable access to communication. A layer of need that Soukup and CSD noticed was helping Deaf people engage with customer service agents or some other hotlines. The user flow breaks down because many Deaf people obviously cannot hear nor understand pressing a certain button for a certain action. It's an exercise in futility that's thoroughly frustrating. To remedy this, Soukup and CSD have become ardent advocates for companies establishing ASL call centers, wherein Deaf callers can get helped by people who quite literally speak their language.

To the extent CSD has succeeded in its work to engender communicative equality, it's illustrative to Soukup and team of what the people who pioneered the ADA three decades ago envisioned when they sat down to discuss the parameters of the legislation and eventually document it.

""We [at CSD] want this level of equality for the deaf community. We want them to have this level of autonomy, this level of access,"" Soukup said. ""Direct video calling has been a big focus for us over the past decade, and we've been encouraging a number of different governments and corporations to adopt ASL customer service and creating points of access for the Deaf community to be able to call in directly to get the information they need or the issues that they have resolved.""

The pandemic shone a light on how hard the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community must fight to be seen and heard. For one thing, while the mask mandates during the pandemic's apex (or nadir, if you prefer) were perfectly sensible from a health standpoint, the incessant masking proved a literal barrier to those who rely on lip-reading for communication. Not to mention a mask somewhat obstructs the unique facial expressions used by those who speak ASL. Soukup told me there was a lot of disinformation online, which made it harder for Deaf and hard-of-hearing people to stay in the loop when it came to breaking news on the virus. To that end, he said CSD ""partnered with a number of states"" to implement so-called ""COVID hotlines"" especially designed for the Deaf community. Deaf people, Soukup said, already had ""sky-high anxiety"" over maintaining the physical well-being of loved ones at the pandemic's height, so having the ASL-ready hotline proved soothing. Having the ability to obtain ""straight answers and clear information"" in an accessible manner was of the utmost import, with Soukup telling me CSD since has been trying to learn and build from those experiences in an effort to ""create as many points of access as we can"" for Deaf people.

Soukup lamented there's a perception pervasive in society that Deaf and hard-of-hearing people are Mr. Magoo-like in a lot of ways -- they're a little ""oblivious"" to the world around them. The presumption is there are so many text-based communicative technologies available -- iMessage, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, et al -- that Deaf people ""should be fine"" in terms of communicating with others. The problem is, textual methodologies aren't as universal in terms of points of access as it seems at first blush. Many Deaf people, Soukup said, don't have a solid linguistic foundation in English; ASL and English are two distinct languages, after all. For those who are heavily dependent on signing, text-based communication tools actually can offer more obstruction.

""There's an aspect of accelerating innovation that is frightening [for Deaf people],"" Soukup said of tech's double-edged sword. ""There are aspects that are very exciting. There are technologies in particular I'm incredibly excited about... they're still very primitive. They're in early stages of development and probably won't be commercially available for a while, and it'll be a decade probably before we see that this [technology] used in ways that Deaf people can benefit from in their daily lives.""

Soukup highlighted technologies that enable typed and spoken input software being turned around as output using an ASL-based avatar. The technology he described is similar to Sign Speak, with Soukup saying today's technology is robust and is bound to get better. Moreover, he's excited by research done into new technology around gesture recognition, whereby ASL signs can be transformed into spoken audio utilizing a specialized type of gloves with specialized software built in.

""The technology is at least a decade away from being fully-formed, but there could come a day where a Deaf person is completely autonomous [and] completely free to move about the world,"" Soukup said. ""They can communicate in their language that is converted through software to speech or to text, and they have a way to take in automated sign language through the use of digital avatars. ""That's going to happen in our lifetime, and it's incredibly exciting. CSD has been watching and advocating and supporting the development of those technologies closely."""
3 Ways To Make Money Online With No Experience In 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2024/10/08/3-ways-to-make-money-online-with-no-experience-in-2024/,2024-10-08T16:05:52Z,"Nearly 53% of Gen Z and Millennial Americans spend more than half of their income on housing costs alone, according to a recent CardRates.com survey of more than 1,000 young professionals. This defies the general guideline that up to 30% of one's salary should go towards housing costs such as mortgage payments and utilities.

The survey sheds light on a troubling reality: most Gen Z and Millennials who are entering the workforce or are mid-career professionals cannot afford basic costs outside of housing, such as weekly groceries, travel, eating out, and other necessary expenditures.

Additionally, almost half of Gen Z and Millennials have taken up side hustles to make more money online, according to a Bankrate survey. The top reason for undertaking gigs was the need to create supplemental income to cover daily living expenses (this accounted for 33% of side hustlers), which is understandable given the current financial situation of many young and mid-career professionals.

If you're a young professional and have found yourself in a similar financial position and worry that you have significant career experience to become a freelancer, don't panic. There is a variety of ways you can make money online without needing extensive experience under your belt.

One great way to make money from home outside your job with little experience is to find and review products within a niche you are passionate about.

The relative popularity of Google searches for ""product reviews"" has increased by 35 points since October 2019, according to Google Trends data at the time of writing, showing just how integral product reviews are in the shopping and e-commerce experience.

With most consumers making purchases online and nothing physically tangible to test before spending their money, many opt for Googling ""product reviews"" so they can hear from someone like them who has tested the product and offered their honest feedback.

You can provide product reviews in the format of a personal blog or as a YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram vlog. You can make money through affiliate links being hyperlinked to your blog or copied and pasted into the description of your video, which you will refer your viewers to throughout your video. As you build a presence, brands will begin to provide their products to you for free for you to test and review.

Another easy way to make money online without experience is to find gigs, which are always popular with students. Platforms such as TaskRabbit, Rover, and even Nextdoor are great places to pick up quick gigs and make money to cover urgent expenses.

You can easily squeeze these gigs (from dog walking and pet sitting to DIY assembly or picking up items from the store) into your free time in the evenings after work, perhaps before work, and on the weekends or whenever you have PTO.

This final idea to make money online requires you to think like an entrepreneur. Reflect and consider your day-to-day experiences, whether at work or from your time in college. Ask yourself, what could be executed better or more efficiently? Where might there be a gap, a need that I could be uniquely positioned to fill based on my knowledge of this gap?

It doesn't even need to be anything significant. You don't need to be the next Mark Zuckerberg or develop a ground-breaking technology like AI for this to work. All you need to do is identify something that annoys or prevents you from performing a task effectively and ask yourself, who else has the same problem?

Conduct some research, and once you have identified a trend and a growing need in that area and have brainstormed some ways to solve it, you have successfully identified a means to make money.

You might need to collaborate or partner with others to make your dream a reality, as is the case with ClothesLyne founder Camden Olivero, who launched his laundry service business following the same model as rideshare apps such as Uber after observing his own need for laundry services in the middle of his busy schedule. Speaking to Chase.com, Olivero said that ClothesLyne is growing 15% month-over-month, and the team currently has plans to expand their footprint nationally...all because he identified a basic need and acted on it.

It takes little genius to make money. With the wide accessibility of digital tools, money-making apps and platforms, and artificial technology, you're left with little excuse. All you need is creativity, a unique approach to your work, and your laptop and Wi-Fi; sooner than later, you could be earning even more than your job pays."
4 Ways To Say No And Manage Your Time More Intentionally,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lucianapaulise/2024/10/08/4-ways-to-say-no-and-manage-your-time-more-intentionally/,2024-10-08T16:05:47Z,"If you are overwhelmed and overextended at work, you may need to practice the time management tool of saying ""no"" more often.

Saying ""no"" doesn't come easy for many of us. Whether it's due to people-pleasing, fear of missing out, or underestimating the time tasks will take, we often overextend ourselves. Current work cultures promote collaboration and helping others while at the same time cultivating the idea of continuous growth by adding new responsibilities. It all makes us feel bad for saying no or declining a meeting, but our day never ends. These tendencies can lead to burnout, diminished productivity, and the inability to focus on your most important work.

Developing the ability to set boundaries and decide intentionally how to use your time is a way to balance collaboration and growth with self-care.

One key reason we tend to say ""yes"" more often than ""no"" is the immediate emotional relief people-pleasing provides, easing the discomfort of potential conflict. However, instead of viewing it as conflict, reframe the conversation as an honest assessment of whether you're the best person for the task. If you're unable to complete it on time or lack the expertise, your candid feedback might be more helpful than forcing a ""yes."" Being upfront allows you and the other party to collaborate on finding the best way forward.

Learning to say no doesn't have to be black and white. Ask questions before agreeing to a task so that you fully understand what it entails. Consider the following spectrum:

It's useful when a request clearly doesn't align with your priorities or workload. For example, ""I'm currently focused on other projects and won't be able to take this on right now,"" or ""No, it is not my expertise"".

If the request is important but requires boundaries, use this option. For example, ""Yes, but I can only dedicate an hour to this project, so I won't be able to deliver the full scope."" or ""I can't handle this entire task, but I'm happy to help with a small portion.""

This is useful when assessing whether the task fits your priorities. You can say, ""Yes, maybe -- let me check my schedule and get back to you."" or you can ask what piece of the tasks is more urgent, and you can propose a timeline based on your possibilities.

Vasundhara Sawhney describes in her Harvard Business Review article some other ways to respond depending on who is requesting it.

Saying ""no"" is not only about accepting or declining tasks but also about meetings, emails and events. Before accepting any meetings, find out if:

Studies show that more than 85% of their time is spent in meetings. And the worst part is half of them are unproductive.

Email management works the same way. If you feel like you shouldn't be copied or you are not interested, ask to be removed, hit unsubscribe or use Sanebox to clean your inbox.

One easy way to help you prioritize is by visualizing your workload. Tools like timeboxing or scheduling tasks on your calendar or tools like Sunsama can help you see your commitments more clearly. Visualizing your day in scheduled blocks instead of to-do list items makes it easier to recognize when you're overbooked and need to say no. By assigning specific times to your tasks, you force yourself to prioritize what truly matters. If a new request comes in and you don't have a time slot for it, you know it's time to say ""no"" or ""yes, but.""

When you say no to tasks that don't align with your core responsibilities, you're saying yes to being more productive, focused, and valuable. It is not about being unhelpful; it's about protecting your time and energy so you can do your best work."
How CFOs Are Preparing For The Future Amid Election Uncertainty,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cfo/2024/10/08/how-cfos-are-preparing-for-the-future-amid-election-uncertainty/,2024-10-08T16:05:40Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

CFOs are taking on bigger leadership roles and more responsibility throughout the business world. A new IDC InfoBrief study commissioned by Billtrust that focuses on the order-to-cash area of business shows one area in which CFOs are leading: AI adoption.

The study surveyed several top leaders in businesses, which included some CFOs. Nearly nine in 10 respondents said CFOs are becoming more critical to their organizations because of the economic downturn and financial uncertainty, and almost as many said that digital transformation across the OTC process is critical to the survival of their businesses. More CFOs agreed that digital transformation is needed, and more are optimistic about generative AI's potential to bring some of that transformation. Two-thirds of CFOs said generative AI will have a large impact on their organization, as opposed to 59% of all people surveyed. And 44% of CFOs said generative AI will help them do their jobs faster, 9% more than the 35% of all surveyed positions.

These results show that it's time to let CFOs lead on generative AI. They've researched the possibilities and know what it can do. And as a virtue of their position and expertise, they know the financial and strategic options their companies should take to weather the current uncertainty. Companies that want to see the financial part of their business become more effective and efficient should give the CFO the respect the position is now commanding. A bonus: Other studies have shown that CFOs who are able to lead on company strategy tend to significantly outperform their peers.

Deloitte conducts a quarterly CFO survey and found in its latest results that 58% think next month's election will be at least very consequential to their organizations. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global and U.S. leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what this means for CFO planning in Q4 and beyond. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are still open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Last month, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs, a huge increase over economists' estimates of 150,000, according to government data released on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, an improvement of a tenth of a point over August. This level of job growth didn't just happen in September. The government revised its summertime job growth figures, adding 55,000 more jobs to July's total -- reaching 144,000 jobs -- and 17,000 more jobs to August, for a total of 159,000.

The upbeat job data also turned the stock market upwards on Friday, but markets came crashing down Monday afternoon as crude oil prices and government bond yields rose to multiweek highs. Monday was the anniversary of the current Israel and Hamas war in the Middle East, which has recently escalated to include Lebanon and Iran, and has sent defense stocks and oil prices up. The rise in bond yields has been somewhat unexpected, though some analysts have predicted it's in response to increasing oil prices, while others have predicted it's responding to the dwindling likelihood of another big interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets early next month.

According to CME FedWatch, 88.2% of economists now believe interest rates will be cut by a quarter percent, with the remaining 11.8% not expecting a rate cut at all. Forbes' Derek Saul talked with Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, an alternate member of the Open Market Committee, about what he'll be paying attention to as the Fed closes out the year. The unemployment rate going forward is important, he said. ""After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?""

Last week, organized labor seemingly notched another victory as 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association returned to work, reopening 36 East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports after a three-day strike. On Thursday, the U.S. Maritime Alliance offered a 62% wage increase over six years and extended the current union contract until January 15, 2025, to allow for further negotiation.

The contract extension means that the nation's ports will remain open for Q4 -- which includes the presidential election and the all-important holiday shopping season. But the new contract isn't even fully negotiated yet, so it's hard to say whether port workers will ultimately support it. Port workers wanted a 77% wage increase and a ban on many kinds of automation. There are no proposals made public from USMX on automation, and as Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly notes, it's a huge issue for the union. The cranes used to remove containers from cargo ships and move them to wherever they need to go next can be automated, meaning fewer people are needed to do the work. Union members are essentially negotiating for their job security -- at least for the time being.

Meanwhile, Boeing is back at the bargaining table with members of the International Association of Machinists union, though local news station KOMO reported negotiations appear to be at a standstill. More than 30,000 members of the union that work in the aerospace giant's factories have been off the job going on four weeks. In a note reported on by Quartz, analysts at Oxford Economics wrote the Boeing strike could impact GDP growth in Q4, similar to the aftermath of Hurricane Helene -- which caused a wide swath of devastation in the Carolinas and Florida.

The roller coaster ride for Nvidia stock continues, with the company surging to become the world's second most valuable, surpassing Microsoft, on Monday. At the close of markets on Monday, Nvidia was worth $3.132 trillion. Nvidia's stock and market capitalization has seen dramatic rises and falls in the last month and a half. After its most recent earnings report at the end of August -- in which the AI processor company delivered record earnings and smashed expectations -- its stock price tumbled because it didn't project as much growth in the next quarter as some might have wanted to see. But since then, relatively small events have caused Nvidia's stock to spike. At a Goldman Sachs conference in mid-September, CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Nvidia's soon-to-come Blackwell processors was ""so great,"" leading the stock value to pop 8%. And another leap in value came last week when Huang said on a CNBC interview that demand for the new chip was ""insane."" Monday's rally came courtesy of Super Micro Computer's announcement that sales for its liquid cooling products alongside Nvidia's GPUs were strong. This seems to be proof that the AI effect is still strong on markets. The sell off in August looked like investors were stepping back until they saw that Nvidia was worth the share price. But their behavior since then -- buying up the stock whenever there is any potentially positive news -- shows they are still overly eager about the technology's possibilities.

Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey showed that most people in the position view November's election as consequential to their organizations. Even if there weren't an election featuring two candidates with wildly differing policy ideas, there are a host of significant geopolitical and economic issues CFOs need to deal with. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what that might mean. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

Considering the state of U.S. politics, geopolitics and the economy, was there anything surprising about how CFOs responded to the survey?

Gallucci: There were some things that we pulled from the data that were interesting. For example, while CFOs are still very risk averse -- less than 15% said that this was a good time to take risk -- a lot of them were actually upbeat quarter-on-quarter around the capital markets. This data was collected before the rate cut, but there was a strong expectation [of one], and all signals indicated that rates will continue to trend downward in the next four quarters. That was a pivot over the last seven or eight quarters, as rates were rising, the capital markets were very inactive. When capital markets are inactive, there's less capital spending, there's less M&A.

More than half -- 58% -- said the election will be at least very consequential for their businesses. How does that impact how CFOs run their businesses and planning?

On the day-to-day running of the business, that particular stat has not shifted. In the longer term, a lot of scenario planning is happening. When you step back and think about where we might be from a policy perspective in six months to a year, it could look different from a tariff perspective. It could look different from a labor perspective.

CFOs more broadly have built into their psyche, [and] they approach their roles with an expectation that there will be shocks to the system that come from all angles: geopolitical shocks, certainly elections. [About] 45% of the world's GDP is electing a new leader this year. CFOs have built in an attribute of being agile and able to pivot. If you trace that back, you're going to go to the pandemic. That shock threw everybody for a loop. We haven't had a world pandemic in a hundred years, per se. [Consider] how that impacted business and supply chains, particularly things like semiconductors and computer chips, and being able to get that type of product. When you lob on top of that some of the geopolitical conflicts that we've been dealing with the last couple of years, all have contributed to a much more dynamic type of environment that chief financial officers across all industries and sectors have had to manage.

Do you think most CFOs have been expecting this wildly changing stock market, and are considering that when they're looking ahead?

Without question. They're looking at a whole host of factors in terms of making decisions around capital spending, M&A, new projects. [There is] a lot of variability in all those areas -- the economy, geopolitics, consumer spending -- which gets back to some of the data that we're taking in around being less risk averse, less bullish, et cetera. You put all these factors in a basket and then you have to make business decisions.

Let's take interest rates, for example. As the Fed was on a plan to raise interest rates to fight inflation, there was a lot of unpredictability: When is it going to peak? When is it going to top out? What we have right now is a little more clarity in terms of it's on the way down. They've stated that they want to get to somewhere around two point half percent and the FOMC rate. That gives a little more certainty towards CFOs in that particular area of the private markets. They can start to plan around that. Once you have clarity in a particular area and a sense that things have less unpredictability, you'll start to see some more actions on the part of corporates and CFOs, specifically, around things like M&A and capital spending.

Some of these big question marks will be figured out six months from now. We will have another president. That person will be in office and their economic policies could be stabilizing. How do you see CFOs responding to a similar survey then?

If you look historically post-election, there's a little more certainty in terms of where things will go in the near to medium term. It's hard to handicap what all that will look like. We'll continue to be in a descending rate capital market. With that, you'll see all indications are a much more robust capital market in the way of M&A and bond issues and whatnot.

History would tell you that there could be some type of bounce and there could be more optimism. There could be another geopolitical conflict that could send the markets into a tizzy. We're dealing with things like natural disasters throughout the globe, and that has an impact. I have to hedge with what we know and we don't know.

5 Steps To Move From Entry-Level To The C-Suite In 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2024/10/08/5-steps-to-move-from-entry-level-to-the-c-suite-in-2024/,2024-10-08T16:05:38Z,"Where do you see yourself in three, five, or even 10-15 years?

Although not everyone aspires to the C-suite or desires to work in leadership and management, you're reading this article because you're at the starting point of your career and wondering how to climb the ladder to a chief executive position or similar role.

What steps should you take, and what actions are necessary now so that you can position yourself for success as a senior business leader in the future?

First, you should remember that every professional's career path is different -- not everyone will have a perfectly linear career journey. As such, it's essential to refrain from comparing your experience and journey to others, as there are many variables ranging from education, background, experience, specific skill sets, abilities, and available networking opportunities.

Next, follow these recommendations:

To work in a senior leadership position, you must know the market your company operates in, inside and out. You must also master the role you are already working in so that you can be top of mind for a promotion when the time is right. You need to be comfortable with key terminologies in your organization and industry and familiarize yourself with ongoing and past trends.

Understand where your entry-level role lies in the ""big picture,"" and learn to be efficient in mastering your craft and perfecting your technical skills so that your performance is consistently high. In this way, you lead by example by modeling this behavior to your team while also positioning yourself where your manager is most likely to notice your work and recommend you for a raise or promotion.

Leadership isn't solely for executives. Leadership skills are needed across organizations to work together proactively and be more innovative, enabling enhanced productivity.

Identify your leadership skills gap and set out to creatively find ways to learn and develop them in real life. Practice them within your entry-level job. It could be as simple as working on your interpersonal and communication skills to build emotional intelligence or as complex as learning negotiation, project management, and conflict resolution skills.

Next, it is essential that you invest in your career development towards the long-term goal of being a senior-level executive by investing your time and resources to make it happen.

Carve out an hour a week and extra time during quieter periods to commit to learning something new about your industry or leadership so that you can develop business acumen. Take business management, strategy, or leadership courses, earn certifications, and attend conferences, webinars, and training seminars.

Explore your employer's continuous professional development offering to see what resources might be available for you to learn new leadership skills, and of course, discuss your professional goals with your boss to see if your employer would invest in your learning and development externally.

Within the C-suite, you will always be aware of what is happening across different parts of the organization. Gaining this exposure early will tremendously benefit your career, give you a holistic view of your work, and give you an appetite to specialize in specific areas that you may not have initially thought you would be interested in.

For example, you might be working in an entry-level role in the finance department, but through exposure to the procurement side, you realize that procurement is more of an interest to you, and you decide to work your way up the ladder through that section of the business instead.

Gaining cross-functional experience also helps you broaden your expertise and stretch your communication skills because it forces you to interact with team members you are not usually engaged with. To gain this level of exposure, ask your manager to assign you to projects and stretch assignments that require you to work and collaborate with multiple teams and departments, and always keep an eye out for new projects or focus groups so you can volunteer.

At the C-suite level, you will be engaging with senior-level stakeholders frequently. Therefore, it helps if you already have a strong roster of business contacts that you can tap into. Focus on strategically adding contacts to your LinkedIn profile from within your industry and market, and regularly attend business networking events.

Strategically cultivating solid business relationships can be your USP (unique selling point) when a senior leadership job opening arises, especially if the company wants to expand into new markets and you have contacts in those areas.

Finally, remember to make yourself vocal and visible at work and in your industry. Even though you're working in an entry-level job, you still need to observe trends and statistics and weigh in with your unique perspectives. This is how you build thought leadership and credibility and eventually earn the respect and trust of other industry professionals and those within your company's market.

By following each of these five steps, you will increase your chances of landing a C-suite role. Even if you don't secure the coveted position, the steps above will equip you to start and lead your own business venture."

NASA Spacecraft Captures Dramatic 'Zen Gardens' On Mars,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/amandakooser/2024/10/08/nasa-spacecraft-captures-dramatic-zen-gardens-on-mars/,2024-10-08T16:05:26Z,"When it comes to Mars, there's room to appreciate both the science and beauty of the red planet. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft has been a star when it comes to helping researchers visualize and understand Mars. Sometimes it sends back images that veer into the poetic. That's the case with a recent view of Daedalia Planum snapped from orbit. ""This terrain looks as if it was raked into furrows like a Japanese dry garden,"" the MRO team wrote in an image-of-the-day feature for Oct. 7.

Daedalia Planum was born from lava flows from Arsia Mons, a large volcano in the Tharsis region of Mars. The MRO team pointed out bright boulders arranged in curving rows in the image, saying the formations also resemble fingerprints. A closer view highlights the whorl-like patterns in the landscape.

These patterns have not been seen anywhere else on Mars. ""Some process has evidently sorted and segregated the larger boulders from the finer soil,"" the team said. ""Exactly what that process is presents a perplexing puzzle.""

The fascinating landscape was spotted at an elevation of 17,900 feet. For comparison, that's a little shy of Denali's 20,310 feet in Alaska. The Tharsis region of Mars was once a hotspot for volcanic activity. Spacecraft have been studying the area for years. The European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft captured a wide view of the region and its varied and unusual terrain.

Japanese Zen gardens on Earth are created by raking sand or gravel into curving patterns that interact with features like rocks, trees and plants. So how did this odd pattern shake out on Mars? The MRO team described the concept of ""grain size convection"" where grains of varying sizes can be separated and sorted out from each other when subject to vibrations or freeze-thaw cycles. That may be what's happening with the Daedalia Planum boulders and soil. ""Seismic shaking of Daedalia Planum could take place if the interior of Tharsis is still active and rumbling,"" the MRO team said.

MRO has been orbiting Mars since 2006. It's older than NASA's two active Mars rovers, Curiosity and Perseverance. The image comes from the spacecraft's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment, more succinctly known as the HiRise camera. The HiRise team at the University of Arizona delivers a daily image along with science explanations and musings. The ""Zen gardens"" view was captured by the spacecraft in late August.

With multiple spacecraft orbiting Mars and rovers on the ground, Mars is one of the most explored planets in our solar system. Scientists have delved into the planet's history of water and its geologic processes. Our rovers are getting us closer to understanding whether or not the red planet might have hosted microbial life in its deep past. As much as we know, there is still more to learn. The fingerprint-like whorls of Daedalia Planum are on the list of unknowns. As the MRO team said, ""How these 'Zen gardens' form on Mars remains a mystery, for now."""
North Carolina 2024 Trump-Harris Polls: Near Tie In The New 7th Swing State,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/08/north-carolina-2024-trump-harris-polls-near-tie-in-the-new-7th-swing-state/,2024-10-08T16:05:22Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris could become only the second Democratic presidential candidate to win North Carolina in more than 40 years as the state has slowly shifted more to the left over the past decade -- with polls showing her and former President Donald Trump in a dead heat in the state.

Whether scandals surrounding GOP gubernatorial candidate, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, could hurt Trump's chances in North Carolina. Trump endorsed Robinson prior to a CNN report revealing a string of racist and derogatory comments he allegedly made on a pornographic website chat forum before his entrance into politics, including referring to himself as a ""Black NAZI."" Polls taken after the Sept. 19 story show Democratic candidate Josh Stein has widened his lead over Robinson, to as many as 19 points in a recent Emerson College survey. A CNN/SSRS poll released Sept. 27 also found Robinson trailing Stein by 17 points and a tie between Trump and Harris, suggesting Robinson's scandals haven't affected Trump's standing there. Historically, the demise of down-ballot candidates rarely drag down the affiliated party's presidential candidate, CNN notes.

16. That's how many electoral college votes North Carolina has, after gaining a vote after the 2020 census. The state has the eighth most electoral votes in the country, tied with Georgia.

Despite the electorate's increasingly Democratic leanings, Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers of the legislature, giving it the power to override Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's vetoes.

North Carolina has only voted for one Democratic presidential candidate since 1980: Barack Obama in 2008.

Harris holds an advantage over Trump in almost all of the seven battleground states, according to the Bloomberg News/Morning Consult survey showing her leading among likely voters by seven points in Nevada, five in Pennsylvania, three in Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin, and two in North Carolina, with a tie in Georgia. Trump also trails Harris in most recent national surveys and now leads him by two points overall, according to RealClearPolitics' polling average. North Carolina was the only swing state where Biden lost to Trump (by one point) in 2020.

Time Warp Returns For 26 Hours Of Techno Music Dominating Dancefloors,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisakocay/2024/10/08/time-warp-returns-for-26-hours-of-techno-music-dominating-dancefloors/,2024-10-08T16:05:19Z,"Techno: A universal language. No matter your native tongue, the myriad beats that define the genre can be understood by all. By cultivating emotions, causing movement, forming sounds and generating beauty, techno transcends language barriers.

What better way to celebrate it than with 26 hours of raving? But where can one find that much techno?

At Time Warp.

The acclaimed techno brand takes over Mannheim, Germany's Maimarkthalle and Maimarktclub venues on October 25th and October 26th for two days of warehouse-ready techno. The premier party boasts 12 hours of music on one dancefloor on the opening day, and the second day will see performances spanning across two floors for 14 hours -- with a real time warp taking place as the clocks will reset to CET/winter time then.

The Friday show is in celebration of the 60th birthday of Sven Väth, whom Robin Ebinger, managing director of Time Warp, says is the German godfather of techno. The tastemaker first performed at Time Warp in 1995 and has since become part of the top techno brand's family. The other artists who will grace the stage that night are Nina Kraviz, Cassy and Keinemusik members &ME and Rampa. In addition, there will be a rare back-to-back set from Charlotte de Witte and Enrico Sangiuliano.

Day two's lineup is equally star-studded, featuring artists such as Indira Paganotto, Adam Beyer, Vintage Culture, Deborah de Luca and Lovefoxy. There will also be a groove-inducing back-to-back set with Somewhen and Øtta. The Saturday event, along with all of the brand's editions this year, is in honor of Time Warp's 30th anniversary.

The lineup for both nights showcases some of the most established names in techno and highlights emerging acts. As a result of having such a blend of artists, generations of techno talents will take the stage, spinning the latest hits and the greatest throwbacks, all for the collective love of techno.

This month's edition of Time Warp follows its last installment, which took place on April 5th and April 6th at Maimarkthalle and Maimarktclub, with stages also set up in numerous tents created by the festival. The two-day event featured stellar sets by the likes of multiple artists, such as Adam Beyer, Joseph Capriati, Pan-Pot, Karotte, Sven Väth, Nina Kraviz, Marco Carola, Richie Hawtin, Laurent Garnier, Clara Cuvé, Indira Paganotto, I Hate Models, Kobosil and Mochakk. In addition, April's Time Warp drew around 30,000 visitors worldwide to dance with over 70 artists for nearly 30 hours.

The April party and this month's forthcoming festival show how techno has evolved. The genre was initially male-dominated and still is to this day, but not as stark as it was in the beginning. Ebinger says that diversity, not only in gender but also in race and sexuality, is essential for the brand.

""The early sounds of Time Warp reflected the scene at the time, with line-ups that were mostly male-led,"" he says. ""As time has progressed, we as a global events brand recognized this early on and have since given a more natural balance to our events. Our bookings are now representative of talent across a diverse scene of all genders, races and sexualities. The 30th-anniversary lineup [for Time Warp in April], as an example, included artists such as Anfisa Letyago, leading Brazilian techno export ANNA, Palestinian inspiration Sama' Abdulhadi, Detroit's first lady DJ Holographic, the blazing sounds of young Spaniard Indira Paganotto, Chicago originator Honey Dijon and UK party starter Jayda G, to name just a few.

The festival is also diverse in design, as each floor will showcase a different look and feel by using music, lights, videos, fabrics with technology, architecture and art -- giving each floor the essence of being its own club. ""We try to create and shape the dancefloors in order to intensify the experience of music,"" Ebinger says. ""So it's not just about having a very good sound system and a spectacular stage, but having the symbiosis of the entire dancefloor of sound, of light, of visuals, of fabrics that build the decoration of the room we give.""

Ebinger says that while the event is large in scale, it has a ""family feel"" because the dancefloor's design and lighting ""enhances the experience for attendees, making them feel connected to the music and each other."" He says this sense of community is further enriched by the number of fans, artists and industry members who attend, especially when people from more than 80 countries attend the festival.

""It's always very rewarding when you realize that so many people from all corners of the world make an effort to come to Manheim because 20 people in the office here have an idea about setting up a party,"" Ebinger says. ""Then you realize these people come from so far away places, and they spend hours planning the trip or preparing for the show. Then they come to the venue, and when the doors open, they bring all their joy, their excitement, their energy and their euphoria to the place. To realize this again and again and again on the very day [of Time Warp] -- that's very special and always a very nice memory.""

Not only has Time Warp helped Maimarkthalle achieve cult status, but the city of Mannheim has been named a UNESCO City of Music. Some may argue that the brand is one of the pioneering institutions to bring techno to wider audiences. The last part, ""bring techno to wider audiences,"" certainly proves true as the global brand hosts parties in four countries -- São Paulo, Madrid, New York and, of course, Germany -- and plans to expand to a fifth country in 2025. Indeed, Time Warp proves to be a mecca for techno.

Ebinger says the renowned festival has changed since its birth 30 years ago. He says techno -- created in Detroit during the mid-'80s by artists such as Juan Atkins, Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson -- was still considered underground during the early days of its existence. Then, the Love Parade happened in Berlin in 1989. What was initially conceived as a demonstration of peace, love and tolerance quickly grew into the Love Parade being one of the world's most famous and largest techno festivals and street parties. Ebinger says this caused techno to enter the mainstream media and become over-commercialized.

Ebinger says the genre had to redefine itself somehow. He adds that this has happened various times throughout the years due to new artists entering the scene, new genres being created, new productions being crafted and more. All of this, he says, inspires the scene, artists and fans, sparking more interest in techno at certain times throughout its history. Regardless of techno's cyclical nature, one thing remains constant: for Ebinger and the Time Warp team, it's always been about the music and always will be.

""Our core is that we come from the dancefloor,"" Ebinger says. ""We were young, motivated guys affected by electronic music -- ravers at heart -- with the idea of creating our own vision of the perfect festival, the perfect event [to] make people dance. This is still there. [There is] this passion for the music, the passion to create these spaces, in this space called Time Warp, which is there only for 30 hours [for the April festival], to soak people in, give them a very special time, make them forget about time and space, experience the music and go home with a suitcase full of memories and beautiful encounters with people from all over the world."""
"Hungary's Orban interrupted, accused of 'selling out' country to Russia, China during EU news conference",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hungarys-orban-interrupted-accused-selling-out-country-russia-china-eu-news-conference,2024-10-08T16:04:12Z,"During the disruption, he yelled accusations at Orban, questioning how much he had ""sold out"" Hungary.

An activist and municipal councilor for a Hungarian opposition party disrupted a news conference in Strasbourg, France, on Tuesday as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was laying out his plans for Hungary's six-month presidency of the European Union.

The activist, Márton Gyekiczki, interrupted Orbán as he was speaking about his opposition to immigration, running toward the podium where Orbán sat and throwing a stack of what appeared to be banknotes at the prime minister.

""How much did you sell out the country for? How much did you sell out the country for, Mr. Prime Minister?"" Gyekiczki yelled as the papers scattered. ""He sold out to Putin, he sold out to Xi Jinping!"" -- referring to the leaders of Russia and China.

TRUMP TOUTS EUROPEAN 'STRONGMAN' AS CLOSE ALLY DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: WHO IS VIKTOR ORBAN?

The disruption came as Orbán was set to address the European Parliament on Wednesday during Hungary's six-month rotating presidency of the bloc. His government has long been at odds with the EU over what it sees as his curtailing of democratic rights, and has increasingly come under fire for his close relations with autocracies like Russia and China.

Gyekiczki, the activist, who was taken to the ground by a security guard and led out of the room, is a member of Hungary's Democratic Coalition party and a local council member in a Budapest suburb.

The president of that party, former Prime Minister Ference Gyurcsány, later wrote on social media that he was ""proud"" of Gyekiczki for his actions.

""We will say it everywhere and always: Hungary has a traitorous government!"" he wrote.

Orbán is expected to receive a mixed reception in the EU parliament on Wednesday. Many lawmakers have pushed for his government to be deprived of EU funds over what they see as rule-of-law and corruption violations.

HUNGARY LAUNCHES EU PRESIDENCY WITH TRUMP-LIKE CALL TO 'MAKE EUROPE GREAT AGAIN'

Two years ago, the parliament declared that Hungary under Orbán had become ""a hybrid regime of electoral autocracy,"" taking it out of the community of democracies.

Yet Orbán this year successfully formed the Patriots for Europe group within the parliament, uniting far-right parties from around the continent to form the third-largest group in the EU legislature.

During the news conference on Tuesday, Orbán lamented what he sees as a declining EU economy and lagging competitiveness with the United States and China, saying that he saw that as ""the most serious challenge we have to face.""

He also argued against recently adopted EU tariffs on Chinese-produced electric vehicles, and railed against immigration which he said was resulting in the destruction of the EU's visa-free Schengen area as countries like Germany, Austria, Italy and Slovenia have introduced temporary border checks along their frontiers.

""These individual attempts will actually break up the Schengen system,"" Orbán said, adding that he proposed a regular ""Schengen Summit"" for member countries to meet and discuss border policy.

Responding to the disruption by the activist, Orbán offered ""a word of explanation for Hungarian political culture.""

""When a Hungarian politician tells another one that he is a scoundrel, all it means in our culture is that 'I disagree with you,'"" he said."

A misplaced arm position can skew blood pressure readings,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5145785/blood-pressure-reading-arm-position-hypertension,2024-10-08T16:02:49Z,"A patient's arm should be supported at around heart level when taking blood pressure readings. Tunvarat Pruksachat/Moment RF/Getty Images hide caption

Think back to the last time you had your blood pressure taken.

How were you sitting? Where exactly was the cuff? And what specifically was your arm doing?

It's such a familiar ritual of going to the doctor's office that most of us scarcely think about the ins and outs, but in reality even small missteps can leave you with an inaccurate reading.

Research has shown that can happen for all kinds of reasons. The cuff size may be incorrect. A patient's legs are crossed or dangling from the exam table. Simply the stress of being in the clinic, what's known as ""white coat hypertension,"" can spike the numbers.

Now add to the list a relatively common faux pas: holding your arm in the wrong position.

A trial from researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that simply deviating from the guidelines for arm position could lead to an overestimate of a patient's blood pressures.

The inflated readings could be substantial enough to even lead to a misdiagnosis of hypertension and decisions to start medication, says Dr. Tammy Brady, a professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and senior author of the study, which was published in JAMA Internal Medicine on Monday.

""People take blood pressure screening for granted,"" says Brady, ""But a lot of decisions are made based on what that reading is on the device.""

In the trial, more than 130 adults had their blood pressure measured in three different scenarios, all using an automated device.

The first stuck to the guidelines: Their arm was supported, in this case resting on a desk, with the cuff positioned at about ""mid-heart level"" on their arm.

The other two, however, strayed from the protocol in ways that Brady sees quite often in clinical practice, with the arm either resting on the patient's lap or hanging at their side. Both positions produced substantial overestimates of blood pressure.

A patient's arm resting in their lap could erroneously bump up both the top and bottom number -- known as the systolic and diastolic pressure respectively -- by about 4 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), which is the unit of measurement for blood pressure.

The phenomenon was even more pronounced when the arm was resting at their side. That position increased the systolic by 6.5 mmHg, and the bottom by 4.4 mmHg.

While it may not sound like a huge swing, it's concerning that a data point used to evaluate risk for cardiovascular disease could be misleading because of seemingly small oversights.

For example, a patient whose systolic blood pressure is 128 mmHg -- which is in the elevated range between 120 and 129 -- a misplaced arm could inadvertently lead them to be classified as solidly in the hypertensive range, which starts at 130.

""This is very basic, but hopefully reminds everybody it really does matter,"" says Brady, whose team has conducted several studies on how blood pressure readings can go awry, ""Somebody could be prescribed medication who doesn't need it at all.""

Guidelines for measuring blood pressure outline a series of steps for getting the most accurate reading: It's supposed to be quiet, the patient needs to wait five minutes before the measurement is taken, go to the bathroom ahead of time, keep their feet flat on the floor, their back should be supported, among other requirements.

""Even though we've known what to do for a long time, implementing all of this in a real world setting has been tricky,"" says Dr. Stephen Juraschek, director of the Hypertension Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.

It's no surprise that some of these details fall by the wayside in the daily rush to see patients, but research also suggests new physicians aren't being trained well enough. Another major obstacle is the layout of the exam rooms themselves, which often doesn't make it easy for blood pressure to be taken properly. (Even Brady says she has to do some rearranging of the furniture before seeing patients.)

Juraschek says this latest research makes it abundantly clear that proper arm position is ""essential.""

In his experience, a dangling arm is usually not an isolated problem. These errors can cluster together and compound the inaccuracies.

""I've seen people with a net reduction of like 20 mmHG,"" he says, ""We're talking about a decision to start or not start therapy, so I think when you start adding up all of these features, it can really have a consequential impact on patients."""
Cubs Awaiting Bellinger's Call On Opt-Out Clause For 2025,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/philrogers/2024/10/08/cubs-awaiting-bellingers-call-on-opt-out-clause-for-2025/,2024-10-08T16:01:46Z,"""Same Time, Next Year"" was an Alan Alda, Ellen Burstyn romantic comedy that was popular back when Sharon Dunston was the Cubs' best player. The expression, however, describes the current-era team, which is once again in a holding pattern awaiting Cody Bellinger's decision on whether to return to Chicago.

The three-year deal that brought the 2019 NL MVP back to the Cubs last February included buyout clause for the 2025 and '26 seasons. It's unclear if Bellinger is going to stay put with two years and $52.5 million remaining on the deal or look to enter free agency for the third year in a row.

Given the development of first baseman Michael Busch and center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong -- both of whom outproduced Bellinger in WAR last season -- there is less urgency to the situation than there was a year ago. But the decision comes with a major impact on the budget, given the desire to add a starting pitcher and a veteran catcher.

The Cubs expected to be serious contenders for an NL Central title after going 83-79 in 2023. They raised the Opening Day payroll from $184.2 million to $214.4 million but finished 10 games behind Milwaukee, needing a 28-19 run to the wire to again win 83 games.

Bellinger hit .266 with 18 home runs, 78 RBIs and a .752 OPS. His rWAR dropped from 4.4 to 2.2 but that's still his second best season in the last five years. Bellinger started 47 games in center field, 46 in right field and 12 at first base while being used at designated hitter 24 times. He's not the same fielder he was when he won four consecutive Gold Gloves but he's solid everywhere he plays, which would figure to make him attractive to any team looking to add a left-handed bat in the middle of the order.

Surprisingly, one consideration for Bellinger is how Wrigley Field has become a difficult park for hitters.

The Cubs had a .670 OPS with 78 homers at home compared to .747 and 92 on the road last season. Bellinger played his part in those totals, hitting .247 with a .700 OPS and only eight home runs in 243 at-bats at Wrigley.

Bellinger projects as the starting right fielder if he returns to the Cubs, moving Seiya Suzuki into a new role as the primary DH. But president/baseball Jed Hoyer and GM Carter Hawkins have a ton of internal options as they explore ways to inject fresh legs into a veteran lineup.

Vice President Kamala Harris told the co-hosts of ""The View"" on Tuesday that she couldn't think of anything significant she would have done differently from President Biden in the last four years.

""We're obviously two different people,"" Harris said, answering a question from co-host Sunny Hostin about what the biggest ""specific"" difference would be between a potential Harris presidency and a Biden presidency. ""One of the issues I'm focused on is what we do with home healthcare.""

The vice president scheduled multiple interviews for Tuesday, including ""The View,"" Stephen Colbert and radio host Howard Stern. It's Harris' first appearance on the liberal ABC News show since becoming the Democratic nominee.

""If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?"" Hostin followed up.

Harris responded, ""there is not a thing that comes to mind.""

""The work we have done to invest in American industries whether it be, in terms of manufacturing, and creating almost 800,000 new jobs around manufacturing, those were all a shared priority,"" she said.

Later in the segment, while discussing health insurance policies, Harris said she planned to have a Republican in her cabinet and said that would be a difference between herself and President Biden, should she become the president.

Harris joined the co-hosts in early January for an interview on the show and admitted she was ""scared as heck"" of a Trump victory in 2024. At the time, Biden was the presumptive nominee, but he dropped out of the race in July and Harris quickly replaced him at the top.

PA gov takes victory lap after Supreme Court rejects GOP bid to overturn election law 'usurpations',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pa-gov-takes-victory-lap-after-supreme-court-rejects-gop-bid-overturn-election-law-usurpations,2024-10-08T15:59:03Z,"Fox News host Sean Hannity analyzes 2024 election polls and Vice President Kamala Harris' upcoming interviews on 'Hannity.'

The U.S. Supreme Court rejected hearing a Republican-backed challenge to an executive order signed by President Biden that works to broaden voting access and registration, just roughly one month before Election Day.

The Supreme Court reconvened Monday for its 2024-2025 term and rejected a bevvy of cases, including one backed by dozens of Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania who claimed President Biden's 2021 executive order on voter access was unconstitutional and attempted to interfere with the election. The lawsuit also targeted an edict from Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro for enacting automatic voter registration across the state.

The justices did not comment when rejecting the appeal.

Shapiro's office took a victory lap following the Supreme Court's rejection of hearing the case, calling GOP efforts a ""bad faith attempt"" to disenfranchise voters.

""This petition was yet another bad faith attempt to disenfranchise Pennsylvania voters - and the U.S. Supreme Court made the right decision to deny the Pennsylvania Freedom Caucus petition,"" Shapiro spokesman Manuel Bonder told Fox News Digital on Tuesday.

GOP STATE LAWMAKERS APPEAL TO SCOTUS TO CHALLENGE BIDEN'S 'USURPATIONS' OF THEIR POWER TO RUN ELECTIONS

""Governor Shapiro has consistently fought to protect our democracy - including defeating Donald Trump and his allies in court dozens of times to defend Pennsylvanians' votes and protect access to the ballot box. Yesterday, election deniers went 0-2 at the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Bonder said.

Biden signed the executive order on Promoting Access to Voting in March 2021, which directs federal agencies to expand access to voter registration, works to overhaul the government's Vote.gov website, and notes that the federal government has a ""duty to ensure that registering to vote and the act of voting be made simple and easy for all those eligible to do so.""

DOJ 'STONEWALLING' REQUESTS FOR DETAILS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF BIDEN'S 'FEDERAL ELECTION SCHEME'

Executive Order 14019 states that ""executive departments and agencies should partner with State, local, Tribal, and territorial election officials to protect and promote the exercise of the right to vote, eliminate discrimination and other barriers to voting, and expand access to voter registration and accurate election information.""

The executive order set off a firestorm of criticism among Republicans, most notably with 27 Republican Pennsylvania lawmakers filing a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality, Fox News Digital previously reported.

The lawmakers argued that the executive order essentially serves as an executive get-out-the-vote effort targeting demographics that would benefit the Democratic Party. They argued the move was unconstitutional as Congress never enacted a law that grants such an action from the White House.

A federal judge rejected the lawsuit in March, citing it lacked legal standing, setting up a legal showdown in the U.S. Supreme Court.

""We think it's really important for President Biden to be held accountable,"" Erick Kaardal, an attorney for the lawmakers, told Fox News Digital in April.

""For him to violate such a big law when all the little people have to follow the laws, even little laws ... it's clear President Biden has issued an executive order without congressional enactments to get himself re-elected. It's ridiculous,"" Kaardal added.

BIDEN'S GET-OUT-THE-VOTE EXECUTIVE ORDER CHALLENGED, HEADING TO SUPREME COURT: 'TARGET WELFARE POPULATIONS'

In their petition filed to the Supreme Court in April, the Republican lawmakers asked the court to weigh in on the case. They argued that, for the 2024 election, they cannot ""do their part"" in suing to stop ""federal and state executive usurpations of Pennsylvania state law, pursuant to the Elections Clause and Electors Clause, unless the Court does its part and declares individual state legislator standing in this case.""

The lawmakers had called on the Supreme Court to bypass the federal appeals court, and determine if they have standing to bring the case ahead of the 2024 election.

Following the court's rejection of the case, Shapiro's office told Fox Digital that the governor is zeroed-in on ""protecting our democracy and ensuring our elections are free, fair, safe, and secure.""

House GOP targets Biden 'social cost' policy for rising energy prices,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-gop-targets-biden-social-cost-policy-rising-energy-prices,2024-10-08T15:58:59Z,"FIRST ON FOX - House Republicans are moving to roll back a progressive Obama-era regulatory metric for greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that it's sandbagging the U.S. energy sector by using ""nonscientific"" standards.

""North Carolinians are struggling to fill up their tanks and pay their electricity bills. The last thing they are worried about is the 'social cost' of energy,"" Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., told Fox News Digital.

""We need to be unleashing American energy to lower prices, not crippling production with burdensome, costly regulations.""

Hudson, who also chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, is leading 12 fellow GOP lawmakers in introducing a bill to stop federal agencies using the ""social cost of carbon"" when creating new regulations for the U.S. energy sector.

HOUSE PASSES BILL BLOCKING BIDEN ADMIN ATTEMPT TO REQUIRE TWO-THIRDS OF NEW CARS TO BE ELECTRIC WITHIN YEARS

Models calculating the ""social cost"" of greenhouse gases use several factors, including population health, sea level changes, economic impacts and other human-felt costs.

Because of the vastly different indicators, ""social cost"" emissions projections can vary widely, according to the Brookings Institute.

It was first used as a federal regulatory tool under the Obama administration but was rolled back by former President Trump.

President Biden made it part of his clean energy plan when he took office, directing a task force to study where federal agencies should consider the ""social cost of greenhouse gases"" as part of an executive order titled ""Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis.""

Democrats have held it up as a necessary tool that presents a more holistic picture for the long-term harms of carbon pollution.

Republicans, however, have criticized the metric as a nonscientific tool that's responsible for burdensome regulations.

Republican Study Committee Chair Kevin Hern, R-Okla., a co-sponsor of the bill, said the ""social cost"" metric and the Biden administration's green energy push overall was pushing gas prices up.

"Texas woman robbed, pistol-whipped in ritzy Dallas area by illegal Venezuelan migrants with gang ties: report",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-woman-robbed-gunpoint-ritzy-neighborhood-4-venezuelan-illegal-immigrants-gang-ties,2024-10-08T15:55:28Z,"Fox News' Brooke Taylor provides details on the Venezuelan gang violence in Dallas, Texas.

After a Texas woman was tied up, robbed at gunpoint and pistol-whipped in her Dallas home in late September, multiple Venezuelan men have been arrested and charged in connection with the incident.

The robbery occurred around 10 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 21, after the woman returned from dinner to her home in Bluffview, a neighborhood in Dallas where the average home price is more than $880,000, according to Zillow.

The men are accused of targeting the woman in her driveway, forcing her into her home and tying her up while pointing guns at her head, according to police records obtained by FOX 4 Dallas-Fort Worth. The men allegedly hit her in the head with a gun and threatened to cut off her fingers.

The suspects allegedly used Google Translate to communicate with the victim and made off with $75,000 worth of jewelry, a Gucci purse, a Ferragamo handbag, a Judith Leiber handbag, the victim's phone and coins from a wooden box, FOX 4 reported.

TEXAS MAN SUSPECTED OF AGGRAVATED ROBBERY AND THREATENING TO CUT OFF WOMAN'S FINGER ARRESTED

On Sept. 28, Dallas police arrested and charged 28-year-old Manuel Hernandez-Hernandez with aggravated robbery in connection with the incident, the department told Fox News Digital.

On Oct. 3, the Dallas Police Fugitive Unit executed an arrest warrant in Irving, Texas, with the assistance of Irving Police SWAT and Dallas Police SWAT, and arrested three other male suspects in connection with the same crime.

Those suspects are 20-year-old Yean Brayhan Torrealba-Sanabria, 34-year-old Carlos Alberto Martinez-Silva and 27-year-old Wilmer Jesus Colmenares-Gonzalez, who are also each charged with aggravated robbery.

'MOST RUTHLESS' MEXICAN CARTELS OPERATE IN ALL 50 STATES, BRING TURF WARS TO US: DEA

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokesperson told Fox News Digital that Hernandez-Hernandez is a citizen of Venezuela and entered the United States in March near the El Paso border ""without being inspected, admitted, or paroled by an Immigration Officer.""

On May 21, Hernandez-Hernandez pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated and was sentenced to three days' confinement, ICE said. Hernandez-Hernandez was also arrested by Colleyville police on Sept. 19 and released a day before the robbery occurred.

After his arrest on Sept 28, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Dallas placed an Immigration Detainer, Notice of Action, Form I-247 on Hernandez-Hernandez.

Dallas police linked Hernandez-Hernandez to the robbery after apparently finding his fingerprint on the wooden box from which the suspects allegedly stole several coins, according to FOX 4.

He allegedly admitted to the robbery and gave police the nicknames of the other suspects involved, but said he did not know their real names. One of the other suspects apparently contacted Hernandez-Hernandez via Facebook and asked him to meet up before the robbery occurred.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Saturday declared a state of emergency for 35 counties, including all of the Tampa Bay area, and warned of a ""flurry"" of evacuation orders. According to the Associated Press, Milton could trigger the biggest spate of evacuation orders in the state since 2017's Hurricane Irma -- where 7 million people were urged to leave their homes. Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, ordered evacuations for areas near Tampa Bay and for all mobile and manufactured homes by Tuesday night. Lee County, home to Fort Meyers, issued a mandatory evacuation order for the island of Fort Myers Beach. Other mandatory evacuation orders have been issued in Pinellas County, Pasco County and Manatee County. Volusia County has issued a curfew and enacted evacuation orders starting Wednesday morning and Marion County is under a mandatory evacuation order for mobile homes, RVs, and modular-type homes.

""I can say this without any dramatization whatsoever. If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you are going to die,"" Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told CNN.

Tampa International Airport closed at 9 a.m. Tuesday with plans to reopen ""as soon as it is safe"" later this week. Orlando International Airport will close at 8 a.m. Wednesday. Major U.S. airlines, including American, Delta, Southwest, United and JetBlue, are issuing travel waivers that will allow passengers flying through impacted airports to rebook without paying far differences. American Airlines' travel alert covers 12 airports in Florida, Delta's covers nine and Frontier covers eight. United Airlines' advisory covers travel to and from only five airports -- Key West, Orlando, Fort Myers, Sarasota/Bradenton and Tampa.

Walt Disney World Resort is currently open and operating as usual but Disney has announced some of its Orlando-area offerings will close Wednesday morning, including the Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground, Copper Creek Cabins at Disney's Wilderness Lodge and the Treehouse Villas at Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa. The company warned the attractions won't reopen until later in the week. Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando are also open and operating as usual, and both parks say they are monitoring the weather and will make adjustments as needed.

There is no such thing as a Category 6 hurricane. The National Hurricane Center uses the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale to classify storms, which ranks only up to a Category 5 and defines those storms as having sustained winds at or greater than 157 mph. Earlier this year, researchers with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Space Science and Engineering Center argued for adding a sixth storm category as climate change continues to intensify weather events. Under their proposal, Category 5 hurricanes would be redefined to encompass storms with sustained wind speeds between 157 and 192 mph and a new Category 6 would describe storms with wind speeds above 192 mph.

Milton is expected to arrive less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene, a major Category 4 storm, hit Florida on Sept. 26. Helene was the hardest hit for the Tampa Bay area from a hurricane in 103 years, according to the Associated Press. Despite staying offshore, Helene inundated parts of the area with several feet of storm surge. At least 20 people died in Florida from the storm, which then traveled 500 miles across the Southeastern U.S. and caused heavy flooding in the Carolinas, Georgia, Virginia and Tennessee. At least 230 people across six states died as a result of the hurricane, which was the deadliest to hit the continental U.S. since Katrina in 2005. Helene made landfall near Perry, Florida, approximately 160 miles north of Tampa, with winds of 140 mph before it was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved northward.

Milton will be the fifth hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. this year, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts 2024 will be one of the busiest hurricane seasons on record, estimating 8 to 13 hurricanes and between 4 and 7 major hurricanes.

Google To Stop Sharing Location Data With Law Enforcement,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2024/10/08/google-to-stop-sharing-location-data-with-law-enforcement/,2024-10-08T15:55:05Z,"Location data has become a valuable resource for both companies and law enforcement. Few understand this better than Google, whose Sensorvault database stores vast amounts of location data from users who have opted into its Location History service, recently rebranded as Timeline.

Although this database was created to enhance user experiences, it has come under scrutiny due to its use in geofence warrants. These warrants, which law enforcement agencies use to track individuals based on their proximity to crime scenes, raise significant questions about privacy and the extent of surveillance.

According to Spencer McInvaille, an expert in location forensics and Google Geofence warrants, ""Google will now migrate user data from the Sensorvault to the user's device. This would make it impossible for Google to search and return the user's location data to law enforcement. Once this change takes effect, law enforcement must identify the person and device from which they seek to obtain location data.""

Google's Sensorvault is a massive database that archives precise location data from users' mobile devices. The data, collected through GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cell tower signals, allows Google to build detailed profiles of where users go, how long they stay, and even the routes they take.

Users who enable Timeline on their Google accounts contribute to this dataset, which Google leverages to improve its services and provide personalized recommendations. However, the database also serves another, more controversial role, as it is frequently accessed by law enforcement through geofence warrants.

A geofence warrant is a request issued by law enforcement to obtain location data on all devices present at a specific place and time. Unlike traditional warrants, which target specific individuals, geofence warrants cast a wide net by focusing on a geographic area and timeframe, collecting data on anyone whose device was present during the specified period.

With increasing privacy concerns, Google has recently implemented changes that alter the way location data is stored. Location data is now kept directly on users' devices instead of within Google's servers, making the process for law enforcement to access it more complicated.

This change requires law enforcement to gain access to the phone itself, either through the phone's owner or by securing the phone in custody. This measure means geofence warrants alone will no longer provide the same broad level of access, as data retrieval will require the cooperation of the device's owner or physical possession of the phone."
Austrian Audio Unveils Its New And Affordable Hi-X20 Closed Back Headphones,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marksparrow/2024/10/08/austrian-audio-unveils-its-new-and-affordable-hi-x20-closed-back-headphones/,2024-10-08T15:55:03Z,"Today sees more interesting news from Austria, a country that punches well above its weight when it comes to audio with brands like Lewitt, AKG and Austrian Audio all originating in the nation's capital, Vienna. The latest product from Austrian Audio is the new Hi-X20 headphones, a fresh take on the brand's signature sound.

The Austrian Audio Hi-X20 are closed-back headphones in a compact and affordable package with the kind of high-precision sound that recording professionals and music lovers expect. They are the latest addition to the brand's family of closed-back headphones offering a detailed and high-precision sound that's ideal for day-to-day use when recording, mixing or just listening

Billed as a professional-grade pair of headphones, the Hi-X20 were designed as the result of customer feedback and they use the same proprietary Hi-X drivers found in all Austrian Audio's professional headphones. The sound is described as ""perfectly balanced in middle and high frequencies with a powerful but not overdrawn bass response.""

The Hi-X20 are a fresh take on Austrian Audio's sonic signature which can best be described as a classic pristine sound with an honest frequency response, fast transients and minimal distortion in the bass range.

With a sleek black and red aesthetic, the Hi-X20 also have robust metal hinges and a metal headband. The foldable design makes them easy to store or transport in a rucksack or bag. The smooth, memory foam padding should ensure years of reliable and comfortable listening.

Supplied with a detachable three-meter cable, the Hi-X20 are ideal for professionals who need flexibility when working. The extra-long cable makes it easy to move up and down a mixing desk and allows music lovers to sit back from their music system.

""The development of Hi-X20 was very much a collaborative effort with our customers who offered us thoughtful feedback,"" says Austrian Audio CEO Martin Seidl. ""The result is a different tuning and a fresh look that will appeal perfectly to audio professionals and musicians.""

I hope to have a pair of the Hi-X20 in for review within the next month or so. It will be interesting to hear if they sound as good as their marketing description.

Pricing & Availability: The Hi-X20 are now available priced at $149 / £119.99. In the UK, Austrian Audio's products are distributed by Sound Technology Ltd. In the rest of the world, consult the Austrian Audio website for your local distributor."
'Joker 2' Flop In 2024 Threatens Worst-Case Future For DC Studios,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2024/10/08/joker-2-flop-in-2024-threatens-worst-case-future-for-dc-studios/,2024-10-08T15:55:00Z,"As I forecast for you yesterday, Warner Bros. Discovery's and DC Studios' Joker: Folie à Deux came in below the widely projected $121.1 million worldwide box office. Expected to be among the year's biggest blockbusters, does the films status as 2024's biggest flop threaten a worst-case future for the rebooted DC cinematic universe?

The $119 million worldwide opening weekend for Joker: Folie à Deux, combined with terrible audience scores and equally bad critical reviews, means it will probably suffer above-average weekly declines, so don't expect the sub-50% drops other successful tentpoles like Deadpool & Wolverine and Inside Out 2 have enjoyed this year.

At this point, signs point toward a final cume in the $250-275 million range, depending a lot on weekday numbers, China's and Japan's contributions when the film opens in those markets, and exactly how bad the second weekend drop is.

I modeled based on a modest 60% decline, but if the bottom falls out at 70% for example then all bets are off and we are probably looking at right around a $200 million finish.

As bad as all of this already looks at face value, the result is worse when compared against Joker: Folie à Deux's enormous budget. Summer tentpole superhero team-up blockbusters typically have equal or lower budgets than this film's pre-deductions $200 million bill, and that's before marketing (although the studio avoided equivalent summer tentpole promotional costs, for better or worse).

A significant portion of Joker: Folie à Deux's budget -- approximately $52 million, according to The Hollywood Reporter -- went to Todd Phillips', Joaquin Phoenix's, and Lady Gaga's salaries alone (albeit to different degrees, as Gaga reportedly earned $12 million while Phoenix and Phillips split the rest at $20 million each).

Compared against the roughly $4-5 million Phoenix received for Joker back in 2019, the pay raises for the top three names explains a lot of inflation from the first film's $70 million budget to the sequel's nearly $200 million budget.

The significance of Joker: Folie à Deux's financial pain is separate from its artistic merit and reception, obviously, and even the fact it was widely panned by critics and audiences alike is likewise still not an objective measure of its value or merit as a film. But it's not insignificant when every measurements align to tell us a film is widely deemed an expensive swing and a miss.

The value in studios funding artistic swings and misses is another discussion, of course, and there's value in discussing it apart from the nuances and particulars we debate over anything else about the films.

But for DC Studios and WBD, right now these are characters, source material, and projects that cost a lot of money to bring to the big screen, and it's an investment within a profit-driven private corporate entity, competing for audience attention and dollars against similar projects by other corporate entities.

That might sound cynical, but I don't actually mean it that way -- it's simply the reality of cinema, and it's always been the reality, however much we often pretend toward some rose-colored idealized Hollywood past.

And however impersonal and cold that math sounds, remember that it represents ultimately the artistic assessments, opinions, discussions, and recommendations among worldwide professional critics of cinema and a mainstream global public. It would be unfair to disregard numbers legitimately reflecting widespread public opinion and reaction to cinematic art created exactly for those audiences and to elicit their reactions. Certainly nobody was insisting that the reviews, audience reactions, box office, and awards were irrelevant with regard to the first Joker film, right?

Negative reviews and bad box office don't take away from the value of Joker: Folie à Deux for anybody else. Measurements of it are relevant to understanding and discussing not only artistic value, but also financial merits of investing in specific films. Especially since Joker: Folie à Deux's reception could play a role in influencing audience reception of forthcoming DC projects, and how the studio might react if they anticipate audience backlash.

Without diving too deeply into the past, WB isn't exactly a stranger to reactive studio leadership abruptly changing course when facing box office adversity. The results of that are precisely why Warner is now starting from scratch next year with writer-director (and DC Studios co-CEO alongside Peter Safran) James Gunn's Superman.

Since Aquaman swam to $1.1 billion in 2018, eight of the nine DCEU superhero movies have failed to reach even $400 million, with half of them taking less than $200 million in total worldwide box office, and two others failing to reach $300 million. The only bright spots for DC on the big screen for the past six years have been Joker in 2019 and The Batman in 2022.

I'm not rubbing salt in the wound, I'm trying to apply some light and some blunt diagnoses, to determine what it tells us about the risk of reopening the same old wounds again compared to healing and moving on. The DCU has the potential for both, depending very much on how WBD and DC Studios leadership react or don't react to Joker: Folie à Deux's failed launch.

Quality is always a factor, but it's also the hardest to measure and most subjective to determine. So while it's true that studios must commit to taking material seriously making sure everyone involved delivers the best film possible, it's also true that everyone involved in Joker: Folie à Deux feels pretty certain they did exactly those things, and they felt they succeeded.

One recurring lesson I've seen across the past 20 years is that audience are less interested in deconstruction of superhero cinema outside of effectively established and recognizable popular iteration first. Because DC did more of the former in their films, it's a lesson most visible in audience reception of DC movies.

Look at the well-received and financially successful DC films over the past 20 years -- Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Man of Steel, Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Joker, The Batman. Those films pretty much delivered (to varying degrees) the expected, recognized versions of superheroes, conforming mostly to audience preferences for those characters and/or superheroes in general.

So the lesson ""make good movies"" is really pointless beyond that. Even claiming ""listen to what people prefer"" suggests pandering and not taking risks, which isn't the right lesson either.

But what is true, and what is a good lesson, is to understand the reasons audiences rejected the deconstructions, the reasons they felt uninterested or ""cheated.""

And that's part of the larger lesson at the heart of all of this: knowing your audience, knowing not only what they prefer and expect but also why they do, and knowing the characters and stories well enough to be able to deliver what audiences prefer and expect in interesting ways that still challenge the audience and even eventually subvert their expectations because you've earned it.

If you prove to audiences that you understand the characters and understand why the characters matter to them, you earn their permission to deconstruct the characters. And like it or not, you need viewer ""permission"" if you want audiences to buy in.

You also need to be sure you established which version you're deconstructing. Because when the approach goes an extra layer deep by deconstructing an incarnation that is itself a deconstructed iteration of the character, then you're asking audiences to take two big leaps of faith with you, beyond even the built-in leaps of faith you're asking when you tell fantasy-sci-fi myths in the first place.

I love deconstruction. Mainstream audiences do, too. They just want to see it within the framework of something larger to care about on the front end, and particularly through a more recognizable version that they care about to begin with (or the deconstruction is pointless).

Whether it's done across several films (the way Marvel Studios set up their shared universe before deconstructing it), or within a single but effective story (such as Zack Snyder's Justice League did for Cyborg, or Barry Allen's arc in The Flash), it usually needs to happen in some semblance of that format when you're making movies about existing pop culture icons.

Marvel did it on the front end and largely avoided the problem of audience backlash. But Warner's DCEU moved quickly into deconstructive territory, rooted in incarnations of certain characters that were already edge cases leaning toward deconstruction. Anyone's personal opinion and preferences regarding the quality and value of that is beside the point, at this level of the discussion. It created a two-point barrier for audiences, and while it only initially slowed mainstream buy-in, it didn't take long to turn audiences off entirely.

Financially, Man of Steel was a success at $668 million, despite slightly underperforming. Batman v Superman did blockbuster business with $874 million, but it underperformed as well and obviously quickly lost audience interest. Then, Suicide Squad did well to the tune of $749 million, and Wonder Woman was a huge hit that grossed $823 million. Justice League failed at $661 million, but Aquaman rebounded as the biggest hit of the DCEU with $1.1 billion.

Wonder Woman and Aquaman were widely accepted by audiences and critics alike, but the rest of those films -- despite being generally financially successful -- had mixed reviews and (mostly) so-so audience scores.

A new DC superhero shared world kicked off with the biggest and most popular versions of DC heroes, at a time when the MCU and the Nolan TDK trilogy put superhero cinema at the top of the charts, was always going to attract initial attention from audiences. But all of the signs of trouble were clear, and studio executive leadership's hands-on approach not only didn't help, it resulted in the franchise-killing Justice League fiasco.

I've already recounted the subsequent nine-film collapse, so I won't repeat that. But what it reflected was audiences having decided the DCEU wasn't what they wanted, and they were mostly done giving it more attention or money.

Now look closely at which of those early films did best, and which underperformed. The films that were generally what audiences expected and prefer in foundational superhero franchises were all successful -- Man of Steel (mostly), Suicide Squad (theatrically, it delivered most of what the trailer reflected), Wonder Woman, and Aquaman.

Before them, it was the TDK trilogy and its moody faux-realism approach that reflected what's always been most popular about Batman -- the notion he's got no powers, he's just someone with resources who trained and wants to save his city. Batman Begins set up the Batman audiences love best and leaned into that. Then, in The Dark Knight, the series deconstructed Batman's assumptions right in front of him, and then in The Dark Knight Rises they tore it all down and showed us its strengths and weaknesses before rebuilding it into something stronger in the end.

But the new DCEU only set up the idealized popular heroes in a few instances, while starting off with deconstruction when it came to some of the biggest and most important foundational characters and films.

The deconstructive elements in Man of Steel, and then the more pronounced deconstruction evident in Batman v Superman and Justice League, seem to have been a case of too much too soon for mainstream audiences.

The studio also felt that audiences knew these characters well enough not to need establishing them more popularly and positively, that deconstruction was possible out the gate. Which it is, and I liked and loved most of the early DCEU films, but being possible and liked by a portion of audience willing to bring their own awareness and preferences of the characters to the table is different from whether it's a good idea that will be successful and embraced by the mainstream.

From there, those underlying disconnects from the audience mixed with soft critical reception and the unfortunate comparison to Marvel's well-received sequels and new franchises. The comparison became all the more relevant at this particular point in time, because Marvel's success was precisely because they were telling stories that mixed the overwhelmingly popular superhero origin template, with deconstructive elements arising later within the larger connected story elements.

After several years of the same sort of stories mostly signaling a lack of appreciation for what the viewers wanted, it seems audiences gave up giving DC a chance -- with two exceptions, that is.

When a new Joker origin film appeared on the radar, audiences saw all of the signs that it was the sort of Joker we know the public prefers, presented in the sort of film audiences tend to favor for Batman and Batman-adjacent movies -- namely, what Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy did. And what Joker did. And what The Batman did (and what The Penguin is currently doing).

Joker: Folie à Deux suffered because of early mixed to negative reactions at festival, from marketing that hid its musical nature while word of it being a musical spread anyway (thus creating buzz that the studio was hiding the musical nature because they feared audiences wouldn't like it), and (mild spoiler) it winds up making many feel like they were cheated or that the film retroactively makes both films pointless.

It shouldn't be hard to look at the films that succeeded, the ones that failed, and learn the right lessons. The only question now is, will audience show up?

My fear is that we are in a mirror of the same moment WB faced in 2013, with a new Superman movie launching a new shared universe, a solo Batman franchise that's a rare bright spot after many rocky years for DC on film, changes in studio leadership, and a rising popular Marvel (again!) defining audience expectations for the genre going forward.

The final mirroring factor to consider is that we also just had a return of the 1990s cinematic Batman, in a film that was widely derided and failed at the box office (akin to Batman & Robin killing off the franchise in the 1990s).

There is a loud warning in all of this, and Batman is sort of the canary in the coal mine. It's not that Batman is a ""tainted brand,"" it's that the DC brand has become so tainted that with the failure of The Flash last year and Joker: Folie à Deux this year, for the first time since the 1990s Batman isn't able to draw built-in audience trust and interest. Joker's own box office draw has been firmly established since 1989, with even Jared Leto's oft-criticized Joker enjoying great financial success in his one-film appearance.

Is the Batman brand no longer safe? Will audience distrust of the DC brand carry over in coming years to even otherwise good or great Batman projects? If Joker's sequel to a billion dollar origin story can't generate enough audience interest and trust to at least have a decent opening weekend, should we be concerned about the future of Batman movies, solo or in the DCU?

I'd like to think audiences will reward The Batman - Part II with another huge box office cume, and that as long as WBD and DC Studios don't meddle or cancel it, the Matt Reeves Batman world could be immune to the other pressures working against DC's shared world stuff. Perhaps the DCU's upcoming new Batman and Robin movie has something to worry about, but surely not the newly established solo Batman?

Sadly, the fact is I also thought Joker's success and its proximity to Batman -- especially as a ""grounded and gritty"" continuation -- was a safe bet. But audiences have told us loud and clear -- there are no safe bets anymore."
SAP Brews Up New Thermodynamic Charges In Joule Copilot,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2024/10/08/sap-brews-up-new-thermodynamic-charges-in-joule-copilot/,2024-10-08T15:54:46Z,"Software needs energy. This may be why SAP called its generative AI copilot Joule. Given that one joule is equal to the amount of work done when a force of one newton displaces a mass through a distance of one metre in the direction of that force, SAP may have been thinking that one Joule is equal to the amount of work done when one AI model executes an analytical decision to displace one unit of human work more efficiently. Or, the marketing team were just fans of 19th-century English mathematicians.

Aiming to extend Joule's intelligence quotient (the technology first emerged in September 2023), SAP is now engineering this tool to include collaborative AI agents imbued with custom skills to complete complex cross-disciplinary tasks. In other words, this is AI that (for example) might be used to write a job description, but then also calculate appropriate market salary, integrate with job posting websites and perhaps even start to vet candidates' résumés and ask them what they like to do on their weekend hobby time.

Other developments here include SAP Knowledge Graph, a technology designed to help software application development engineers to use SAP data in closer connection with its business context.

Talking about the push to forge a new human-AI partnership with its platform, Muhammad Alam, member of the executive board of SAP SE, SAP product engineering says that the company has expanded Joule's capabilities to support 80 percent of SAP's most-used business tasks as it now embeds Joule more deeply within the company's portfolio.

""Collaborative multi-agent systems work by deploying specialized AI agents to tackle specific tasks and enable them to collaborate on intricate business workflows, adapting their strategies to meet shared objectives. SAP is infusing Joule with multiple collaborative AI agents that will combine their unique expertise across business functions to collaboratively accomplish complex workflows. These AI agents will help organizations unlock massive productivity gains by breaking down silos and freeing workers to concentrate on areas where human ingenuity thrives,"" noted Alam and team, at an SAP technical symposium.

Can we get some solid examples of the kinds of use cases SAP is talking about here? We can if we look at a corporate dispute management use case that employs autonomous AI agents to analyze and resolve dispute resolution scenarios including incorrect and missing invoices, unapplied credits and denied or duplicate payments. Or, additionally, we can consider a financial accounting use case that employs autonomous AI agents to streamline key financial processes by automating bill payments, invoice processing and ledger updates while addressing inconsistencies or errors.

SAP also mentioned its SAP Knowledge Graph product. Now forming an important part of the way some of the more progressive elements of AI are built and engineered, a knowledge graph is a design pattern or model for interrelated data entities. Used to store, classify and manage data, a knowledge graph organizes information on the basis of its interlinked values, concepts, relationships and events which are defined with semantic values to establish the relationship that exists between those data entities.

The new SAP Knowledge Graph solution, accessible through SAP Datasphere (the company's data integration, semantic modeling, data federation and data warehousing service) and Joule at the start of 2025, promises to give users a deeper layer of business understanding by mapping relationships and context across SAP's vast data landscape (self-aggrandizing term allowed for once, it is fairly vast, 87% of global commerce is said to pass through SAP) enabling organizations to make better decisions with their data.

""By offering ready-to-use relationships between business entities like purchase orders, invoices, and customers, the solution significantly reduces the complexity of manual data modeling. SAP Knowledge Graph grounds AI in SAP-specific business semantics, which reduces the risk of inaccurate or irrelevant results and makes it easier for organizations to build intelligent applications and leverage generative AI more effectively,"" noted Alam and team, in a product statement.

SAP has also come forward with new services for software programmers. There are new generative AI developer capabilities such as code explanation and documentation search in SAP Build, the company's platform for extending its solutions, that are said to reduce development time for Java and JavaScript developers. SAP Build is also adding an extensibility wizard feature that will let developers access SAP Build directly from SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, simplifying the extension process.

The company is of course large enough to have a philanthropic edge and SAP says that it is on track to fulfill its pledge to upskill two million people worldwide by 2025. Through guided learning with SAP Learning Hub and free, self-paced learning resources available on the SAP Learning site, the company aims to lower the world's digital skills gap through role-based certifications, free training materials, hands-on opportunities for developers etc.

Looking back over the last couple of decades, SAP always was one of the more vocal 'not just a database' company that cultured a reasonably strong developer message (SAP acquired Sybase back in 2010 for its mobile technologies and rapid application development tool) and most if not all of its events over the post-millennial period have featured bean-bag developer zones and hackathons, so its logical enough to see these current progressions from the Walldorf-headquartered softwarehaus.

As a measure of energy, joule in German is joule. As an AI copilot, Joule in German is also Joule. As they say in Germany, das ist praktisch."
"Sean 'Diddy' Combs, Justin Bieber: The Ripple Effect Of Brand Scandal",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeetendrsehdev/2024/10/08/sean-diddy-combs-justin-bieber-the-ripple-effect-of-brand-scandal/,2024-10-08T15:54:44Z,"As sexual assault allegations against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs (or P. Diddy) escalate, including accusations of sexual abuse, sex trafficking, exploitation of commercial sex workers and indicators of a larger criminal enterprise at work, the spotlight has shifted to Justin Bieber as a potential victim of the music mogul. The CEO of Bad Boy Records, mentored a 15-year old Justin Bieber who allegedly attended Diddy's infamous ""Freak Off"" parties where much of the alleged sexual abuse occured.

Adding to the controversy, a likely AI-generated song titled ""Diddy Party"" attributed to Justin Bieber that went viral, racking up millions of views across social platforms including TikTok, X and YouTube, and featured in over 4,500 TikTok videos alone. The lyrics ""Lost myself at a Diddy party, didn't know that's how it go, I was in it for a new Ferrari, but it cost me way more than my soul,"" eerily echo some of the accusations in the lawsuits:

Why should we care?

This viral moment offers crucial insights for leaders navigating today's savvy audiences and digital landscape.

1. Prioritize Authenticity and Transparency

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: In an era of both real and fabricated stories, authenticity is paramount, and people's ability to detect inauthenticity is sharper than ever.

The likely AI-generated song attributed to Justin Bieber is a prime example of how easily misinformation can spread. However, it also reflects what many audiences already believe to be true, which makes open and authentic engagement essential for brands seeking to build trust, especially when navigating real-life scandals -- whether related to sexual misconduct, alleged abuse, sex trafficking trials or any other controversy for that matter.

As I emphasize in my book The Kim Kardashian Principle, without transparency, brands struggle to control the narrative. Bieber's silence is damaging his image, and a late response risks appearing calculated, deepening public skepticism instead of rebuilding trust. With major outlets like Rolling Stone, NBC News, and Fox News covering these scandals, the pressure on brands to stay ahead of public perception has never been greater.

By contrast, Cassie's sexual assault lawsuit against P. Diddy was viewed as brave and authentic, especially compared to Diddy's initial denial, which seemed strategic and insincere. Audiences are attuned to hollow narratives, particularly when serious allegations like abuse of minors and sex trafficking and abusive relationships in general come to light.

2. Empower Individual Narratives and Identity

Today's audiences are creating and sharing their own narratives, often correctly, across platforms. While misinformation remains a risk, I do believe brands must act transparently and authentically to empower individual voices. Whether responding to sexual assault allegations or engaging with viral content, brands must recognize this shift and embrace their audience's self-expression rather than trying to suppress it.

In P. Diddy's case, public reaction to his alleged misconduct has been swift, with a federal sex trafficking probe now underway. These accusations also implicate other high-profile figures in the music industry like record company executive Aaron Hall and former associates from Bad Boy Entertainment. While the lawsuits have spotlighted Diddy's alleged abuse, they've also demonstrated the influence of individual voices in shaping public perception.

Remember, brands that encourage audiences to connect their personal experiences with the company's values build deeper loyalty and a sense of authenticity. This is especially true with Gen Z, who place a high premium on self-expression and transparency. In fact, 73% of Gen Z believe that more self-expression leads to a happier, healthier life -- showing just how important it is for brands to align with these values.

3. Harness the Power of Storytelling

Brands can harness the emotional power of storytelling to connect with audiences. For those of you who are familiar with my work, you know that I believe storytelling not only humanizes brands but also fosters deeper emotional connections with audiences.

P. Diddy's mother, Janice Small Combs, recently defended her son by calling the accusations a ""public lynching."" According to BBC News, MTV News, NBC News and other outlets, Janice Combs claimed that some individuals were pursuing a quick payday -- an expected narrative. No surprise there.

However, Janice Combs also stated something less expected, ""Sometimes, the truth and a lie become so closely intertwined that it becomes terrifying to admit one part of the story, especially when that truth is outside the norm or too complicated to be believed.""

This, I'd say, is where authentic storytelling plays a crucial role -- highlighting the complexity of public perception, particularly in industries like entertainment where norms can differ from the general public's -- and potentially providing some content to these Freak Offs parties. This by no means discounts the seriousness of the allegations against P. Diddy by the federal government. However, Janice Combs voiced what many were already thinking: what's considered normal in Hollywood can easily be misunderstood by those outside of its world. Resonate with the idea or not, it's a story.

And storytelling has been shown to drive 30% higher conversion rates, making it a powerful tool for creating emotional bonds and fostering loyalty. Janice Combs' narrative approach underscores the importance of emotional communication, a strategy that brands can use to forge deeper connections with their audiences.

4. Build Communities Through Shared Value

Last but not least, leaders must recognize the importance of fostering community and connection. The viral nature of the likely AI-generated Justin Bieber song highlights a strong desire for engagement, prompting brands to create spaces where audiences can connect, share experiences, and collaborate. Building a community around shared values cultivates belonging and enhances brand affinity.

By creating platforms where consumers can connect, and collaborate, brands can build stronger communities. Whether navigating civil lawsuits, allegations of sexual desires fulfilled through criminal means, or broader controversies like those engulfing Bad Boy Entertainment, brands must enable authentic communities -- and this can be seen by audiences as a sense of brand purpose. According to The Strength Of Purpose study, brands with a strong purpose see higher trust and loyalty, with 6 times more consumers willing to defend the brand during public criticism.

There is no doubt that the scandal surrounding P. Diddy, including the involvement of entities like Homeland Security and hotel security staff, demonstrates how quickly a brand or individual can face public scrutiny. Surveillance video, bail decisions, and arguments from prosecutors have all played a role in shaping the public perception of Diddy, and brands must understand that today's values-driven audiences will hold them accountable in similar situations.

In 2022, P. Diddy was celebrated as a billionaire and one of hip-hop's wealthiest artists. Today, his business empire is crumbling amid mounting allegations of sexual misconduct. The once-adored music mogul's brand has unraveled following the release of security video showing singer Cassie Ventura (also known as Casandra Ventura) being violently attacked by Diddy, which led to her filing a sexual assault lawsuit. This triggered a cascade of events: brands distanced themselves from Diddy, Howard University revoked his honorary degree, and NBC News reports that over 120 additional accusers with allegations have surfaced with civil lawsuits.

But in today's environment, where public figures like P. Diddy face sexual misconduct allegations, and accusations of sex trafficking, and abuse of women (and others,) I believe the repercussions extend far beyond the accused. Those linked to him -- including Justin Bieber -- are also being scrutinized as audiences increasingly shape and share their own narratives. The pressure is mounting on everyone associated with Diddy to come clean, as audiences demand accountability not only from the primary figures but also from those who enabled or turned a blind eye to the misconduct.

The downfall of the Bad Boy Records CEO, fueled by ex-girlfriend Cassie's courageous allegations, serves as a powerful reminder to leaders that audiences now expect accountability from all involved. In today's digital age, the public is more discerning than ever, and implausible narratives will no longer suffice. Those associated with Diddy -- whether enablers or collaborators -- must reckon with this new reality. Authenticity is not optional; it's essential for survival."

In a shocking moment, Trump most recently bragged about his ""very good"" relationship with Putin in September while standing next to Putin's enemy Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Woodward's book also depicts the two remaining in touch after his presidency, with an unnamed aide saying calls between the two happened as much as seven times since 2021, according to the Post, citing the book. Trump has also publicly praised Putin, once calling him a genius, according to the New York Times.

Trump's relationship with Putin has become a prominent point on the campaign trail and at rallies, with Trump never saying that he wants Ukraine to beat Russia in the ongoing war and the former president repeating his claim of ending the Ukraine war before he gets into office. Vice President Kamala Harris mocked Trump during the debate in September for cozying up to dictators, saying that ""Putin would eat"" Trump for lunch if he returns to office. At the debate, Harris also criticized Trump for his relationship with other dictators."

Commentators are predicting that Rachel Reeves will unveil a clutch of tax hikes to fill a £22 billion 'black hole' she has identified in the public coffers, when she delivers her Budget speech on Wednesday 30 October, writes Kevin Pratt.

She'll also want to raise additional funds to underwrite the government's spending plans.

The decision to axe Winter Fuel Allowance payments to around 10 million pensioners this winter has demonstrated that Reeves - the first woman to hold the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer - is not afraid to make unpopular decisions.

She's received unwavering support from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in the teeth of protests from across the political spectrum, so it's reasonable to assume she's not going to pull any punches.

Reeves has reiterated Labour's manifesto commitment not to increase the rates of three key government revenue-generators - the holy trinity of income tax, National Insurance Contributions and VAT (although VAT is being introduced on private school fees).

The Chancellor could, however, maintain the freeze on income tax thresholds, which would result in more people becoming taxpayers or ascending into higher tax bands as their pay increases - something known as 'fiscal drag'.

Say, for example, your income is £12,000 and you have no other taxable income. This amount falls within the £12,570 standard personal tax allowance, so you do not pay income tax.

But if your pay increases and you earn more than £12,570, you would then be taxed at 20% on the amount above the allowance.

The same scenario applies with the threshold between the 20% basic rate of tax and the 40% higher rate (£50,270), and between the higher rate and the 45% additional rate (£125,140).

Couple of points to note here: if your taxable income is over £100,000, you lose £1 of your personal allowance for every £2 of income above the £100,000 level. This means by the time you get to £125,140, you don't get any personal allowance and are taxed on everything you earn.

If you live in Scotland, there are six thresholds rather than three, set at different levels with different rates of tax applying. Any changes here will likely be announced in December.

Under the Tories, the thresholds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were already due to remain frozen until 2028, but it is conceivable that the Chancellor might extend this date to help balance the books over a longer forecast period.

The decision to axe Winter Fuel Allowance payments to around 10 million pensioners this winter has demonstrated that Reeves - the first woman to hold the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer - is not afraid to make unpopular decisions.

The prime candidates for a tax hike in the Budget are:

We may also see changes to the rules affecting 'non-doms'. These are individuals who live in the UK but who are non-domiciled for tax purposes, meaning they can avoid or reduce the tax they pay on overseas earnings.

If the Chancellor is feeling particularly combative, she could introduce a wealth tax on the super-rich, although this would be immensely complicated as well as deeply controversial as it would seek to harvest revenue from illiquid assets such as property and other possessions."
Jewish CBS anchor forced to meet with Race and Culture Unit after grilling pro-Palestinian author: report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/jewish-cbs-anchor-forced-meet-race-culture-unit-after-grilling-pro-palestinian-author-report,2024-10-08T15:47:53Z,"CBS Mornings anchor Tony Dokoupil pressed author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates on whether he believed Israel had a right to exist in a Monday interview.

Colleen Monfore, 68, was diving with friends near the Pulau Reong island off the coast of Indonesia's Southwest Maluku Regency on Sept. 26 when she did not resurface, Asia Pacific Press reported.

Two weeks after Monfore disappeared in the tropical waters, a fisherman spotted a shark in distress and killed the creature. Upon cutting open the shark's stomach, the fisherman uncovered what were believed to be Monfore's remains along with her wetsuit and bathing suit.

Initial reports indicated the shark had attacked and eaten Monfore, but a friend of the Michigan woman says that the evidence so far suggests this is likely false.

TOURIST, 30, DIES AFTER LOSING HER LEG IN SHARK ATTACK OFF CANARY ISLANDS

Kim Sass, who wrote that Monfore was her ""very good friend"" in a Facebook post, listed what is known about the case, and how it appears likely that Monfore died of a medical issue during a dive.

Sass wrote that the fisherman captured the shark around Oct. 4 near Timor-Leste, a southeast Asian country which is 70 miles away from the dive site where Monfore vanished over a week earlier.

Monfore's remains were identifiable, according to Sass, which would not have been had the shark eaten her at the time she went missing.

While it can take days for sharks to fully digest a meal, the stomach of a shark ""produces an acid that is strong enough to dissolve metal,"" while ""large bones and other indigestible objects are prevented from going past the stomach due to the small size of the opening to the intestine,"" according to the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Sass believes that the nearly eight-day timeframe from when Monfore disappeared to when the shark was found suggests that the shark consumed Monfore after she was already dead.

""Colleen's body was identifiable. Her fingerprints (again identifiable) are being used by our US Embassy and the local government for proof of death,"" Sass wrote. ""This would not be possible if the shark had attacked her weeks ago.""

7-FOOT SHARK WAS EATEN BY EVEN BIGGER SHARK, RESEARCHERS SUSPECT

Sass said that dive information, photos and witness accounts from two other divers and the group's dive master show that Monfore was in 24 feet of water when the group turned around due to a change in the current. Sass added that Monfore likely had half a tank of air at that time.

""There was a down current at the turn around site, but it was manageable,"" she wrote. ""I've easily done 1000+ dive with this gracious woman; she was an excellent diver. I don't believe it was the environment and certainly not a shark that ended her life.""

Indonesian authorities are continuing to investigate."

NYC First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright resigns as Eric Adams' administration suffers more departures: report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nyc-first-deputy-mayor-sheena-wright-resigns-eric-adams-administration-suffers-more-departures-report,2024-10-08T15:46:08Z,"Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz and political strategist Lucy Caldwell react to New York City Mayor Eric Adams' criminal fraud indictment on 'MediaBuzz.'

New York City First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright reportedly resigned from her position Tuesday after the FBI raided her home in early September, becoming the latest senior official to depart Mayor Eric Adams' administration as he faces federal corruption charges.

Wright's reported resignation comes just days after her husband, New York City Public Schools Chancellor David Banks, announced that he would resign earlier than expected in October. The New York Times, citing sources, says Wright is expected to be replaced by Maria Torres-Springer, who is the current deputy mayor for housing, economic development and workforce.

When asked about the matter on Tuesday morning, the mayor's office told Fox News Digital that ""No announcement is final until and if it is made.""

On Monday, Winnie Greco, the mayor's director of Asian affairs, also resigned from her role, according to the New York Post.

Her attorney Steven Brill - who did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment from Fox News Digital - told The City that Greco ""officially resigned... on her own volition.""

ERIC ADAMS CHANNELS TRUMP AS HE RAMPS UP REVENGE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, EXPERT SAYS

The same day, Rena Abbasova, a staffer for Adams who worked in the office of international affairs, was fired from her job, with sources telling Fox News that she was let go because she is the ""key cooperating witness"" in the federal investigation of Adams.

Senior New York City Hall official Mohamed Bahi also stepped down on Monday. This morning, federal prosecutors announced they unsealed a complaint charging him ""with witness tampering and destruction of evidence in connection with a federal investigation of unlawful contributions to a particular 2021 mayoral campaign.""

""If there were no vulnerabilities here, nobody would have to resign,"" former NYPD inspector and Fox News contributor Paul Mauro told Fox News Digital. ""Obviously, a lot of them are trying to make the point 'oh I was going to leave anyway' -- but these are all the people from [Adams'] tightest inner circle and this is the team he put together to run the city and for them to be leaving prematurely when he would normally be gearing up for re-election, I don't see how you can argue that this is business as usual. It's very obvious something heavy is going on.""

MOST NEW YORK CITY RESIDENTS WANT INDICTED MAYOR ERIC ADAMS TO RESIGN: POLL

Adams is facing a five-count indictment on fraud, bribery and corruption charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty.

The mayor, 64, is accused of soliciting illegal campaign donations from foreign entities and falsifying paper trails to cover it up. As part of the plot, he allegedly defrauded taxpayers for $10 million over the past decade and frequently took free or steeply discounted vacations bankrolled by his foreign benefactors.

Adams has said in a video statement that any charges filed against him would be ""entirely false, based on lies,"" and he insinuated that his criticism of the Biden administration's disastrous border policies made him a target for retaliation.

ERIC ADAMS IS LIKELY TO FACE MORE CHARGES

The mayor was quoted by The New York Times as saying in a statement that will be circulated Tuesday that ""We are grateful for First Deputy Mayor Wright's years of service to the city and all she has done to deliver for children, families, and working-class New Yorkers.""

""She is an exceptional leader who assembled a strong team and constantly demonstrated a bold vision for this city,"" he reportedly added.

The mayor's office says on its website that Wright served in the administration since January 2022, first as deputy mayor of strategic initiatives and then as first deputy mayor starting in January 2023.

""During her time in the administration, she helped launch the first phase of the MyCity portal, a one-stop-shop where New Yorkers can easily apply for and track city services and benefits. She has helped the city deliver on key planks of the Blueprint for Child Care & Early Childhood Education in New York City -- most notably, clearing a backlogged waitlist for vouchers and allowing families of 36,000 children to apply for low-cost, high-quality child care,"" her bio reads.

Money Market Funds Are Losing Their Luster. Here's What Shines.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeljohnson/2024/10/08/money-market-funds-are-losing-their-luster-heres-what-shines/,2024-10-08T15:38:16Z,"The Fed's September 18th interest rate cut was a long time coming and a symbol of progress on inflation. It's a cause for celebration and a catalyst for re-examining investment strategies you favored during the higher-for-longer interest rate environment. With more rate cuts expected later this year, now's a perfect time to consider changes that could be advantageous to your portfolio.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not an advocate of timing the market, but I am a believer in managing your portfolio to capitalize on changing tradeoffs between risk and reward. Given the declining interest rate environment, it can be a smart move to hold less cash by moving up the risk curve and buying fixed income and equity investments.

With Decreasing Interest Rates, These Investment Options Shine Bright

For example, money is already flowing from money market funds into bond funds, as investors attempt to lock in yields before rates drop further.

Equity funds, particularly those holding dividend paying stocks, are also tempting investors to move out of cash for better returns. If all goes as planned and we avoid a recession, stocks should continue to generate higher returns than bonds over a 5- to-10-year period, and the dividend yields add an element of safety.

Speaking of the stock market, we've seen the dangers of being too growth-oriented over the last few months. Many tech stocks that had a good run-up got hammered - a reminder that the cost of high growth is high volatility. That volatility may be acceptable for younger investors, but I'm encouraging mature clients who want to invest some cash to consider diversifying their tech holdings with consumer staples.

Companies in this sector produce essential products that people use day in and day out. Food producers and manufacturers of household goods may sound like boring investments, especially compared to Nvidia, Alphabet, or Apple, but these large, established companies tend to be far more stable investments. The consumer staples sector provides modest growth, low volatility, reliable profits, and steady dividends, which is why I diversify with them in financial plans for clients in their 50s and 60s.

I can't stress enough the importance of owning a well-diversified portfolio when you've accumulated wealth that you want to preserve. Concentrating your assets amplifies the impact of volatility and changing market conditions, tempting you to move money and trade sectors at the worst possible times.

If you're like most investors, you might think you're well diversified, but you probably aren't, especially if you set up a portfolio two or three years ago. If your portfolio hasn't been rebalanced during that time, it's likely to be dominated by tech stocks. Contrary to popular belief, owning the big index funds doesn't provide enough equity diversification. Think about it: roughly 31% of the value of the S&P 500 Index is composed of stocks in the information technology sector.

At this stage of the economic cycle and in anticipation of more rate decreases, some investors are moving from cash into small and mid-cap stocks. There are two reasons this allocation could be beneficial. First, smaller businesses that want to grow in value will be able to borrow money at lower rates. Second, loans will be more affordable for bigger companies who want to acquire smaller ones.

With interest rate cuts underway, now's a great time to revisit your investment strategies and asset allocation decisions. Declining interest rates might prompt you to move out of cash. Any action you take should be based on your investment goals and personal situation within the context of a solid financial plan."
Amazon Slashes Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra In New Prime Day Deal,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/10/08/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-galaxy-s23-amazon-prime-day-sale-trade-in/,2024-10-08T15:38:10Z,"Amazon is fighting an uphill battle competing with Samsung's current Galaxy phone deals, which include hundreds of dollars off 2024 handsets and enhanced trade-in prices.

However, the retailer's Prime Day deals offer some solid savings for Samsung shoppers that are worth looking at, with surprisingly high price drops for the latest Galaxy S24 range.

Below are the best deals I could find for Samsung Galaxy phones. Don't forget to check out Amazon's Google Pixel prime day deals here.

These are good deals when compared to Samsung's pricing. For example, the base Galaxy S24 will set you back $799 if bought directly from the Korean company, which is a huge $200 difference. Amazon's offer is also $250 cheaper for the Galaxy S24 Plus and $287.85 less for the Galaxy S24 Ultra.

That doesn't tell the full story, however because Samsung's trade-in prices bring those upfront device costs down dramatically.

When buying the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the most recent Galaxy phone Amazon will accept for trade-in is the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which it priced at $135. Samsung values the exact same handset at $600. A mind-bogglingly large gap in valuation between the two companies.

It's the same for all other handsets Amazon and Samsung will accept for trade-in. The Galaxy S20 Ultra is priced at $100 by Amazon, whereas Samsung will give you $400 for it. Amazon will refund traders $225 for the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, while Samsung will pay $350 for it.

If you're hunting for a new Samsung phone and you have something -- anything -- to trade in, buying directly from Samsung is likely the better option. Just make sure you check the trade-in prices before you pull the trigger. If you don't have an old phone to hand over, Amazon prices are genuinely impressive and worth taking a look at."
America The Tax Haven? Exploring The U.S. Trade Deficit,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/taxnotes/2024/10/08/america-the-tax-haven-exploring-the-us-trade-deficit/,2024-10-08T15:38:08Z,"In this episode of Tax Notes Talk, Professors Kenneth Austin and Hillel Nadler discuss the policies that they believe make the United States a tax haven, and the resulting effects on the economy.

Tax Notes Talk is a podcast produced by Tax Notes. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

David D. Stewart: Welcome to the podcast. I'm David Stewart, editor in chief of Tax Notes Today International. This week: just like haven.

Tax havens and financial secrecy are regular topics of discussion in the tax world. We've previously looked at tax havens from an international perspective, and you can find those episodes in the show notes. But today, we're turning the lens around and considering if the United States is a tax haven.

Here to talk more about this are two authors who have recently considered this topic in-depth in the pages of Tax Notes. Kenneth Austin is a retired Treasury economist, and an adjunct professor at American University's International School of Service, and Hillel Nadler is an assistant professor at Wayne State University School of Law.

David D. Stewart: Let's start off with the big question of why should we look at the United States as being a tax haven?

Hillel Nadler: Well, there are really two aspects to this. One is that, on the U.S. side, in terms of the U.S. tax burden on financial inflows, foreign investors can hold U.S. financial assets while paying minimal U.S. tax on the profits from those assets, so that's one aspect of it. The second aspect of America being a tax haven in this sense is that the U.S. has a unique financial secrecy position, which means that foreign investors can not only avoid paying tax to the U.S., or pay minimal tax to the U.S., but they can avoid paying tax in their home countries on their profits from U.S. financial assets.

David D. Stewart: In your article about this subject, you talked about this affecting the trade deficit. Could you explain that?

Kenneth Austin: Yeah. Basically, the way it works in today's world, and particularly for the U.S., our trade deficit is equal to how much money we borrow net from the rest of the world. When I say borrow, it's not exactly like we go down to the People's Bank of China and fill out a loan application. It's just that any foreigner, or I guess in the tax code, nonresident alien, can simply buy U.S. assets on, say, the bond market, stock market, deposit it in a bank.

That's lending internationally. It may not be to a particular individual, and the money may already have been borrowed. Say the U.S. Treasury sells a bond, and that bond is sold to an American, but that American sells it to a nonresident alien, then we are borrowing internationally. That will affect the exchange rates. And as we borrow, the exchange rate appreciates, which causes the U.S. trade deficit to grow.

David D. Stewart: How did we start going down this road?

Hillel Nadler: These provisions have accumulated over time. These provisions that offer favorable tax treatment to foreign investment, many of them made sense in a different exchange rate situation, when the United States' financial situation was different.

If you start by addressing each provision, one provision that's favorable to foreign investors in the United States is that capital gains from the sale of most U.S. investment assets, including stock buybacks by U.S. corporations, aren't taxed at all to foreign investors. They pay no U.S. tax on those. Then in the early 1930s, all the way back then, the U.S. Treasury actually tried to collect tax on capital gains of foreign investors. If you looked at the code then, there was no specific exemption. But doing that was difficult because, if the foreign investor didn't actually file a tax return, Treasury had no way of knowing what they had earned. And Treasury was also concerned about discouraging foreign investment.

Eventually, Congress responded by introducing what we currently have now, which is an exemption for capital gains for foreign investors. I think this historical episode, the following historical episode illustrates our point nicely, which was that the exemption was actually broadened in the 1960s, by adding what's known as the securities trading safe harbor, which says that capital gains of foreign investors would be exempt even if they're present in the United States, they're trading in the United States, or acting through a U.S. agent.

Previously, doing so would have been considered engaging in a trade or business in the U.S. and would have subjected the foreign investor to U.S. tax. But this change was made explicitly to encourage foreign investment in the U.S.

The context was this was in response to the then balance of payments crisis. At the time, the U.S. was trying to prop up the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates and wanted to encourage foreign investment inflows into the United States. They wanted to encourage investors to turn U.S. dollars into longer-term investments. That's just one example, but a lot of these provisions were specifically designed to attract foreign investment into the United States.

Kenneth Austin: May I interject one thing? I know this may sound rather picayune. But in English, the word ""investment"" has more than one meaning. And words have multiple definitions, eventually they lose meaning. Because I say one thing, you hear another. You can talk about a foreigner buying a share of GM, and we'll call that an investment in the stock market. What congressmen tend to hear is creating some form of productive capacity, like plant and equipment, and something especially with an employee parking lot. When really, what they've done is made a bank deposit in the U.S. and then used that bank deposit to buy a stock. No real productive capacity was created.

As long as you say the word ""investment,"" I think a lot of people, and particularly politicians, will hear, ""We're going to have bigger employee parking lots."" That's just not necessarily true. Most of the money that's come into the U.S. in the last 30 years has not built productive capacity. Yeah, we have some Honda factories, and BMW factories, etc. But overwhelmingly, the money has just gone into the banking system. It's bank deposits. A lot of it winds up just financing dodgy consumer debt.

David D. Stewart: Now, is the U.S. unique in the way that it treats these foreign inflows? You're mentioning this nontaxation of capital gains.

Hillel Nadler: The U.S. isn't unique in the way it treats foreign financial inflows. At least, not now. But in some ways, the U.S. has been a leader on this.

If you go back to the 1980s, the U.S. introduces this exemption for interest income on portfolio debt. If you're a foreign investor, you hold a U.S. issued bond, then the interest on that bond is going to be, in most cases, going to be exempt from tax in the U.S. At the time when this exemption was introduced, the U.S. was alone, but other countries wanted to follow suit with the U.S., and other major economies, and they were worried about losing capital flows to the U.S., so they followed suit and also abolished their taxes on interest paid to foreign investors.

David D. Stewart: Now you mentioned this Bretton Woods, the fixed exchange rates. Since the collapse of that, what have been the results of the U.S. treatment of foreign investments since then?

Kenneth Austin: Well, I would say that there's really two periods. When the Bretton Woods system first collapsed, most of the Western countries, the advanced countries, whatever we want to call them -- Europe, the U.S., Japan -- just gave up on trying to control their exchange rates. The Japanese backtracked on that and it became a problem. But we backed up on that. We just let currencies move against each other. The Europeans didn't like that, and that started a movement towards the European Union.

A lot of other countries continued to control their exchange rate. The way you do that is you buy and sell foreign currency. Particularly, the U.S. dollar was very valued because we had big financial markets. You can move your money in and out quickly. If you wanted to make your own currency more valuable, you would buy it and pay for it in dollars, but you needed dollars to do that. Or if you want to depreciate your currency so you could run a larger trade surplus or smaller deficit, then you bought foreign currency. The price of foreign currency would go up, and that would encourage your exporters to earn more of the more valuable foreign currency, and discourage imports. If the price of foreign currency went down, it had the opposite effect. It was less valuable to you as an exporter, and it was cheaper to buy foreign goods.

That was a way to control your trade balance. For a long time, that mostly worked. I don't want to go in too much detail here, but things started to change when we had the oil crises of the '70s, because a lot of countries in the Middle East that had not previously had a lot of money to invest, they just started buying U.S. dollars. We allowed that. We actually encouraged that. Then the Reagan administration came along, did a lot of huge tax cuts, tried to cut the budget expenditures, but we still had a huge deficit. We were issuing a lot of U.S. government bonds, and that attracted more. Our interest rates went very high. A lot of people bought dollars around the world. Then that gradually tapered off.

By the late 1990s, America actually had a small fiscal surplus. But then, something new started to happen. There was what was called the global savings glut. A lot of countries, particularly in Asia, were growing very rapidly, and they were saving more than they were investing, actually finding uses for those savings. When the Asian financial crisis came, a lot of money came to the U.S. It also came from Europe, which was trying to reduce its budget deficits. So it all came here. The U.S. current account deficit, which is the trade deficit with some extras thrown in, basically tripled within about two, three years. Now all this money flowing into U.S. financial markets blew up the dot-com bubble, and we had a recession in 2000, two, three years after the Asian financial crisis.

Normally, that would have caused the trade deficits to shrink. It just shrank for a little bit. And then it started growing, because the rest of the world needed a place to put their money and it came to the U.S. That financed a larger and larger trade deficit. Because there are basically two ways you can get foreign currency. You can earn it by exporting; you can borrow it. Whether you want to borrow it or not, if you borrowed it, it causes your currency to become more expensive on world markets. That encourages trade deficit, because more is coming in than is going out.

Actually, what'll happen almost immediately is that the amount that you're borrowing and your trade deficit will be equal. It's actually to the penny because the balance of payments is a double-entry bookkeeping system, and that's the way it has to work.

David D. Stewart: What is the negative to the U.S. economy of having a lot of this money coming in?

Kenneth Austin: Well, one thing is our financial system can't always handle it. We just had a huge amount of money came in in the first decade of the 21st century. All of a sudden, you're watching all these TV ads, ""Don't have to fill out paperwork, get our mortgage."" A lot of these mortgages were bad. All sorts of ridiculous things happened in U.S. financial markets because interest rates started to go really low. People became desperate to find something they could actually put their money in. That led to a lot of the abuses that caused the great financial crisis.

At the same time, all this money was raising the price of the U.S. dollar. It was just not profitable to invest in U.S. production facilities anymore, because things could always be made cheaper elsewhere, particularly in China, and this was the China shock. There's some economic work that actually said this China shock, all these people who got thrown out of work in what are now the swing states -- Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, all across the Midwest, the old Rust Belt -- a lot of these people, the children and grandchildren of New Deal Democrats, they voted Trump because somebody had to help. And if you look at the areas where that trade impact was the biggest, where the most jobs were lost, not only in the factories but in the surrounding towns that depended on the factories for the money that would be spent there, they were terribly harmed by this. It's very tangible, particularly to the people who lost their job.

David D. Stewart: Turning back to the tax policy underlying this, you mentioned the treatment of capital gains. Are there other things that the U.S. government is doing that are allowing inflowing dollars to escape taxation?

Hillel Nadler: Yeah. The basic structure of the U.S. tax code, especially as it relates to inbound investment, or inbound financial flows if you don't like to use the word ""investment,"" is that it's very favorable towards passive investment by foreign taxpayers.

Your listeners are probably familiar -- there are basically two different tax regimes that apply to foreign taxpayers: one that applies to passive investment income, and another that applies to active business profits from an active business in the United States. Very broadly, foreign taxpayers, if there's income that's derived from a U.S. trade or business, or in the lingo of the tax code, effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, then on that income, they're going to be subject to the same graduated tax rates that apply to U.S. taxpayers. When it comes to passive investment income, nominally, that type of income is subject to tax at a flat rate of 30 percent on the gross amount of U.S.-sourced passive investment income.

But when it comes to that passive investment income, there are large gaps in that flat rate tax. For one, as we mentioned, capital gains from the sale of most U.S. investment assets, other than real estate, aren't taxed at all because they're not considered U.S.-source income. Also, interest from U.S. bank deposits, and most importantly, from U.S. portfolio debt, bonds, most other debt instruments, are also going to be exempt from U.S. taxation. And these two categories, capital gains and portfolio interest, account for the majority of passive income earned by foreign investors in the United States, and they're exempt from U.S. tax.

Kenneth Austin: Yeah. This is a bit I'm going to tread here on the tax part. But you can think of, if I own a Treasury bond, at the end of the year, I'm going to have some interest and a 1099 form. If I sell that bond to a German resident, then they get the interest on that bond, but it's disappeared from the U.S. tax base. And they pay nothing. And the U.S. isn't necessarily going to share the information with the German government that your resident or citizen earned this income on a U.S. bond. It's very hard for them to get it, and we made that system deliberate. Your choice is, ""OK, I could buy a German bond, but I'm going to pay interest on it. If I buy an American bond, I won't."" I could voluntarily pay some German taxes, but I may not.

If you look at, for example, a lot of Europe, you can find 40, 50, 60 percent marginal interest rates there. In the U.S., the worst you could do is pay the 30 percent withholding, but you don't have to. It's a much better deal from the tax point of view to put your money in the U.S. That is a result of U.S. policies designed to bring that money in. I think you can discuss what the politics is, but a lot of congressmen really believe that that money coming in is investment, in the sense it creates jobs and employee parking lots, when really it's just a bank deposit. What happens to that money after it gets here is anybody's guess, particularly the bankers.

Hillel Nadler: Just to add another wrinkle there, it's not just the statutory provisions of the code that offer favorable treatment, U.S. tax treatment, to foreign investment. The U.S. also has a network of bilateral tax treaties, which also exempt a lot of passive foreign investment from U.S. tax. But if you look at where financial inflows are coming, it's not just from those treaty countries. It's also from jurisdictions with which the U.S. doesn't have those bilateral tax treaties.

And that's because the other leg of the U.S. status as a tax haven, which is that the U.S., or U.S. financial institutions, can offer financial secrecy to their clients in a way that other jurisdictions can't, or other major economies and financial centers can't because other major economies signed up for the common reporting standard, which is reciprocal and provides for the automatic exchange of information between different jurisdictions and different tax authorities.

The U.S. has FATCA, which it adopted unilaterally, which provides the U.S. with a lot of information about U.S. taxpayers, but doesn't provide the same information to other jurisdictions and to other tax authorities. The U.S. financial institutions aren't required to collect and the U.S. isn't required to share information with other countries, for example, about the identity of controlling persons or beneficial owners of certain entities that are used to hold passive investments. Foreign investors can avoid tax reporting to their own tax authorities by holding U.S. accounts through U.S. entities, like LLCs or trusts, and things like that.

Kenneth Austin: If you'd spoke to the lobbyists behind a lot of these provisions, they'd say, ""We're just trying to prevent double taxation."" Double taxation isn't the issue. It's zero taxation.

If all the foreign financiers who bought these Treasury bonds paid tax somewhere, the full amount, particularly to their home government maybe in Denmark, or Switzerland, or Germany, they'd keep more of it at home, they'd be less inclined to bring it to the U.S. But the U.S. says, ""Bring it here, and there won't be double taxation. There won't any taxation.""

In some ways, double taxation might be unfortunate. But remember, nobody is forced to put their money somewhere else. They could always just keep it at home and pay their own taxes. They made a choice. Now I think one country collecting the tax makes sense. But to exempt these interest or other portfolio income from all taxes is a bit ridiculous. Since it's not symmetrical, it attracts more of that money here, which triggers a higher U.S. trade deficit.

David D. Stewart: It sounds like the policy of trying to get more money in was very effective. Maybe too effective. How would we go about unwinding that and making the U.S. less of a tax haven?

Kenneth Austin: We could theoretically eliminate the trade deficit overnight, but that would be a terrible idea. We want the economy to adjust. We don't want to shock it. We would have to rebuild an awful lot of factories and companies that were destroyed in the last 30 years. That would take time. Maybe four years, maybe 10 years. It's a guess now; we haven't started that project. We would want to do this gradually. Just gradually unwind this. We don't know how fast it would go, but as we get a little bit of experience, we should be able to do that. As long as we are, as I say, we want to do this carefully. It's not something we do overnight.

But during that period, we're going to be rebuilding all of these companies, all of these factories, and that will create a lot of jobs. That transition period will be a period of prosperity.

I'll let Hillel talk about how he would wind it down.

Hillel Nadler: Sure. I think, for starters, reversing some of these exemptions, the current exemptions for portfolio interest, for example, would be a first step towards making U.S. financial assets and foreign financial inflows less attractive. Providing reciprocal exchange of information so that, even if these foreign investors aren't paying tax in the U.S., we can at least help ensure that they're paying tax to their home governments.

But I do want to caution, our argument isn't that the only reason investors are holding U.S. financial assets is because of favorable tax treatment. There are a lot of reasons why someone outside the U.S. might want to hold a U.S. asset. This goes into the status of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, and all sorts of other reasons why people might want to hold U.S. financial assets. We just think the tax treatment is part of the picture. If we're trying to reduce foreign financial inflows, part of the solution is to start thinking about reversing some of the favorable tax treatment that foreign investors get.

Kenneth Austin: There are other things we could do. A few years ago, I think it was 2018, there was a bill introduced into the U.S. Senate, the Baldwin-Hawley Bill. That would have introduced, I think, the market access charge -- I think Hillel calls it a transactions tax -- which was a small payment every time you converted another currency into the dollar. Unfortunately, the bill went nowhere, but it was the right approach.

The thing is, you can't reduce the trade deficit by imposing tariffs. It doesn't work. It just results in same trade deficit, just at a more appreciated dollar. What you have to do is attenuate the financial inflows. I think ideally, we might want to bring those to zero. Now lots of people would still own dollars abroad, but they just on net wouldn't be buying more. If you got to that point, U.S. current account deficit, which is, as I said, a larger definition of the trade deficit, would go to zero.

David D. Stewart: The issue of extra money coming into this country doesn't seem to be something that is talked about as a negative. Why is it that you're viewing this as a negative, but we don't generally hear that from other people discussing the issue of trade imbalances?

Kenneth Austin: That's a very good question I ask myself. I say, ""Why am I one of the few economists that wants to do this?"" I am a retired Treasury economist, and nobody wanted to talk about it.

But I think part of it is, among mainstream economists, there seems to be an ideological taboo against this. One reason is mainstream economists hate the idea of what used to be called capital controls. It's still actually called capital controls, although once again, it's not little factories flowing across the world. It's just bank deposits.

They keep saying, ""Oh, well this is investment."" And actually, some pretty good economists confuse this flow of bank deposits with, they say, ""Real, productive capacity."" New factories, new electrical generation facilities, ships, transport, all this stuff. It's not. It's bank deposit. But by this verbal ambiguity, they convince themselves of it.

But they do know that this is really a question of financial flow. In 2016 Alan Blinder, who I think is probably almost the definition of mainstream esteemed economists, wrote an op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal on five important facts about trade. He said, ""A trade deficit isn't so bad because we're getting real goods and services, and the rest of the world is just getting our IOUs"" of bonds, stocks, corporate bonds, treasury bonds. ""It's just paper. It's just paper. Is that so bad?""

Well, that is ridiculous in the sense that it's something worthy of ridicule. And for an economist of his stature to say that, I don't even know if it's plausible he believes it. It's an astonishing thing to say. But I can give you other examples of economists just twisting themselves in knots, not to acknowledge that the U.S., if we stop borrowing -- the one exception that I find is when the other party holds the White House, then everybody comes really worried about the budget deficit, and blames all the borrowing and the budget deficit for the trade deficit. But that's not necessarily true.

When these large trade deficits began in the late '90s, the U.S. actually had a small fiscal surplus. But the rest of the world had the global savings glut. They just had a lot of money that they couldn't use at home. So it came here.

David D. Stewart: Well, this has been fascinating. Ken, Hillel, thank you so much for being here."
12 organizations helping with Hurricane Helene relief efforts as Florida braces for Milton,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/how-to-help-hurricane-helene-milton-donate-rcna174326,2024-10-08T15:36:39Z,"As misinformation about hurricane relief efforts spread online, here's a list of NBC-verified organizations helping victims on the ground.

Hurricane Helene left a trail of devastation across the Southeast, killing at least 230 people and causing especially severe flooding damage in western North Carolina. As residents struggle to recover from the impact of Helene, Hurricane Milton, one of the most intense storms in Atlantic history, is barreling toward Florida, threatening to wreak more havoc on the state.

More than a dozen counties in Florida are under evacuation orders, and Tampa Mayor Jane Castor issued a dire warning to residents on Monday night: ""If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you are going to die.""

As misinformation about Helene relief efforts spread online, residents are still struggling with power outages and a lack of running water as they try to salvage their belongings from the wreckage. Areas in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia that were hit hard by Helene are expected to take years to recover.

Here's a list of some of the organizations NBC has vetted that are supporting hurricane recovery efforts in those states:

This is not an exhaustive list of organizations providing relief to people impacted by Helene and Milton. The Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends visiting the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster website for more trusted groups."
"In key Senate race, Montana's Sheehy faces overlapping messes",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/key-senate-race-montanas-sheehy-faces-overlapping-messes-rcna174479,2024-10-08T15:35:21Z,"In one of the nation's most important Senate races, Tim Sheehy isn't just facing one self-imposed mess, the Montana Republican is actually facing several.

The U.S. Senate is up for grabs in the 2024 election cycle, and it's far from clear which party will be in the majority for the next two years. It's likely that the entire national effort will come down to a contest in one state: Montana.

Democratic incumbent Sen. Jon Tester is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success, and it won't hurt his chances that there's an abortion-rights ballot measure on the statewide ballot. At the same time, however, Montana has earned a reputation as a reliably red state, which Donald Trump will almost certainly win easily.

Candidate quality, however, still matters in competitive races -- and in Big Sky Country, the Republican candidate keeps running into trouble. NBC News reported:

""Young people, listen up, they've been indoctrinated for too long. We don't even try to talk to them anymore,"" Sheehy said at an event in late 2023, according to audio obtained by NBC News.

In case that weren't quite enough, the Republican went on to say, ""It's called murder. That is the position of the American Democrat [sic] Party.""

Tester's spokesperson responded to Sheehy's rhetoric, saying, ""Tim Sheehy calling young women 'indoctrinated' because they value reproductive freedom just goes to show how out of touch he is with Montanans. In Montana, we don't want the government telling us what to do -- and Sheehy's position that politicians should get the final say over our health care is one of the many ways he's trying to change Montana for the worse.""

This is probably the sort of story the GOP candidate would prefer to avoid four weeks before Election Day, but complicating matters for Sheehy is that this is the latest in a series of overlapping messes.

The Republican Senate hopeful, for example, has also used racist rhetoric when talking about Native Americans -- which is indefensible under any circumstances, and which is especially foolish in a state with a sizable Native population.

There's also the lingering controversy surrounding Sheehy's gunshot wound, which he admits to having lied about, and which he refuses to explain in more detail.

Unfortunately for the GOP candidate, the list keeps going. For example, Sheehy has also been accused of plagiarism. He's also been accused of doctoring footage in a campaign commercial to obscure his association with a group that has advocated in support of transferring public lands, which is a big issue in Montana.

In August, NBC News reported that Sheehy's claims about success in the private sector aren't quite what they appear to be.

CNN reported last week, meanwhile, that the Republican -- a 38-year-old political novice who's never held elected office -- has also ""gone to extreme lengths to avoid press scrutiny"" during his campaign.

With all of this in mind, a casual observer might assume that Tester is trouncing Sheehy. That's not the case: The latest polling suggests the challenger is actually leading the incumbent.

There's no great mystery as to why: Sheehy has an ""R"" after his name in a red state. That's it. That's the whole explanation.

But if Tester manages to outperform the polls and hang onto his seat for another term, expect a whole lot of ""candidate quality"" conversations in GOP circles in the weeks and months following Election Day."
GOP lawmaker unveils effort to ban illegal immigrants from using IDs to buy guns,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-lawmaker-unveils-effort-ban-illegal-immigrants-using-ids-buy-guns,2024-10-08T15:31:39Z,"FIRST ON FOX: A House lawmaker is raising concerns about the possibility of people who are in the country illegally being able to purchase firearms through the same process a U.S. citizen would use.

Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., is unveiling a new bill called the ""No Guns for Illegal Aliens Act,"" which would explicitly ban illegal immigrants from buying firearms using government-issued IDs.

He also expressed support for former President Trump's controversial mass deportations plan, which would likely be the largest such move in U.S. history, while criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

MEXICAN GOVERNMENT BUSES MIGRANTS TO US BORDER AS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BECOMES TOP ELECTION ISSUE

""Border Czar Kamala Harris has allowed criminal illegal aliens to enter our country and roam our streets. Meanwhile, radical liberals like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are offering driver's licenses to illegals - creating a recipe for disaster,"" Clyde told Fox News Digital.

""As we await President Trump's historic mass deportation effort, we must ensure illegal aliens with government-issued IDs cannot obtain firearms and wreak havoc on our communities.""

It's the latest move in a wider push by House Republicans to direct attention to crime perpetuated in the U.S. by illegal immigrants after several high-profile incidents in the last few years, including the killings of Rachel Morin, Laken Riley, and 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray.

FOCUS GROUP REACTS TO TRUMP CLAIM THAT MIGRANTS ARE 'EATING THE DOGS' IN OHIO TOWN

The three high-profile killings did not involve a gun, but Clyde argued that progressive policies allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses could open the door to more crime.

Clyde, a gun store owner, has had his own firearms license for over 30 years, according to his office.

As of now, 19 states plus Washington, D.C., offer driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has also recently developed a pilot program to distribute federal IDs called ""Secure Docket Cards"" to people who cross the border illegally and are awaiting immigration proceedings. It's not immediately clear if these IDs can be used to purchase guns, however.

The rate of crimes committed by illegal immigrants is lower than that of U.S. citizens, according to a study by the National Institute of Justice.

But Republicans argue that the act of entering the U.S. illegally is a crime in itself, and that instances of violent crime by such groups could be prevented just by having tougher border and immigration laws.

Oregon mistakenly registered hundreds more voters without proving citizenship,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/oregon-mistakenly-registered-hundreds-more-voters-without-proving-citizenship,2024-10-08T15:29:01Z,"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich weighs in on concerns of illegal immigrants voting, the ABC News Presidential Debate and Chinas influence on American politics.

Officials in Oregon announced Monday that they have identified an additional 302 people on the state's voter rolls who didn't provide proof of citizenship when they were registered to vote.

The announcement comes just two weeks after officials in the Beaver state said 1,259 possible noncitizens have been registered to vote since 2021, bringing the total number of mistaken registrations to 1,561.

The mistakes occurred in part because Oregon passed a law in 2019 allowing some residents who aren't citizens to obtain driver's licenses. And the state's so-called ""Motor Voter"" law, which took effect in 2016, automatically registers most people to vote when they seek a new license or ID.

OREGON MISTAKENLY REGISTERED NEARLY 1,260 POSSIBLE NONCITIZENS TO VOTE, DMV ADMITS

The improper voter registrations stem from clerical errors at the state DMV.

On Monday, the DMV released an ""After Action Report,"" which identified errors in its processes that led to the mistakes, with Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade then directing county elections officials to inactivate all 302 voter registrations.

Griffin-Valade and Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, both Democrats, called for an independent, external audit of the motor voter system in a joint statement.

""Thanks to the swift action of elections officials, I have full confidence that these new errors will not impact the 2024 election,"" Griffin-Valade said. ""The DMV's After Action Report raises serious concerns about this important part of our voter registration system. The first step in restoring the public's trust in Motor Voter is a transparent review by a neutral third party operating under strict government auditing standards.""

DMV Administrator Amy Joyce said the agency believed two weeks ago that it was confident it understood and had reviewed all records at risk of error.

""We have since learned this confidence was misplaced based on new information outlined in this announcement and after-action report and for this, we are sorry,"" Joyce said in a statement. ""DMV will follow the Governor's directed actions and remains committed to continuous learning, corrective action, transparency and accountability.""

Griffin-Valade has ordered her office's elections division to immediately hire a new Motor Voter oversight position, according to the statement. And she has instructed the division to establish a documented process for performing regular data checks with the DMV and update the administrative rules governing the Motor Voter system.

She said the Oregon Elections Division will work with the 36 county election officers to determine if any of the erroneously registered voters have previously cast a ballot. Every registered voter in Oregon is sent a ballot in the mail and the state had an 81.97% voter turnout rate in 2020. President Biden beat former President Trump comfortably in the 2020 election, winning the state by more than 380,000 votes.

RNC BLASTS WALZ ADMIN'S NONANSWER ON HOW NONCITIZENS MADE IT ONTO MINNESOTA VOTER ROLLS: 'NO HYPOTHETICAL'

Of the 302 additional cases, 178 were due to people from the U.S. territory of American Samoa being misclassified as U.S. citizens, the DMV report said.

However, under federal law, people from American Samoa are U.S. nationals, not citizens, and don't have the same right to vote. Another 123 records stemmed from the previously identified clerical error, but weren't included in prior reviews due to a newly identified software issue. And one case was caught by the DMV's new quality controls.

Griffin-Valade's office says they are doing everything they can to prevent the 302 mistakenly registered voters from receiving a ballot, but cannot guarantee that all 302 ballots will be removed before they are mailed. Her office is putting in place a process that will ensure those ballots are not opened or counted.

Of the 1,259 possible noncitizens identified last month, 10 mistakenly enrolled individuals went on to cast a ballot, according to Oregon's secretary of state, although at least one became a citizen before voting.

A DMV audit found staff may have accidentally selected ""U.S. passport"" when presented with a foreign passport, or ""U.S. birth certificate"" when given a foreign document, triggering voter enrollment.

The DMV said its drop-down menu has now been rearranged so ""U.S. passport"" is no longer the first, default option. Staff must also enter the state and county for all U.S. birth certificates and respond to a prompt when passport information is entered confirming that the documentation is accurate.

About half of all states, as well as Washington, D.C., have implemented automatic voter registration, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

But there have been numerous allegations of improper enrollment in states without automatic registration too.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced in August that officials have purged 1.1 million ineligible names from the voter rolls since the 2020 presidential election.

Ohio's secretary of state referred 138 noncitizens believed to have voted in previous elections to the state's attorney general for possible criminal charges.

And a conservative watchdog group is suing Arizona's Maricopa County for allegedly failing to remove more than 35,000 people who did not provide proof of citizenship."

Jana Kramer removed a video of her 8-year-old daughter dancing around their home in a sports bra after she was ""sexualized"" online.

On Monday, Kramer took to her Instagram story to clarify why she removed the original video of her daughter and shared that Jolie questioned why the video needed to be redone.

""Jolie asked to see [the] original this morning and I told her I took it down after some convos,"" the country star wrote on top of the second video she filmed of her daughter. ""She was sad, I explained why, and I said we can redo...and she said yay!""

Kramer continued on the next slide, ""I'm being honest, I didn't even see the issue at first with the original...I forget how sick this world is and how sexualized kids are. Jolie came down the stairs that morning in her sports bra and said, 'Alright momma I'm ready to work out.'""

The mother of three acknowledged that although the video was filmed at their home, she still shared it with her 2 million Instagram followers. Kramer noted that she would not allow her daughter to wear a sports bra out in public and originally did not see anything wrong with Jolie's outfit.

""I looked at the comments and at first again if i'm honest I thought, 'She's wearing more than a bathing suit' ?!?"" Kramer wrote. ""But after some convos and a few chats with followers over dm I made [the] decision to take down.""

Kramer explained that she loves showing her family on her social media platforms. However, she plans to take precautions in order to protect her young children.

""I'm being honest, I didn't even see the issue at first with the original...I forget how sick this world is and how sexualized kids are.""

"What Is The T Visa? Definition, Requirements and Process",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/legal/immigration-law/t-visa/,2024-10-08T15:28:48Z,"This guide explains how the T visa works, when someone may be eligible for it and what rights and obligations come with the T visa.

The T visa is a nonimmigrant visa and a temporary immigration benefit. Victims of a severe form of human trafficking can apply for and obtain a T visa to get permission to stay in the U.S. for up to four years.

Victims can become eligible if they provide reasonable assistance to law enforcement in detecting, investigating or prosecuting human trafficking. Trafficking victims who fall within an exception to the cooperation requirement can also get a T visa.

A T Visa is a temporary benefit designed to protect victims of human trafficking. Human trafficking, or trafficking in persons, is a crime that involves using force, fraud or coercion to make victims provide services or labor, including sex work, against their will.

Victims of severe human trafficking can apply for a T visa to stay in the U.S. for four years. The visa was created because traffickers often use a victim's immigration status as a means of threatening or coercing them."

""60 Minutes"" recently disclosed that former President Trump canceled an interview with the program after demanding an apology for how it conducted a sit-down with him in 2020. He also allegedly complained that the CBS News show would ""fact-check"" him.

CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley revealed the information at the opening of the show's Monday night episode, which featured an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris, explaining why a conversation with her opponent was absent.

""Then, a week ago, Trump backed out. The campaign offered shifting explanations. First, it complained that we would fact-check the interview. We fact-check every story. Later, Trump said he needed an apology for his interview in 2020,"" Pelley said.

CBS NEWS CASTS LONG SHADOW OF ANTI-TRUMP BIAS AHEAD OF ITS VICE-PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

The reporter began by noting that it has been ""tradition for more than half a century"" that each major presidential candidate do an interview with the show the month prior to election day. He detailed how Trump's team had initially agreed to the interview but backed out last week.

""But, unfortunately, last week, Trump canceled. The Trump campaign had told us that the interview would be this past Thursday at Mar-a-Lago. They also asked us whether we would meet 78-year-old Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was grazed in an assassination attempt. We agreed,"" Pelley said.

He added that Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung initially negotiated the sit-down and told ""60 Minutes,"" ""The president said, 'Yes.'"" However, days later, the campaign declined the invitation.

In addition to explaining that Trump didn't want to be fact-checked, the campaign slammed veteran ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl for how she conducted her interview with Trump ahead of the 2020 election, demanding an apology for how she dismissed the Hunter Biden laptop scandal during their conversation.

At the time, Trump insisted that then-candidate Joe Biden was ""in the midst of a scandal."" ""He's not,"" Stahl replied. ""Of course he is, Lesley,"" Trump sternly doubled down.

""No, c'mon,"" Stahl continued to reject the president's claim, before lecturing him, ""This is '60 Minutes' and we can't put on things that we can't verify.""

CBS News eventually verified the laptop in 2022.

CBS TARRED AND FEATHERED FOR ADMITTING EXISTENCE OF HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP TWO YEARS AFTER NEW YORK POST REPORT

The network released a statement on X last week saying that Trump punted on the interview after agreeing to it. At the time, Cheung replied, calling it ""Fake News.""

""Fake News. 60 Minutes begged for an interview, even after they were caught lying about Hunter Biden's laptop back in 2020. There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in. They also insisted on doing live fact checking, which is unprecedented,"" he posted on X.

Cheung reiterated the statement when asked for comment by Fox News Digital on Tuesday.

He said, ""Fake News. 60 Minutes begged for an interview, even after they were caught lying about Hunter Biden's laptop back in 2020. There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in. They also insisted on editing the President's answers with jump cuts, which is unprecedented... There was nothing scheduled or agreed upon. We had already long promised an exclusive on filming at Butler to another national outlet, which turned out to be Fox News. Also, President Trump wasn't even scheduled to be at Mar-a-Lago last Thursday, as we previously announced a campaign visit to Michigan."""

You can have him there.'""

Presley was only 9 years old when her father passed away.

The room was kept a cool 55 degrees for Benjamin.

Keough wrote earlier that her brother was ""on dry ice.""

Presley was struggling with where to bury her son - Hawaii or Graceland - which ultimately postponed the inevitable.

""My house has a separate casitas bedroom and I kept Ben Ben in there for two months. There is no law in the state of California that you have to bury someone immediately.""

""But I got so used to him, caring for him and keeping him there. I think it would scare the living f---ing piss out of anybody else to have their son there like that. But not me,"" she wrote.

Presley wrote that so often, the grieving process is rushed. ""I felt so fortunate that there was a way that I could still parent him, delay it a bit longer so that I could become okay with laying him to rest.""

During all of this, Keough wrote that she and her mother decided to get tattoos of their brother's name, similarly to how he had tattooed theirs on his body.

""We met with the artist in the little courtyard next to the casitas, and during the meeting my mom became adamant that she wanted her tattoo exactly where my brother had his. The artist said it was possible, but that he'd need to know the font, the positioning. 'Do you happen to have any photos,'"" she remembered him asking.

""'No...but I can show you,'"" her mother responded.

""I looked at my mom, and with my eyes only communicated, 'Are you out of your f---ing mind. You've never met this guy before. Do not bring him into that room with my dead brother.'""

However, Presley did, even picking up her son's lifeless hand to show the tattoo artist exactly how she wanted her own.

""I've had an extremely absurd life, but this moment is in the top five,"" Keough wrote.

""Soon after that, we all kind of got this vibe from my brother that he didn't want his body in this house anymore. 'Guys' he seemed to be saying, 'this is getting weird.' Even my mom said that she could feel him talking to her saying, 'This is insane, Mom, what are you doing? What the f---!'"""
Jets Fire Robert Saleh After Three Seasons,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2024/10/08/jets-fire-robert-saleh-after-three-seasons/,2024-10-08T15:12:20Z,"The New York Jets are coming off a brutal showing in a loss to the Minnesota Vikings in London this past Sunday.

They fell by the score of 23-17, with future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers throwing three interceptions. Whether he can be seen as the fall guy is not yet known. But head coach Robert Saleh is the first to feel the impact of this loss.

Multiple media reports indicate that the Jets have indeed fired Saleh less than four years into his tenure in New Jersey. NFL Media's Tom Pelissero was the first to report the huge news. Defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich takes over on an interim basis.

This is not necessarily the Jets' brass being reactionary to Sunday's loss. Saleh entered this season firmly on the hot seat. Owner Woody Johnson made that clear after their 7-10 showing under Saleh last season.

""I'm not a playoff mandate (guy),"" Johnson said back in February. ""But we have to do a lot better than seven (wins).""

Saleh finishes up his Jets career with an ugly 20-36 record and having failed to lead them to a playoff appearance. He came over to New Jersey after a brilliant run as the San Francisco 49ers' defensive coordinator.

Obviously, a lot of attention will turn to what type of role Rodgers had in the decision to fire Saleh. The future Hall of Fame quarterback joined the Jets ahead of last season. He suffered a torn Achilles mere days into his tenure with the team and did not return to action until Week 1 of this season.

Someone of Rodgers' ilk will have say in what happens within the confines of an organization that has not been relevant in recent years. At 2-3 on the season and with an offense that has been among the worst in the NFL, the status quo wasn't working.

Interestingly, the Jets did not go with Rodgers' hand-picked offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett to replace Saleh on an interim basis. That could very well be a tell that he did not have a huge role in Tuesday's not-so-surprising decision. Though, Rodgers did throw praise on Ulbrich's direction after the loss on Sunday.

""They gave up only a few points to that offense that has been ripping everybody up,"" Rodgers said, via the Jets' official website. ""And they did that without Sauce Gardner for a decent part of the game and without Michael Carter II. So, credit to Jeff Ulbrich and those boys over there. They kept us in the game.""

Clearly in win-now mode, at 2-3 start to the season just was not acceptable to the Jets.

Surprisingly, this move comes with the Jets less than a week away from their next game. They are set to host the division-rival Buffalo Bills on Monday. Typically, in-season firings around the NFL are done during bye weeks. New York's bye isn't until Week 12. It's a clear indication that the team viewed Saleh remaining on the sideline as a non-starter.

It's going to be a difficult next month of football for the Jets. In addition to hosting Buffalo, they are set to take on the Pittsburgh Steelers and upstart Houston Texans. No rest for the weary for new head coach Jeff Ulbrich and Co. That's for sure."
Chiefs Run Defense Continues To Smother Its Opponents,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jefffedotin/2024/10/08/chiefs-run-defense-continues-to-smother-its-opponents/,2024-10-08T15:12:16Z,"Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo locked his fingers together while trying to describe the chemistry that makes his run defense so successful.

Indeed, the Chiefs, who only allow 88.4 running yards per game, have locked down the opponents' No. 1 running backs.

They've held three running backs -- Derrick Henry of the Baltimore Ravens, J.K. Dobbins of the Los Angeles Chargers and Alvin Kamara of the New Orleans Saints -- to season-low rushing totals of 46, 32 and 26 yards, respectively.

Henry, who signed a two-year, $16 million contract offseason deal with the Ravens, including $9 million guaranteed, is the NFL's leading rusher.

And the latest victim was Kamara, who was leading all running backs in total yards per game entering the Week Five contest.

""We really couldn't get anything going in the run game,"" Saints head coach Dennis Allen said. ""They did a good job of controlling the line of scrimmage and they made it really difficult.""

Spagnuolo praised how his aggressive linebackers play downhill, and their most impressive job may have been when they shut down the Atlanta Falcons' run game on two critical plays, which iced the 22-17 victory in Week Three.

With 1:03 left in the game, the Falcons had 3rd and 1 at the Kansas City 13. Linebacker Drue Tranquill stopped Tyler Allgeier for no gain. And then on the next play -- 4th and 1 -- the Falcons tried a perimeter run with Bijan Robinson. Middle linebacker Nick Bolton sniffed it out and combined with Leo Chenal for a three-yard loss.

""Coach (Spagnuolo) had a great call, put the big D-linemen in there, those guys got vertical,"" Bolton said. ""And I just shot my gun.""

Bolton has helped launch a reversal of fortune in Kansas City.

Even during Spagnuolo's tenure in the Super Bowl era, the run defense was a weakness, and running the ball against Kansas City was considered a great way to keep Patrick Mahomes' explosive offense off the field.

Their first Super Bowl championship team ranked just 26th against the run, and every squad since then ranked no better than 18th except for the 2022 team, which ranked eighth.

Through five games this year, the Chiefs rank third in the NFL against the run.

The versatility of Chenal and the addition of defensive tackle Mike Pennel have helped.

In his third year, the 6-3, 250-pound Chenal has really found his groove. Spagnuolo uses Chenal in a variety of roles, but he helped set the edge against the tight end on that key stop of Robinson.

After injuries to the interior of the Chiefs defensive line, there was some concern on how the Chiefs would hold up against Christian McCaffrey and the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII, but Pennel, who wasn't elevated from the practice squad to the active roster until Dec. 16, was a revelation in that title game with six tackles while playing 50% of the snaps.

This offseason he signed a one-year, $1.2 million contract with the Chiefs and has started all but one game in 2024.

The run defense has been stout all season, but the defense as a whole had been struggling on the first drives. Each of the first four opponents scored on the first drive, and three of the scores were touchdowns.

But in the 26-13 victory against the Saints, safety Bryan Cook ended New Orleans' first possession by hauling in an acrobatic interception.

The Chiefs scored a touchdown on the ensuing drive, and then the defense, which finally could play from ahead, put the clamps on Kamara and Co. from then on."
Are Ghost Guns Used In Crimes?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/katharinabuchholz/2024/10/08/are-ghost-guns-used-in-crimes/,2024-10-08T15:12:12Z,"The Supreme Court is hearing arguments today on whether Biden Administration rules regulating kits for the home assembly of guns should be reversed. The final product of the kits, so-called ghost guns, have been on the radar of law enforcement recently and have been used in crimes in the United States, with one former manufacturer even making the top ten of the most used weapons in a 2023 analysis of 34 cities by Everytown Research.

The plaintiffs in the case, who are pro-gun groups, kit manufacturers and gun owners, allege that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is overstepping its powers by mandating so-called ghost guns need to have serial numbers and be subject to background checks and that the rules in place since 2022 are unjustly overextending the definition of the term firearm. A lower court sided with the groups bringing the case and the Supreme Court agreed to hear it back in April.

The U.S. Department of Justice said in 2022 that privately made firearms, or ghost guns, ""are especially attractive to dangerous and prohibited persons because of their untraceable nature."" Everytown Research in their 2023 analysis meanwhile states that guns originating from now-defunct kit manufacturer Polymer80 made up 1.5 percent of recovered crime guns in 34 queried cities -- enough for rank 7 among the very fractured set of manufacturers. Polymer80, whose name refers to the 80%-ready kits it used to sell, ceased operations in July among mounting legal costs. Previously, it had been the leading manufacturer of the kits and parts in question.

Apart from those unable to pass background checks and those planning to use a gun illegally, ghost gun kits also appeal to minors who cannot legally purchase guns. Cases of death and injury including minors and ghost guns have made the news in recent years, including teenagers and minors as young as 12 years old accidentally injuring or killing themselves or others with ghost guns. But the guns have also been used in homicides and violent attacks by adults over the years.

The new regulations came at a time when the spread of ghost guns had proliferated in the country. According to the Department of Justice, more than 28,000 ghost guns were recovered by the government in 2022, up from just over 1,700 in 2016. While there are indications from several cities that the spread has slowed since the new rules have been in place, a Supreme Court decision in favor of ghost guns could reverse this trend again. Everytown Research also found that even more Polymer80 guns were used in crimes in 2022 than in 2023. While the latter year saw 670 such cases across 28 continuously reporting cities, the previous one had counted 933. No countrywide figures have been released for the past year.

Additionally, regulation on the state level also slowed the further spread of ghost guns. As of October 2024, 15 states including New York, California, Massachusetts, Illinois and Nevada -- where Polymer80 was headquartered -- have adopted rules saying that ghost gun kits must be subject to the same regulations as other firearms, i.e. serial numbers and background checks. Some states additionally banned undetectable plastic guns and 3D-printed guns."
First Primark Manhattan Store To Open At Herald Square Amid U.S. Growth,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfaithfull/2024/10/08/first-primark-manhattan-store-to-open-at-herald-square-amid-us-growth/,2024-10-08T15:12:10Z,"Fast fashion retailer Primark is to open its first store in New York City's Manhattan district, as its expansion in the U.S. continues.

The Associated British Foods-owned apparel giant has signed a lease for its first Manhattan storefront at Herald Square in the Penn District at 150 W 34th Street and upon opening it will become the U.S. flagship location for Primark.

Located directly across from Penn Station, the Herald Square store will cover 54,000-sq.-ft. of retail selling space, offering a mix of fashion trends and essentials, homewares and beauty across four floors. It will be the retailer's 11th store in the state of New York, once its new store in Queens, New York at Queens Center opens later this year.

The opening date for Primark Herald Square will be announced at a later date, the company said. Primark U.S. currently operates 27 stores in 11 states, soon to be 12.

""Opening a location in the epicenter of U.S. fashion is going to be an exciting milestone for Primark U.S.,"" said Kevin Tulip, Primark U.S. President. ""When the opportunity arose to bring Primark to Herald Square in Manhattan, a store with exceptionally high foot traffic, national influence, and perfectly located to attract customers who already know us from other Primark stores in the boroughs and surrounding areas, we knew it was the perfect fit.""

Primark opened its first store in Michigan on Sept. 12 at Great Lakes Crossing Outlets in Auburn Hills, a northern suburb of Detroit and at Florida Mall in Orlando on Aug. 29. The retailer had previously announced a target to open 60 U.S. stores by 2026 but has been notoriously considered in its expansion, not just in the U.S. but across its international markets.

Primark has also signed leases to open stores in CoolSprings Galleria, Franklin, Tennessee; Potomac Mills, Woodbridge, Virginia; Katy Mills, Katy, Texas; and Mall at Prince George's, Hyattsville, Maryland and earlier this year recently opened its second U.S. distribution center in Jacksonville, Florida, aimed at supporting Primark's U.S. expansion across southern states.

Founded in Ireland in 1969 under the Penneys brand and now owned by Associated British Foods (ABF), Primark has more than 450 stores across 17 countries and the retailer has been expanding across the U.S. for almost a decade, after making its store debut in Boston.

On Sept. 26 Primark celebrated half a century on the British high street, having opened its doors in 1974 at Babington Lane, Derby, in the East Midlands.

Last month ABF said that Primark continued to ""make good progress in the U.S."" and said that sales growth is expected to be around 25% in the first half of 2024.

""Recently opened stores are performing well and we opened three new stores in the period. Primark also launched its first U.S. marketing campaign in the New York area as we focus on driving increased brand awareness with U.S. customers,"" the company said in its trading update.

As part of its continued market expansion, Primark has also signed an agreement with the Kuwait-based Alshaya Group to explore the opportunity to open stores in the Gulf Cooperation Council markets in the Middle East."
How AI Is Transforming Business Planning -- 5 Steps To Success,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhenkin/2024/10/08/how-ai-is-transforming-business-planning-5-steps-to-success/,2024-10-08T15:12:03Z,"Business planning has always been part of the core of successful organizations. From startups to Fortune 500 companies, a robust business plan lays the foundation for growth, competitive advantage, and long-term sustainability.

But as the world becomes more complex and data-driven, traditional business planning methods struggle to keep up. Enter artificial intelligence (AI), a transformative technology that is reshaping how businesses strategize, execute, and measure their plans.

AI is reshaping industries and business models at an unprecedented pace. Its ability to analyze vast datasets, identify patterns, and make predictions has profound implications for every aspect of business operations, including strategic planning. By leveraging AI, organizations can advance their approach to business planning, enhance decision-making, and improve overall performance.

Traditionally, business planning has been a time-consuming and iterative process involving extensive data analysis, forecasting, and scenario planning. At its core, business planning involves setting goals, identifying the steps necessary to achieve those goals, and establishing metrics to measure progress.

This includes financial forecasting, market analysis, resource allocation, risk assessment, and the development of strategies to achieve specific objectives. Business plans serve as a roadmap for decision-making and provide a clear direction for teams across the organization.

However, established business planning practices are often time-consuming, largely manual processes that rely heavily on historical data and human intuition. The static nature of conventional business plans can also be limiting, sluggish, and reactive.

AI has the power to transform business planning by automating routine tasks, generating data-driven insights, and enabling real-time decision-making. Here are a few key ways AI is reshaping the business planning landscape:

For example, Unilever uses AI to forecast demand for its products. By analyzing data from social media, weather patterns, and economic indicators, the company's AI-driven models can predict changes in consumer demand with greater accuracy, allowing Unilever to optimize its production and inventory planning.

HSBC, for instance, leverages AI to run scenario analyses for financial planning. By simulating different economic conditions and regulatory environments, the bank can assess the potential risks and rewards of different strategies, improving decision-making at the highest levels.

A prime example is Amazon, which uses AI to manage inventory across its global supply chain. By analyzing real-time data on sales, inventory levels, and shipping times, Amazon's AI systems can automatically allocate resources to optimize efficiency and reduce costs.

Walmart, for example, uses AI to dynamically adjust pricing and inventory across its stores.

JPMorgan Chase employs AI to detect fraud and assess credit risk, significantly improving their risk management strategies.

Spotify utilizes AI to measure the effectiveness of its content recommendations in real-time. By analyzing user behavior and engagement, Spotify's AI systems can adjust its algorithms to improve the relevance of content recommendations, driving user retention and growth.

AI is also transforming how we measure the effectiveness of business plans:

To capture the benefits of AI-driven business planning and avoid the pitfalls, businesses should consider the following action steps:

By incorporating AI, businesses can transform traditional business planning into a dynamic, predictive, and innovative process. While challenges exist, the short-term and long-term benefits of integrating AI into business planning can help businesses and their leaders make more informed decisions, reduce risks, adapt quickly to market changes, and more effectively measure and manage progress against plans.

There's No TikTok If It's 'A Tool Of Chinese Communist Propaganda',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/10/08/theres-no-tiktok-if-its-a-tool-of-chinese-communist-propaganda/,2024-10-08T15:11:58Z,"Bikes were ""as indispensable to a Chinese as a car to twentieth century Americans."" Those are the words of Fox Butterfield from Alive In the Bitter Sea, his 1982 book about communist-era China. Call Butterfield's account of just some of communism's myriad horrors essential reading when it comes to attaining a tangible grasp of how little communism associates with anything related to competition or prosperity.

As Butterfield went on to report, ""To buy a bike you also had to have a special bike purchase coupon"" that was exceedingly difficult to come by. Butterfield interviewed one factory worker who indicated that, ""out of every one hundred workers, only two were given these treasured certificates each year."" Such was brutal life amid the CCP's control of China's economy from the proverbial Commanding Heights.

The China of old came to mind while reading a recent Wall Street Journal column by the great Andy Kessler. He quoted Sen. Tom Cotton as saying that ""TikTok is a tool of Chinese Communist propaganda."" Let's just say they don't make cold warriors like they used to. Is Cotton aware of just how hideously cruel communism was, and much more important, how little production there is when governmental bodies (including the CCP) manage economic activity, when property is owned by them, and when people allegedly work according to their abilities and needs?

The questions about Cotton (along with a myriad of other TikTok critics in the commentariat) are asked mainly because communist rule is defined by unrelenting desperation. As was made apparent during the Soviet Union years for Russia, communist rule and its bitter fruits is the stuff of empty shelves, not to mention that if there's anything on the shelf, it's what no one wants. It's worth thinking about as Cotton and others of his ilk claim TikTok is but a puppet for the CCP. You mean the TikTok that is headquartered in Singapore and Los Angeles, and that is substantially owned by American investors?

If TikTok were a tool of any government, let alone a CCP the rule of which so awfully correlated with immense dysfunction, it's safe to say it would in no way be a global powerhouse. Evidence supporting this claim isn't just vivified by what economic life was like when the CCP arrogated to itself command-and-control powers, but also by the relative freedom of the U.S. economy that has logically gifted Americans (and the world) with the most dynamic, customer-leading businesses in the world.

It's just another reminder that TikTok's critics can't have it both ways. They can't make baseless claims about TikTok being a ""a tool"" of the CCP when it's remembered just how awful and inept commerce was when the CCP was actually running the Chinese economy. In short, if TikTok were ""a tool of Chinese Communist propaganda,"" it not only would have no voluntary users as is the case with all government-operated entities of any kind, it also wouldn't exist as evidenced by the scarcity of nearly every necessity when the CCP ran China."
'Goosebumps: The Vanishing' On Disney Plus Gets Spooky Reveal And Release Date,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mitchwallace/2024/10/08/goosebumps-the-vanishing-on-disney-plus-gets-spooky-reveal-and-release-date/,2024-10-08T15:11:54Z,"Today is an especially spooky day for two reasons: It's Goosebumps creator R.L. Stine's birthday (congrats on another slimy trip around the sun, Bob!) and a new season of the Disney+/Hulu Goosebumps show has been revealed, paired with a rapidly approaching release date: Friday, January 10, 2025. All eight episodes will go live at the same time, unlike the previous season.

Goosebumps: The Vanishing is the official title for the upcoming entry in last year's rebooted TV show, which was loosely based on the best-selling middle grade horror book series. Once again, the project is being developed by Nicholas Stoller and Rob Letterman, as well as showrunner Hilary Winston. I interviewed the former pair last year, and seeing as how I thoroughly enjoyed the first season, I'm glad to hear they're back to further develop this growing eerie anthology.

The gist? All new characters. All new narrative. More small town fright, assumingly. Check out the fresh teaser below:

David Schwimmer, who stars alongside Ana Ortiz in The Vanishing, plays Anthony Brewer, ""a former botany professor who has immersed himself in science and mystery."" This feels like a direct reference to one of the earliest Goosebumps books, the second entry back in 1992 to be exact, and it's been confirmed as such:

""The new season draws on elements from some of the most popular books, including 'Stay Out of the Basement,' 'The Haunted Car,' 'Monster Blood,' 'The Girl Who Cried Monster,' 'The Ghost Next Door,' 'Welcome to Camp Nightmare' and more.""

I think Stay out of the Basement is one of the strongest Goosebumps books, so it will be interesting to see how Stoller and Letterman bring that one into the fold -- it seems like it will play a major role. Furthermore, a lot of these books are what you might consider deep cuts in the Goosebumps world, especially stuff like The Girl Who Cried Monster and The Ghost Next Door. These don't get mentioned very often, so it's cool to see they're being included here.

Also of note is The Haunted Car, because it's a Goosebumps 2000 series story, and that wasn't published until 1999, long after the original series had concluded. Monster Blood is the most obvious choice, simply because it's a mainstay of the franchise and received numerous sequels. Welcome to Camp Nightmare is actually one of my favorites and has a nice twist ending, classic Stine. I always loved the camp stories for some reason, including Ghost Camp and The Horror at Camp Jellyjam.

Here's the brief synopsis for the new season, just so we know what we're in for:

""Goosebumps: The Vanishing begins when twins Cece and Devin Brewer are sent to spend a summer in Gravesend, Brooklyn, with their divorced dad. A threat is stirring, and they quickly realize that dark secrets are among them, triggering a chain of events that unravel a profound mystery. As they delve into the unknown, Cece, Devin and their friends -- Alex, CJ and Frankie -- find themselves entangled in the chilling tale of four teenagers who mysteriously vanished in 1994.

Ah, a divorced dad script, something we'd have never seen in the original Goosebumps books. Which is all well and good, really, because last year's reboot was never about staying note-for-note faithful to the G-rated '90s manuscripts, necessarily. It was about modernizing the series, taking it in a slightly more mature direction. And if you watched last season, you'll know all of Stine's kid-friendly rules went out the haunted window, as it were. These were characters with real-life problems, and I anticipate the second season will follow suit.

Despite some arguably uneven and occasionally cheesy writing, I had fun with Stoller and Letterman's darker take on Goosebumps, and judging from the cryptic teaser trailer, I think we're in for another twisted-yet-wacky ride in season two. ""It's for the greater good,"" deadpans Schwimmer's tortured character, and his impressively creepy delivery gives me some Halloween hope. Will Schwimmer abandon his famous comedy chops and top Justin Long's excellent performance in the first season? We'll see. I almost made a 'pivot!' joke, but I won't. I'm a professional.

It's just a shame we'll have to wait until the new year for another dose of (somewhat) safe scares. The countdown begins. At least we can celebrate R.L.'s birthday in the meantime, perhaps with some Crypt Cake and Poltergeist Punch? Bob, out of respect, I won't write what age you are. I'll only say it rhyme's with smeighty-shwun."
I went to a classic Wisconsin supper club to talk politics. This is what I learned,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5138314/wisconsin-supper-club-harris-trump,2024-10-08T15:11:27Z,"The Packing House in Milwaukee caters to diners of all political persuasions. Keren Carrión/NPR hide caption

When we started planning an election reporting trip to swing state Wisconsin, locals told us we had to include a visit to a supper club to experience a unique part of the state's culture. So when I finally met Chris Wiken, whose family opened The Packing House in Milwaukee 50 years ago, my first question was, ""What on earth is a supper club?""

""This is the elusive question,"" he says. ""The whole idea of a supper club is somewhere that you're going to come and spend the evening at.""

Typically, a supper club will include a few things: a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned cocktail at the bar, seafood or prime rib in the dining room and then live music and a boozy ice cream drink to close out the night.

Even though The Packing House was remodeled about a decade ago, it still has a classic old-time aesthetic with dark wood and dim lighting. Walking through the doors feels like going back in time.

Milwaukee's main airport terminal was just across the street when The Packing House opened in 1974. Now, that terminal serves private jets where former President Donald Trump, Vice President Harris or their running mates park every time they come to town.

""The police and Secret Service come over and go, 'Hey, Chris, they have to close down the street again.' And then I go and shake my fist at them,"" he says, joking that he'll vote for whoever shuts down the street in front of his restaurant fewer times.

You won't see a Harris or Trump sign in front of The Packing House. Wiken doesn't want to alienate his customers, who have a wide range of views, as the All Things Considered crew and I discovered when we started chatting people up at the bar.

Janine Collette, having dinner with an old friend, remembers growing up in Wisconsin before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in the state.

""In high school, we used to raise money in the girls' bathrooms to help girls go to the state of New York to get an abortion,"" she says. ""We're not going back."" Collette is excited to cast her vote for the candidate she expects to become the first female U.S. president.

At the other end of the bar, Ron Raasch says that he has voted for Democrats his whole life and that this election may be the first time he doesn't. He's disillusioned with the two-party system and is considering a vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

""It's very hard to see the difference when both of the major parties are going to continue shipping arms all over the world and especially to Gaza,"" he says. Raasch isn't concerned that in 2016 and 2020 the margin of victory in Wisconsin for Trump and Biden, respectively, was less than 1% of the vote. ""People are throwing that as a fear tactic,"" he says. ""And I'm trying to [more so] make a statement that the two-party system is showing its age and its frailties.""

Wearing a Packers hat at the bar, Lee Cielonko is nursing a beer while he waits for his food to arrive. ""I want the economy to be put back together. I want energy. I want to drill, baby, drill, man,"" he says.

He's supporting Trump and is concerned about immigration, saying: ""People come here and they don't have the same culture as us. They don't understand and know a lot of the way our culture works.""

So much about the future, as well as this election, is uncertain; there can be something comforting in the familiar: fish fry Friday, a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned at the bar and live music in a place that has been doing pretty much the same thing since before most Americans were born."
5 key takeaways from Kamala Harris' '60 Minutes' interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/5-key-takeaways-from-kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview,2024-10-08T15:03:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program.

Here are some standout moments from the Harris interview.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Whitaker asked Harris about the ongoing crises in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, with Israel under assault from Iranian proxies and Ukraine persevering in the fight against Russia's invasion. In her answers, Harris did not do much to distinguish her foreign policy from that of the current administration.

On Israel, Harris echoed Biden's call for the war with Hamas to end, though she acknowledged the Jewish nation's right to defend itself after the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, when terrorists slaughtered 1,200 people and took 250 captives back to Gaza.

""I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end,"" Harris said.

Whitaker pointed out that although the United States has handed billions of dollars to Israel in military aid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted the Biden-Harris administration's call for a cease-fire with Hamas. When asked if the U.S. holds no sway over Netanyahu, Harris dodged the question and stayed on message, emphasizing the current administration's diplomatic efforts.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" she said.

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

Whitaker pressed, ""but it seems Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.""

Harris declined to answer that point. ""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""

On Europe, Harris stuck with Biden's position that Ukraine must be involved in any resolution to the war with Russia.

""There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the U.N. charter participating in what that success looks like,"" she said.

In a definitive statement, Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war unless Ukrainian representatives were present. However, she was less specific on whether Ukraine should join NATO.

""Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression,"" Harris said. ""Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREET TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Whitaker confronted Harris on her apparent flip-flop on immigration, noting that she supported Biden's efforts to reverse Trump's strict policies even as a historic flood of illegal immigrants crossed the border. Now, the vice president has ""embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers,"" he said.

Whitaker asked, ""If that's the right answer, now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?""

Harris responded by pointing to congressional Republicans who backed out of a bipartisan agreement on a border security bill negotiated by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. ""Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed. And he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress kill the bill. Don't let it move forward,"" she said.

However, Whitaker pushed back on the vice president, observing that in the first three years of the Biden-Harris administration, border arrivals quadrupled and there was no action from Biden or Harris.

""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?""

Harris did not answer the question but asserted that her administration has offered solutions ""from day one, literally.""

""We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem,"" she said, again echoing Biden.

To fight inflation, Harris said she intends to ask Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries. She would expand the child tax credit to $6,000, give first-time homebuyers $25,000 in down payment assistance and offer generous assistance to people starting a small business.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that the total cost of her economic proposals would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

""How are you going to pay for that?"" asked Whitaker.

""Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it,"" Harris answered. ""But my plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.""

HARRIS SAYS WEALTHY AMERICANS, CORPORATIONS WILL PAY HIGHER TAXES TO FUND ECONOMIC PLAN

Whitaker pressed again. ""Pardon me, madam vice president. The question was, how are you going to pay for it?""

The Democratic candidate's answer was that the rich must ""pay their fair share in taxes.""

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations, and I plan on making that fair,"" Harris asserted.

Whitaker followed up again, stating, ""we're dealing with the real world here"" and observing that Congress has shown no inclination to raise taxes.

""I disagree with you,"" Harris responded. ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

""None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy,"" she continued. ""Let me tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that I am also a capitalist, and I know the limitations of government.""

After a discussion on foreign policy, Whitaker took ""a hard left turn"" and asked Harris about her recent admission that she is a gun owner.

""I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time,"" Harris said after he asked what kind of gun she owns. ""And, I mean, look, my background is in law enforcement, and so there you go.""

Harris served as the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004-2011 and was California's attorney general from 2011-2017 before she was elected to the U.S. Senate and later selected as Biden's 2020 running mate.

She told Whitaker she has fired her handgun ""at a shooting range.""

Though Harris had served in government for decades before becoming vice president, she remains a largely unknown figure in national politics. She did not run for president in the 2024 Democratic primary and only became a candidate two and a half months ago, when Biden decided to drop out of the race amid mounting pressure from Democrats concerned that he was too old to win.

""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you,"" Whitaker told Harris. They don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""

""It's an election, Bill,"" Harris replied. ""And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support."
"Friends since birth, Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal are back together on screen",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5101757/la-maquina-diego-luna-gael-garcia-bernal-hulu,2024-10-08T15:02:18Z,"Diego Luna (left) and Gael García Bernal in Los Angeles in September. Erica Hernandez for NPR hide caption

Actors Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal have been friends since they were babies in Mexico City.

Actually, as the story goes - they met even earlier.

""Diego was still a molecule. He was still a little amoeba,"" says García Bernal - who, according to the family lore, was a year old when his parents took him to the hospital where Luna was born.

""When I was finally delivered into this world, he was there waiting for me,"" says Luna. ""And he looked at me and said -""

""You're late, but welcome,"" García Bernal interjects.

Their parents had been great friends too; García Bernal's father was an acclaimed theater director, his mother an actress; Luna's father was a well-known set designer, and his mother a costume designer.

""They were doing a theater play, and I think Gael was born when they were rehearsing and I was born when they were executing the play,"" says Luna. ""Whoever wasn't actually needed on the stage was taking care of us, I guess. And I think that that has a lot to do with the connection we have.""

The night before our interview, Luna and García Bernal were onstage together at the Emmy Awards in Los Angeles. They announced and presented one award entirely in their native language.

""It was nice to go all the way...to do it just in Spanish,"" Luna says, explaining it was a nod to the huge Spanish-speaking audience in the U.S.

""We have to be unapologetic about it, because Spanish is one of the main languages in the United States,"" adds García Bernal. ""Contextually, politically, there is a reason to speak in Spanish. And also it sounds a little bit radical to do.""

Now, Luna and García Bernal are teaming up again, for Hulu's first original series in Spanish: La Máquina.

""I'm 44,"" says Luna. ""I had to wait to be 44 to do a show in Spanish produced by an American studio. So it's just the time, right?""

Both actors have followed in their parents' footsteps: As teens in the 1990s, they acted on stage and in TV soap operas such as El Abuelo y Yo. Then in 2000, García Bernal got his big break in Alejandro González Iñárritu's film Amores Perros.

The following year, he and Luna starred as best friends in a love triangle in the coming-of-age road trip movie Y Tu Mamá También.

""From the get-go, it was very clear the incredible talent, also the amazing friendship that they have is something very touching, really beautiful,"" recalls director Alfonso Cuarón.

García Bernal says it was such a small production crew, they helped carry the camera bags and asked about the camera lenses. ""They found us like these little mascots,"" he says, adding that hearing the conversations between Cuarón and cinematographer Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki was ""like being around John Lennon and [Paul] McCartney talking about music.""

Cuaron remembers the two actors always making fun of them. ""There is a great sense of humor around them. I think it's one of those great duos of cinema.""

As producers, they partnered nearly 20 years ago to create the Ambulante Film Festival, to showcase documentaries in Mexico. They also co-created two production companies, Canana Films and La Corriente del Golfo, focused on social justice themes. Later this month, Netflix will begin streaming one documentary Luna executive produced, State of Silence [Estado del Silencio], about the risks Mexican journalists face in covering the drug wars.

Cuarón says he admires their artistic choices and the opportunities they give other actors and filmmakers.

""What is really incredible is to see how, as the years pass, how they have embraced life with integrity and full responsibility of who they are and who they represent -- particularly, in Mexico, Latin America,"" says Cuarón. ""And just to watch the two of them on screen is just pure joy and pleasure.""

Luna says for many years, they'd been trying to cook up another project to reunite as producers and actors. And one hungover morning during the Berlin Film Festival, they say, they came up with La Máquina. It's about two best friends: a boxer and his manager.

""Diego had done a great documentary about [world champion] Julio César Chavez, and I had been training a lot in boxing. And we love the sport. Mexico is one of the best countries at boxing. So it was, like, why not let's tell a story that is very ours?"" says García Bernal.

García Bernal plays an aging boxer, Esteban, whose nickname is ""La Máquina"" (""The Machine""). Luna plays his manager, who is obsessed with plastic surgery. In the story, criminals threaten to kill both of them unless Esteban throws his next match.

""We wanted to tell the story of a boxer [at his] height, in [his] complete success,"" says García Bernal, ""and realizing that losing is a way to win. That is counter-narrative to [how] the world talks about success and everything. It's when losing becomes winning.""

Luna says he and García Bernal can relate to what boxers go through, not only having to perform, but also constantly going on tour, dealing with managers, agents and promoters.

Fans hope to see more of Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal on screen together, in any language."
5 Must-See Immersive Art Exhibitions In London This Fall,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanneshurvell/2024/10/08/5-must-see-immersive-art-exhibitions-in-london-this-fall/,2024-10-08T15:01:47Z,"Every October, Frieze Art Fair and ""Frieze Week"" ushers in numerous additional art fairs (Start, 1-54, PAD London) and countless art exhibitions in the capital, including a raft of immersive shows. From interactive digital installations to immersive environments indoors and outside that engage sight, sound and even touch, here are some of London's most exciting exhibitions (including two that are free) that allow visitors to step inside the artwork itself.

Curated by Fatoş Üstek, Frieze Sculpture has expanded for its 12th edition to include 22 leading international artists hailing from five continents, whose work is sited throughout Regent Park's historic English Gardens. The free sculpture exhibition, held alongside Frieze Art Fair, includes works by Leonora Carrington, Theaster Gates, Zanele Muholi and Yoshitomo Nara.

For her first major UK show, Haegue Yang's work at the Hayward Gallery on London's Southbank, spans a vast range of media - from paper collage to performative sculpture and immense sensorial installations. Equally as wide-ranging, the Korean artist's inspiration draws on diverse histories and customs, including East Asian traditions and folklore, modernism, contemporary art history and nature. These works bring together a wide spectrum of visual and sensory experiences through the mediums of installation, sculpture, collage, text, video, wallpaper, sound. Yang uses a variety of crafts, techniques and materials in her work, tapping into the cultural connotations they carry. Her works often feature a variety of household and industrial objects, including drying racks, light bulbs, metal-plated bells, nylon pom-poms, hand-knitted yarn and hanji (Korean paper).

The Japanese artist's latest show is her fourteenth solo exhibition at London's Victoria Miro gallery and includes Kusama's latest paintings and sculptures as well as a much-anticipated new infinity mirrored room, an immersive work that envelops visitors inside a pulsating, light-filled, hexagonal space. The ceiling is colored flashing LED lights arranged in a concentric pattern whose reflections produce an infinite honeycomb. A large, mirrored sphere hangs in the centre of the space where you'll see endless distorted reflections of yourself. Two large-scale stuffed fabric installations also dominate the upper and lower galleries. Death of Nerves, 2022 consists of numerous multicolored sewn, stuffed-fabric elements reminiscent of tendrils, vines or even a nervous system, suspended from the ceiling beams of the upper gallery, coming to rest on the ground floor fifteen metres below. Also upstairs are paintings and a new work The Moment of Regeneration, 2024, a cluster of red-and-black sewn, stuffed fabric forms that look like a mini forest. The free tickets are sold out but check for returns and additional releases.

""Through the experience of Eclipse, we would like visitors to realize the power and impact of light on visual perception when combined with space and sound."" Nonotak

Lumen Studios' immersive audiovisual experience, Eclipse, by acclaimed creative duo Nonotak is their first solo exhibition in London. Spanning over 1,000 square meters in a vast south London warehouse, Eclipse includes three light and sound installations, including two new site-specific works. Kinetic visuals, projection mapping, choreographed sound and more, engrosses the viewer in dynamic audiovisual landscapes and experimentations. The duo of visual artist Noemi Schipfer and light and sound artist Takami Nakamoto is inspired by minimalist architecture and optical art and their installations invite an exploration of the interplay between light and darkness; sound and silence; and the physical and the intangible. The duo has collaborated with Hermès, Adidas and Roppongi Art Night and their work has also been featured in John Wick 4.

""The power of performance art, after all, lies in its ability to transform not just the artist but the audience too. The body of the artist is the medium, but so too is that of the observer."" Marina Abramović

Moco Museum London's first temporary exhibition is Healing Frequency, a new exhibition by Serbian performance artist Marina Abramović where you can engage with interactive spaces designed for contemplation and transformation. The show brings together 12 works from Abramović's series Transitory Objects for Human Use, including one piece that has been acquired for Moco's permanent collection. This important series of works in Abramović's career, dates back to the 1990s and includes a series of chairs, beds, and benches adorned with Abramovic's signature crystals. At the centre of the exhibition is the newly acquired Chair for Human Use with Chair for Spirit Use, featuring two chairs in which visitors will have the opportunity to sit across from each other, entering a moment of shared energy, ""activating the power of art"" as Abramovic explains."
"Hong Kong Corrects & Mainland Catches Up, NDRC Lacks Specifics With More Announcements To Come",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brendanahern/2024/10/08/hong-kong-corrects--mainland-catches-up-ndrc-lacks-specifics-with-more-announcements-to-come/,2024-10-08T15:01:42Z,"Last night was a roller coaster in China's markets after the Mainland reopened following the weeklong National Holiday or ""Golden Week"". The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets opened at the 10% limit-up threshold, but the Hang Seng fell -9.41% after investors were disappointed by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) press conference's lack of fiscal policy details.

The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock market opened at the 10% limit-up threshold, showing the pent-up demand from investors. Mainland volumes were up 400% versus the 30-day average. Some local media reports have referenced anywhere between 1-2 million new accounts opened per day during the National Day holiday. New brokerage accounts opened during the National Day holiday will only be able to start trading on October 9, and more funds may flow in afterward.

It is important to note that the rally has been massive, leading the government to want to manage expectations. Regulators are cautious of overheating the market and are guiding banks not to direct loans or leverage to the stock market.

The big event overnight was the press conference held by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The conference disappointed investors because it did not provide enough detail on the new fiscal stimulus. The Hang Seng Index was down -9.41% overnight. However, it is important to note that there will be a series of meetings in the coming days and weeks where the full fiscal stimulus package will be outlined.

Upcoming events:

We have seen the government's previous stimulus packages have lifted consumer confidence over the holiday, with travel data for China's National Holiday coming in strong. More than 2 billion trips were made during the week-long holiday. Xinhua says outbound and inbound travel volumes hit a record.

Despite the record travel numbers, consumption of goods needs to rise to the level of services. We are still seeing this imbalance. Our colleague in China said in June that people were feeling that experiences should be valued over physical goods, especially coming out of the pandemic. This is changing, albeit gradually, and goods consumption subsidies will help.

The PBOC fixed the yuan at 7.07 CNY per USD, which is above the level expected. Allowing the currency to depreciate somewhat after a strong run makes sense and demonstrates the central bank's easing stance.

The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes fell -9.41% and -12.82%, respectively, on volume that increased +109% from yesterday. The top-performing sectors were Health Care, which fell -7.84%; Energy, which fell -8.39%; and Materials, which fell -8.79%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Real Estate, which fell -17.48%, Consumer Staples, which fell -13.09%, and Consumer Discretionary, which fell -11.28%.

Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board gained +4.59%, 8.89%, and 17.38%, respectively, on volume that increased +33% from the last session. The top-performing sectors were Information Technology, which gained +11.86%, Health Care, which gained +6.02%, and Industrials, which gained +6.03%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Utilities, which fell -1.60%, Energy, which fell -0.98%, and Consumer Staples, which gained +0.41%."
Suspect in Madeleine McCann disappearance case acquitted of unrelated sexual offense charges,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/suspect-madeleine-mccann-disappearance-case-acquitted-unrelated-sexual-offense-charges,2024-10-08T14:58:23Z,"Brueckner has not been charged in the McCann case, in which he is under investigation on suspicion of murder.

A German court on Tuesday acquitted a man who is also under investigation in the 2007 disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann in a trial on charges of unrelated sexual offenses.

The Braunschweig state court acquitted the 47-year-old German national, who has been identified by local media as Christian Brueckner, of two counts of rape and two of sexual abuse.

However, Brueckner will remain in prison another year because he is still serving a seven-year sentence for rape in a different case, German news agency dpa reported.

MADELEINE MCCANN WITNESS CLAIMS SUSPECT IN HER KIDNAPPING DRUNKENLY CONFESSED TO CRIME

Brueckner had been on trial since February over offenses he is alleged to have committed in Portugal between 2000 and 2017. Defense lawyers had pointed to what they labeled a lack of evidence and witnesses who weren't credible, and suggested he might not have been charged if he hadn't also been a suspect in the McCann case.

Prosecutors had argued he should be given a 15-year prison sentence and kept in preventive detention once he has served it.

""The evidence we had was not enough to convict the defendant,"" presiding judge Uta Engemann said, according to dpa, adding that ""we were dealing with unreliable witnesses, some of whom deliberately lied to the court.""

Engemann argued that witnesses had been influenced in their statements by the media's reporting on Brueckner, who she said had been ""stylized as a sex monster and child murderer.""

Prosecutors said they would appeal the ruling.

""We believe that the decision is wrong, so we will appeal to the German supreme court so that the supreme court can check the verdict for mistakes,"" prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said.

Brueckner's lawyer, Friedrich Fülscher, told reporters after the ruling that ""it was foreseeable, at least from the point of view of the defense, that there can only be one outcome that corresponds to the factual and legal situation and that is the acquittal.""

Brueckner has not been charged in the McCann case, in which he is under investigation on suspicion of murder. He spent many years in Portugal, including in the resort of Praia da Luz around the time of Madeleine's disappearance there in 2007. He has denied any involvement in her disappearance.

He is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2019 by the Braunschweig court for the rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal in 2005.

The Braunschweig state court has jurisdiction because Brueckner had his last German residence in that city in Lower Saxony."
"Asked about targeting his foes after the election, Trump hedges (again)",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/asked-targeting-foes-election-trump-hedges-rcna174469,2024-10-08T14:56:15Z,"Fox News keeps trying to get Trump to say he won't prosecute his political enemies in a second term. Unable to help himself, he keeps missing the cues.

Late last year, Fox News' Sean Hannity asked Donald Trump if he had plans to ""abuse power, to break the law, to use the government to go after people."" The obvious point was to have the former president say he had no intention of breaking the law or abusing his authority. Trump, however, missed the point and deflected.

So, the host tried again to get his guest to say the sensible thing. ""Under no circumstances, you are promising America tonight you would never abuse power as retribution against anybody?"" Hannity asked. Trump responded by saying he wanted to create a temporary American dictatorship.

Six months later, the duo tried again. ""Will you pledge to restore equal justice, equal application of our laws, end this practice of weaponization?"" the Fox host asked, pointing to developments that have no basis in reality. ""Is that a promise you're going to make?"" Trump eventually responded, ""Look, I know you want me to say something so nice, but I don't want to look naive.""

In the same interview, Hannity also noted those who ""want people to believe that you want retribution, that you will use the system of justice to go after your political enemies."" Once again, the former president missed the prompt.

""Look, when this election is over, based on what they have done, I would have every right to go after them,"" Trump replied.

This week, it was Laura Ingraham's turn. It went about as well.

The Fox host began by asking the GOP nominee how he intends to ""restore faith in our Justice system,"" adding, ""A lot of people will say, 'Well, he's just going to do to them what he they did to him back at them.'""

Trump continued to miss the cues. ""A lot of people say that's what should happen, right?"" Trump replied and the nearby audience murmured its approval.

Ingraham tried again. ""Punitively using government institutions is what got us in this mess in the first place,"" she said, pointing to imaginary circumstances that don't exist. ""In our townhall we did back in February, one of the lines that really resonated, I think, with people is when you said, 'My revenge is going to be success.'""

It appeared that the Fox host was trying to guide the candidate to safer ground. It also appeared that he didn't care.

""Well, I do believe that, but I will say this: They have started a terrible precedent,"" Trump said. ""We've never had this. We do have that in Third World countries, banana republics, a lot in South America, where they go after somebody politically that's an opponent.""

It led Ingraham to try a third time to get the Republican to say the responsible thing. ""But you're not going to do that,"" she said. ""When you get into office, you're going to look at all your political enemies?""

Trump didn't exactly answer the question directly.

""No, I want to make this the most successful country in the world. That's what I want to do,"" he replied.

To be sure, part of Ingraham's line of inquiry was problematic. She treated it as a given, for example, that the Biden administration has weaponized federal law enforcement, despite the fact that this hasn't happened; the ridiculous conspiracy theories have been thoroughly and repeatedly discredited; and there's unambiguous evidence pointing in the opposite direction.

But Trump's answers were far worse.

The Republican not only took deliberate and abusive steps to target his perceived foes while in office, he's effectively running on a retaliatory 2024 platform: Trump wants to prosecute his perceived domestic political enemies, and he doesn't seem especially interested in hiding his intentions. On the contrary, he talks about his desire to abuse presidential powers all the time, even raising the specter of military tribunals for his opponents.

A recent New York Times analysis noted that Trump has effectively put the rule of law ""on the ballot."" Fox News hosts keep trying to help the former president take the issue off the ballot, but the GOP candidate, hellbent on revenge, simply can't help himself."
The Numbers Behind Netflix Cancelling 'Kaos' After Just One Season,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2024/10/08/the-numbers-behind-netflix-cancelling-kaos-after-just-one-season/,2024-10-08T14:53:35Z,"Kaos may have an adoring legion of fans, but it wasn't enough to save the dark comedy series from cancellation. After just one season, the show, which premiered on Aug. 29, 2024, has already met its end, despite spending multiple weeks in several Top 10 rankings in several countries. The show's ambitious attempt to retell Greek mythology in a modern-day setting won many people over and received great reviews, but in the end (as I'll soon detail), the viewership numbers weren't there to guarantee a second and third season like the show's creator, Charlie Covell, intended.

The series starred Jeff Goldblum as a paranoid, insecure Zeus, who stands at the center of a power struggle between the gods and humanity -- an effort spearheaded by Prometheus and a group of humans including Eurydice, Ariadne, and Caeneus. Despite its dynamite cast that included the likes of Janet McTeer, Cliff Curtis, David Thewlis and Aurora Perrineau, the show failed to secure a second season, leaving fans disappointed.

The cancellation was first revealed in a now-deleted Instagram post by Perrineau, who played Eurydice, confirming the show's fate to her followers. You can read the full post over on What's On Netflix, but here's a small selection:

""For one of the first times in my life, I have found myself really proud. I'm, of course, proud of everyone's work and the care they gave to this project, because, let me tell you, they left everything on the floor. But I've also found myself proud of me, and that is something I've struggled with. When I got cast, I couldn't believe that someone SAW me. A girl who's not only a minority but also a survivor of SA -- and you're telling me that someone thinks I could be one of the leads of a show, have agency, my own mission, and be desirable enough to be the love interest to not only one amazing human but two? I was worthy of that? Everything that happened from that point forward really changed my perspective.""

When someone in the comments section of her post asked if the show was cancelled, Perrineau signaled that it was. Then, earlier this morning, Variety had indeed confirmed the show's cancellation.

Kaos was initially envisioned as a three-season arc by Covell, who explained in an interview that the first season's finale set up several potential storylines for future installments, including the weakening of Zeus's power and the rise of Prometheus as a new leader. Covell expressed optimism that the first season, despite not ending on a cliffhanger, would leave enough room for progression as the show would continue to develop its characters and story.

As is always the case with these cult-obsessed shows, the continuation of Kaos relied upon its viewership numbers (What's On Netflix goes into great detail about this, by the way). While Kaos' first four weeks on the global Top 10 charts was promising, its performance was ultimately inconsistent and didn't display the sustained growth Netflix expects from its multiple-season shows.

In its debut week, Kaos ranked #3 on Netflix's English-language TV chart, accruing 22.8 million hours viewed, which translated to about 3.4 million views. The second week was best for the show, with it pulling in 39;.2 million hours viewed, aka 5.9 million views -- a 72% increase from the previous week.

From there, however, it was a slow and inevitable decline, with the numbers dropping by 43% in the third week to 22.4 million hours viewed (3.4 million views), then decreasing further in the fourth and final week with 14.5 million hours viewed (2.2 million views). Kaos accumulated approximately 98.9 million hours viewed, or 14.9 million total views.

While a steady decline is expected of most shows, this sort of drop-off lined up with other recent shows that got cancelled by Netflix. The streaming service's renewal decisions are primarily based on viewership in those first 28 days. Shows need to not only bring in a large audience, but they must also retain that audience to grow. And, per the drop in the show's second week, Kaos failed to achieve this. After its second week peak, the drop in viewership suggested that engagement was quickly waning.

Additionally, Netflix reclassified ""Kaos Season 1"" to just ""Kaos,"" signaling a shift its status to a limited series. In the past, this has typically indicated (as we saw in this case) that Netflix no longer views the show as a long-term investment. Compared to other recent Netflix shows that were renewed, such as Supacell, The Gentlemen and My Life with the Walter Boys, Kaos consistently ranked lower and had less consistency in the weeks following its debut. Meanwhile, shows that were canceled, like Dead Boy Detectives and Obliterated, showed a similar pattern to Kaos in terms of early decline in viewership and failure to maintain momentum."
Why BP's Elimination Of 2030 Oil Reduction Target Is No Real Surprise,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2024/10/08/why-bps-elimination-of-2030-oil-reduction-target-is-no-real-surprise/,2024-10-08T14:53:31Z,"British oil giant BP advanced efforts to adjust its business plans to make itself more competitive with peer companies Monday, announcing it will abandon a goal of reducing its equity oil production by 2030. Originally set in 2020 at a 40% reduction by former CEO Bernard Looney, current BP management led by CEO Murray Auchincloss had reduced the goal in January to a 25% target.

Reuters quotes a company spokesperson as saying the company's long-term goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 remains unchanged despite the elimination of this near-term target. ""As Murray said at the start of year... the direction is the same - but we are going to deliver as a simpler, more focused, and higher value company,"" the spokesperson said.

The elimination of the targeted production cuts follows a series of moves invoked by Auchincloss throughout 2024 designed to dedicate a larger percentage of the company's capital allocation on its core oil and gas business ventures. In July, Auchincloss imposed a hiring freeze and pause in new investments in the company's wind energy business unit, reversing Looney's strategy of aggressively investing in both onshore and offshore wind projects as a key part of the plan to replace lost revenues from cuts in oil production and to meet the company's net zero goals.

Most recently, Auchincloss followed that step with an even more aggressive move in September, announcing plans to completely divest BP's suite of US onshore wind projects, a total of 10 operations BP currently owns through its subsidiary BP Wind Energy. At the same time, Auchincloss detailed plans to acquire full ownership of Lightsource BP, a solar-focused joint venture in which it owns 50%. The plan there would be add some wind development to the Lightsource BP portfolio.

In making these and other moves designed to make itself more competitive through a refocus on its core oil and gas business, BP aligns itself with similar strategic moves made over the last two years by US majors ExxonMobil and Chevron, as well as fellow British major Shell. It all follows a move to prioritize energy security over ESG goals, a general industry theme that emerged early in 2023.

Reaction to BP's latest move from the anti-fossil fuel activist community was swift and aggressive. The Guardian quotes Greenpeace UK senior climate campaigner Philip Evans as saying, ""This is yet further proof that we cannot leave the future of our planet in the hands of fossil fuel bosses. It's clear that BP CEO Murray Auchincloss is hell-bent on prioritising company profits and shareholder wealth above all else as extreme floods and wildfires rack up billions of dollars in damages, destroying homes and lives all over the world. Oil companies cannot be trusted to curtail their further destruction of the planet.""

James Alexander, CEO of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association, was less bombastic, accusing oil majors like BP of failing to ""invest enough"" in intermittent energy sources preferred by fossil fuel opponents. Alexander didn't define exactly what would, in his view, amount to ""enough"" in such less profitable investments by BP or its industry peers, but he did add that, ""The transition will not wait for them. The gap they have left is already being filled by renewables companies.""

Well, yes. Exactly so. After all, BP, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and all the other major oil companies are exactly that: Oil companies. They have always been oil companies, and the core competencies of their corporate cultures are, probably smartly, focused on maximizing profits from their oil-related core business.

The conceit of this government policy-forced transition and the ESG mentality that drives it has to this point been that these oil companies would simply be able to somehow transform themselves into renewable energy companies in order to remain in business. Often lost in that discussion, though, is the fact that these are all corporations, and corporations exist for one reason: To maximize profits to be returned to their investors.

It is important not to lose sight of the fact that, for management at these corporations, a focus on maximizing profits and returns to investors is not just a goal, but a fiduciary duty under the law.

Auchincloss and his current management team at BP have determined that the best way to fulfill that duty is to increase focus on what has always been the company's core business since its founding as British Petroleum in 1908. The only wonder here is that anyone would be surprised by any of this."
Trump's Tax Plan Will Be Fine,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanlewis/2024/10/08/trumps-tax-plan-will-be-fine/,2024-10-08T14:53:15Z,"The Great Depression got started with the passage of the Smoot Hawley Tariff in the United States, by the Republican Party, which immediately set off a cascade of retaliatory tariffs worldwide. This alone did not cause the Great Depression, but it did cause the initial downturn. This was followed by a long string of bad decisions in reaction to that downturn, such as Republican Herbert Hoover's 1932 tax increase which took the top income tax rate from 25% to 63%.

After World War Two, the whole world came to recognize that the Trade War of 1930 was a major contributor to the Great Depression. At the 1944 meeting in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, they began a long postwar movement toward Free Trade, with a proposal for an International Trade Organization, to go along with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank also established at the same time. The ITO was not passed, but evolved into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which then became the World Trade Organization in 1995.

Conservatives thus have some trepidation when they see a move by presidential candidate Donald Trump, representing the Economic Nationalist wing that includes Patrick Buchanan, move again toward tariffs and restrictions on trade. The reasons for this are well known, and include the corrosive effects on the US's middle class since China entered the WTO in 2001; or arguments that the US, as a continental superpower, needs to retain a large measure of self-sufficiency in key industries including electronics.

Tariffs are taxes; basically, they are a variant of sales taxes. Trump's proposals, mirroring those of Patrick Buchanan, are for a single-rate across-the-board universal tariff of 10% or perhaps later 20%, instead of the troublesome item-by-item and country-by-country approach of the past. This is actually no different than most countries in the world already have, as a component of their value-added-tax -- also of 10%-20% -- which also applies to imports.

Nevertheless, more taxes typically have a negative economic effect. This is offset, in the Trump proposals, with lower taxes on business.

The Corporate Income Tax rate would be lowered to 20% from 21%; possibly to 15% for businesses making their products in the US. This is the right idea, but certainly very small. A reduction in the Corporate Income Tax rate to 15% for everyone would be more effective at boosting the economy, and is not that far from the 19% corporate income tax rate now enjoyed by Britain. When you add Corporate taxes in some States, it would mirror Britain's rate. Forty-four States have their own Corporate taxes; the rate in Alaska, Illinois, Minnesota and New Jersey is nine percent or higher.

Much of the rest of Trump's tax proposals consist of extending his 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act -- which led to a noticeably stronger economy, particularly among the lower income brackets. Some tax technicians think that this would lead to some disastrous decline in revenue, compared to if the tax cuts were allowed to expire; but this assumes that these taxes would, in 2027, produce a much higher revenue/GDP figure than the exact same taxes produced before the reform, in 2016. The Congressional Budget Office thinks that revenue from the Individual Income Tax will reach 9.8% of GDP in 2027, with the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts -- a whopping 18% higher than the 8.3% actually received in 2016, before the TCJA, and a figure that has never been exceeded except for two years (2000 and 2022), when tax revenues were momentarily boosted by capital gains from huge stock market rises the year earlier. Not gonna happen.

My impression is that the smallish reductions in corporate tax rates would not provide much of an advantage, compared to the potential drag from higher tariffs, especially if they are matched with higher tariffs on US goods from other countries worldwide.

The best and easiest way to produce an economic advantage would be to eliminate all capital gains taxes. To this we could eliminate double-taxation of corporate income via dividends, which should be tax-free. An important distortion between debt and equity financing should be ameliorated by making corporate income taxable before interest, known as the ""VAT base."" Along with this, interest income should be untaxed at the personal level.

The main argument against eliminating capital gains taxes might be the categorization of some forms of income as capital gains. This is particularly true of investment funds. Income from fund management should be taxed as regular business income, when it is realized. This mirrors the tax treatment of employee stock options today, which are subject to the regular personal income tax (not capital gains) when they are exercised.

Many of the more successful countries in the world do not tax capital gains. These include Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Belgium, Germany, Malaysia, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Switzerland. It used to include Japan, which did not tax capital gains until 1989.

Trump also introduced the idea of a 60% flat-rate tariff on Chinese imports. Besides potentially providing relief for US workers from international wage competition, this is motivated by geopolitical concerns, with supply lines for key military and other industries compromised by dependence on Chinese and Taiwanese sources. Implementing such a plan would increase the need for more business and growth-friendly tax reductions elsewhere to compensate.

Trump even floated the idea of eliminating the Income Tax altogether, and replacing it with the Tariff as a revenue source. This was actually the regular state of affairs in the United States before the Sixteenth Amendment was passed in 1913. There was no Income Tax.

But, the Federal government was much smaller then. Today, a more realistic idea is to replace the Income Tax with a VAT, which is an indirect tax that resembles both the retail sales tax and various Flat Tax income tax proposals that have been made since the 1980s.

Since the flat-rate tariff is already an inherent part of the VAT found in most countries worldwide, I think Trump is testing the waters for a much more important reform -- eliminating the Federal Income Tax altogether, both Individual and Corporate, including a full repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment, and replacing it with a VAT, with a rate of probably around 15%.

For many decades, we've avoided the VAT because we don't want to have an income tax and VAT together, like high-tax European socialist governments. But, adopting a VAT is the best way to replace the income tax.

This resembles the ""FairTax"" national sales tax proposal popular among conservatives, but would be much better in my view. The VAT is a proven and effective system worldwide, while retail sales tax rates above 10% have been problematic. Replacing the problematic and destructive Income Tax with a VAT is actually the solution offered by President George W. Bush's economic advisor Lawrence Lindsey, in his 2013 book The Growth Experiment Revisited.

In the nineteenth century, the United States had high tariffs, domestic excise taxes (sales taxes), and no income tax. It was the most successful country of that century."
Christina Ricci On Creation Of Her 'Cat Full Of Spiders' Tarot Deck And Guidebook,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2024/10/08/christina-ricci-on-creation-of-her-cat-full-of-spiders-tarot-deck-and-guidebook/,2024-10-08T14:46:01Z,"Christina Ricci's new creative endeavor Cat Full of Spiders Tarot Deck and Guidebook is coming out Tuesday in the early part of the spooky season, but the acclaimed Wednesday and Yellowjackets star said there's a big misconception about what tarot cards and readings are about.

Yes, tarot card readings can indeed be the driving force of movies like the summer horror hit Tarot, and some people may want to associate them with the scary preconceptions that accompany Ouija boards. In truth, however, Ricci said there's really nothing to fear when using a tarot deck.

""I don't really believe in anything mystical -- I think all of the magic that we need in the world takes place right in our brain,"" Ricci told me during a recent phone conversation. ""So what I love about tarot is it's basically a tool to use everything you consciously know about yourself, everything your subconscious knows and everything you've collected in your personal journey up until this moment.

""Those are the things that are used when you have a tarot reading,"" Ricci added. ""You pose a question and then cards are drawn and basically based on whatever theme or idea is brought up by the card, you then come to a conclusion or get an idea based on your own mind, your own experience, your own identity and your own subconscious.""

Basically, Ricci said, tarot card decks are basically ""a tool of self-reflection to predict your future.""

""We can all sort of vaguely predict our futures or solution to something based on our knowledge of ourselves and the choices we will always make for the habits that we have,"" Ricci explained. ""So, I love it because of that, because it really sort of harnesses your self-awareness and self-consciousness to put you more in control of your life and you tell yourself to give yourself more information about yourself.

""That's what I love and that's really what my deck is about,"" Ricci further noted. ""My deck is about the journey of the subconscious and mine specifically as interpreted by our artist and it, it's a very deep dive into a subconscious.""

Available online and in stores, the Cat Full of Spiders Tarot Deck and Guidebook was created by Christina Ricci with tarot expert Minerva Seigel and the cards feature the artwork of illustrator Felipe Flores.

Released by Insight Editions, Cat Full of Spiders Tarot Deck and Guidebook comes in deluxe packaging that includes a 78-card tarot deck and a 128-page guidebook featuring a foreword by Ricci. The guidebook -- which comes complete with card meanings and instructions -- was designed to aid tarot practitioners of all skill levels.

Cat Full of Spiders Tarot Deck and Guidebook is a personal project for Ricci for many reasons, including the fact that her husband, Mark Hampton, is the creative director of the project.

""The original idea was my husband's, to create something that was really personal and came from me that conveyed a lot of messages about how I feel about the world and how I feel about magic and life,"" Ricci recalled. ""We wanted to do that while combining really beautiful artistry and storytelling, and we thought a tarot deck was the best way to do it. We also really loved tarot and wanted to add to the beautiful decks that are out there.""

Ricci's acting career, of course, kicked off long before her most recent shows Yellowjackets and Wednesday. Ricci's film career kicked off in 1990 in Mermaids opposite Cher and Winona Ryder. Since then she's appeared in such notable features as The Addams Family and its sequel Addams Family Values, Casper, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Sleepy Hollow, Monster and The Matrix Resurrections.

Yet for Ricci's vast body of work -- she's amassed more than 90 screen credits since 1990 -- the idea for Cat Full of Spiders Tarot Deck and Guidebook was inspired by who Ricci is as a person and isn't tied to any of her films or television shows.

""It's inspired by the life that I've led as a creative person and as an artist,"" Ricci explained. ""I lived my life at certain times as different characters since I create stories and create whole worlds for myself in my work, but this is really about me as an individual, not me as an actress.""

At the same time, Ricci noted that some of the characters she's played on screen have ultimately been informed by her own life.

""If you see something [in the images on the tarot cards that] looks like it might be a character I want to play, well, it's probably because that's what I look like with dark curls,"" Ricci said. ""So, the two things are so intermixed because I've lived my whole life doing this thing. I do understand the misconception there, but that is one of the reasons that I wanted to do this is because I am more than my work. So, my work is something that has definitely been a good part of my life and comes from my brain.""

For readers wondering where Ricci came up with the title of the tarot deck and guidebook, Ricci offered an explanation of where it originated.

""Cat Full of Spiders is a name that I came up with basically metaphorical, the spiders being all of the experiences and traumas or moments that a person or the cat eats in their lives,"" Ricci said. ""And so, by the end of the journey, the cat or the person is full of the spiders-slash-experienced trauma moments. They'll never forget the idea that all of that is carried with them.""

Christina Ricci's Cat Full Of Spiders Tarot Deck and Guidebook is now available through online retailers and stores."
Broncos Quarterback Bo Nix Earned His Stripes Against The Raiders: What Comes Next?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2024/10/08/broncos-quarterback-bo-nix-earned-his-stripes-against-the-raiders-what-comes-next/,2024-10-08T14:46:00Z,"When the Denver Broncos announced during the preseason that rookie Bo Nix would be their starting quarterback in Week 1, the expectation was that we'd see some major learning curves.

Head coach Sean Payton's decision to name Nix Denver's starter had a lot to do with the experience he gained at Auburn and Oregon in college. Even then, he's a rookie playing within the confines of an offense that lacks tremendous skill-position talent.

Pretty much out of the gate, struggles were the name of the game for Nix. He threw zero touchdowns compared to four interceptions in the Broncos' first two games, both losses. Nix actually didn't toss his first career touchdown until Week 4 against the New York Jets.

Despite this, the Broncos headed into Sunday's home date with the Las Vegas Raiders at 2-2 on the season and looking to get over .500. Boy, did Nix pick the perfect time to have that coming-out performance against Denver's bitter division rival.

The youngster completed 19-of-27 passes for 206 yards with two touchdowns and zero interceptions. He added another score on the ground. It was a mistake-free performance in what ended up being an eye-opening 34-18 win over the Raiders.

Most of the talk after this game surrounded the Raiders and their brutal performance in Mile High. In particular, head coach Antonio Pierce being under fire.

However, one particular scene in the third quarter caught the eye of the Fox broadcast booth. Nix could be seen having a heated exchange with Payton. At that point, there was no telling what the conversation was all about.

This came after a Nix pass to wide receiver Troy Franklin fell incomplete. It appears that there was a mix-up between the play call coming into his head set and the young quarterback.

""It was a single play. We had it flipped. He wanted it to the boundary, and we just kind of got confused there in the huddle. So I tried to get things right. We ended up having it, had a chance and I overthrew it, but that's a part of the game sometimes,"" Nix told reporters after the game. ""With the huddle operation sometimes you just have to make the most of guys, how it is with the play clock moving. You just make the most of it, and fortunately it didn't bite us.""

Denver was up 20-10 at the time. It also led to a punt from the Broncos. Nix ultimately completed his remaining four passes for 54 yards with a touchdown through the air and another on ground after that play.

What exactly does this tell us? The experience factor Payton talked about this past summer relating to Nix is now fully apparent on the field. Nix did not let the heated exchange impact him. In fact, he started to play better football. It's a rarity for a young quarterback in today's NFL.

The Broncos did win five consecutive games at one point last season. But this feels a lot different. Nix's rapid progression under center tells us this story.

Over the course of this three-game winning streak, Nix has accounted for five total touchdowns with zero giveaways. That comes after he tallied a single rushing score with four interceptions in the first two games.

""He played well. He used his feet, went through his progressions, threw the ball well, got it down the field, took the underneath throws. He handled the two-minute [drill] again,"" Payton told reporters after Sunday's win, via the Broncos' official website. ""That's happened a number of times now, where we've been able to get some points at the end of the half. He had good command of what we were doing, and I was pleased.""

One major thing that has stood out over the past few games is Nix's ability to get rid of the ball. He's been sacked all of four times while attempting 113 passes during this span. Sure, Denver's offensive line deserves some of the credit. But it seems like these two aspects are functioning well together.

Denver will ride that three-game winning streak into a Week 6 home date with the division-rival Los Angeles Chargers. It then heads to Payton's old stomping grounds against the Saints in New Orleans to open Week 7 on Thursday Night Football.

We'll certainly learn a lot more about the young quarterback and his team after those two games. Consecutive road dates with the Baltimore Ravens and Kansas City Chiefs to open November adds another layer to this.

What I do know is that this iteration of the Broncos is much different than after a Week 2 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in which I was calling for Nix to be benched. That's not happening any time soon. Sunday's veteran-caliber performance adds another layer to this."
Hurricane Milton Can't Be A 'Category 6' -- But Some Researchers Think It's Time To Create A New Tier For The Strongest Storms,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/10/08/hurricane-milton-cant-be-a-category-6-but-some-researchers-think-its-time-to-create-a-new-tier-for-the-strongest-storms/,2024-10-08T14:45:54Z,"Hurricane Milton -- the Atlantic storm forecast to be ""one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida"" -- has fluctuated between the two most intense hurricane classifications in the runup to its anticipated landfall and sparked debate about introducing a Category 6 distinction as climate change intensifies extreme weather events.

Even if Category 6 storms did exist, Milton would not have been one of them. The storm's top maximum sustained wind speed was 180 degrees as of Monday evening, 12 mph lesser than the 192 needed to upgrade the storm under the researchers' proposal.

5. That's how many storms could have been classified as a Category 6 between 1980 and 2021, meaning they exceeded maximum sustained winds of 192 mph. Of those, only one threatened North America. Hurricane Patricia made landfall in Mexico as a Category 4 hurricane in 2015 and became the strongest storm ever recorded in the western hemisphere with 215 mph winds. The other four storms all occurred in the Western Pacific.

Climate change has not led to a marked difference in the number of hurricanes hitting the United States every year, but it has been blamed for intensifying those that do form. Higher temperatures allow for more intense evaporation, which allows storms traveling across warm oceans to pull in more water vapor and heat, leading to more rainfall and stronger winds. Additionally, sea level rise intensifies storm surge, pushing more water further inland during hurricanes. Even so, Category 5 hurricanes are somewhat rare. Only 42 tropical cyclones have reached Category 5 status since 1924, CBS News reported. Of those, 18 of those have formed since 2003.

Hurricane Milton is moving over Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula Tuesday, before crossing the eastern Gulf of Mexico. It is forecast to hit the west coast of Florida by Wednesday evening. Milton is expected to continue fluctuating in strength for the next day or so while it moves across the Gulf of Mexico and will likely weaken slightly before it hits Florida, but the National Hurricane Center warns ""there is high confidence that Milton will remain an extremely dangerous hurricane when it reaches the state."" Milton is set to hit Florida just two weeks after Hurricane Helene did so before moving on to cause catastrophic flooding across parts of the southeastern U.S. The impacts of Helene moved further inland than expected, devastating western North Carolina and parts of Eastern Tennessee. More than 220 people died from the impacts of Helene, and hundreds more are still missing."
"Biden White House has 'very low' trust in Netanyahu regime, urges transparency: report",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-white-house-warns-very-low-trust-netanyahu-regime-demands-transparency-report,2024-10-08T14:45:33Z,"Israel's air defense systems have been under pressure since Oct. 7 last year as the country fights a multi-front war against Iran and its proxies. (COURTESY: IDF Spokesman's Unit)

The Biden-Harris administration has privately warned of ""very low"" trust in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's regime following several Israeli strikes the U.S. was not warned about, Axios reported Tuesday.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan reportedly told Israeli officials that the U.S. expects ""clarity and transparency"" about Israel's plans, specifically regarding any retaliation against Iran for last week's missile attack.

""Our trust of the Israelis is very low right now and for a good reason,"" one U.S. official told the outlet.

The report comes after weeks of the Biden-Harris administration growing more and more willing to criticize Netanyahu's regime. They have repeatedly stated that they support Israel's right to defend itself, however.

Vice President Kamala Harris wouldn't say whether she thought the administration had influence over Netanyahu in an interview this week.

CBS' Bill Whitaker asked Harris about why Netanyahu seemed to be ""charting his own course,"" despite the billions of dollars of military aid the U.S. has provided to Israel. ""Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?"" he asked.

""Now the work we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire. And we're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders,"" Harris responded.

One Stock Most Likely To Beat 3Q24 Estimates,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/08/one-stock-most-likely-to-beat-3q24-estimates/,2024-10-08T14:41:10Z,"Without proprietary footnotes data, other analysts are flying blind. They are forced to estimate earnings without the critical gains and charges that companies hide in their footnotes so they can manipulate their earnings.

Every quarter, my team combs through thousands of footnotes to help find the one stock I think is most likely to beat the Street. I think this stock will beat because their Street Earnings are artificially depressed by non-operating expenses that I remove when I calculate Core Earnings.

You probably won't be surprised to learn that Street Earnings overstate profits for the majority of S&P 500 companies. There are far fewer S&P 500 companies whose Street Earnings are lower than their Core Earnings.

Today, I'm featuring the first of my two earnings season preview reports. This report shows:

My firm's Robo-Analyst allows me to compare Core Earnings across the entire market.

Street EPS Are Lower Than Core EPS for 121 S&P 500 Companies

For 121 companies in the S&P 500, or 24%, Street Earnings are lower than Core Earnings in the trailing-twelve-months (TTM) ended 2Q24. In the TTM ended 1Q24, Street Earnings were understated for 122 companies.

The percentage of the S&P 500 where Street Earnings understate Core Earnings by more than 10% equals 9% (43 companies) in 2Q24, which is up from 41 companies in the TTM ended 1Q24.

Those 43 companies make up 8% of the market cap of the S&P 500 as of 9/23/24, which is up from 6% of the market cap in 1Q24, measured with TTM data in each quarter. See Figure 1.

Figure 1: Understated Street Earnings by >10% as % of Market Cap: 2012 through 9/23/24

The 121 companies with understated (by any amount) Street Earnings represent 33% of the market cap of the S&P 500 as of 9/23/24, which is up from 29% in the TTM ended 1Q24. See Figure 2.

Note that this analysis is based on my team analyzing the financial statements and footnotes for ~3,000 10-Ks and 10-Qs filed with the SEC after earnings season. I estimate that the cost of this work for most firms would be over $2 million each quarter.

When Street Earnings are lower than Core Earnings, they are understated by an average of 24%, per Figure 3.

S&P 500 Company Most Likely to Beat Calendar 3Q24 Earnings

Figure 4 shows the S&P 500 company with a Strong Beat Earnings Distortion Score likely to beat calendar 3Q24 earnings because their Street EPS estimates are understated. Because investors and analysts tend to anchor their earnings projections to historical results, errors in historical Street EPS lead to errors in Street EPS estimates.

A jellyfish with a superpower - it can fuse with another and become one,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5144689/comb-jelly-superpower-absorb-become-one,2024-10-08T14:39:04Z,"A little more than a year ago, while biologist Kei Jokura was in Woods Hole, Mass., he routinely walked down to the water, scanning for comb jellies.

""They look like a jellyfish,"" he says, ""but they're completely different."" It's a blob the size of a silver dollar with little hairs that ripple along the edges of its mostly see-through body. Jokura says it's possible that the first nervous system to ever evolve on Earth was inside an ancient comb jelly -- a distant ancestor of the ones he was scooping out of the water.

He likens the search to a thrilling kind of treasure hunt. ""You can definitely miss it,"" he says, but his trick is to look for sunlight reflecting off of their bodies.

Jokura took the comb jellies he found back to the lab in Woods Hole and put them in a tank. One day, he went to check on them and a particular comb jelly caught his eye -- one that led to a paper just published in the journal Current Biology.

""I was surprised because a weird shape was there,"" he recalls. It was fatter. It had two heads, two mouths, and two anuses. Jokura thought to himself: ""Oh, I think these are two individuals fused together.""

He took off at a sprint, fat comb jelly in a beaker, to show his labmates. ""I was like, 'What? That's weird,"" says neurobiologist Mariana Rodriguez-Santiago of Colorado State University. ""And so I went to see it and I was like, 'Oh, it is fused. Oh, and it's moving together.'""

This was a striking observation -- if this being was once two individuals, it was now behaving as one.

The next thing Rodriguez-Santiago did was to poke it. ""I poked it mostly to see if they would get unstuck,"" she says. ""But instead, the muscle contracted at the same time."" This suggested that it had a shared nervous system.

The researchers went about trying to see if this little translucent fatty was an anomaly or whether they could recreate it. ""So we did some Frankenstein pilot experiments,"" says Rodriguez-Santiago.

They sliced comb jellies in different spots, and when they snipped them along their edges and placed them near one another, within an hour or two, they fused nine out of ten times.

In addition, the team fed the fused jellies brine shrimp with fluorescent dye so they could keep track of the food particles. ""One comb jelly ate it and it traveled through the gut of both of them and the second comb jelly pooped it out,"" says Rodriguez-Santiago.

""I thought this was a really fun paper to read,"" says Allison Edgar, an integrative biologist at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who wasn't involved in the research. She says comb jelly fusion has been observed before, but this is the first time that scientists have documented the individuals behaving as one.

Edgar is excited by what this discovery might mean for humans. ""If comb jellies do have this great mechanism for regenerating and healing,"" she says, ""that would mean you could have an organ transplant with no consequences and you would heal from it very quickly.""

She says given how rapidly the two comb jellies' nervous systems became one, it could teach humans how to allow someone to regain full control over a transplanted limb, say. But she admits that kind of advance is a ways off.

In other words, comb jellies may be transparent -- but they hold secrets that are still very much opaque."
Richemont Lends A Helping Hand For  Mytheresa To Acquire Yoox Net-A-Porter,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2024/10/08/richemont-lends-a-helping-hand-for--mytheresa-to-acquire-yoox-net-a-porter/,2024-10-08T14:35:42Z,"Mytheresa just struck a deal to acquire Yoox Net-A-Porter (YNAP) from luxury powerhouse Richemont, owner of Cartier, Piaget, Chloé, Montblanc and more.

Mytheresa has favorable winds at its back, having overcome the recent downturn in the luxury market by growing annual revenues 10% in fiscal year 2024, including a 14% uptick in the second half of the year.

Richemont is a highly motivated seller since Mytheresa will pay no cash in the deal. Instead, Mytheresa will issue Richemont 33% of Mytheresa's fully diluted share capital and a board seat while taking on YNAP's existing $604 million (€555 million) cash balances and no financial debt. Plus Mytheresa will inherit a six-year $110 million (€100 million) revolving credit facility to support YNAP's corporate needs.

Other terms of the agreement include Richemont's holdings in Mytheresa will be subject to a one-year lockup following closing, expected in the first quarter 2025. And Richemont expects to write off approximately $1.4 billion (€1.3 billion) in YNAP net assets upon closure of the deal, pending regulatory approval.

Fortunately, Germany-based Mytheresa and Richemont in Switzerland are subject to European regulatory oversight, not the Federal Trade Commission, which is challenging the Tapestry acquisition of Capri Holdings in the luxury market.

Moving over to Mytheresa will be YNAP brands Net-A-Porter and Mr Porter and its off-price Yoox and Outnet platforms. Each brand will maintain separate online storefronts, while backend operations will be combined.

Mytheresa CEO Michael Kliger said in a statement:

""With this transaction, Mytheresa aims to create a pre-eminent, multi-brand, digital, luxury group worldwide. Mytheresa, Net-A-Porter and Mr Porter will offer differentiated but complementary multi-brand luxury edits based on curation, inspiration and outmost customer service.

""The three brands will share a large part of their infrastructure creating synergies and efficiencies while maintaining their different brand identities.

""The off-price business will benefit from the separation from luxury and a much simpler operating model driving growth and profitability.""

It's a win-win for both companies. Richemont has been losing money on YNAP for years after acquiring it in 2018.

YNAP revenues were down 14% last year from $2.8 billion (€2.5 billion) in 2023 to $2.4 billion (€2.2 billion) in 2024 under ""discontinued operations."" It also wrote down $1.4 billion (€$1.3 billion) in YNAP net assets last year. It's plans to sell YNAP to online multi-brand competitor Farfetch tanked last December.

Mytheresa will instantly more than double in size, adding some $2.3 billion in YNAP's gross merchandise value - €1.2 billion from Net-A-Porter and Mr Porter and €.9 from off-price Yoox and Outnet - to its current $1 billion (€914 million). The average order value (AOV) for Net-A-Porter is about $735, just shy of Mytheresa's $775. Yoox and Outnet's AOV is around $250.

Mytheresa will also gain 1.4 million Net-A-Porter and Mr Porter luxury customers, along with some 2.2 million Yoox and Outnet customers, described as ""aspirational"" luxury consumers. That will more than triple Mytheresa's reach across demographics as it currently reports some 900,000 ""ultra-high-net worth customers.""

In an investor research note, TD Cowen sees the companies' customer files as complementary rather than overlapping which will give it access to an expanded market.

They'll need it since Similarweb's online tracking data finds direct-competitor Farfetch's annual traffic is nearly double that of Mytheresa's and Net-A-Porter' combined as of June - 23.9 million compared with 6.9 million for Mytheresa and 6.4 million for Net-A-Porter.

The combined companies also complement each other in geographic reach. About 45% of YNAP revenue is generated in North America, while Mytheresa derives about 55% of revenues in Europe. The U.S. makes up 25% of Mytheresa sales.

In a conference call explaining how the integration of YNAP will unfold, Kliger stressed that each brand will have clearly defined and differentiated identities but will run on a shared technology stack for greater operational efficiencies and customer data analytics.

At the luxury end, Mytheresa, Net-A-Porter and Mr Porter will operate three distinct storefronts.

""This will allow us to cover the market with differentiated positioning, including differentiated brand portfolios, customer and geographic focus. This makes for a strong, valuable position towards luxury brands based on depth and breadth of customer reach,"" Kliger shared.

Mytheresa already has strong, sustained relationships with some of the biggest names in luxury, numbering some 200 brands. And with the addition of Net-A-Porter's brands and with Richemont's backing, it should elevate its stature as a partner further. In the luxury market, status matters and Mytheresa just got a whole lot more.

Integrating the off-price side of the YNAP business will be more problematic. Yoox and Outnet have been particularly challenging for Richemont. Net-A-Porter has delivered low-single-digit adjusted EBITDA margin for Richemont, but the off-price business has been unprofitable.

Mytheresa intends to simplify and streamline the off-price operating model, but Cowen notes Mytheresa's experience is in full-price luxury not off-price. ""It may take time to ramp the outlet businesses,"" it observed.

Bain and Company predicts that the digital personal luxury market will more than double in size from 2023 to 2030, growing from around $80 billion in 2023 to $200 billion in 2030. Mytheresa plans to make the most of that growth.

""We are still a very small player. We want to be the leading global player. And the market opportunity is extremely significant. We believe there is even more growth opportunity if we approach the market with different storefronts.""

As for Richemont, it is surely relieved to be unburdened from YNAP, which never fit well into its luxury business model.

""We are pleased to have found such a good home for YNAP. Mytheresa is ideally placed to build on YNAP's assets to further delight customers and brand partners alike across the world by harnessing both companies' respective strengths."" Johann Rupert, chairman of Richemont, said in a statement.

TD Cowen shares the positive view of the growth prospects for Mytheresa but is more restrained about how quickly Mytheresa can fully execute the integration. In particular, it is cautious about folding in the off-price side of the YNAP business.

""The success of the deal will largely depend on how quickly and seamlessly MYTE can integrate YNAP's IT stack and nine distribution centers globally across the combined platform. Yoox had tried to create a proprietary IT platform, but its more complicated warehouse network combined with its much lower AOV business resulted in poor execution,"" Cowen wrote.

But then, we all know strategy is the easy part. Execution is where Mytheresa will be tried and tested."
Can New York City Stay Fashionable?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mauriceobeid/2024/10/08/can-new-york-city-stay-fashionable/,2024-10-08T14:35:41Z,"Maintaining the city's global place as a fashion capital

--

New York's Fashion District was created in 1919, and the city has been a fashion mecca since at least the 1940s, attracting designers, brands, manufacturers, retailers, the media, investors, and shoppers from around the world. The industry -- fashion retail, wholesale and distribution, along with textile, apparel, footwear and jewelry manufacturing -- contributed more than $50 billion in direct sales and $45 billion in indirect sales in the city in 2022, employing more than 130,000 people.

The world is changing, however, along with the fashion business. The total market value of the goods and services it produces in the metropolitan region has been declining for a decade. It has yet to recover from a sharp decline in the pandemic, and it now employs 50,000 fewer people than it did in 2014.

Powerful trends are to blame. The costs of living and doing business in the city continue to rise, for example, spurring more fashion students, designers, manufacturers, and retailers to consider less expensive locations. Other trends will continue to put pressure on the industry:

· Social media allows a new breed of influencers to ""work from anywhere"" -- they don't need to report from Soho or Madison Avenue.

· New designers have fewer opportunities to connect with shoppers as famed local specialty stores, such as Barneys New York, disappear, and some brands shrink their brick-and-mortar presence in favor of ecommerce.

· And like many other big businesses, fashion is consolidating. European conglomerates, especially in luxury, are making it harder for independent brands to compete.

It's a vicious circle: some brands are now shifting from New York Fashion Week to events overseas to reach more international buyers and press. But the city can still harness its unique advantages and reclaim its mojo to keep pace with other fashion capitals around the world.

We explain these in our new report, ""At a crossroads: New York's status as a global fashion capital,"" by McKinsey, in collaboration with the Partnership of New York City. [1]

New York isn't just a big city. It is a global center of finance and high technology, both of which can help the fashion industry thrive. It is far more culturally and ethnically diverse than any other metropolis -- 5.6 million residents were born outside the United States, and more than 800 languages are spoken in the city's five boroughs. [2]. The city is so diverse because it's exceptionally welcoming: anyone can become a New Yorker by putting down roots here. The same cannot be said about Paris, Milan or Tokyo.

So, what can be done to maintain the city's global place as a fashion capital? Some ideas:

§ Helping designers get started: New designers need space, which is increasingly expensive in the city. The industry could create a ""designer campus"" where they could work in subsidized workspaces, share resources and get mentorship. Paris has done just that with Station F, the world's largest startup campus. It offers a range of services, workshops, and apartments for entrepreneurs.

§ Helping emerging brands grow and connect with shoppers: Most new designers struggle to secure long-term funding and visibility. An accelerator could connect them with mentors and investors who understand the intricacies of the fashion business; storefronts in prime locations could allow them to reach more consumers. London's 12 Piccadilly Arcade is one example. The ""pop-up boutique"" in a central shopping district offers shopper a range of new and independent brands.

§ Building workforce capabilities and diversity: Industries of all kinds flourish when schools and employers partner to support diversity and help students master job-related skills. In New York, fashion schools could collaborate with companies to help students become fluent in realms beyond design, from AI to sustainability. Continued investment in diversity, equity and inclusion could help underrepresented talent enter and rise through the ranks, creating a workforce with fresh ideas who can connect with broader audiences.

§ Revitalizing industry demand for New York fashion: New York Fashion Week could evolve to host a wider array of events and programming. It could take a page from other fashion weeks, such as in Paris and Copenhagen, and engage the whole city, or conferences like South by Southwest in Austin that converge talent in tech, film, music, and other adjacent industries.

The fashion industry relies on so many players that no single institution can independently put the industry on a new path. Hence our call for local government, industry veterans, brands, retailers, schools, and real estate owners to share ideas and take collective action - whether it be supporting new talent or launching new brands.

Fashion itself is about spotting and understanding trends -- and then shaping those trends rather than simply reacting to them. The industry's most creative, visionary leaders can build on New York's decades-long legacy as a global fashion capital.

So You Want To Run A Wine Tasting? Don't Fuss Too Much,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnmariani/2024/10/08/so-you-want-to-run-a-wine-tasting-dont-fuss-too-much/,2024-10-08T14:35:32Z,"Once the very idea of holding a wine tasting at one's home was considered a pretentious way of ruining a convivial party. Now such tastings are considerably less high-minded, and, if conducted with conviviality in mind, a way of getting together without the preparation and expense of a full dinner party. And no one's likely to throw his poker cards against the wall upon losing ten straight hands.

The idea of simply assembling a bunch of wines to taste without any focus can, however, become a dead end. Inviting friends who have an avid interest in wine is not paramount, but asking those with only a moderate taste for wine can become the most pleasant form of self-education.

So, here are a few guidelines to holding a wine tasting for people who have a general knowledge and interest in wine rather than those who consider discussion of Ph levels and vine trellising fit conversation at a party.

The first rule of thumb is not to serve too many wines -- six is an ideal amount. Fewer makes no sense; much more becomes a slog.

Next, decide if you've going to taste the wines blind, that is, without revealing their names. This is not to fool or embarrass anyone but to be able to judge the wines without bias of known labels. If so, cover the bottles with a paper bag to hide the labels and the shape of the bottle because some varietals, like Pinot Noir and Riesling, are always sold in specifically shaped bottles. Then number the bags and reveal the labels only after all are tasted.

You might feature wines from a particular region, like Tuscany or New Zealand, Napa Valley or Sicily. Or by varietal grape, like Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache or Chardonnay.

A vertical tasting is one in which you taste the exact same wine from the same producer but in different vintages, which is probably not a good idea for the idle, uninformed imbiber.

A horizontal tasting is when you taste wines from the same vintage or the same grape varietal but from different producers.

As to glassware, connoisseurs stick with a single shape, even though restaurants may serve different varietals in different shapes, according to the kind of wine, like Alsatian wines in green-stemmed glassware. The glass should be thin, in which a four-ounce pour fills about half the glass. This allows for swirling and sniffing the aroma of the wine, itself a point of discussion. Needless to say, a tasting is not the same as drinking five half-glasses over dinner. By the way, you can buy perfectly good, thin wineglasses for under five dollars at big stores like Costco.

You should have plain water and crackers or bread available to restore your palate wine after tasting the wine. Salted butter on the cracker is also an excellent way to intensify the flavors of the wine, because fat carries flavor.

If you are serving the wines with dinner, keep the food simple so that the wine remains the focus: simply grilled red meat with big reds, cheeses or seafood with whites, and vice-versa.

As host, you should try to stir discussion, perhaps with a toast, like Lord Byron's, ""Let us have wine and women, mirth and laughter,/ Sermons and soda-water the day after.""

Last, someone has to pay for the wines, and friends may want to defray those expenses. Remember that one bottle will allow, say, six friends to have a tasting sample, so six bottles will certainly suffice."
North Korea's Kim Jong Un pushes goal to become nuclear powerhouse in warning to South Korea,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-pushes-goal-become-nuclear-powerhouse-warning-south-korea,2024-10-08T14:32:57Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

North Korea's Kim Jong Un went after South Korea's president for the second time in a week, warning again on Tuesday that Pyongyang will push forward with its plans to be a top nuclear player.

Kim accused South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol of issuing ""some tasteless and vulgar comment about the end of the Republic"" in a recent speech and said it shows ""he is totally consumed by his blind faith in his master's strength,"" he added, according to a Reuters report, in reference to Seoul's partnership with Washington.

""To be honest, we have absolutely no intention of attacking South Korea,"" Kim said during a speech at a military school named after him, the Kim Jong Un National Defense University.

US 'SLEEPWALKING' INTO WWIII, EXPERTS WARN NATION IS UNDERPREPARED: 'WE DO NOT HAVE OUR CHURCHILL'

Kim's comments came after South Korea's president condemned Pyongyang's recent reveal of a new nuclear facility last month and in turn, during its Armed Forces Day last week, displayed a new Hyunmoo-5 ballistic missile, which, according to a Newsweek report, is capable of destroying underground facilities in North Korea.

Yoon has repeatedly pushed for a denuclearized North Korea as regional tensions continue to escalate.

But Kim, who has long looked to expand North Korea's nuclear capabilities, objected to the calls to denuclearize and said, ""Every time I stated our position on the use of military force, I clearly and consistently used the qualification 'if.'""

""If the enemies try to use force against our country, the republic's military will use all offensive power without hesitation,"" he added. ""This does not preclude the use of nuclear weapons.""

""Our footsteps toward becoming a military superpower and a nuclear power will accelerate,"" Kim added.

The comments were the second time in a week that Kim directed an ominous message at his southern neighbor after he warned earlier this month that North Korea will respond with nuclear force if its sovereignty is threatened.

According to state run news agency KNCA last week, Kim ""affirmed that 'if' the enemy, seized with extreme foolishness and recklessness, attempt to use armed forces encroaching upon the sovereignty of the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea]... the DPRK would use without hesitation all the offensive forces it has possessed, including nuclear weapons,"" Reuters reported."

Dodgers' Dave Roberts says it's 'unsettling' Manny Machado seemed to throw ball at him,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/dodgers-dave-roberts-says-its-unsettling-manny-machado-seemed-throw-ball-him,2024-10-08T14:32:25Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said it was ""bothersome"" and ""unsettling"" that a ball San Diego third baseman Manny Machado threw into the Dodgers dugout seemed intended for him during the Padres' 10-2 win in Game 2 of their NL Division Series, when tempers flared on the field and in the stands at Dodger Stadium.

It was one of several incidents Sunday night that prompted Dodgers starter Jack Flaherty and Machado to exchange profanities as the Padres evened the series with Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers at 1-1 by hitting six home runs. Two of them were by Fernando Tatis Jr., who was hit by a pitch by Flaherty, which also angered Machado. Flaherty also hollered at Machado after striking him out with two runners on in the sixth.

Roberts said he didn't notice Machado's throw in real time but later saw a video of the incident. ""It was unsettling. ... And the ball was directed at me with something behind it.""

Roberts said the ball didn't hit him because of netting.

""That was very bothersome. If it was intended at me, I would be very -- it's pretty disrespectful,"" Roberts said Monday before the Dodgers had an early evening workout at Petco Park, where the series will resume in front of a sellout crowd Tuesday night.

Third base umpire Tripp Gibson spoke with Machado but Roberts said: ""I don't think they should have had a little arm-around-each-other conversation. If players can throw balls at opposing managers, you know.""

Game 2 was delayed for 12 minutes after rowdy fans tossed baseballs in the direction of San Diego left fielder Jurickson Profar, and then trash onto the outfield. Profar had robbed Mookie Betts of a home run in the first inning, reaching into the stands behind the low left-field wall. He trolled the fans by staring at them and then hopping up and down several times before throwing the ball to the infield.

Flaherty said Sunday night that Machado ""did some s--- in between innings. He threw a ball at our dugout. There was no reason for that.""

Asked about Flaherty's accusation, Machado said, ""I throw balls all the time into dugouts. Both dugouts. They have bad balls, you throw the ball back in there.""

Roberts spoke Monday about an hour after Machado met briefly with reporters.

Flaherty said he wished he had ""held it together a little bit better.""

""It's the playoffs, man. There's a lot of emotion,"" Flaherty said. ""I think it got out of hand yesterday with everybody from me and him to the fans getting involved. There's emotion after the punchout, there's emotion after every home run. I wasn't trying to direct any of that toward him. I understand them taking offense to Tatis getting hit. We would react the same way if any of our guys got hit.""

""After that happens and he throws a ball, I wish he would have just let it go,"" Flaherty added. ""The umpires did their job. They stepped in and talked to him. That's not how I want things to go. We want to keep things on the field and focus on the game.""

Flaherty, who grew up in the Los Angeles area, was obtained from Detroit on July 30.

""I'm not trying to be that player that's going back and forth with somebody in the dugout,"" Flaherty said. ""I was done. Things were said, it's hard to hear. We've got to do a better job of getting things done on the field.""

Freeman had discomfort in his sprained right ankle. He was replaced at first base by Max Muncy, and Kiké Hernández entered at third.

Freeman struck out and flied out in his two at-bats. In Game 1 on Saturday, he had two hits and a strikeout.

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Freeman was ""still sore"" on Monday, when the Dodgers held an off-day workout at Petco Park. ""He's getting treatment. Don't know anything else. Outside of that I think he's very grateful for a mental break today.""

""The thought is he's going to play tomorrow. If he can't, then he won't,"" Roberts said. ""But again, if he's able to play and post, he'll be in there.""

The 35-year-old Freeman, an eight-time All-Star, said it's the first time he's sprained an ankle. He said he was told the injury typically results in four to six weeks on the injured list.

The slugger wields a powerful bat as the No. 3 hitter behind leadoff batter Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts while playing valuable defense at first.

Freeman missed 15 games during the regular season because of injuries and his young son's medical crisis.

Chiefs WR Rashee Rice likely out for the season with LCL injury,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-wr-rashee-rice-likely-out-season-lcl-injury,2024-10-08T14:31:25Z,"Kansas City Chiefs standout wide receiver Rashee Rice is expected to be out for the remainder of the season after more tests Monday revealed he injured his lateral collateral ligament.

The diagnosis was Rice needs his LCL repaired, contrary to previous reports that he tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). That could put his recovery time at 3-4 months, essentially ending his season.

Rice is expected to have surgery Tuesday, according to NFL Insider Ian Rapoport.

The Chiefs initially put Rice on injured reserve last week after he suffered a knee injury in Kansas City's 17-10 victory over the Chargers on Sept. 29.

The Chiefs' leading wide receiver hurt his knee when quarterback Patrick Mahomes collided with him trying to make a tackle after an interception.

No official diagnosis was given by the team, as head coach Andy Reid said that the medical staff was waiting for the swelling to subside before they did another round of imaging this week to get a fuller picture of the damage.

While the team still has not released an official statement regarding Rice's status, Rapoport stated his ""long-term outlook is said to be positive.""

Rice is the latest playmaker for the Chiefs who has suffered a major injury. Fellow receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown is also out for the regular season, while running back Isiah Pacheco is sidelined until November. If Kansas City decides to deal for another receiver, it has until the trade deadline on Nov. 5."
Susana Grau Batlle Creates Artistic Jewels With Deep Meanings,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonydemarco/2024/10/08/susana-grau-batlle-creates-artistic-jewels-with-deep-meanings/,2024-10-08T14:29:17Z,"I occasionally feature new jewelry designers or artists that show promise and Susana Grau Batlle fits the bill nicely.

Batlle, a Barcelona native, has spent years working in some of the world's most challenging environments, including Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, Congo, Nigeria and several countries in South America and the Caribbean. She has been at forefront of providing aid and intelligence for places ravaged by war and other humanitarian crises. Her travels also offered her a tapestry of culturally rich experiences that she has channeled into a creative outlet for jewelry art.

""The art of jewelry became a natural extension of my creative journey, a form of expression that was born during my childhood and blossomed during times of high stress,"" she said. ""During chaos, beauty and creativity could often bring me peace, offering a space where creations could emerge and restore balance to the intensity around me.""

She specializes in producing capsule collections using minerals and gems, some of which are not known for high jewelry applications, in creative ways. The pieces are crafted in Paris workshops. Her first collection, titled ""Mother of Mothers,"" featured five rings centered with, chrysocolla, a blue-green mineral that derives its color from copper. The organic material is then sprinkled with colored gems and set in platinum.

Her second collection, titled ""Trilogy of Evolution,"" features a full collection of jewels with a variety of gemstones, including Peruvian pink opals, Paraiba tourmalines, ammolites, quartz, Moroccan agates and tsavorites. She says this collection through the materials and in the design has greater breadth.

""While my debut collection, 'The Mother of Mothers,' celebrated feminine creation and energy. A 'Trilogy of Evolution' is more expansive, exploring broader themes of transformation through form, time and light,"" she said. ""This new collection delves deeper into spiritual and philosophical concepts, reflecting a more mature and complex understanding of evolution as well as my own growth within the craft of jewelry.""

She adds, ""I chose diamonds because they have a kind of ethereal sparkle, untreated Paraiba tourmalines because they're so special in their raw state, polished Paraiba because they are so vibrant, and orange and blue sapphires for the elemental energy they bring. Each gem, in its own way, weaves a narrative of evolution and grace within this collection.""

She uses these gems in creative ways. For example, an oval shaped white gold and platinum ring is centered with a 19.05-carat Brazilian Paraiba rough on a quartz matrix surrounded by a mix of Paraiba and diamonds. The ring was featured in a book titled, ""Paraiba, The legacy of a Color,"" by Kevin Ferreira and Katerina Perez.

Then there's a blue titanium cuff, in textured pattern wrapped by a string of yellow gold. Two open ends are fitted with ammolites and citrines. Several of the pieces use Peruvian pink opals and pink agate, including a pendant in the shape of a lotus flower that uses each in a pear-shaped setting further highlighted by a paving of pink sapphires set in titanium and 18k yellow gold.

She says her attraction to gemstones and minerals is because of both their spiritual and physical properties. There's also a community of miners and dealers that bring the stories of these gems to life.

""Gemstones fascinate me because of their natural beauty, rarity, and the stories they tell,"" she says. ""Ammolite, with its iridescent colors and ancient origins, is symbolic of transformation through time in so many ways -- like how each moment of pressure, of heat, of circumstance, transforms us -- transforms everything. Paraiba itself is super vivid, electric blue and so rare. For me, it represents the purity, brilliance and potential of the soul's journey in this collection. Both stones align perfectly with the themes of transformation present in my work.""

While adhering to industry standards when it comes to sustainability, she has her own definition of what it entails.

""I see the word 'sustainability' as meaning not just environment or labor issues but ethics more broadly,"" she says. ""It's about acting in a way that's responsible in terms of what you are engaging with - so, minimizing negative impacts (environmental and social) and trying to maximize the benefits. In this sector sourcing is central to that.""

Each collection also serves to communicate her ideas of the physical and spiritual.

""Through each piece, I've tried to capture the harmony between resilience, strength, beauty and transformation, weaving together the unseen forces that shape our lives and the world around us."""
"Gold ETFs Rise By 18 Tonnes In September, Says World Gold Council",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/roystonwild/2024/10/08/gold-etfs-rise-by-18-tonnes-in-september-says-world-gold-council/,2024-10-08T14:29:11Z,"Gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded further net inflows in September, according to the World Gold Council (WGC).

This fresh uplift was thanks to accelerating bullion demand in North America, and meant that funds have enjoyed five straight months of net inflows.

Global ETFs added 18 tonnes of the expensive metal last month, the WGC said, taking total holdings to 3,200 tonnes.

Cumulative inflows were worth $1.4 billion, the council said. This -- combined with a surging gold price -- propelled total assets under administration (AUMs) to $271 billion, a fresh all-time high.

Gold continues to surge as concerns over military action in the Middle East grow and investors prepare for interest rate cuts. The precious metal rose to new record peaks around $2,685 per ounce on September 26.

In North America, ETFs recorded their third successive net monthly inflow. Total holdings rose by 16 tonnes month on month, to 1,624 tonnes.

Fresh inflows were worth around $1.4 billion, which in turn lifted regional AUMs to $137 billion.

The WGC said that ""lower opportunity costs, related to interest rates and the dollar, boosted investor interest in gold ETFs."" It noted that ""the US Fed surprised investors with a cut of 50 basis points at their September gathering, pushing Treasury yields and the dollar down during the month.""

Asia-located funds also enjoyed another monthly net inflow in September to take the streak to 20 months.

ETFs added two tonnes of material, nudging aggregate holdings to 186 tonnes. AUMs rose to $16 billion, a $175 million month-on-month increase.

The WGC said that ""India again saw strong inflows,"" helped in part by strong gold price momentum and elevated geopolitical concerns.

However, ETFs in Europe recorded net outflows last month, the council noted. This was due predominantly to liquidation in the UK as hopes of Bank of England interest cuts receded.

The WGC commented that ""compared to the US Fed's easing efforts, the Bank of England (BoE) was more reserved, leaving rates unchanged at 5% at their September meeting, citing the upside risk of inflation from elevated wage growth.""

European funds lost two tonnes of material, which were worth a total of $245 million. As a consequence, total holdings and AUMs dropped to 1,325 tonnes and $112 billion respectively."
Inflation Reduction Act 2 Years Later: Building Clean Electricity Faster Than Ever,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/10/08/inflation-reduction-act-2-years-later-building-clean-electricity-faster-than-ever/,2024-10-08T14:27:54Z,"In August 2022, when the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, it became the most significant investment in climate that the United States has ever made, making long-term, transformational investments in clean energy deployment, manufacturing, electric vehicles and buildings, and targeted investments to support communities disproportionately impacted by our energy system.

America's electricity sector is the IRA's cornerstone, making up 30-44% of the bill's expected economy-wide emissions reductions. Now, two years after the IRA's passage, signs of progress are emerging.

Before the IRA passed, clean electricity incentives were caught in a cycle of short-term extensions and expirations, creating enormous clean energy industry uncertainty. The IRA invested in the clean energy industry's long-term economic health by creating a decade's worth of certainty for electricity providers, developers, and investors solidifying that clean energy was the better deal for electricity consumers, shareholders, and the planet.

The IRA owes its name to the era of rising prices in which it passed. Global fossil fuel price volatility and supply chain constraints were driving up inflation and interest rates. With clean energy costs largely coming as upfront capital expenditures, the industry was in a period of moderating growth when the bill passed.

Key policies included extension and expansion of clean electricity tax credits, providing up to 60% off the cost of clean energy for ten years, the creation of manufacturing tax credits that bring clean energy manufacturing to the U.S., and billions of dollars to grant and loan programs to make sure upfront funding is there for projects that will save money in the long-term.

The effect of the IRA has only just begun to show up in clean energy deployment. While the first half of 2023 was still relatively slow on installs of solar, wind, and energy storage, 2023 ended with a new record of over 35 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity added, and the first half of 2024 saw a 91% increase over installs in the first half of 2023 at 19 GW. Not only were installations in the higher than 2023, but they were 10 GW higher than average of the previous five years. The U.S. Energy Information Agency expects a total of 59 GW of wind, solar and energy storage to come online in 2024. The growth in renewable energy installations is only expected to rise, with planned projects reported to the EIA overwhelmingly comprised of wind, solar, and batteries in coming years.

Since 2021, utility plans have also become increasingly bullish on adding new clean energy. An RMI analysis of 121 utilities representing 48% of U.S. electricity demand showed utilities are now planning to add 34% more wind and solar than they were as of August 2022. Unfortunately, plans to add gas have also increased, as utilities respond to rising electricity demand while they work to modernize their planning assumptions. Utilities don't need to rush to gas, however, as good planning and procurement practices can help utilities meet growing demand with cleaner and cheaper resources.

The IRA extended support for clean electricity across the whole sector, but publicly owned and non-profit electricity providers saw some of the most significant changes. First, tax credits that were previously inaccessible due to lack of tax liability were converted to direct pay, so non-profit entities could take direct advantage.

Rural electric cooperatives in particular are set to receive significant direct funding. Rural electric cooperatives provide electricity to 42 million people across 56% of the nation's landmass. They serve a disproportionately low-income segment of the population, but lag behind the rest of the nation in moving away from coal power, with 30% of their electricity coming from coal in 2022 compared to 19% nationwide. However, the IRA breathed new life into these non-profit utilities, setting aside $9.7 billion in funds to help cooperatives reduce emissions and install clean energy projects.

The first round of funding announcements into this program were made in September, with $7.3 billion awarded to 16 utilities across 23 states, leveraging an additional $29 billion in private investment. These funds are expected to support 10 GW of new clean energy projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from rural electric cooperatives by 43.6 million tons each year, or about 30% of cooperatives current annual emissions. Projects are also expected to reduce electricity rates substantially compared to a continued reliance on fossil energy, according to several of the awardees.

The IRA didn't stop at driving new clean energy investment - it sought to create a positive feedback loop between the clean energy transition and the health of American manufacturing via a new set of tax credits that can be earned by producing components that go into clean energy projects.

Since the bill's passage, manufacturing facility announcements rolled in, with over $112 billion in investment slated for batteries, electric vehicles, solar, and wind. Batteries are by far the largest share of investment at 68%, shared between batteries for the electric grid and for electric vehicles which utilize slightly different chemistries. However, solar manufacturing boasts no small stake with $14 billion in announcements, which will continue to abate supply chain delays that have lingered after the pandemic.

The power of the IRA does not lie in its direct investment alone. The bill's clean energy provisions also enabled state action with four states implementing 100% clean energy targets for the first time in 2023. Minnesota and Michigan passed legislation requiring 100% of electricity sales to come from clean sources by 2040, while the New Jersey governor signed an executive order requiring 100% clean electricity by 2035. Delaware, too, passed clean energy legislation, requiring a 100% clean economy by 2050.

While interest in clean energy from states, utilities, and investors has increased, many bottlenecks remain, namely in interconnection queues, or the projects waiting to connect to the grid. Research by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that at the end of 2022, over 2,000 GW clean projects were waiting to connect, and at the end of 2023, that number had skyrocketed to over 2500 GW. Overall U.S. energy capacity is about 1,400 GW, meaning significantly more projects are waiting to connect to the grid than are currently connected.

Reforms by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aim to shorten these wait times and reduce costs, but regional approaches have shown that much more can be done in the effort to connect clean energy projects as quickly as possible. For example, Texas uses an approach to interconnection that avoids lengthy studies and costly upgrades across the transmission grid any time a project wants to connect.

This has reduced Texas' timeline to connect projects compared to other regions by 2.5 or more years, and shows why the state is predicted to add 35% of all solar projects and 44% of all battery projects this year, despite only producing 13% of the nation's electricity.

Further improvements to transmission planning, bolstered by recent FERC action, are also expected to prepare the grid to handle more clean energy, faster, but short-term actions like upgrading existing infrastructure to carry more electricity on the transmission pathways we already have can help meet our current needs.

The investment approach of the IRA is not enough to bring electricity sector emissions down to zero - it was never expected to do so. However, it has created tailwinds, bringing industry forward and creating momentum far into the future. Now, it's time to focus on the next piece of the puzzle and make sure the momentum translates into clean power."
How Dynamiq Stands Out In The Crowded AI Agent Landscape,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2024/10/08/how-dynamiq-stands-out-in-the-crowded-ai-agent-landscape/,2024-10-08T14:24:49Z,"AI agents and agentic workflows are the most commonly used buzzwords in the developer community, including among CXOs. Dynamiq, an emerging AI platform, is positioning itself as an operating platform for generative AI, offering an end-to-end environment that addresses the complex needs of modern businesses in their AI journey.

Vitalii Duk, the founder and CEO of Dynamiq, has a strong background in ML and AI infrastructure. As an engineering leader at Careem, which got acquired by Uber in 2019, Vitalli was responsible for operationalizing and managing complex MLOps platform running over 50 purpose-built models. That experience led Vitalli to launch Dynamiq as an enterprise-grade LLM and agent application platform.

Dynamiq's approach to AI development is fundamentally different from existing platforms. While platforms like CrewAI, LangGraph and AutoGen excel in specific areas such as multi-agent collaboration or graph-based workflows, Dynamiq takes a holistic approach, covering the entire AI development lifecycle from prototyping to deployment and fine-tuning.

At the core of Dynamiq's offering is its emphasis on on-premise deployment, a feature that sets it apart in an era where data privacy and security are paramount concerns for enterprises. This approach allows organizations to maintain full control over their data, ensuring compliance with stringent regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. For industries dealing with sensitive information, such as healthcare and finance, this level of control is not just a luxury but a necessity.

What caught my attention is the platform's low-code AI workflow builder, which is a standout feature that addresses a critical pain point in AI development. Traditionally, building AI applications required deep technical expertise, often creating a bottleneck in organizations where AI talent is scarce. Dynamiq provides a no-code, drag-and-drop interface for creating agentic workflows that include complex task orchestration. Dynamiq's intuitive interface simplifies building AI agents and agentic workflows, allowing teams with varying levels of technical expertise to rapidly prototype and test various scenarios. This acceleration in development cycles can significantly reduce time-to-market for AI-powered solutions, giving businesses a competitive edge.

Dynamiq's integrated retrieval-augmented generation capabilities further enhance its appeal to enterprises. By offering centralized data management and customized search functionalities, the platform enables organizations to leverage their existing knowledge bases effectively. This integration allows for more efficient handling of knowledge-intensive tasks, a crucial factor in industries where domain-specific expertise is critical.

One of the unique aspects of Dynamiq is its emphasis on LLM fine-tuning and ownership. In an AI landscape dominated by a few large players, the ability to fine-tune and own custom language models is a game-changer. Combined with RAG, this feature allows organizations to transition from consuming AI capabilities to truly owning their AI assets and IP, tailored to their specific needs and data. The platform's promise of achieving rapid fine-tuning and deployment of open-source LLMs with just two clicks is particularly attractive for organizations looking to build state-of-the-art models on their proprietary data.

Perhaps the most significant differentiator for Dynamiq is its focus on workflow persistence and human-in-the-loop interactions. In multi-agent systems, ensuring that workflows can recover from errors or interruptions is essential, particularly in production environments. Dynamiq offers built-in persistence for workflows, enabling smooth recovery from errors and making it easier to integrate human interventions into the process. While platforms like LangGraph also support stateful applications and error recovery, Dynamiq's approach is more enterprise-focused, offering the scalability and reliability that large organizations require. This makes it a preferred option for businesses that need to manage complex, large-scale workflows with minimal downtime.

With built-in features supporting SOC 2, GDPR and HIPAA compliance, the platform addresses the stringent security requirements of modern enterprises. This focus on security extends to its approach to data processing, with mechanisms in place to protect sensitive information and ensure data confidentiality.

Dynamiq's comprehensive observability features are another key differentiator. In the complex world of AI applications, the ability to gain real-time insights, track key metrics and streamline debugging processes is invaluable. This level of visibility into AI operations can significantly enhance operational efficiency and reduce the time and resources required for troubleshooting.

Recently, the company released a subset of its enterprise platform as open source. Dynamiq's open-source component, which is available on GitHub, is a Python-based framework that simplifies the development of AI-powered applications, with a focus on orchestrating RAG and large agents.

As businesses increasingly turn to AI to drive innovation and competitive advantage, platforms like Dynamiq appear promising and compelling. By offering a comprehensive, secure and flexible solution for AI development and deployment, Dynamiq addresses many of the challenges that have historically hindered widespread AI adoption in enterprise settings.

However, the true test of Dynamiq's potential will be in its real-world application across various industries. As early adopters begin to leverage the platform, the industry will be watching closely to see if Dynamiq can deliver on its promises of accelerated AI development, enhanced security and seamless integration."
"Roblox Inflated Data And Doesn't Protect Underage Gamers, Short Seller Alleges -- Stock Falls 6%",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/08/roblox-inflated-data-and-doesnt-protect-underage-gamers-short-seller-alleges-stock-falls-6/,2024-10-08T14:24:48Z,"Influential short seller Hindenburg Research revealed Tuesday it took a short position against kids-oriented video game platform Roblox, accusing the company of inflating key metrics of user engagement and of inadequately protecting children from disturbing content, causing Roblox's share price to tumble.

Several disturbing games on Roblox were accessed by Hindenburg with a child-registered account, including the ""Escape to Epstein Island"" and the ""Run From Diddy Simulator,"" referring to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, who is in federal prison awaiting trial for a litany of alleged sex crimes.

Hindenburg short positions often cause stock drops on the day of their release, and the company has targeted firms such as Cash App parent Block, Hydrogen car firm Nikola and Indian mogul Gautam Adani's Adani Group in prior reports. The California-based Roblox was cofounded in 2004 by its CEO David Baszucki, who is worth $2.5 billion as of Forbes' latest estimates, though Bascucki's fortune fell about $150 million Tuesday. Roblox went public in 2021, and had a roughly $25 billion market value as of Tuesday, about a third of its peak valuation of more than $75 billion in late 2021 as its share price faded alongside other ""pandemic darling"" stocks."
Netflix Reportedly Just Cancelled Another Great Show After Season 1,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/08/netflix-reportedly-just-cancelled-another-great-show-after-season-1/,2024-10-08T14:22:42Z,"Netflix has been on a pretty decent run lately with quality movie and show offerings and not cancelling as many good series as usual. Well, now they may have broken that streak with a cast member saying they are cancelling Jeff Goldblum's Kaos after just one season. No season 2 for Kaos.

While this is not from Netflix directly, it is from actress Aurora Perrineau who played Riddy on the show. Here's what she said in a now-deleted Instagram post:

""Well... this one hurts....I find explaining how I'm feeling to be really difficult, but I'll try.... For one of the first times in my life, I have found myself really proud. I'm, of course, proud of everyone's work and the care they gave to this project, because, let me tell you, they left everything on the floor. But I've also found myself proud of me, and that is something I've struggled with."" Later, she said outright that it was cancelled.

Kaos did reasonably well on the Top 10 charts for a while, but it never hit #1, and its viewership was behind a number of other series that were renewed. According to data from What's On Netflix, in its first four weeks it did worse than Obliterated and The Brothers Sun, two other series that were cancelled. It's about half of Supacell, a series that had very high scores and a presumably lower budget, and was renewed.

Kaos was a unique spin on Greek Mythology Jeff Goldblum as Zeus and Janet McTeer as Hera. It received solid reviews, a 76% from critics and a higher 83% from fans, many of whom are now dismayed with its reported cancellation.

This is, as ever, likely a combination of cost versus viewership, where it did decently, but not well enough. We don't know how much it cost, but it did have at least one big star in Goldblum. It was left hanging for over a month before it was apparently cancelled, and there are some indications Netflix perhaps tried to pivot to list it as a limited series, according to some data. It is not currently listed as such on the service, however. The creator originally said he wanted it to run for three seasons.

One bit of data we don't know about is the all-important completion rate, as that is a huge indicator of season 2 renewal, whether or not viewers make it through the whole series. If they drop off fast, that indicates many would not return for season 2. If not, they may come back for more. We don't know if that's what happened here.

But as with all these cancellations, the show did have its fans and many wanted to see more from the characters. But that does not appear to be happening. I've asked Netflix for comment and will update if I hear back."
Dyson Hair Dryer Sale: The Supersonic Is $100 Off For Prime Day,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2024/10/08/dyson-hair-dryer-sale/,2024-10-08T14:18:00Z,"We independently select all products and services. If you click through links we provide, we may earn a commission. Learn more

October Prime Day is officially here, and this season's beauty deals are pretty impressive. Among the offers, you can save $100 on the Dyson Supersonic, our beauty editors' pick for the best luxury hair dryer. This might be the last time we see a Dyson hair dryer sale before the holidays (at least, that's what happened last year), so we highly recommend taking advantage.

Multiple Forbes Vetted staffers praise the Supersonic for its ability to dry their strands faster than other hair dryers. ""Until I got the tool, I used to almost solely air dry my hair because blow drying felt like a total chore. But with the Supersonic, I'm able to get my hair fully dry in under 10 minutes. And I appreciate that the dryer is lightweight, so my arms never get sore,"" says senior deals editor Kara Cuzzone.

The Dyson Supersonic comes with five styling attachments that allow you to smooth flyaways, diffuse curls, create volume and concentrate heat. But if you're looking for something with a bit more styling versatility, consider opting for the Dyson Airwrap (which is also on sale for Prime Day). The tool uses hot air to curl and/or blow out your hair for a just-left-the-salon effect.

The Dyson Supersonic hair dryer is our pick for the best luxury hair dryer, so we clearly think it's worth the hype. It's powerful, effective and easy to use. If you style your hair regularly, the Supersonic a worthy investment. That said, the price is a very real downside. The streamlined Origin is a great way to try the luxe dryer for less -- if you don't mind the limited attachments. That said, if you want to spend even less or don't style your hair every day, we recommend the more affordable T3 AireLuxe Hair Dryer, our pick for the best hair dryer overall.

The Dyson hair dryer's quiet motor is one of its most defining features -- but don't expect a silent machine. It's still very much a whirring blow dryer when in use. However, the average dryer sits around 80 to 90 decibels while Dyson claims the Supersonic tops out at 79. And most users agree, including our contributor who says, ""Despite being an extremely powerful tool...the Supersonic is quiet (go ahead and blow dry your hair near your sleeping partner without getting dirty looks)."""
Anthony Marlowe Purchases Iconic Manalapan Estate From Oil Heiress Jean Christine Thompson,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/amandalauren/2024/10/08/anthony-marlowe-purchases-iconic-manalapan-estate-from-oil-heiress-jean-christine-thompson/,2024-10-08T14:17:45Z,"With a population of under 500 people -- home sales tend to make headlines in Manalapan, Florida, especially when the newest resident is call center magnate Anthony Marlowe, CEO of the customer experience conglomerate MCI. In October 2024, the entrepreneur closed on 3090 South Ocean Boulevard, an estate that he and his Mar-a-Lago buddies have proudly dubbed MarloweLago. The property was purchased from Dos Hermanas Real Estate, which oil was owned by oil heiress Jean Christine Thompson and previously used as a seasonal property.

However, the current Miami resident plans to move in and use this one-of-a-kind estate as his primary home. ""Miami is extraordinarily vibrant, but Palm Beach County is where I want to raise a family one day. It is where my social network is more centered,"" says Marlowe.

Originally from LaGrange, Illinois, the entrepreneur spent the beginning of his career in the Iowa City area. He also owns a 27-acre estate in North Liberty, Iowa, overlooking Coralville Lake, but Marlowe rarely uses that home. ""It's hard to believe I've only been to that house twice in the past three years. I was going to give it to my brother, but then he'll never join us in South Florida, so I am holding out.""

With an asking price of nearly $20 million in 2024, down from the original ask of $29.5 million, Marlowe shows that his years of negotiating starting, buying, and operating companies paid off by snagging the sea-to-lake Manalapan Estate for just over $15 million excluding furniture and fees. This iconic property, which was built in 2000 by famed Palm Beach developer Edward Falcone, is truly one-of-a-kind.

""I have a knack for finding waterfront property, but this one takes the cake by a long shot. It is an epic property. It is my honor to carry the torch from here, and my great honor to become a resident of Manalapan on Ocean Boulevard,"" he says.

Previously known as Castillo Dos Hermanos, the Mediterranean-style castle is 12000 square feet and sits on approximately two acres. It boasts a generous 150 feet of ocean beachfront as well as 144 feet of the Intracoastal. With seven bedrooms and ten bathrooms, the property features an elevator, resort-style pool and spa, steam shower, infrared sauna, gym, home theater, BBQ grill, pizza oven, three garages, wine cellar, and a private beach house with a dock.

""It's just an extraordinary build-out,"" the entrepreneur tells me. ""It has a cathedral-like ceiling, incredible marble inlays, mosaics, and an onyx theater. Some of the rooms definitely need furniture updates, but when you look at the master bedroom ceiling, the valances, and the color scheme -- it's extraordinary. It is Italian Castle meets English monarchy, meets Mediterranean Estate.""

Because the property is so large and sits on a double lot, Marlowe knows there are endless options for the future. ""Maybe I'll put a megastructure on the ocean side one day. In order to do it, I'd just have to vacate the current one which would be heartbreaking, because you can't have occupancy on both sides. But it's extremely buildable on the ocean. I could put, who knows, about 20000 square feet over there, which could make it a nine-figure property.""

But mostly, he's looking forward to moving in. ""I'm very excited about the short-, medium-, and long-term prospects, and having such a beautiful place to call home, right?""

He also doesn't think he will likely sell. ""If zoning allows it, I'm going to say just bury me on the ocean, on the ocean-side property right there. Not sure there is a better view. Unless perhaps Elon Musk starts selling burial plots on Mars or ejection into the heliosphere services, which would be out of this world, ha...""

Marlowe acquired the property full furnished. However, he eventually plans to add pieces that reflect his personal style. But, he isn't planning any major construction, at least not anytime soon. ""I don't think I'm knocking any walls down,"" he tells me. Still, there are a few minor renovations he wants to make, such as installing a more proportional fountain, potentially repainting the ceiling mural with byzantine iconography, upgrading to a state-of-the-art interior and exterior AV system for entertaining, as well as adding additional gold leaf to select ceiling coffers and trim.

On the other hand, Marlowe is going to change up the landscaping a little bit to improve the already breathtaking view. ""Some of the palms and hedges are so mature. So I'm going to have them do a little bit of clipping back,"" he tells me. ""It will dramatically open up the ocean view. I need Mr. Miyagi.""

Lastly, he plans to fully renovate the guest house. After all, with such a breathtaking property, there's a good chance Marlowe will have his fair share of visitors, so a refresh there is imminent."
Critical Application To Pursue Student Loan Forgiveness Is Back Up  --  Key Details,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2024/10/08/critical-application-to-pursue-student-loan-forgiveness-is-back-up---key-details/,2024-10-08T14:17:41Z,"In a major update, the Education Department has restored online access to a key application for borrowers looking to continue pursuing student loan forgiveness as certain programs remain cut off.

For the last two months, there has been no online access to the application for Income-Driven Repayment. This has prevented borrowers impacted by recent court rulings from applying to change their repayment plan. And it has also interfered with borrowers' obligations to recertify their income annually for existing IDR plans.

IDR is a collection of individual plans that base monthly payments on a borrower's income, with the potential for student loan forgiveness after a certain period of time (typically, 20 or 25 years). IDR is also a critical component of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, or PSLF, as most borrowers must be enrolled in an IDR plan in order to make qualifying PSLF payments. PSLF can allow for student loan forgiveness in as little as 10 years for borrowers who work in the nonprofit or public sectors.

But following a nationwide injunction blocking President Joe Biden's newest IDR program called the SAVE plan, the Education Department took down the online IDR application to update its internal systems to comply with the court order. With online access to the IDR application now restored, borrowers have a bit more wiggle room to stay on track for student loan forgiveness.

More than eight million borrowers who had enrolled in the SAVE plan or were converted from REPAYE, the predecessor IDR plan, have been forced into a forbearance since August as a result of the recent injunction ordered by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. During the forbearance, borrowers will not have to make payments on their federal student loans, and their balances will not accrue interest. However, the forbearance period won't count toward student loan forgiveness under either IDR or PSLF, effectively pausing borrowers' progress toward debt relief.

This is particularly frustrating for borrowers who are nearing the end of their student loan forgiveness term. This could include borrowers who had been repaying their loans under an IDR plan for 20 or 25 years, or stand to benefit from the IDR Account Adjustment, a related initiative that can credit borrowers retroactively with time toward IDR loan forgiveness. This also would include borrowers on track for PSLF, which provides for faster debt relief in as little as 10 years.

The Education Department had previously suggested that borrowers looking to resume progress toward student loan forgiveness under IDR or PSLF could apply to switch to a different repayment plan. But with the online IDR application down, borrowers' only option had been to use a paper application, and the department had said that there was a systemwide processing pause on new IDR requests.

As of last week, the Education Department has now restored access to the online IDR application.

""Borrowers may apply for IDR plans and/or to consolidate loans by using the online applications"" available at StudentAid.gov, says updated department guidance.

Borrowers can apply to the SAVE plan, but as long as the program remains blocked, it's inaccessible. With the ICR and PAYE plans no longer available, that effectively means there is only one other IDR plan available to borrowers looking to leave the SAVE plan forbearance: Income-Based Repayment, also known as IBR.

""Borrowers should note that, under the court's injunction, no new enrollments are being accepted for the Pay As Your Earn (PAYE) or Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) Plans,"" explains the department. But IBR remains available. Switching to IBR would allow borrowers to resume progress toward student loan forgiveness under both IDR and PSLF.

Some borrowers are reporting that the online tool that links to the IRS for purposes of importing their income information may not be functioning. As a result, borrowers may need to manually upload their income documentation as part of the online IDR application process.

The main benefit of applying to leave the SAVE plan forbearance for IBR is that it would allow a borrower to effectively ""un-pause"" their student loan forgiveness progress under IDR plans and, if applicable, PSLF. Given that the SAVE plan forbearance could last a year, this may matter to people, particularly those who are approaching the end of their loan forgiveness term.

But for other borrowers, the calculus may be more complicated. First, IBR is a more expensive plan than SAVE, and in some cases, the difference in the monthly payment amounts could be significant. A single borrower making $60,000 annually would pay around $220 per month under SAVE, but would pay around $470 per month under IBR.

In addition, the IBR plan does not have the interest waiver benefits that the SAVE plan has. This means that loan balances may increase over time due to negative amortization if payments aren't high enough to cover the interest that's accruing. And borrowers who switch to IBR, and then subsequently apply to change to a different repayment plan, could experience interest capitalization, where all of the outstanding interest gets added to the loan principal.

""We encourage borrowers to review the specifics of each IDR plan in order to make the best choices for their circumstances,"" says department guidance, noting the possible risk of interest capitalization under the IBR plan.

Borrowers on track for PSLF may have other options that don't require that they switch to IBR. For example, PSLF borrowers could switch to a 10-year Standard plan if they are eligible, which counts toward student loan forgiveness under PSLF regulations. Or they could remain in the SAVE plan forbearance and subsequently apply for PSLF Buyback, although this comes with important restrictions.

The Education Department warns borrowers to still expect lengthy processing delays, even though the online IDR application is back up.

""Borrowers should expect a lengthy delay in processing of applications, especially for borrowers applying for SAVE/REPAYE,"" says the department. ""We do not currently have an estimate of how long this will take.""

One possible bright spot with the delays is that borrowers who apply to change IDR plans could be placed in a processing forbearance for up to 60 days, which can count toward student loan forgiveness under both PSLF and IDR. But interest will accrue during that time.

""If servicers need time to process a borrower's IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days,"" says the department. ""Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and it is eligible for PSLF and IDR for up to 60 days.""

But if the IDR application isn't processed within 60 days, the borrower will then be placed in a general forbearance again. This will pause interest accrual, but the period won't count toward student loan forgiveness."
"Saints' Khalen Saunders, brother of Taylor Swift backup dancer, records 1st career interception vs Chiefs",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/saints-khalen-saunders-brother-taylor-swift-backup-dancer-records-1st-career-interception-vs-chiefs,2024-10-08T14:17:29Z,"FOX Sports' Peter Schrager joins Colin Cowherd to break down how the Kansas City Chiefs remain undefeated despite losing their key players.

Worlds converged on Monday night during the Kansas City Chiefs' win over the New Orleans Saints with Taylor Swift in attendance high above Arrowhead Stadium.

Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs were driving down the field again in the third quarter. Mahomes threw a pass intended for wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. Instead, the ball went off of the veteran's hands and into the arms of defensive lineman Khalen Saunders.

Saunders rumbled for a 37-yard return, which helped set up the Saints' touchdown pass from Derek Carr to Foster Moreau. The interception was a career first for Saunders, and it became an interesting answer to a potential trivia question down the road.

Saunders is the brother of Kameron Saunders, who is one of Swift's backup dancers on the pop star's ""Eras Tour.""

The 6-foot, 324-pound defensive tackle played for the Chiefs from 2019 to 2022 - before the Swift-Travis Kelce relationship took off during the 2023 season. He played in all 17 games for the Saints last season and has appeared in two this year.

PATRICK MAHOMES THROWS FOR OVER 300 YARDS AS CHIEFS REMAIN UNBEATEN WITH WIN OVER SAINTS

Kameron Saunders was apparently in Kansas City to watch his brother's team take on his boss' team.

""PERIOD!!!!! Play of the game! The big boy/d-lineman running the ball!!!!"" the proud brother wrote on his Instagram Stories.

It was a bright spot in what otherwise was a disappointing game for the Saints.

China Bets On Massive Blockchain Infrastructure,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/08/china-bets-on-massive-blockchain-infrastructure/,2024-10-08T14:16:02Z,"In October 2019 Chinese President Xi Jinping noted: ""We must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies, clarify the main direction, increase investment, and accelerate the development of blockchain technology."" according to the study in the Journal of Physics: Conference Series.

The speech resolved the uncertainty of blockchain technology development in China and delivered a strong signal that the central government will support and devote more resources to this area according to a study published in Research in International Business and Finance journal. Following this, the Communist Party of China made a decision, recognizing data as an equal factor of production alongside traditional inputs like labor and capital.

A key component of China's blockchain strategy is the Blockchain-Based Service Network launched in 2020. According to a CoinDesk report from March 2021, BSN offers a government-controlled framework for blockchain developers, supporting applications built on multiple blockchain networks. The system provides two versions: one for users inside China and another for international developers.

Notably, the domestic version allows authorities to censor or delete entire blockchains if deemed necessary, with CEO Yifan He of Red Date, the company behind BSN, stating, ""If they do something wrong we can delete the whole chain,"" as reported by Coindesk.

In March 2021, the Chinese government formally incorporated blockchain development into its national strategy with the approval of the ""14th Five-Year Plan"" (2021-2025). This plan includes blockchain industry development initiatives for 29 provinces and cities across the country. This push aims to enhance China's global competitiveness in critical economic sectors through what officials term ""Chinese-style blockchain"" - blockchain without cryptocurrencies, according to a research article published in the Big Data & Society journal.

The Chinese city of Shanghai issued an implementation plan on July 31, 2023 to promote the development of its urban blockchain digital infrastructure system for the period of 2023-2025. The plan aims to strengthen blockchain applications in Shanghai's economy and governance, supporting municipal affairs and coordinating resources in the Yangtze River Delta to create an international blockchain hub according to an article on Cointelegraph.

The government views blockchain through the lens of 'state techno-solutionism,' a technological tool to boost national competitiveness and modernize agriculture. This approach aligns with broader national goals, including what Chinese officials refer to as the 'rejuvenation' of the nation. Such a perspective stands in contrast to the Western cypherpunk blockchain movement's vision of decentralization and freedom from governmental and corporate control according to the article in Big Data & Society journal.

According to various news on the Chinese government website, the country is integrating blockchain technology into various sectors. Among these, in 2024 China uses blockchain to propel its foreign trade, in social and economic development, the digital trade sector, and the creation of new information infrastructure. Additionally, courts at all levels are exploring the use of blockchain to improve judicial processes. This integration is happening alongside other advanced technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and big data analytics.

In May 2023, China established a national blockchain research center with the goal of training at least 500,000 blockchain professionals for the country. For comparison, there are currently only about 26,000 active blockchain developers worldwide, according to data from the Developer Report website.

In August 2023, at the Hangzhou Summit, officials unveiled a blockchain-powered data exchange platform. The Hangzhou Data Exchange uses distributed ledger technology to enable enterprise IT data trading, providing a system for immutable and traceable transactions, according to a report by China News Network. Over 300 enterprises, including Alibaba Cloud and Huawei, participated in its debut.

In December 2023, China's Ministry of Public Security launched RealDID, a blockchain-based platform to verify the real-name identities of China's 1.4 billion citizens. This system aims to provide a form of ""pseudonymity"" where users can register and log in to websites using DID addresses and private keys, keeping their real identities hidden from other users and businesses. However, the government retains the ability to link these digital identities to real individuals when necessary, according to a report by CoinDesk.

On March 30, 2024, China launched its national key R&D program for an ultra-large-scale blockchain infrastructure platform for the Belt and Road Initiative - China's global strategy to expand its economic and political influence through improved trade routes and infrastructure across Asia, Europe, and Africa.

The Belt and Road Initiative, estimated to cost between $1-8 trillion, is one of the largest economic development projects in history. It includes the ""Information Silk Road,"" a digital dimension comprising deep-sea internet cables and satellites. This digital infrastructure overlays the physical BRI corridors, creating a foundation for advanced software-based services, including blockchain applications. The integration of physical and digital elements positions the BRI as a comprehensive system of land, sea, and space connectivity, potentially revolutionizing global trade and economic cooperation, according to Wolfgang Lehmacher's study published in the Port Technology International journal.

""The time is now to view geopolitics through the lens of blockchain technology,"" writes anti-financial crime expert Douglas McCalmont in his LinkedIn post. He notes that ""China will soon maintain a powerful and insular global (parallel) economy to challenge all things US.""

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has issued guidelines encouraging social capital investment in innovative agricultural technology enterprises, with a specific focus on key agricultural technology research and blockchain application promotion.

The agricultural sector implements social credit systems in rural areas using blockchain technology. For instance, in 2020, Qingyuan, Guangdong province, introduced a blockchain-based system called ""Persimmon Points"", according to a study published in the Big Data & Society journal. This system allows participants to earn points for ""positive actions"" and lose points for perceived negative behaviors, with the data transparently recorded on a public blockchain.

Another example is the GoGoChicken project, a collaboration between local governments and a blockchain technology company, uses blockchain and IoT devices to record and monitor the entire chicken production process, from breeding to sales. Positioned as a poverty alleviation tool, the project caters to safety-conscious urban consumers willing to pay premium prices for traceable food products. However, the article in Big Data & Society journal raises questions about the project's potential impact on farmers' data control and empowerment. The study argues that ""Blockchain fortifies the extraction and exploitation of data, granting businesses greater access and control over information belonging to vulnerable groups.""

China's rapid advancement in blockchain technology has raised concerns in the United States, leading to legislative action. According to a report by CoinDesk, in November 2023, U.S. lawmakers introduced the CLARITY Act, proposing to bar federal government officials from doing business with China-based blockchain firms and using China-based blockchains. The bill prohibits transactions with iFinex (Tether's parent company), The Spartan Network, and The Conflux Network. It aims to prevent foreign access to national security intelligence and private information. The Act also directs U.S. agencies to develop a plan addressing risks from China's blockchain technologies.

China's approach to blockchain technology demonstrates a strategic duality. On the mainland, Beijing has banned global crypto networks while developing and promoting versions of next-generation monetary technology that provide greater control to the Chinese Communist Party's government. Meanwhile, through Hong Kong, China maintains a presence in global crypto markets, leveraging the city's special administrative status as a financial gateway. This two-pronged approach allows China to take advantage of blockchain's potential while maintaining tight control over its financial systems on the mainland.

As noted in the article by Ben Schreckinger in POLITICO, this strategy enables China to ""exert internal financial controls on the mainland while impeding capital flight to bet on the potential of global crypto networks to disrupt money and finance."" Schreckinger further observes: ""Inside China, Beijing will be able to keep the world's biggest population and second-largest economy running on financial networks it designs and controls (and push trading partners to join them) -- without giving up its ambitions to make China a player in the more unruly crypto networks used elsewhere."""
Wilson Expanding Tennis-Infused Lifestyle Sneaker Style,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/timnewcomb/2024/10/08/wilson-expanding-tennis-infused-lifestyle-sneaker-style/,2024-10-08T14:15:20Z,"Wilson plans to open three-plus decades of the brand's sneaker archives and create an entirely fresh wave of lifestyle shoes all based around tennis history.

It's already started.

Earlier in 2024, Wilson unveiled the revamped Pro Staff 87 and just last month debuted the new Wilson Tennis Classic Premium, a low-profile shoe design for off-court wear highlighted by a premium European leather upper. To help the new Tennis Classic make a splash, high-end leather wasn't the only material the debut release came in, with Wilson offering up a special-edition tennis ball felt upper on the design.

""The tennis ball felt was released to do something unexpected, and to drive energy and conversation toward the model,"" a Wilson footwear spokesperson tells me about the release. ""We wanted to show the equity we are building in court style footwear, as well as for Wilson Sporting Goods as a brand overall. We are working on many future partnerships, collaborations and also celebrating moments with limited release products in the future on models brought back from the archive.""

That archive will soon open even further. Following the Pro Staff 87 and Tennis Classic, Lee Gibson, senior director of footwear design at Wilson, tells me to expect a newfound focus on the extensive collection as the brand works toward a full offering of models spanning the 1980s, '90s and even some from the 2000s. ""We are excited to be able to offer multiple options to support our athletes when they are not on court,"" Gibson says, ""so expect to start seeing things pop up.""

The additional releases within the lifestyle collection match with Wilson's continued focus on its Sportswear apparel, which has seen steady growth over the last couple of years. The brand says that it believes with 114 years of tennis history it has ""something authentic to offer in the court style world.""

The Tennis Classic is simply the next step in that direction. While the Pro Staff 87 features a modernized update of a popular on-court model, the Tennis Classic is a homage to tennis style. Wilson says it hopes to bridge the gap between performance and style with the silhouette, offering a ""refined"" model rooted in tennis culture.

The Tennis Classic has a focus on craftsmanship, the brand says, highlighting the simplicity of the detailing. The European leather is meant to provide elegance, while the last shape, stance and understated branding fits the brand's focus for the product by creating a shoe that doesn't overstep its needs.

Much like the Pro Staff 87 update, which launched in three new colorways on top of an updated last, sockliner, foam midsole, rubber outsole and leather upper design, Wilson wants to ensure the new Sportswear models don't back down on comfort, with the primary goal ""to create a highly comfortable lifestyle option,"" Shivam Bhan, Wilson senior director of product and merchandising, tells me. ""The [Pro Staff 87] pays homage to its athletic roots while being versatile enough for everyday wear.""

Now the Tennis Classic adds to the tennis-inspired mix from Wilson. That mix may soon grow larger, as the brand will further dip into the Wilson footwear vault for lifestyle sneakers."
I am not buying the 'hate speech' ruse and you shouldn't either,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/i-am-not-buying-hate-speech-ruse-you-shouldnt-either,2024-10-08T14:14:28Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Kamala Harris' pick for vice president, Tim Walz, has repeated the claim during the campaign that ""there's no guarantee to free speech."" The aspect that he targets is ""hate speech."" However, the Supreme Court has stated that our constitution's first amendment protects even hate speech. One may argue that one should not have the right to call a gay man or a black man a derogatory name, but that is not the point here. The First Amendment protects the views and opinions that our government may label as ""hateful."" I'm thankful for that, for I would not be where I am today without free speech.

When I first moved to Chicago from Indiana over 20 years ago, I kept my mouth shut. Liberal politics held sway over the Black community and one did not swim against the current. I saw many things I did not like, mainly the continual reinforcement of Black dependency on the government. I saw failures in education and the job market that did not have to happen. I saw teens mapping their families around government policies. I saw far too much and I kept my mouth shut.

I feared the repercussions of speaking out. The penalty for a Black person is often higher than other Americans and that is often due to the stronghold that Black politicians and their white liberal counterparts hold over the community. I feared being delegitimized as an Uncle Tom. Look at Ralph Ellison or Shelby Steele or Thomas Sowell -- smeared as Uncle Toms for speaking truth to power.

THE SERIOUS CRISIS GRIPPING AMERICA THAT NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT

Eventually, my resentment of the fear building up within me and my shame in looking away from the realities that I saw on the streets became too much to bear for me. When a young man born to good parents was shot and killed, I felt the nudge of God. I walked across the street from my church to the motel infested with drugs, prostitution, gamblers, and murderers and I climbed the roof in protest.

That was the moment I began to exercise my freedom of speech. I wasn't going to take it anymore. I would begin to speak the truth. I drew my strength from the civil rights foot soldiers who used the power of free speech to illustrate the horrors of segregation and white supremacy and to argue for a more moral America.

I didn't stop there. A few years after raising enough funds to buy and tear down the motel, I came out as a Republican. In doing so, I broke publicly with the politics of my community. I began to speak out against the 60-plus years of liberal policies that destroyed my community.

In response, I faced death threats and had to put my family into hiding. My church was robbed. Most of all, people accused me of speaking hatred.

That is why freedom of speech is so important. Imagine if those people, some of them employed by the government, had the power to shut me down for hate speech. All I did was say these liberal policies are killing my community and that was labeled as hate speech. They did that to protect their power, their money, and their identity.

We can never allow the principle of free speech to be compromised in any way. It is the greatest principle and power that man could ever possess -- just look back at the history of mankind and you will see that nearly every advance of some sort starts with man speaking his mind.

Look no further than me. I never stopped speaking since I announced that I was a Republican. Several years ago, Fox News asked if I wanted to work with them and we created the ""Rooftop Revelations"" series. What makes me most proud of that series is that we allowed so many people from the South Side to speak without varnish to the public. It was raw and truth. It allowed outsiders to see directly into our community and to see what the need is.

That is why, today, I am in the middle of building a $40 million Leadership and Economic Center right across the street from my church. Yes, the very same location where that motel once stood. That is the power of free speech and that is why we must never allow it to be compromised in any way. We have everything to gain from it, especially the truth that gives us the power to advance society."
"Best Motorcycle Accident Lawyers Albuquerque, NM Of 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/legal/auto-accident/best-motorcycle-accident-lawyers-albuquerque-nm/,2024-10-08T14:14:22Z,"That time limit is set by the New Mexico statute of limitations for personal injury claims. According to that statute, claimants have three years from the date they were injured to file a lawsuit against the party that caused the harm. If they wait longer than that to file a lawsuit, the courts will dismiss it.

Anyone who drives a motorcycle in New Mexico needs to be familiar with New Mexico motorcycle laws. The following are regulations that could affect the outcome of a motorcycle accident.

New Mexico, like the majority of states in the country, uses at-fault motorcycle insurance and accident rules. This means that the at-fault driver or rider in a motorcycle accident is responsible for compensating everyone who was injured in the accident.

Because the at-fault driver (or their insurance company) is responsible for compensation, identifying fault becomes a critical part of any claim or lawsuit. All potentially liable insurance companies can instigate independent investigations to determine which party was at fault. Similarly, the lawyer for the injured party can also try to uncover evidence to determine fault.

Identifying fault in New Mexico motorcycle accidents is additionally complicated by the pure comparative negligence rules that the courts use to calculate damages from a jury verdict. If the litigating party was partially responsible for the injuries they suffered, any award they receive is reduced by a percentage equal to the percentage they are responsible for their injuries."

Our close call with crafty scammer posing as Microsoft support,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/our-close-call-crafty-scammer-posing-microsoft-support,2024-10-08T14:10:30Z,"Whether you're using a Microsoft Windows computer or an app like Word or PowerPoint, you can get free virtual help and training through Microsoft's website, Kurt ""The CyberGuy"" Knutsson reports.

Microsoft support scams are probably the oldest type of online scam, and they remain just as dangerous as they were a decade ago, perhaps even more so now with scammers having access to better technology, AI tools and advanced hardware. We've reported on countless numbers of these scams, but ""Bob"" from Washington, D.C., forwarded a new one that we wanted to share with you. This particular scam uses Google search results to redirect you to scammers instead of Microsoft customer support.

Bob mentioned in the email that he and his wife lost access to their Microsoft Exchange email service. They searched Google for Microsoft support and called a number they found, which connected them to a technician. They then gave him permission to access their computer.

""After a couple of hours of running 'security' scans he told us he had found that other IP addresses were trying to get into our system. Getting suspicious I asked him for his ID number and contact information for his supervisor. I called his 'superior' who asked me all the 'right questions' and confirmed the technician I was talking to was legit,"" Bob wrote.

The technician then claimed to have frozen Bob's account and told him that one of the suspicious IP addresses had attempted to withdraw money from their bank account.

When Bob asked if he should contact the bank about the issue, the technician told him, ""Don't do that. We want to set up a sting and catch them red-handed. We believe there's an employee leaking customer information, and we don't want you tipping them off.""

Bob added, ""Now nationwide, I believe my bank probably has over 100,000 employees. What are the odds that I would be alerting the one crooked bank employee? Then he said give us permission to access your account. We will 'borrow' $14,000, and set up a sting in South Carolina where the police are already waiting to catch the crook.""

The technician, who by this point was clearly a scammer, also promised Bob a $500 reward. But when Bob asked about their original request to have the email account restored, the scammer replied that the IT team would handle that later. Realizing it was a scam, Bob and his wife ended the call.

HOW TO RECOGNIZE AND AVOID BEING A VICTIM OF VACATION RENTAL SCAMS

Scammers often take advantage of search engines like Google by creating fake websites or ads that mimic legitimate Microsoft support pages. When users, like Bob, search for ""Microsoft support"" or ""Microsoft customer service,"" they may unknowingly click on one of these fraudulent links, which appear at the top of search results. These fake pages display phone numbers that look official but actually connect users to scammers posing as Microsoft technicians.

Once on the phone, the scammers use scare tactics, like claiming there's suspicious activity on your account, to gain access to your computer and personal information. In Bob's case, he called what he thought was a Microsoft support number, but it was really a scammer who tricked him into allowing access to his computer.

MOST TARGETED CITIES FOR TRAVEL BOOKING SCAMS

Microsoft scams are getting more sophisticated every day, but you're not defenseless. Here are some ways to protect yourself from Microsoft support scams:

1) Verify contact information: Always use official contact information from Microsoft's official website. Microsoft does not offer support via unsolicited calls or pop-ups.

2) Be cautious with search results: Be wary of search engine results or ads that appear too good to be true. Use official websites and contact numbers to reach support.

3) Check for red flags: Scammers often use urgent language or threats to create a sense of panic. Be suspicious if you're pressured to act quickly or if the person asks for remote access to your computer.

4) Invest in personal data removal services: Scammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their methods of obtaining personal information. They often scour the web for publicly available data, piecing together details from various sources to create targeted phishing attacks. These personalized scams can be alarmingly convincing, making it crucial to limit the amount of personal information accessible online. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.

5) Have strong antivirus software: If you have strong antivirus software installed on your device, it can protect you from visiting harmful websites on the internet that might be mimicking a company like Microsoft. Antivirus software also helps you avoid opening malicious attachments or links.

While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.

HEARTLESS SCAMMERS ARE PREYING ON PEOPLE'S LOST PET ANGUISH

This Microsoft support scam is a reminder to double-check who you're dealing with before sharing any personal info. Scammers are getting slicker, using fake support numbers that pop up in your search results to trick you into giving them access to your computer or bank details.

Wisconsin Senate race shifts to 'toss up' by handicapper as Tammy Baldwin fights for re-election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wisconsin-senate-race-shifts-toss-up-handicapper-tammy-baldwin-fights-re-election,2024-10-08T14:09:54Z,"Wisconsin Republican Party Executive Director Andrew Iverson emphasized the ground game strategy in the battleground that includes turning out Republican voters in deep blue areas.

A top political handicapper shifted its rating for the Wisconsin Senate race on Tuesday to ""Toss Up"" with less than a month until election day.

The race in Wisconsin, a pivotal battleground state in both the presidential and Senate matches, was most recently considered ""Lean Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report.

TRUMP, REPUBLICANS VENTURE TO BLUE AREAS IN WISCONSIN TO BOOST GOP TURNOUT

The handicapper cited changes in polling in recent days, with Hovde appearing to close the gap with Baldwin. But Cook also referred to private polling from both campaigns, which it said each showed the race within the margins of error.

A source familiar confirmed to Fox News Digital that Baldwin's internal polling shows such a race.

In response to the rating shift, Hovde spokesman Zach Bannon said, ""Sen. Baldwin's radical agenda has sparked record high inflation, created chaos [at] the southern border, and made our communities less safe. Eric Hovde is going to win because the people of Wisconsin are ready for change.""

HERE'S WHAT 2 UNDECIDED WISCONSIN VOTERS ARE HOLDING OUT FOR IN 2024 ELECTION

""After 25 years in Washington, Tammy Baldwin has become the typical D.C. politician, voting in lock-step with the failed Biden agenda and hiding her Wall Street partner's stock trades from her constituents. Wisconsinites are ready for change, and Eric Hovde has the momentum,"" said National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) spokesman Tate Mitchell in a statement.

SENATE REPUBLICANS MARK OCT 7 ATTACK 1 YEAR OUT AS ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR CONTINUES

The latest Marquette Law School poll showed Baldwin winning the battle, 51% to Hovde's 45%. The survey interviewed 882 registered voters over Sept. 18-26. The poll's margin of error was +/-4.4 percentage points.

With Cook's ratings change, Wisconsin joins other ""Toss Up"" Senate races in Ohio and Michigan."
Sylvester Stallone's daughter has scary experience with stranger in New York,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sylvester-stallones-daughter-scary-experience-stranger-new-york,2024-10-08T14:09:15Z,"Sylvester Stallone's daughter, Sistine Stallone, 26, wants to share her story with other women.

During a recent episode of ""Unwaxed,"" the podcast she shares with sister Sophia, Sistine opened up about a terrifying moment she experienced in New York when a strange man followed her for multiple city blocks.

""There was this guy on a bike that just started screaming really inappropriate profanities at me, but I just kept moving. I didn't even acknowledge it,"" she said on the podcast. ""But he comes up behind me on his bike and puts his hands on me and that's when I freaked out, and then he started screaming at me.""

Following the man's decision to touch her, Sistine no longer felt safe, explaining that she then began to run, looking for a place to hide. He continued to follow her for three blocks and started ""cutting through the crowd on his bike.""

She then ran into a Sephora and was ""hiding behind a makeup counter."" Initially, Sistine believed she successfully ""lost him"" and the man had moved on. She quickly realized, however, the man was ""inside the store"" and ""screaming at the top of his lungs, 'You can't hide from me b----, I will find you. I will get you.'""

""And at this point he has like five employees trying to box him out of the store,"" she explained. ""In the middle of all of this I'm hiding in the back of the store for 15 minutes, I'm on the ground like in a bug formation. If he comes back, I'm screwed. I see four cops take him to the back of the store.""

After telling her story, Sistine revealed she chose to share her experience in an effort to remind women to pay attention when walking alone, telling them ""don't have your headphones in"" and ""don't be looking down.""

""He comes up behind me on his bike and puts his hands on me and that's when I freaked out and then he started screaming at me.""

-- Sistine Stallone

Fans of the young star were quick to show their support on social media, with one person writing, ""I'm horrified that this happened to you. I hope you're OK."" Another commented, ""I'm so sorry that happened please get a taser or pepper spray! No one should have to go through that.""

Sylvester shares Sistine, and her two sisters, Sophia, 28, and Scarlet, 22, with his wife, Jennifer Flavin. The couple got married in May 1997, and aside from a brief separation from August to September 2022, they have been together ever since. They previously dated from 1988 to 1994, reconciling later in 1995.

""I remember vividly the first time I met Jennifer,"" he said in an episode of ""The Family Stallone,"" the reality show he stars in with his family. ""I was in this dark restaurant, a few people. She came in and, whoa! Something happened. I just felt, like, this jolt, like - 'Oh, did we just have a minor earthquake or something?'""

He went on to say that things ""happen when you least expect it"" and 35 years after meeting his wife, he still considers himself to be ""the luckiest son of a b---- in the world.""

WATCH: Sylvester Stallone's daughters claim he makes it difficult for them to date

While promoting their reality show, the ""Rocky"" star's daughters explained why their dad makes it hard for them to date. Sistine and Sophia told Fox News Digital they feel the need to ""prep"" the men they're dating before they meet their dad.

'No guns for illegal aliens' bill rolled out by House GOP lawmaker,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/no-guns-illegal-aliens-bill-rolled-out-house-gop-lawmaker,2024-10-08T14:09:10Z,"FIRST ON FOX: A House lawmaker is raising concerns about the possibility of people who are in the country illegally being able to purchase firearms through the same process a U.S. citizen would use.

Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., is unveiling a new bill called the ""No Guns for Illegal Aliens Act,"" which would explicitly ban illegal immigrants from buying firearms using government-issued IDs.

He also expressed support for former President Trump's controversial mass deportations plan, which would likely be the largest such move in U.S. history, while criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

MEXICAN GOVERNMENT BUSES MIGRANTS TO US BORDER AS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BECOMES TOP ELECTION ISSUE

""Border Czar Kamala Harris has allowed criminal illegal aliens to enter our country and roam our streets. Meanwhile, radical liberals like Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are offering driver's licenses to illegals -- creating a recipe for disaster,"" Clyde told Fox News Digital.

""As we await President Trump's historic mass deportation effort, we must ensure illegal aliens with government-issued IDs cannot obtain firearms and wreak havoc on our communities.""

It's the latest move in a wider push by House Republicans to direct attention to crime perpetuated in the U.S. by illegal immigrants after several high-profile incidents in the last few years, including the killings of Rachel Morin, Laken Riley, and 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray.

FOCUS GROUP REACTS TO TRUMP CLAIM THAT MIGRANTS ARE 'EATING THE DOGS' IN OHIO TOWN

The three high-profile killings did not involve a gun, but Clyde argued that progressive policies allowing illegal immigrants to obtain drivers' licenses could open the door to more crime.

Clyde, a gun store owner, has had his own firearms license for over 30 years, according to his office.

As of now, 19 states plus Washington, D.C., offer driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has also recently developed a pilot program to distribute federal IDs called ""Secure Docket Cards"" to people who cross the border illegally and are awaiting immigration proceedings. It's not immediately clear if these IDs can be used to purchase guns, however.

The rate of crimes committed by illegal immigrants is lower than that of U.S. citizens, according to a study by the National Institute of Justice.

But Republicans argue that the act of entering the U.S. illegally is a crime in itself, and that instances of violent crime by such groups could be prevented just by having tougher border and immigration laws.

Exclusive: Sauz Pasta Sauce Enters Target Chainwide 15 Months Into Launch; Expands Nationwide In Whole Foods Markets,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwatman/2024/10/08/exclusive-sauz-pasta-sauce-enters-target-chainwide-15-months-into-launch-expands-nationwide-in-whole-foods-markets/,2024-10-08T14:08:13Z,"Jarred pasta sauce brand Sauz is experiencing a meteoric rise, entering 1,900 Target stores across the US today, Sauz cofounders Troy Bonde and Winston Alfieri reveal to me exclusively. Additionally, Sauz will increase its shelf space in Whole Foods Markets, expanding from about 60 stores in its Southern-Pacific region to more than 500 stores nationally beginning in January.

The Gen Z cofounders, based in Pasadena, CA, launched Sauz in July of 2023 with two varieties, Hot Honey Marinara and Summer Lemon Marinara, during a test run in Los Angeles' small upscale grocery chain, Erewhon. Come January, Sauz will offer a total of seven varieties, including Cracked Pepper & Parmesan, which hits Target shelves today in tandem with today's announcement.

The Covid Kickstart

Bonde and Alfieri kickstarted the company before they even realized that they were kickstarting the company. While the childhood friends and University of Southern California classmates were home during their sophomore years due to the covid pandemic, they raised a pretty penny which soon became their seed money for Sauz. Bonde sourced a hand sanitizer machine which doubled as an infrared thermometer-selling it to public schools. ""I put on a suit and a tie and I went to Glendale Unified,"" Bonde recalls. ""That evening, we had a signed purchase order that was more money than we'd ever thought we'd see...$15,000."" He met up for breakfast the next day with his best friend to share the news. Alfieri paid; Bonde never had a credit card before. ""I'll show you how to get a credit card, but let's partner,"" Alfieri told him. They relentlessly emailed more school districts, eventually earning nearly seven figures.

As they ruminated on ways to seize the momentum once covid died down, they would go to their local Whole Foods to buy ingredients to make pasta and red sauce, which became a ritual, perhaps due to Alfieri's Italian roots, as the two became roommates. ""I love making it homemade,"" Alfieri says. ""I thought jarred sauce was so weird.""

""We'd walk by the beverage aisle and see Olipop and Poppi and these bright, colorful, exciting brands."" In the pasta sauce section, Bonde says, ""visually, there was nothing that appealed to us."" They took $200,000 of the earnings from the covid product to develop a brand that they felt would innovate the sauce section. ""Our parents were like, what are you guys doing? Starting a tomato sauce? We're like, yeah,"" Alfieri remembers. ""We think there is room for a new tomato sauce.""

A Product Infused With A Gen Z Mindset

The sauce brand that the pair set out to create was one that was fun and took a risk. They introduced color (aside from red) to the sauce aisle. Walking past it now, you can't help but stare for a bit at Sauz on the shelf. The solid-colored labels pop out and draw the shopper in, inviting them to pick it up and take a closer look. They then feel the soft, matted label, and read at the bottom of the label, ""Not your grandma's pasta sauce,"" a statement that pasta sauce brands often preach the opposite of.

These vivid labels, amid a sea of tan-colored jars, form a rainbow on the shelf and symbolize unseen flavors in this section of the grocery store. Bonde and Alfieri landed on Hot Honey Marinara and Summer Lemon Marinara after years of testing, later adding Wild Rosemary Marinara and Creamy Calabrian Vodka to the lineup. They're familiar flavors that consumers would understand, yet unfamiliar in the medium of a pasta sauce so to provide a new experience. These varieties proved that Bonde and Alfieri had their pulse on the culture. As Brooke Gil, Whole Foods Markets Global Category Manager for pasta sauce, tells me, ""the recipes were speaking to trends that I'd seen in other categories.""

Mike Messersmith is the former President of Oatly North America and an investor in Sauz through Coefficient Capital, and says, ""you don't see this type of brand innovation in a legacy category...I attribute it to their youth and defiance of traditional flavor conventions.""

Bonde and Alfieri aimed to create a health-conscious sauce that didn't compromise taste. ""The brands that were trying to innovate too much on the health-forward side were taking a step forward and then two backward,"" says Bonde, leading to Sauz's decision to stick with olive oil instead of replacing it with something like avocado oil, despite its fewer calories. The ingredients list on a jar of Sauz has no mention of any additives, a general anomaly in the sauce section. ""One co-manufacturer wanted to take us to market with a tomato that included calcium chloride,"" Bonde says. Although it would have cost less, ""we said, no.""

A study conducted by YouGov on behalf of Whole Foods Markets released last month proves that the pair knew what they were talking about, revealing that 80% of Gen Zers feel that the quality of a product is important in order to buy it and 70% are willing to spend a premium on high-quality food.

Sauz's Rapid But Strategic Expansion

Sauz prides itself on being a local brand-dubbing itself 'Southern California Italian Sauce,' which also speaks to the global fusion aspect that many chefs and restaurateurs are embracing lately. Bonde and Alfieri considered launching Sauz in farmers markets. But the opportunity to launch locally in Erewhon provided two variables they couldn't turn down: data and awareness. ""Erewhon is the place to be seen,"" says Alfieri. ""We started demoing in every store as often as we could...that was our consumer testing."" Erewhon initially ordered about 100 jars of the two varieties to place in the top corner of the shelf. Today, four Sauz varieties take up significant real estate in Erewhon's sauce aisle.

Sauz launched in Whole Foods in April, right before completing its seed round of funding, in which the company raised $4.8 million. Dozens of H-E-B grocers in Texas and Raley's grocers in and around Northern California have since starters carrying Sauz too. ""Whole Foods is our natural partner. H-E-B was our initial test in conventional and Target is our test in mass,"" says Bonde.

With thousands of Target stores now carrying Sauz, the brand is no longer one of coastal America. ""We want to appeal to the consumer in the Midwest...that wants to excite their family,"" Bonde explains. ""75% of Americans now live within 10 miles of a jar of Sauz."" And while shoppers are in the grocery section of Target, the product is hard to miss-not just because of the colorful labels, but because they're shelved on the prominent sidecap display.

For a year-old company of three staff employees to launch in thousands more stores is a steep task. ""I love seeing retailers taking chances on brands that don't have massive infrastructure and taking bets on what they think consumers want,"" Messersmith says. Sauz has had several months to prepare to scale, and seems to be ready for it, with tomatoes and other ingredients already contracted through 2025. ""When a supplier is new to the scene, I like to start them out with a smaller footprint,"" Gil says. ""It gives them time to build that solid foundation to get comfortable with production, scheduling...for a greater chance of success when they do expand nationally.""

Both Target and Whole Foods worked with Sauz to collaborate on new flavors. While Cracked Pepper & Parmesan launches in Target today for an initial run, Sauz will also release two additional varieties in January that will be exclusive to Whole Foods through May 15. One variety will be another ""innovative"" red sauce while the other promises to be ""indulgent"" and ""creamy.""

Competing With Legacy

In its first six months at Whole Foods in the Southern-Pacific region, Sauz is holding its own. ""Sauz has outpaced a longstanding premium pasta sauce competitor in Whole Foods Market stores where both brands are sold, and with the same number of sauce options, selling 40% more jars than the competitor,"" according to internal Whole Foods data.

Rather than simply competing with other sauce brands, Sauz believes it is driving a whole new demographic to the category, largely because of its Gen Z-minded presence on social media, led by Sauz Head of Brand, Camryn Frederickson. ""They bring a lot of people in by telling their story on TikTok. I've seen these guys work the aisle, shelf by shelf, just talking to consumers,"" Messersmith says. ""CPG needs stuff like that.""

""People are looking for something new,"" he adds ""[Bonde and Alfieri] are creating something that feels different,"" which makes it compatible for Whole Foods Markets. According to Gil, ""discovering new products is one of the top reasons that customers come to Whole Foods.""

Bonde and Alfieri are a legacy of their own; their grandparents were friends too. ""We're literally like brothers,"" Bonde says. The legacy of Sauz is unapparent right now, but the story so far is one that very few others can relate to. As Gil says, ""I see this brand going the full mile."""
Why Workstations Are The Preferred AI Development Platform,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/garydrenik/2024/10/08/why-workstations-are-the-preferred-ai-development-platform/,2024-10-08T14:08:04Z,"There was a time, not so long ago, when it seemed like language models would only continue to grow larger. But today, organizations are recognizing the value of language models that are smaller, transparent, built-to-purpose -- and capable of running (and even being trained) on a developer's workstation. Not coincidentally, developer workstations are becoming more powerful, and new tools are emerging that make AI more accessible to more developers.

""There are trillion-plus-parameter LLMs out there right now, and it takes a tremendous amount of compute resources to run that kind of model,"" said Joe Fernandes, Vice President, Artificial Intelligence Business Unit, Red Hat. ""But an organization using AI to solve a specific problem can likely do so with smaller, more efficient models, ones that developers can start to experiment with and tweak right on their laptops.""

And, more and more, organizations are using AI in enterprise use cases. Across business and consumer realms, people have quickly embraced AI and, specifically, generative AI (gen AI). According to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey, 61 percent of professional/managers and about 46% of employees either are excited to experience gen AI or are already using it.

Indeed, demand is increasing rapidly for intelligent applications powered by AI. According to Gartner, in 2026, 30% of new applications will use AI to drive personalized adaptive user interfaces, up from less than 5% in 2023. Also in 2026, Gartner predicts that every enterprise PC purchase will be an AI PC. While it's interesting to think about how AI computing systems will transform daily work in the near future, it's critical for organizations to plan for how developers will be able to use them today.

There are many benefits to running language models on local developer workstations. Chief among them are:

Of course, all of this depends on having the right hardware in place, and even small language models will require GPU-enabled workstations. Evaluating workstations for AI development is a lot like evaluating workstations for any other role. The key difference is that we don't yet know what we don't know about AI. This means organizations will need to make their best, most educated predictions about how AI will evolve for the business, industry, and even society -- all while balancing budget considerations.

Of course, what happens on the workstation can't stay on the workstation. Organizations will also need to plan for moving (and scaling) applications from prototyping to production and beyond across the hybrid cloud using technologies like containers and Kubernetes.

Open-Source Considerations

The use of open source-licensed models, development tools and platforms is an important consideration when it comes to local development of AI-enabled applications. Open-source models are more easily accessible and ""tuneable"" by traditional developers than massive LLMs. Additionally, open-source operating systems and tooling provide transparency and engender trust -- a critical advantage as AI continues to expand into sensitive industries and workloads. And, importantly to the bottom line, open source can help reduce the currently high costs of AI (and especially generative AI) development and deployment.

""AI is transformational technology, and, like the inflection points that came before it, such as Linux and containers, not every organization is going to jump into the deep end right away,"" said Red Hat's Fernandes. ""AI will have a long tail, and developers and others will need a straightforward path to get started and to learn, as well as a view into how AI can work for their specific use cases. Right now, you can start on a laptop, graduate to a server, and then eventually make your way to production across the hybrid cloud.""

Further, the ability to freely and economically test and iterate AI-enabled applications on local workstations, combined with the transparency and accessibility of open systems, will help organizations position themselves for alignment with current and future regulations and directives. For example, the White House's Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence calls for artificial intelligence to be ""safe and secure,"" and specifically states that, ""Testing and evaluations, including post-deployment performance monitoring, will help ensure that AI systems function as intended, are resilient against misuse or dangerous modifications, are ethically developed and operated in a secure manner, and are compliant with applicable Federal laws and policies."" The concept of safer and more responsible AI is also the mission for emerging industry organizations like the AI Alliance.

A number of factors have converged to make workstations the preferred environment for building and testing AI-enabled applications in ways that benefit both businesses and their customers while providing the necessary controls to conform with the White House executive order and other mandates. These factors include smaller, more purpose-built learning models, the availability of (relatively) low-cost GPU-enabled workstations, and open-source tools and platforms that make development of AI applications more accessible and transparent. All of this is driven by the rapid surge in demand for applications that embed AI capabilities -- a demand that will only continue to grow."
Apple's Satellite Messaging: A Lifeline In Emergencies,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/timbajarin/2024/10/08/apples-satellite-messaging-a-lifeline-in-emergencies/,2024-10-08T14:08:00Z,"The smartphone is one of the greatest tools that allow us to stay connected to family and friends.

I learned this firsthand in 1989 when the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the Bay Area. I was at San Francisco's Candlestick Park for the SF Giants and Oakland A's World Series game. About 30 minutes before the game started, a 6.9 earthquake hit and jolted the stadium. It seemed that the entire stadium jerked forward and then back and rumbled for about five full minutes.

Amazingly, Candlestick sustained little visible damage, and once the shaking stopped, everybody mostly calmed down. However, for those with transistor radios, the news spread that some of the Bay Bridge had collapsed and many buildings were toppling. We quickly began to realize this was a massive earthquake.

I have always been a geek, frequently ridiculed for traveling with many gadgets. But this time, my geek toys were important. In 1989, cell phones were costly, so very few had them. But I had a Motorola brick cell phone, and I first called my wife to let her know we were okay. I also called three other family members to see if they were fine and let them know we were safe. Since I did this immediately, I could get a connection, but very shortly, cell services were cut off around the Bay Area, as power lines and cell towers were toppling, too.

I also had a 2-inch portable TV with me, so I could watch the early videos of the earthquake damage with our whole section crammed around me.

Fast forward to 2024.

As with the 1989 earthquake, once Hurricane Helene hit North Carolina, Florida and Georgia, power and cell services were lost in the most devastated areas. It became impossible for many to check on loved ones or let family members know their status.

In a September 30, 2024, article by 9-to-5 Mac, they posted a timely story stating that the iPhone's messaging app could now link to satellite connections. This article also included significant tweets from a few affected by Hurricane Helene.

Here are some examples they posted-

""Matt Van Swol: I've never been more thankful to be an iPhone user. Due to the lack of cell service, EVERYONE in Asheville NC right now on iOS 18 has been able to get messages out and in with the Satellite messaging feature. This is literally saving lives @Apple.

Mike, cyberowners.com: This new iOS 18 feature came in handy yesterday. I was able to contact my son. Unfortunately no one else in the family had the latest iOS installed so he was the only person who received my messages and later replied. When this is a Starlink feature, it will be incredible.

Xen: Also, with Verizon service absolutely dead after the hurricane, the @Apple Satellite Messaging service, was extremely helpful to reach out and let family know we were safe, etc. Such a helpful utility in times like this.""

In 2022, Apple launched the Satellite SOS service (for emergency services only) on the iPhone 14 and 15 Series.

On iPhone 14 and later models, with iOS 18, Apple has added satellite messaging that made it possible for those folks in North Carolina with dead cell phone service to still get information to their families and friends about their status.

In 1989, when I could let my wife know I was safe and she was as well, having that cell connection became a communication lifeline.

Now, with Apple's Satellite messaging available in iOS 18, it gives us even more comfort to know that we can communicate with anyone regardless of our circumstances, wherever we are in the world. Samsung and Google are also expected to add various satellite connections in the near future.

Apple and others' next step is to add satellite calling, but as most know, the number one way people communicate today is via messaging.

By the way, satellite messaging is the number one reason I have upgraded my wife's iPhone 12 Pro to an iPhone 16 Pro. The knowledge that we can always be connected, especially in an emergency, is worth the cost to me, as is the peace of mind it brings."
14 Attorneys General Sue TikTok As Its Future In The U.S. Is On The Line,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandralevine/2024/10/08/attorneys-general-sue-tiktok-ban/,2024-10-08T14:07:59Z,"ipartisan attorneys general from more than a dozen states and Washington are suing TikTok in separate but coordinated complaints alleging TikTok is a deliberately addictive platform that is psychologically harming and financially exploiting kids.

The suits were filed by attorneys general in New York, California, New Jersey, Oregon, Mississippi, Kentucky, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Vermont, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Washington state and Washington D.C.

At least one of those lawsuits, from D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, takes aim at problematic ways that money changes hands on TikTok, alleging the app is running an ""unlicensed virtual currency system"" that has made its popular livestream feature the equivalent of ""a virtual strip club"" for teens. The complaint, filed in D.C. Superior Court, cites and quotes the Forbes investigation ""How TikTok Live Became 'A Strip Club Filled With 15-Year-Olds,'"" along with internal TikTok materials that support it. The district accuses the company of violating consumer protection and money transmission laws by making false or misleading statements about how safe the platform is for young users, and it's demanding a jury trial.

""TikTok's platform, designed to be dangerously addictive, inflicts immense damage on an entire generation of young people,"" Schwalb said in a statement. ""In addition to prioritizing its profits over the health of children, TikTok's unregulated and illegal virtual economy allows the darkest, most depraved corners of society to prey upon vulnerable victims.""

After the state of Utah sued TikTok on similar grounds in June, company spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement: ""TikTok has industry-leading policies and measures to help protect the safety and well-being of teens. Creators must be at least 18 years old before they can go live, and their account must meet a follower requirement. We immediately revoke access to features if we find accounts that do not meet our age requirements."" (The follower requirement means that only users with an audience of more than 1,000 can go live.)

TikTok's future in the United States remains in limbo after President Joe Biden signed a law earlier this year that will ban the app nationwide come January over national security concerns -- unless its China-based parent, ByteDance, sells TikTok to an American owner. TikTok and ByteDance subsequently filed a lawsuit challenging that law, as did a cohort of TikTok creators, calling it unconstitutional and a move to simply shutter a platform used by 170 million Americans. Just last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington heard their arguments against a looming shutdown (both sides asked the court to issue a ruling by December 6, so the losing party can appeal). But against the backdrop of this high stakes legal fight in the Capitol, which could see a foreign-owned social media app barred from this country for the first time ever, states have steadily been building their own arsenal against TikTok. A bipartisan group of attorneys general launched an investigation into TikTok's alleged harms to underage users back in 2022. And after many months of individual states jockeying for internal TikTok documents in their respective probes, the new lawsuits filed today reveal some of the early results of that work.

Child safety and mental health concerns related to social media are now well-known and well-documented, so much so that schools across the country have started banning smartphones from their classrooms and campuses. More overlooked are the ways that minors are earning and spending money on these platforms, and the potential dangers that can create.

TikTokers regularly earn and spend money through TikTok Live: Those watching the broadcasts can use real money to purchase TikTok coins, which can then be used to buy and send digital TikTok gifts directly to those hosting livestreams, who can redeem them for actual cash.

TikTok policies state that users must be 18 or older to go live, and that those under 16 are blocked from hosting livestreams altogether. But like every major social media platform, TikTok has struggled to verify the ages of its users, making it easy for them to gain access and freely use Live and its monetization features. Forbes reporting has brought to light the ways they have been misused to lure young girls into performing suggestive, and potentially illegal, acts for adult men on TikTok Live -- one of the key issues highlighted in the D.C. attorney general's complaint.

""The company knows that Live is unsafe, exploiting children financially and sexually,"" the filing says. ""Operating in part like a virtual strip club, Live provides young streamers with a performance stage, and allows other users to entice streamers into sexual acts in exchange for virtual money.""

In one TikTok Live detailed in the Forbes investigation, a 14-year-old in a bralette fielded requests from strangers on a 2,000-person broadcast, some offering ""$35 for a flash,"" asking to see her feet and telling her they'd send money to her Cash App. ""You're paying my bills,"" the young girl told viewers.

In another, a teen slowly cut off her shirt with a pair of scissors as an audience of 3,000 egged her on. ""IF U DO THE BLACK PART IM GONNA SEND TIKTOK LIVE 35.000 TIKTOK COINS (400$),"" one commenter wrote, urging her to snip her bra. On other TikTok streams, often filmed from girls' bedrooms and bathrooms, they were offered financial rewards if they'd kiss each other or spread their legs for the camera.

The D.C. filing describes TikTok's ""virtual economy"" as ""similar to a casino that facilitates the exchange of money for poker chips."" It says that the fact that TikTok gifts -- which include hearts, ice cream cones and lollipops -- look like ""plush toys"" and ""cute, colorful animated emojis reminiscent of cartoons and Disney characters,"" they distract children and parents from how much money is being exchanged and the reality of what may be going on (a tactic it calls ""currency confusion"").

""Despite TikTok's representations, it has knowingly created a system on Live that allows youth who view live streams to be taken advantage of financially and youth who live stream themselves to be sexually exploited by adults on the platform,"" the complaint says.

It also alleges that despite TikTok offering a mechanism for people to send money to each other and facilitating ""billions of dollars in transactions,"" it is not licensed to do so, as is required by district and federal laws. It argues TikTok should be registered with the district's Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking, and the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which work to ensure that payment platforms are adequately protecting users from illegal activity like sexual exploitation, drug trafficking and money laundering.

""By not registering as a money transmitter, TikTok not only masks criminal activity on the app from regulators, but also tricks its most vulnerable and unsuspecting users into using its platform for monetary transactions without sufficient safeguards,"" the complaint says. ""At no time has TikTok clearly told users -- many of whom TikTok knows are children -- that TikTok Live is littered with known criminals and that TikTok knows users are at heightened risk of fraud and other financial crimes.""

TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
Capital One BrandVoice: Making Your Data AI-Ready,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/capitalone/2024/10/08/making-your-data-ai-ready/,2024-10-08T14:07:39Z,"Every technology-enabled organization today understands the need to be able to harness AI. But many are still working to figure out how to approach a critical component of their AI strategy - data.

At Capital One, we've leveraged data to drive strategic decisions since our founding. As technology has advanced, we have evolved our data ecosystem. We went all in on the public cloud so we'd have the right foundation in place to continue to use data, analytics, and machine learning to unlock insights, make critical decisions, and create value for our millions of customers and the business. Our investments in technology and data infrastructure, our deep bench of in-house engineering, product, and science talent which deeply understand our business and how data powers it, and our expertise in machine learning have set us up to be at the forefront of enterprises leveraging AI.

In my role as Chief Data Officer at Capital One, I ensure engineers and analysts across our company are able to leverage trustworthy data to power the business, including fueling AI use cases. As we've progressed on our data journey, I've formed several principles which I believe could be helpful for any organization that needs to get ready for AI.

No organization will be truly ready for AI at scale until there is demand for data from across the business - and that demand ultimately stems from culture. The essence of a data-driven culture is when everyone looks to data for insights that inform decision making and new ideas. Establishing a truly data-driven culture means using data as a truth-seeking tool. Often that means discovering new insights that one didn't initially set out to find and using those to shift the direction of the business strategy. Leaders need to model and reward being data-driven.

Data is the lifeblood that enables and powers AI models. AI can best differentiate a company when the data is plentiful and hyper-specific to the business and its customers. This requires making a broad and deep collection of data from across the organization's ecosystem available for use. Hard as that is for many organizations to make happen, it's not enough: the data also needs to be high-quality and trustworthy. This requires data to be error-free, clearly described and inventoried, and only kept and used where permitted.

The more complex the data a company has, the more important it is to manage it consistently and in one place. For data-driven companies to get the most out of their data, users with appropriate authorization should be able to easily find and use data from across the organization. And to ensure that the growing volume of data is high-quality and trusted, central platforms enable companies to embed automation of data management within the platforms so that they can operate with governance by design at scale.

AI is becoming increasingly multi-modal, meaning it is able to integrate multiple types of data, like image, sound, and text, along with more traditional structured, numerical data to train more powerful models. To make the most of these advances, organizations need to be able to store and process data across a range of formats - including those often referred to as unstructured data. To prepare unstructured data for AI, video, image, text, and audio files may need to be labeled, registered, turned into a different structured format, scrubbed for sensitive data, and stored for human review and further processing. Doing this with massive quantities of different types of data will take a new set of tools and approaches that organizations need to build or buy as they seek to make the most of more sophisticated AI models.

Just as AI is powered by data, creating a data-driven culture and modern data ecosystem is powered by great talent. Building all the components above will take strong product managers, engineers, data scientists, analysts, designers, and risk managers to name a few. The people who excel in a domain like data are those who are intellectually curious, thrive when solving complex problems, seek out opportunities to experiment and learn, and can influence others in the organization to change. With everything moving so fast in the data and AI space, people with these core competencies, arguably even more so than those with data expertise, will be best positioned to help companies chart the course in this evolving world.

Taken together, these five principles are the fundamental building blocks to creating a strong data ecosystem and culture that enable organizations to take full advantage of AI. Each organization needs to account for their bespoke needs and nuances in their data strategy as well, factoring in things like risk appetite, data availability, and their use cases.

Getting data ready to fuel AI and drive real business outcomes isn't a destination; it's a way of life that will evolve over time. When that way of life permeates the entire organization, it will be leveraging the power of AI wherever it can add meaningful value. Moving to and sustaining that way of life requires ongoing investment and commitment from across the organization and especially its most senior leaders."
Northern Lights Forecast: Aurora Borealis Could Be Visible In These States Tonight,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/08/northern-lights-forecast-aurora-borealis-could-be-visible-in-these-states-tonight/,2024-10-08T14:07:36Z,"The northern lights could be visible from several states on Tuesday night as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric predicts continued minor to moderate geomagnetic storm conditions, days after the sun produced some of the strongest solar flares in years.

States included in the northern lights' potential view line include Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, according to the NOAA. The chance for an aurora borealis sighting in most of these states are low, though Alaskans will have the best shot at seeing the lights. The upper edges of Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota also have a slightly better chance of a sighting.

The lights are best seen between about 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. local time, according to the NOAA. The NOAA recommends traveling as far north as possible, finding a high vantage point and avoiding light pollution.

Northern lights can be photographed with a smartphone, and the best bet is to avoid using flash and use night mode, which is available on newer iPhone models.

Geomagnetic activity has been exceeding scientists' predictions during Solar Cycle 25, the current cycle of activity the sun experiences every 11 years. Because of the increased number of solar flares and geomagnetic storms, the northern lights have been frequently visible, and NASA predicts solar activity will peak sometime in 2025."
Reese Witherspoon Pays It Forward With Annual Shine Away Conference,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenalvarez/2024/10/08/reese-witherspoon-pays-it-forward-with-annual-shine-away-conference/,2024-10-08T14:06:49Z,"While many Angelenos were basking in the calmness of their Saturday morning, purposeful women from various disciplines congregated to Hollywood to attend Hello Sunshine's second annual Shine Away conference -- a two-day event aimed at bringing women together to connect, network and collaborate with each other.

On Saturday (October 5th), approximately 700 attendees were welcomed to the event by Reese Witherspoon, who owns the media company that produced the affair alongside the lead sponsor AT&T. Taking place at Nya Studios, the warm greeting kicked off two days of programming, activations, workshops, wellness moments and panels from notable leaders and their brands.

Following the founder and actress' opening remarks, she sat down with Octavia Spencer and Laura Dern for an initial powerful conversation. Moderated by AT&T's Chief Marketing Officer Kellyn Kenny, the prolific actresses described how their personal relationships with each other ultimately fuel their creative projects -- for the better.

The panel covered many topics, including lessons learned in life -- both professionally and personally -- as well as how they hope to continue elevating women narratives. Here are all the takeaways from Saturday's panel.

It's apparent Witherspoon is genuine with her efforts. In her opening speech, she almost came to tears while telling a heartfelt story about how sunflowers move in relation to the sun for nourishment -- ultimately utilizing the anecdote as a metaphor to make the point that there's enough nourishment (and room) in the world for everyone to shine with success.

Her authenticity, relatability and vulnerability definitely separates her from what is the status quo in Hollywood. That day, her delivery made it very clear that she genuinely wants to elevate women and BIPOC visionaries in film and television.

Alongside the other Hollywood panelists, the Sweet Home Alabama star cites that Jennifer Aniston, Nicole Kidman and Kerry Washington are also other cherished members of her community that she relies on to progress women storytelling.

Witherspoon started her own production company at 32 years old, yet admitted that she didn't always have a sustainable business plan until she brought on CEO Sarah Harden, who eventually hired execs and built an infrastructure for the company.

She confessed to having an ""aha"" moment when her accountant presented a harsh truth, saying:

""I had a moment right after Big Little Lies. I had self-funded my first company and I thought... okay, well, Big Little Lies won all these Emmys and Wild and Gone Girl got all these Oscar nominations and we made $600 million at the box office. I had four employees and I couldn't keep the lights on. I remember the accountant calling me, going, 'You didn't make enough money producing those three things to keep four employees.' So I was like, 'I'm doing something wrong.' And that's when I had this 'aha' moment. I was like, I need to have help. I don't have a business plan.""

She candidly continued, ""I think it was an important moment for me to realize that there's things that I didn't know and I had to reach out for help... It's also good to know what you're not good at.""

Laura Dern, who was alongside Witherspoon and Spencer for the panel, admitted that she had an ""aha"" moment herself the night before the conference. Her 19-year-old daughter had just ended a business call when the Palm Royale star asked her a frank question: ""What are your goals?""

""Well, of course, acting, writing and directing and producing stories... but also, I'm an activist. I want to go to law school. I'm interested in making documentary films,"" her daughter replied.

Dern went on to say that she was embarrassed for thinking her daughter should ""pick a lane"" until she had an almost instant revelation. ""Because of all of you sunflowers, I went, 'Wait a second. She's going to feel the sun everywhere and she's gonna be expanded because of all of you,'"" Dern disclosed. ""She's going to be a businesswoman and a leader and a mom and take care of herself and go to pilates, even when it hurts. I really want to thank you [all] for teaching me what we're entitled to in our voice and our ownership of self.""

Octavia Spencer first teased her movie adaptation of the novel First Lie Wins, which is also featured in Reese's Book Club, saying, ""What I will say is that it's propulsive. It's a thriller and it's sexy.""

The Academy Award winner avoided spoiling any storylines for the audience, but she did reveal that the stories she hopes to continue making have no boundaries.

""I want to continue to tell stories in all genres, [on] marginalized people, people who don't actually necessarily have a voice. I'm on the board of AFI and I also contribute to the Sundance Institute. My company meets with people fresh out of college who get an agent. We are constantly looking for the emerging voices,"" Spencer states. ""So, I just want to continue to tell stories and hopefully inspire. I don't care how we get there... if it's a horror story, it's inspiring (laughs). It's show business, but it's also an art form. I want to be able to continue to do things in all genres, but present opportunities for not just myself, but for for as many people as I can bring along with me.""

Kellyn Kenny couldn't rave enough about collaborating with Hello Sunshine on Shine Away and only hopes that their partnership makes the event ""bigger and better"" in years to come.

""I like to think it's been inspiring on both ends... them feeling really energized about the power of connection and the power of networking. And us, being just so on board with Reese's mission: Female empowerment. When you think about entering into business partnerships, it's not all the time that they have the opportunity to be as creative as we've made it to be here and where you can draw such inspiration from both the attendees and also the panels,"" the executive exclusively said. ""Hello Sunshine and A&T have kept the attendee in mind first. Everything that we've done is trying to curate an experience that really resonates with the people who are taking huge amounts of time out of their day.""

Other notable panelists in attendance throughout the weekend included Heather McMahan, Alex Morgan, Candace Parker, Diana Flores, Olivia Munn and Naomi Watts."
"More than a dozen states sue TikTok, alleging it harms kids and is designed to addict them",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/g-s1-26823/states-sue-tiktok-child-safety-mental-health,2024-10-08T14:05:30Z,"More than a dozen states, led by California and New York, are suing TikTok for allegedly duping the public about the safety of the popular video app, claiming it was deliberately designed to keep young people hooked on the service.

The lawsuits, filed separately on Tuesday in 13 states and the District of Columbia, argue TikTok has violated consumer protection laws and contributed to a teen mental health crisis.

The bipartisan group of attorneys general is seeking to force TikTok to change product features that they argue are manipulative and harm teens. The suits are also asking courts to impose financial penalties on the company.

It is the latest headache for TikTok, which is trying to fend off a U.S. ban of the app slated to start Jan. 19, unless the company severs ties with ByteDance, its China-based parent company.

Used by half of America, TikTok will now be defending itself against a barrage of state lawsuits that tap into growing national unease with the design of social media platforms and questions over whether the over-use of social media contributes to mental health problems like depression and body issues.

While pinpointing the exact role social media plays in worsening mental health issues is complicated, the state authorities claim TikTok is prioritizing the company's growth and profits over child safety.

""TikTok intentionally targets children because they know kids do not yet have the defenses or capacity to create healthy boundaries around addictive content,"" said California Attorney General Rob Bonta in a statement. ""TikTok must be held accountable for the harms it created in taking away the time -- and childhoods -- of American children.""

Last year, a coalition of states filed a similar lawsuit against Instagram and Facebook owner Meta, accusing the tech giant of failing to keep children safe on the popular apps. Those cases are still pending.

TikTok, like most social media apps, tries to keep users as engaged as possible. But the attorneys general say features like its hyper-personalized algorithm, the ability to scroll endlessly and the app's use of push notifications encourage excessive use that can lead to emotional and behavioral changes. The states say the company has downplayed the negative effects of the alleged dependence the app creates in an effort to boost its bottom line.

The lawsuits also target TikTok's use of beauty filters, which can let users appear thinner and younger, or apply virtual makeup to a face using AI.

""Beauty filters have been especially harmful to young girls,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James wrote in a statement. ""Beauty filters can cause body image issues and encourage eating disorders, body dysmorphia, and other health-related problems.""

New York investigators argue TikTok failed to warn teens about these harms, and instead pushed beauty filters to its youngest users to keep them on the app longer.

Adolescents are left with growing feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt after using TikTok, the state attorneys say.

The District of Columbia's suit alleges that TikTok traps teens in online bubbles that ""bombard them with precisely the kinds of content that TikTok claims not to allow, including videos about weight-loss, body-image, and self-harm content.""

TikTok's live-streaming feature is also abused, the state attorneys allege. In particular, they contend that thousands of underage users have hosted live-streamed videos where users can pay to send the streamer money in the form of TikTok ""gifts,"" a type of digital currency. This has been used to incentivize the sexual exploitation of children, according to the lawsuits.

A TikTok spokesman declined to comment before fully reviewing the litigation.

The suits will now proceed in 14 separate state courts. State officials say the cases will not be merged, since each complaint relies on specific state consumer protection laws. Individual trial dates will eventually be set months or years from now, unless the cases are dismissed, or settlements are reached.

In response to concerns, many social media apps, including TikTok, have beefed up child safety tools.

Last month, Meta announced a host of new features that enhance parental supervision on Instagram and made all teen accounts private in an effort to shield young people from interacting with potential predators.

Likewise, young TikTok users cannot send direct messages and their accounts are set to private by default to limit their exposure to people they do not know. The app also uses screen-time reminders to nudge users about how long they have been scrolling.

Yet in their suits, the states dismiss TikTok's safety measures as meaningless public relations stunts, arguing that the company has done a lackluster job of verifying users' identities when opening accounts, allowing adolescents to lie about their age and circumvent child safety measures.

Bonta, the California attorney general, wrote in a statement that TikTok's features to protect children ""do not work as advertised.""

""The harmful effects of the platform are far greater than acknowledged,"" he continued, ""and TikTok does not prioritize safety over profit.""

In addition to New York, California and the District of Columbia, the states suing TikTok include Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont and Washington."
Meet The World's Best Employers 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelpeachman/2024/10/08/meet-the-worlds-best-employers-2024/,2024-10-08T13:59:19Z,"The feeling of family at Bacardi Limited is palpable for employees -- who, fittingly, are all called ""primos"" (which means cousins in Spanish), says Scott Northcutt, the company's senior vice president of global human resources. ""There is something so special about being part of a company that has been family-owned for seven generations,"" Northcutt says. ""The Bacardi name on each bottle isn't just a brand name; it's a family's name and that makes it personal.""

That personal connection is evident not only in how Bacardi -- founded in Cuba -- preserves its family legacy, but also in how the spirits company takes care of its primos around the world, offering a slew of wellness and mental health benefits, including workout programs, mindfulness training and a service that provides confidential emotional support -- available 24/7 to employees and immediate family.

Bacardi also invests in the career development of its staff. ""We are committed to creating a robust pipeline of future leaders from within the company with custom programs at Harvard Business School, University of Miami, and other institutions across the globe,"" says Northcutt. Primos can also take advantage of talent development opportunities right where they are with workshops that help define personal purpose and 10-year career plans. No doubt all of this -- along with company mixology classes, of course -- helped Bacardi land the No. 79 spot on our list of the World's Best Employers 2024.

To determine this eighth annual ranking, Forbes partnered with market research firm Statista to survey more than 300,000 employees in over 50 countries who work for multinational corporations that employ more than 1,000 workers and operate in at least two of the six continental regions of the world (Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, North America and Oceania). Respondents were asked whether they would recommend their company to family or friends, and to rate it on such criteria as salary, talent development and remote work options. Participants could also rate companies they knew through their own industry knowledge and through friends and family who worked there.

Survey responses were analyzed and tallied -- along with data from the previous three years -- with a heavier weight put on the more recent data and on the evaluations from current employees. While the number of honorees per country varied based on the population and qualifying companies in each area, 850 companies, spanning 48 countries, earned a spot on our list.

This year, the top 10 spots were populated by familiar contenders, but for the first time, Microsoft ranked at No. 1, after landing between No. 2 and No. 4 on every prior annual ranking. Coming in at No. 2 was Alphabet (aka Google), which has ranked within the top eight (often earning the No. 1 spot) in all prior seven years. The No. 3 spot went to Samsung Electronics, which has nabbed No. 1 for the past four years.

The industries that dominated this year's list were similar to those from last year: banking and financial services (with companies such as Seoul-based KB Financial Group at No. 11); construction, chemicals, and raw materials (such as Japan-based Osaka Gas at No. 25); and engineering and manufacturing (including Munich-based Siemens and Volvo Group in Gothenburg, Sweden, at No. 32 and 33 respectively).

Regardless of the sectors they inhabit, however, many of the list's high-ranking employers share one thing in common: providing employees with opportunities to upskill and advance in their careers, particularly in regard to the ever-accelerating pace of technological advancements. For example, Kathleen Hogan, Microsoft's chief people officer, says that nurturing employee growth is central to keeping staffers ""energized and empowered to do meaningful work."" This is why, she adds, ""ten years ago we intentionally made a commitment to shift our culture from being 'know-it-alls' to 'learn-it-all,'"" which has fostered an environment where employees can take risks and learn from mistakes. Microsoft also offers hundreds of online and in-person technical, management and professional development classes that enable employees to expand their knowledge and skills as their career progresses.

Likewise, Samsung provides multiple avenues for employees to learn, including through professional development programs. The company's own dynamic training platform, called the University of Samsung or the ""UniverSE,"" consists of 12 schools under three academies, and offers a variety of courses on topics ranging from functional skills to leadership. The training is available to employees around the world, including part-time and contract workers.

As KH Na, chief human resources officer at Samsung Electronics, notes, investing in employees is paramount. ""As much as it is important to make technological innovations, it is equally crucial to build a better workplace, as these are mutually reinforcing objectives,"" he says. ""These efforts are based on one of Samsung's core values, which states that ""a company is its people.""

The Ladies Of The Association Of Pickleball Players Shine In Columbus At Inaugural Women's Open,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddboss/2024/10/08/the-ladies-of-the-association-of-pickleball-players-shine-in-columbus-at-inaugural-womens-open/,2024-10-08T13:59:11Z,"This past weekend, the Association of Pickleball Players (APP) hosted a first of its kind event, the latest in its series of signature events called the Women's Open, presented by the James. Hosted at the Pickle & Chill facility in Columbus, Ohio, it brought together 250 ladies (both amateurs and pros) for a weekend celebrating women's players in pickleball.

Click here for the PickleballBrackets.com home page for the event, where you can get tournament details, draw sheets, and results.

The ladies singles draw started with a slew of household APP names, including Fudge, Jardim, Barr, and Hendry. All of them fell early as the injury bug hit took out both #1 Fudge and #3 Jardim in the round of 16. Tour regulars Susannah Barr and Amanda Hendry both fell in quarters to #12 Domenika Turkovic and #10 Shannon Pretorius respectively.

Both Turkovic (a Croatian-born tennis standout at Arizona State) and Pretorius (who graduated from Arkansas State and currently works in video production in the Cleveland area) advanced to the final, topping #16 Erika Oku and #19 Alla Mikhno respectively, to guarantee a brand new singles winner on tour. In the final, Pretorius survived a three-game grind, winning 6,(14),10. Mikhno won the bronze medal match to form an all-1st time medal winning trio.

Fudge may have retired in singles, but she wasn't to be stopped in doubles. Pairing with Jill Braverman, the pair cruised into the final as the #1 seed, topping #5 Eugenio & Lopez in the semis 5,1. #3 Allison Harris & Daria Walczak surprised the #2 seeds Susannah Barr & Arielle Butler in the bottom semi to setup a #1 vs #3 final.

In the final, Fudge & Braverman cruised to the title, winning 9,4. It is their second APP pro doubles title in 2024 together.

Gold: Fudge & Braverman. Silver: Harris & Walczak. Bronze: Barr & Butler.

One of the fun events that tournaments like the US Open and USAP Nationals hold is the pro split-age competition, where a ""junior"" pro (younger than 50) and a ""senior"" pro (older than 50) team up and compete. These events usually favor those teams that can nab a newly-minted senior pro, but a strong younger pro can also carry a solid senior.

To no surprise, all four senior ladies who featured in the split-age semis are currently ranked in the top 10 on the APP's Champions tour for Senior Women's Doubles. Current senior #1 pro Lee Whitwell paired with Amanda Hendry for this event but were ousted by current #9 senior pro Sheri Courter and current #2 main pro Susannah Barr in one semi. Meanwhile, the juggernaut #1 seeds of Megan Fudge (#1 APP main pro ranking) and Angela Simon (current #2 senior pro) took out Anna Shirley (#6 on the Senior circuit) and Jill Braverman (#8 on the APP in limited 2024 action) in the other semi.

In the final, Barr & Courter upset the Fudge & Simon pairing for the title.

Gold: Barr & Courter. Silver: Fudge & Simon. Bronze: Whitwell & Hendry

Trump picks an odd time to ignore the GOP's antisemitism problem,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-picks-odd-time-ignore-gops-antisemitism-problem-rcna174455,2024-10-08T13:57:55Z,"The presidential candidate wasn't just wrong to pretend the Republican Party doesn't have an antisemitism problem. He also had incredibly bad timing.

Like many prominent political figures, Donald Trump recognized the anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel. What was notable, however, was the Trumpian way in which he honored the day. The New York Times reported:

""The anti-Jewish hatred has returned even here in America, in our streets, our media and our college campuses and within the ranks of the Democrat [sic] Party in particular, not in the Republican Party, I will tell you,"" the former president said at an event held at one of his resorts.

Trump added: ""The Republican Party has not been infected by this horrible disease. And hopefully it won't be. It won't be as long as I'm in charge, I can tell you that.""

The rhetoric was obviously ugly and false, but it was also poorly timed.

As Trump pretended that the GOP doesn't have an antisemitism problem, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia continued to insist, over and over again, that ""they"" have a secret ability to ""control the weather"" -- and as my MSNBC colleague Ja'han Jones explained, ""Greene didn't specify whether 'they' are Jewish in this weather control scenario, but such claims about people nefariously controlling the weather have documented links to antisemitic conspiracy theories.""

A few days earlier, Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee thought it'd be a good idea to condemn George Soros as a ""money changer of the worst kind.""

It came against a backdrop in which the public learned that North Carolina's Republican gubernatorial candidate, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, allegedly described himself as a ""Nazi"" and praised Adolf Hitler's ""Mein Kampf.""

Let's not forget far-right media personality Tucker Carlson, who received a prominent speaking slot at the Republican National Convention, who recently interviewed and praised a Holocaust revisionist, and who nevertheless remains close with the party's presidential ticket.

And then, of course, there's Trump himself, who, just a few weeks ago, publicly suggested that he intends to blame Jews, at least in part, if he loses the 2024 race. A month earlier, after seeing Gov. Josh Shapiro's remarks at the Democratic National Convention, the former president decided to take a rhetorical shot at his critic. The Pennsylvania Democrat, the former president wrote online, is a ""highly overrated Jewish Governor.""

In context, there was no reason for the Republican to reference Shapiro's faith. Trump did it anyway.

It was not an isolated incident. As regular readers might recall, it was earlier this year when Trump also invoked a familiar dual loyalty trope by claiming that Jewish voters who support Democrats hate Israel.

It was part of a larger pattern. During his 2016 campaign, for example, Trump spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition and said, ""You're not gonna support me because I don't want your money. You want to control your politicians."" He added, ""I'm a negotiator -- like you folks.""

Several months later, in the run-up to Election Day 2016, the Republican promoted antisemitic imagery through social media. In the closing days of the campaign, Trump again faced accusations of antisemitism, claiming Hillary Clinton met ""in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.""

While in office, the then-president used some highly provocative rhetoric about Jews and what he expected about their ""loyalties."" Trump also spoke at the Israeli American Council's national summit, where he suggested Jewish people are primarily focused on wealth, which is why he expected them to support his re-election campaign.

There was also his ugly reaction to a racist event in Charlottesville in 2017, in response to torch-wielding bigots chanting, ""Jews will not replace us.""

After his defeat, Trump kept this going, whining that Jewish voters ""don't love Israel enough,"" dining with prominent antisemites at Mar-a-Lago, and arguing that Jews need to ""get their act together"" and ""appreciate"" Israel ""before it is too late.""

In late 2022, the former president went so far as to declare that Jewish leaders ""should be ashamed of themselves"" over their ""lack of loyalty."" Around the same time, he added to the list, using related rhetoric about Jews with a documentary filmmaker.

And yet, there was Trump on the anniversary of Oct. 7, boasting that he'll ensure that his party isn't ""infected"" by antisemitism. What a relief that must be to the Jewish community."
Brokerage Firm Refugee Says Tax Optimization Is Key To Managing $3 Billion,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2024/10/08/brokerage-firm-refugee-says-tax-optimization-is-key-to-managing-3-billion/,2024-10-08T13:52:00Z,"Background: Rich Mullen grew up in the Farmington Valley area of Connecticut, and graduated from University of Arizona in 1988. He planned to go to law school but after a chance meeting with an old friend working at Lehman Brothers Mullen decided to become a broker, starting at Prudential in 1993 and eventually met one of his current managing partners, Charles Evangelakos. They left to Morgan Stanley in 1999, where they met Pallas' other managing partner, Greg Boyle, before the three moved to UBS in 2011. Eight years later, they went independent and founded Pallas. Today the firm numbers 33 employees across four different states, servicing roughly 400 clients in total.

Investment Philosophy/Strategy: Mullen and his team focus on what they call tax-optimized wealth management: They stay ahead of the curve on constantly changing tax laws. ""Through proper planning you can achieve a return on your assets "" says Mullen.

""We also look for private credit to fill those fixed income needs as it is a good diversifier and provider of income,"" says Mullen. ""We see a tremendous amount of alpha in private markets."" His team uses a family office-type approach to investing in alternatives, leveraging a network of existing relationships to offer clients more bespoke opportunities like investing in GP Stake Funds or professional sports teams.

Investment Outlook: Mullen and his team are more dovish than most when it comes to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, predicting another 50 basis point rate cut before the end of the year. ""The trend right now is for the Fed to get in front of this and these cuts will allow for a soft landing,"" says Mullen, adding, ""but that also means we're probably going to have below average economic growth in 2025."" He sees the S&P 500 -- absent any sort of major geopolitical event -- posting a high single-digit return next year. Mullen also likes the bond market as a good source of income during a downward trending interest rate environment. ""The reduction in rates should make it easier for companies to finance acquisitions, which should see M&A activity pickup, especially with so much cash that has been sitting on the sidelines finally coming into play,"" says Mullen. ""Real estate has taken a hit, but easing rates are also likely to spur increased demand for construction.""

Best Advice: ""Many affluent individuals focus solely on investment returns without considering how taxes will impact their overall wealth,"" says Mullen. By integrating tax optimization, as well as other aspects like estate planning, it is possible to significantly increase returns. ""We don't react to market changes, we anticipate them by integrating all of these different planning aspects,"" he says. ""Keep an eye on long term goals rather than short term market movements.""

Off The Clock: Outside of work, Mullen loves to be out on the water. He lives on the ocean near the South Shore of Boston, so he often goes out on a boat with friends or family -- whether it's for Tuna fishing or just to spot whales. ""It never gets old seeing the unbelievable marine wildlife,"" he says."
"Trump, Vance and Musk push lies about immigration app CBP One",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/cbp-one-app-trump-vance-musk-rcna174400,2024-10-08T13:51:49Z,"Donald Trump, JD Vance and Elon Musk have spread lies about the U.S. Customs and Border Protection app. Here are the facts.

Donald Trump and the Republican Party are spreading lies about a mobile app used to assist migrants -- and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection -- with the asylum process.

The latest lies align with the Trump campaign's racist fearmongering about migrants weeks out from the election.

During his debate against Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz last week, Trump's running mate, JD Vance, made the following absurd claim:

Trump made a similar claim in Wisconsin last week:

Trump has referred to the CBP One app as ""the Kamala phone app for smuggling illegals,"" but the app was actually launched during his administration. And tech billionaire Elon Musk, who is no stranger to peddling conspiracy theories, claimed last week that ""it takes less than 5 minutes and zero documentation to get approved"" for entry into the United States using the CBP One app.

All of these assertions are flat-out lies. As The Verge explained, the true nature of the app is almost the polar opposite of what Trump and Vance have claimed. The outlet reported:

In other words, the suggestion that the CBP One app is aiding migrants' unfettered entry into the U.S. would be a surprise to the hundreds of thousands of migrants who've used the app. In reality, many migrants have complained about glitches and other malfunctions on the app that have caused delays in the asylum-seeking process. Migrant rights activists have denounced the app's collection of biometric data belonging to the migrants who use it. And Haitian and African migrants, whom Trump and Vance have demonized, have claimed the app's facial recognition software has impeded their immigration process because of its failures to detect darker skin tones.

In the name of stoking anti-immigrant invective, Trump and Vance are filling the MAGA trough with putrid lies and telling their followers to eat up."
Why This Private Equity Investor Is Thriving In His Second Act As $3 Billion Financial Advisor,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2024/10/08/why-this-private-equity-investor-is-thriving-in-his-second-act-as-3-billion-financial-advisor/,2024-10-08T13:51:42Z,"Background: A native of upstate New York, Brian Gorczynski studied finance at Boston College then got masters in business from Harvard in 1999. Before becoming a financial advisor, he spent over 25 years as a private equity investor, with stints as a partner at Veritas Capital and as co-head of BAML Capital Partners, which was owned by Bank of America. He joined Transcend in 2021, two years after it was founded by a group of partners including Duncan Nierderauer, the former CEO of the New York Stock Exchange. Serving just over 1,000 clients in total, Transcend has over 40 employees with offices in New Jersey, Michigan and Florida.

Building Relationships: One way that Transcend has gone the extra mile with clients is through its sponsorship of top junior and amateur golfers under the age of 20. Several years ago, one of the firm's clients called up and said he was struggling to pay for his son's golf tournaments, with lodging and travel fees costing up to $5,000 per week. The firm stepped in to help out, and what started as a philanthropic initiative has now become a bigger operation -- not to mention a big hit with clients, who love to cheer on the kids, says Gorczynski. Thanks to the Supreme Court's 2021 decision to allow student-athletes to sell rights to their name, image and likeness (NIL) for marketing purposes, Transcend is able to throw its financial support behind these athletes; In return, the players will wear the firm's logo at official events and can be used in its marketing materials. So far, Transcend has sponsored seven different top-ranked junior and amateur golfers, one of whom has already turned professional.

Competitive Edge: Gorczynski cites the breadth and depth of the investment backgrounds of Transcend's partners as a big differentiator, as it allows the firm to bring clients uniquely sourced opportunities (mainly private and alternative investments) from their existing networks. ""In most of the private investments we have sourced, we are either the only 'retail' wealth management firm in the world, or one of a select few, with access to the investment opportunity,"" adds Gorczynski. ""Oftentimes, we are able to negotiate enhanced economics or significant fee discounts on behalf of our clients.""

Investment Philosophy/Strategy: Many clients have significant exposure to alternative investments: ""It's non-correlated to equity markets and adding returns for clients,"" says Jacob Grossman, who had stints at Citadel and Glenview Capital before his current role of chairing the firm's investment committee. Beyond private credit, private equity and real estate, one such area within alternatives where the team is able to leverage their network is in reinsurance, especially in catastrophic weather insurance. ""We try to skate more quickly to where the puck is than others and because we are early we are usually able to negotiate advantageous terms for our clients that add to returns,"" says Grossman.

Investment Outlook: ""We would guess we are probably due for some below average return years,"" says Grossman, adding that current S&P 500 valuations -- at 23x forward earnings -- are not attractive. ""With so many different asset classes today, anyone who just relies on public markets is really doing themselves a disservice,"" says Gorczynski. ""Most companies in this country are private, so why would you limit yourself?""

Best Advice: ""So many clients are allocated to 60/40 portfolios, yet the most sophisticated family offices, endowments and foundations in the world have 20-30%, sometimes more, of their portfolios allocated to alternative investments,"" says Gorczynski. ""These investors don't settle for 60/40 portfolios, so why should individual investors?"""
Methodology: America's Top RIA Firms 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rjshook/2024/10/08/methodology-americas-top-ria-firms-2024/,2024-10-08T13:51:40Z,"Clearly more and more families are entrusting independent advisors to manage their assets. But how does one choose between countless firms? It's one thing to choose an advisor who works for a global brand, like a major bank. But how does one begin to choose amid thousands of independent firms?

SHOOK is here to help. As the world's only advisor research firm in the world with a specialty in quality, SHOOK performs deep due diligence as the basis for its rankings.

Disclosure: SHOOK is completely independent and objective, and does not receive compensation in exchange for placement on its rankings.

What Qualities Does SHOOK Look For?

To start, every ranking of independent advisors we've seen focus on size -- total assets under management, headcount, etc. But that's like recommending a major bank -- how does recommending an entire firm help anyone looking for a single trusted advisor?

For bigger firms, SHOOK focuses on individuals or teams. But for individuals looking for an independent advisor, SHOOK's focus on quality skews its recommendations towards firms in which we can thoroughly understand how each client is actually treated. In doing so, we measure aspects like processes that are inherent in each client relationship, what is the team's purpose, and what is the underlying culture that we see throughout all levels of employees.

When we meet with these independent firms, we take a close look at leadership and the senior principals since they tend to dictate every client's experience. When we meet with a firm or an advisor for a due diligence meeting, we are always thinking to ourselves, ""Would we recommend this firm (or individual) to a friend or family member?"" Quality is always first; if we're going to include a firm (or advisor) on our rankings, we have to make sure everyone is of the highest quality.

The Forbes ranking of America's Top RIA Firms, developed by SHOOK Research, is based on an algorithm of qualitative criteria, mostly gained through telephone, virtual and in-person due diligence interviews, and quantitative data. The algorithm weighs factors like revenue trends, assets under management, compliance records, industry experience and those that encompass best practices and approach to working with clients. Portfolio performance is not a criterion due to varying client objectives and lack of audited data. Neither Forbes nor SHOOK receive a fee in exchange for rankings.

(For the full list and more, visit www.forbes.com/lists/top-ria-firms; advisors can complete a survey for upcoming rankings at www.SHOOKresearch.com.)

We don't want 300,000 nominations so we set thresholds to minimize the quantity we receive:

*Approximately 20% represent independent advisors.

The SHOOK Process

SHOOK scours the financial services industry for nominations. SHOOK accepts advisors who meet pre-determined minimum thresholds and acceptable compliance records. As of this date, SHOOK has received nearly 46,212 nominations -- advisors who meet SHOOK's thresholds. 25,103 of these nominees have taken an online survey.

Unlike other advisor rankings, SHOOK is not a ""robo-ranker"" -- numbers such as production and assets don't tell the whole story, especially when much of the data is self-reported. SHOOK Research creates rankings of role models -- firms that are leading the way in offering best practices and providing a high-quality experience for clients. A focus on both quantitative and qualitative factors, including telephone and in-person meetings, is imperative.

SHOOK Research is the only ranking firm that interviews firms and advisors via telephone and in person at the firm's location.

The following conditions will be considered in order to lessen weightings infractions:

Once an advisor's compliance rating falls into a tenable category, the following conditions must be met:

The algorithm is designed to fairly compare the business practices of a large group of firms based on quantitative and qualitative elements. Data are weighted to ensure priorities are given to dynamics such as preferred ""best practices,"" business models, recent business activity, etc. Each variable is graded and represents a certain value for each measured component. These data are fed into an algorithm that measures thousands of firms against each other.

SHOOK Disclosures

SHOOK is completely independent and objective and does not receive compensation from the advisors, Firms, the media, or any other source in exchange for placement on a ranking. SHOOK is funded through various sources, such as conferences and research partners. Since every investor has unique needs, investors must carefully choose the right advisor for their own situation and perform their own due diligence. SHOOK's research and rankings provide opinions for how to choose the right financial advisor and not indicative of future performance or representative of any one client's experience. Portfolio performance is not a criterion due to varying client objectives and lack of audited data. Remember, past performance is not an indication of future results."
This $1 Billion Michigan RIA Shuns Alternatives In Favor Of Dividend Stocks,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2024/10/08/this-1-billion-michigan-ria-shuns-alternatives-in-favor-of-dividend-stocks/,2024-10-08T13:51:33Z,"Background: Steinberg graduated from Michigan State University in 1984 with a degree in accounting and began his career specializing in tax preparation and planning at Deloitte. He went back to law school at the University of Michigan and then worked for a couple years as an estate-planning attorney for Honigman, Detroit's largest law firm. In 1993, he started as an advisor with many of his early clients being former colleagues from the law firm. Steinberg eventually started Blue Chip Partners in 2004 and brought on his longtime partner, Daniel Seder, a year later. Today the firm has 33 employees servicing roughly 800 clients.

Building Relationships: Blue Chip Partners has positioned itself to do the whole range of planning for clients -- from investments to taxes to estate planning -- all under one roof, with different subsidiaries of the business to help specialize in each segment. The firm also focuses on educating clients through a very active social media presence and even has its own podcast.

Competitive Edge: Steinberg says excellent employee hiring and retention as a pillar of the firm's success. Prospective hires all take the Caliper Profile assessment, a rigorous personality test designed to predict future job performance. This not only allows the team to hire from outside the business, but also to find 'team players' such as former college athletes, for instance, who understand the importance of working together or not winning every game of a match, says Steinberg.

Investment Philosophy/Strategy: Blue Chip uses an independent investment department of which the primary equity portfolio strategy is dividend growth. Instead of an ETF- or mutual fund-heavy model, the team's core approach to equities is investing in companies that have a track record of paying and growing dividends. ""Every time a company raises their dividend we will send clients an email... because clients own individual stocks in their portfolio they have higher risk tolerance,"" says Steinberg. ""These companies have a track record, so in down markets clients are still getting positive emails that they raised their dividend and that helps their confidence."" In terms of asset allocation, Blue Chip generally favors a 70/30 allocation of equities with the rest a mix cash and fixed income. ""We tend to be more plain vanilla on fixed income, with some ETFs and lower cost mutual funds,"" says Steinberg. ""Trying to get too smart with bonds just doesn't work -- that portion of a client's portfolio should be defensive."" When it comes to alternatives, the firm has very limited exposure: ""We have chosen to keep things simple from a client standpoint.""

Investment Outlook: ""Unless one party sweeps the election and gets rid of the filibuster, we're unlikely to see dramatic changes that will have an effect on the market,"" says Steinberg. He and his team remain optimistic about the direction of the economy as inflation is likely to continue to moderate, though they don't anticipate interest rates to come down too quickly. ""Personally, I was surprised they did 50 basis points,"" says Steinberg. ""I thought with the presidential election they would maybe be a bit more conservative.""

Best Advice: ""You're going to have snow storms, but snow melts and things will continue to do well,"" Steinberg often tells clients. He recalls early in his career, he once called up a client to congratulate him for his portfolio losing less than the market during a downturn: ""He told me, 'Never tell a client they're doing well when they are losing money.'"""
Ukrainian Culture Comes To American Audiences,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/katyasoldak/2024/10/08/ukrainian-culture-comes-to-american-audiences/,2024-10-08T13:51:20Z,"Ukrainian arts and culture are on tap to make a big splash in New York City this fall, coming to such iconic venues as Carnegie Hall and the New York City Center.

Once overshadowed and culturally appropriated by its imperial neighbor -- Russia -- Ukrainian music, art, ballet and cinema are now rightfully claiming their spot on the global map, reminding the world that there is a lot more to Ukraine and its people than the latest news from the frontlines.

Ukraine's cultural outreach this year largely comes in the framework of The Ukrainian Cultural Festival, which takes place from October 15th through October 31st in New York. ""The main idea is to show that Ukrainian culture exists, because if the culture exists, then the people exist, the nation exists,"" says Maria Genkin, a cultural advocate and member of the board of directors of Razom, a New York based human rights organization. ""The whole premise of the war that Russia has been waging on Ukraine is to deny Ukrainians the right of existence. We want to show American audiences that Ukrainians exist."" Genkin adds, that's why it's important to hear Ukrainian poetry, to hear music, to see ballet.

American audiences in 16 cities across the East Coast will get a chance to see the Ukrainian ballet, in the form of Kyiv's National Ballet of Ukraine, which is making its first visit to the U.S. in 30 years. The tour is ""much more than just a world-class ballet performance,"" said Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's Ambassador to the United States. ""It's also a symbol of the resilience and courage of the Ukrainian people, an opportunity to once again celebrate the rich and outstanding cultural heritage of Ukraine, and to share it with everyone, to share it with our friends.""

The month-long tour in the U.S. starts on October 8th, with performances at New York City Center on October 15 and 16th. The program features timeless classics, such as The Dying Swan, Don Quixote, and Giselle. The Ukrainian Shumka Dancers, from Canada, join the tour with their athletic choreography of Ukraine's traditional dance, The Hopak.

The Ukrainian Cultural festival is co-presented by Razom for Ukraine, the Ukrainian Institute in Kyiv, and produced in partnership with the National Ballet of Ukraine, Ukrainian Contemporary Music Festival, Yara Arts, Ukrainian Museum, KISFF, Linoleum Festival, and others.

For two weeks, New Yorkers will have a chance to experience a number of literary, cinema and art events, most of them tailored to English-speaking audiences, including Yara Arts Group's ""Slap!"" album launch at Bowery Poetry club, ""Water Drops on Burning Rocks"" art show by Rukh Art Hub at the Mriya art gallery in Tribeca, talks and discussions at the Harriman Institute at New York's Columbia University.

Ukrainian vocalists and composers have been entertaining international audiences for decades, such as the Ukrainian Chorus Dumka of New York. In New York, on October 13th Dumka Chorus marks its 75th Year of Musical Heritage with an anniversary concert at NYU Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at 3pm, at 566 LaGuardia Place. The Dumka chorus was established in 1949 as a male chorus by Ukrainians who escaped from the terror of the Kremlin regime, and it became a mixed chorus ten years later.

Although an amateur chorus, it has provided professional quality performances for decades at venues like Carnegie Hall, Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center in New York, the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. and others. It appeared as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live, in February 2022, singing ""Prayer for Ukraine"", and has performed under the artistic direction of Vasyl Hrechynsky from Lviv, Ukraine, for over three decades.

Young singers from the children's division Moloda Dumka, as well as a renowned Japanese violinist and composer Ikuko Kawai, Ukrainian pop singer Khrystyna Soloviy, and male vocal group Trioda will join the Dumka singers at their anniversary concert in New York. The fall season promises to be busy for Hreschynsky's Dumka -- the chorus is set to perform at Carnegie Hall later in October and at St. Patrick's cathedral for the annual concert to honor those lost during Russia's genocide of millions of Ukrainians through an artificial famine during the 1930s known as Holodomor.

A special performance by the Orchestra for Ukraine, conducted by Christoph Eschenbach, with artists from more than a dozen countries, will take place at Carnegie Hall on October 23rd.

The Concert for the Children and Youth of Ukraine -- a benefit to help Ukrainian children affected by Russia's war on Ukraine -- is organized in cooperation with the Permanent Mission of Ukraine to the United Nations, as well as the New York-based diplomatic institutions of numerous participating countries. Besides the Orchestra for Ukraine, the concert will feature world renowned musicians and composers, the Dumka chorus, the Oratorio Society of New York, and will be hosted by film director and actor Liev Schreiber, co-founder of the BlueCheck Ukraine foundation.

The Ukrainian Museum in the New York's East Village neighborhood has new exhibitions on a display. A show by Alexandra Exter, a Ukrainian avant-garde artist from the early 20th century, was opened by none other than Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, during his visit to the USA last month.

New York-based artist Molly Gochman presented ""UKR|RUS"" and ""Dispersed Geographies,"" two sculptural multi-sited, city-wide installations accompanied by community events - one of them hosted outside of the Ukrainian Museum on October 5th, with Ukrainian modern and traditional music, arts and crafts open for public participation. Right nearby, at the Ukrainian National Home, Ivan Bernatsky's Ukrainian Drama Theater performed an adaptation of Vasyl Stefanyk's novella ""Sons"", featuring Volodymyr Kurylo.

""It's important to remind Americans that the Ukrainian state is not a figment of their imaginations,"" Genkin of Razom said. ""It's very real. If there is music, if there is poetry, then there are people -- it's the most basic form of culture."""
From Small Town Kansas Advisor To Managing $86 Billion For Clients In Over 30 States,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2024/10/08/from-small-town-kansas-advisor-to-managing-86-billion-for-clients-in-over-30-states/,2024-10-08T13:51:08Z,"Background: Marty Bicknell grew up in a small town in southeastern Kansas called Pittsburg. Though he was at first studying pre-law while attending nearby Pittsburg State University, Bicknell landed an internship at a small, single practitioner Edward Jones location, where he fell in love with the business. After graduating in 1991, he moved to Kansas City and got a job with wirehouse A.G. Edwards, where he worked for more than 15 years. He founded Mariner in 2006 with seven other partners on the idea that operate according to the fiduciary standard, which stipulates that advisors must work in a clients best interest, rather than the ""suitability"" standard used by many wirehouse brokers, which requires products must be suitable even if they are high cost. Bicknell says that during the financial crisis his team was able to triple in size by recruiting high-quality people who were leaving bigger firms. Mariner has also been active with M&A deals, buying about 50 small RIA practices since 2012 alone. Today, the firm has grown to 1,800 advisors and 120 locations across more than 30 states, serving roughly 45,000 clients from all over the country.

Building Relationships: ""One of the most overused words in our industry is holistic planning,"" says Bicknell. ""In order for us to truly be holistic the service and talent has to be in-house, so culture, client experience and deliverables are cohesive and not spliced together."" He points to Mariner's long list of in-house offerings including such things as owning their own trust and insurance companies, a boutique investment bank for closely held business owners and dedicated institutional offerings for retirement plans. ""At this size, we have the ability to serve all client segments,"" he adds.

Investment Philosophy/Strategy: ""Our philosophy is to create access -- so if there's a unique or exclusive strategy we want to utilize our size and skill to get access to those for clients,"" says Bicknell. From an equity and fixed income standpoint, his firm likes to allocate mass affluent client portfolios into ETFs in order to bring down expenses and allow for easy access. Once a client portfolio has more than a couple million dollars, however, Mariner likes to use in-house equity and fixed income strategies primarily geared towards limiting client expenses. A majority of the firm's client base are also invested in alternatives such as private equity or real estate, making up anywhere between 10% and 30% of portfolios.

Investment Outlook: ""In general, even with the market near all-time highs, we're still very constructive with our investments,"" says Bicknell. He remains optimistic going into 2025, adding that the market and the economy are in a good place. ""We always think there could be some short term volatility, which may present short-lived buying opportunities,"" he adds. ""With a Federal Reserve that is reducing rates, the over-talked about recession has never come: All of those things bode well for companies in general and therefore the economy.""

Best Advice: The key to success is bringing in and training young talent, says Bicknell. He points out that for every acquisition Mariner makes, he and his partners may talk to a dozen or more firms in the process. In what is a hugely fragmented space, learning about your peers can be a big advantage: ""The leading firms in the industry are the ones who understand the need to invest in next-gen, rather than being cost-conscious,"" says Bicknell."
What Are 'Ghost Guns'? What To Know As Supreme Court Hears Case Today.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/08/what-are-ghost-guns-what-to-know-as-supreme-court-hears-case-today/,2024-10-08T13:51:00Z,"The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in its first major case of the term Tuesday with a dispute concerning ""ghost guns,"" firearms that are typically assembled at home and cannot be traced, as gun owners and manufacturers challenge a Biden administration policy trying to stem what's become a growing issue.

Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text ""Alerts"" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.

How the court will rule, though justices previously ruled 5-4 in Aug. 2023 to keep the Biden administration's regulations on ghost guns in place while the lawsuit played out in court.

If the lower court ruling striking down the 2022 rule is upheld, ""anyone could buy a kit online and assemble a fully functional gun in minutes -- no background check, records, or serial number required,"" the government argued in a brief to the Supreme Court. ""The result would be a flood of untraceable ghost guns into our Nation's communities, endangering the public and thwarting law-enforcement efforts to solve violent crimes.""

The court will hear oral arguments Tuesday morning and will likely release its decision in a few months, sometime before its term ends in June.

45,240. That's the number of ""ghost guns"" without serial numbers that were recovered from crime scenes between 2016 and 2021, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The number of ghost guns sharply went up during that period, prosecutors noted in their brief to the Supreme Court -- with only 1,600 guns submitted to ATF for tracing in 2017 versus more than 19,000 in 2021 -- and the lack of serial numbers makes them almost impossible to trace. Of the more than 45,000 submitted, the government could only trace 445 back to the original point of purchase.

What other gun cases the Supreme Court could take up this term. The court has already been asked to take up a number of major disputes over firearm regulations, including cases on Maryland's assault weapons ban, the ban on people convicted of felonies possessing guns and whether states can ban 18-to-20-year olds from purchasing guns. Justices have not ruled yet on whether or not to take up those cases.

The ghost gun case comes as the Supreme Court has made waves for several major gun rulings in recent years. The court opened the door to a flood of new lawsuits over gun restrictions in 2022 with its ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, which struck down New York's restrictions on concealed carry and broadly ruled that gun laws have to be in line with historical precedents on gun regulations. That led to dozens of gun regulations being blocked or struck down in court, though the Supreme Court made clear last term that some restrictions can stay in place, upholding a law prohibiting domestic abusers from owning firearms. The 6-3 conservative court also struck down federal restrictions on ""bump stocks"" for guns in June, however, which are devices that allow firearms to mimic automatic weapons. The court's controversial rulings on guns, coming as gun violence continues to be a major issue in the U.S., have helped fuel criticism on the left of the conservative-leaning court. A September Gallup poll found 51% of Americans now disapprove of the Supreme Court as its new term begins, versus 44% who approve."
"Oilstainlab Unveils The HF-11, A Porsche Motorsport-Inspired Hypercar",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/peternelson/2024/10/08/oilstainlab-unveils-the-hf-11-a-porsche-motorsport-inspired-hypercar/,2024-10-08T13:51:00Z,"Since its founding in 2019, Southern California-based boutique automotive design consultancy Oilstainlab has been steeped in nostalgia. Its Half-11 Prototype is a love letter to a bygone era, conjuring up images of feather-light late-'60s prototype race cars crafted by legendary names like Porsche and Ferrari. With a heavy emphasis on simplicity -- from distinct design to immensely low curb weight -- the company has now unveiled plans to build its first ultra-low-volume production car, the HF-11.

The HF-11 is, in a sense, counter to what modern high-performance enthusiasts have accepted as normal. Thanks to spacious, amenity-rich interiors, complex modern electronics, and other methods of piling on weight, anything hovering around 3,000 lbs is considered lightweight in this day and age. Like the current Porsche 911 GT3. By a very stark contrast, however, the HF-11 is planned to tip the scales at just 2,o00 lbs.

""At the very core of the car, every single component was considered, everything is super lightweight,"" Nikita Briden, co-founder of Oilstainlab told the crowd at a reveal event in Los Angeles. ""We use Formula 1 suppliers for the switches, and everything is utterly minimalist."" This is a herculean effort to pull off in a modern vehicle, especially one designed to carry two occupants and join our nation's public roadways.

While the HF-11's Porsche-inspired bodywork is largely simple in its aesthetic, a massive amount of time was spent utilizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) by the company's team of ex-Mercedes F1 employees to optimize its aerodynamics. The primary goal: perfectly balance high-performance with gorgeous looks and everyday function.

Underneath, its bespoke carbon-fiber monocoque -- the foundation of its motorsports-derived demeanor -- is uncompromising. ""Over 3,500 hours across two years of joint effort have been spent on this innovative design, offering exceptional modern safety, engineering, technology, ergonomics, and driving experience,"" the company shares in its official press release.

The overall dimensions are quite small, too, which is refreshing to see in 2024. ""The overall length is a 993 Porsche -- 171 inches long -- which is tiny by today's standards. That's very small,"" explained Briden.

Powering the HF-11 is something that, like its design and dimensions, takes a traditional Porsche-esque route: it's planned to receive a naturally aspirated flat-six that will rev to 12,500 RPM and produce around 650 horsepower. Finer details have yet to be revealed about its specifications. Additionally, Oilstainlab plans to offer the ability to quickly swap between it and an all-electric powertrain, enabling owners to enjoy both forms of propulsion. No matter which is selected, however, a six-speed manual gearbox is set to bolt up to either.

Between its immensely low curb weight, stiff carbon monocoque, miniscule size, and mid-mounted engine, the Oilstainlab HF-11 is designed to be engaging and ravenously fun-to-drive. Fun fact: Like the legendary Lancia Stratos HF Stradale, its door pockets are designed to hold a racing helmet, which certainly demonstrates it core intentions.

Oilstainlab hasn't released any information on when production of the HF-11 will begin, but it will be limited to just 25 units and is projected to start at $1,850,000. Currently, the company is in the process of testing the planned all-electric powertrain in its Half-11 Prototype, so there are still some details to hammer out. Nonetheless, I'm thoroughly excited for when these roll out of its Signal Hill, California facility, and join the ranks of other high-end boutique creations (like the Ruf CTR Anniversary) that put design, engagement, and thrilling performance first."
The Era Of The Combustion Engine Is Far From Over,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarwantsingh/2024/10/08/the-era-of-the-combustion-engine-is-far-from-over/,2024-10-08T13:41:06Z,"A conversation with PHINIA CEO Brady Ericson and CTO Todd Anderson at the IAA, Hannover

As someone who has spent decades analyzing and predicting the trajectory of the automotive industry, I've often witnessed revolutionary moments, from the rise of hybrid technology to the advent of fully electric vehicles. But what truly fascinates me is how companies adapt, evolve, and strategically plan for the future, especially when faced with monumental technological shifts. PHINIA's journey -- one rooted in combustion technology and now advancing into alternative fuels -- perfectly encapsulates this balance between evolution and innovation.

Balancing Innovation and Tradition

PHINIA's journey began as a spin-off from BorgWarner, inheriting a rich legacy in fuel systems and emissions control. Faced with stricter emissions regulations and the growing popularity of EVs, PHINIA seized the opportunity to leverage its expertise in developing more efficient and sustainable combustion technologies. This strategic approach has successfully allowed the company to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape and changing consumer preferences.

While the EV market is undeniably growing, I believe that combustion engines will remain a significant force in the automotive industry for decades to come. PHINIA focuses on developing innovative solutions that meet stringent emissions standards and enhance performance, fuel efficiency, and overall driving experience.

In my recent conversation with the President & CEO of PHINIA, Brady Ericson, and CTO, Todd Anderson, it became clear that their vision of the future doesn't reject the past -- it builds on it. While much of the automotive world is caught in the EV hype, PHINIA is taking a more pragmatic approach. Brady's deep understanding of both combustion and electrification technologies highlighted a compelling truth: the world's transition to EVs might be slower and less all-encompassing than the headlines suggest.

Brady expressed how his perspective evolved over a span of 16 months after their spin-off from BorgWarner. ""At the time, the general sentiment was that combustion would be obsolete within two or three years. However, 12 months later, the industry has come to realize that the transition away from combustion will not happen overnight. The shift is proving to be more evolutionary than revolutionary.""

This insight is critical as we analyze the long-term future of energy in transportation. The conversation reinforced my belief that combustion technology, especially when transitioning to alternative fuels like hydrogen, is not only surviving but thriving in key sectors, including commercial vehicles, industrial applications, and off-highway markets.

Despite the early doubts, PHINIA's strategy has already led to impressive gains, with a market share growth from the low double digits to the mid-teens. There is a clear pathway to achieving a 20% market share, driven by a combination of light vehicle original equipment (OE) business and an expanding portfolio on the commercial vehicle (CV) and industrial sides.

The Evolution of Fuel Systems

PHINIA's strategy is as deliberate as it is practical. While Brady acknowledged the increasing adoption of EVs, he emphasized that ""whether it's 45% or 35% of vehicles being electrified by 2030, there will still be a significant portion relying on combustion technology."" This reliance isn't just limited to fossil fuels -- alternative fuels, including hydrogen, ethanol, and E-fuels, are becoming increasingly important. Brady predicts that a more realistic scenario is EVs capturing 30-35% of the market by the end of the decade instead of the more optimistic 50%, something my team at Markets and Markets agrees to as shown in the chart shown for Commercial Vehicles.

Their approach to expanding the CV and aftermarket businesses is grounded in the belief that liquid and gaseous fuels will continue to dominate in parts of the world where EV infrastructure is insufficient. As Todd pointed out, PHINIA's team of 1,600 engineers, technicians, and scientists bring expertise in precision machining, fuel metering, and flow management. This knowledge base is now being adapted to innovate with alternative fuels like hydrogen, including hydrogen internal combustion engines (H2 ICE).

PHINIA's pragmatic focus on providing complete systems -- from fuel injectors to calibration software -- illustrates their adaptability. It's not about chasing trends; it's about offering practical, real-world solutions. As Brady noted, ""We're going to continue to support light vehicle OE revenues but see huge growth opportunities in the CV and industrial spaces.""

The Future of Hydrogen Combustion

One of the most exciting aspects of our discussion was PHINIA's work with H2 ICE. As Brady explained, while hydrogen fuel cells may offer advantages in specific controlled environments, H2 ICEs provide a more robust solution for heavy-duty commercial vehicles operating in extreme conditions. ""We can tolerate lower-quality hydrogen in our combustion engines, which could drastically reduce hydrogen fuel costs, making this technology far more accessible."" This could cut hydrogen fuel costs by as much as half, presenting a significant advantage in markets with less refined hydrogen supplies.

This nuanced approach toward hydrogen is what sets PHINIA apart. They aren't pushing for hydrogen just because it's a buzzword. They are leveraging decades of expertise in combustion to ensure that hydrogen can be used efficiently, even in regions where infrastructure and fuel quality might be lacking. Todd reinforced this by discussing PHINIA's values, ""Product leadership isn't about creating the next shiny object. It's about providing real solutions that add value today.""

PHINIA's efforts to integrate hydrogen combustion with existing infrastructure and systems also stand out. Brady emphasized that H2 ICEs provide significant advantages over hydrogen fuel cells when it comes to total cost of ownership, particularly in regions where the environmental conditions would make fuel cell maintenance overly complex and costly. This focus on practical, immediate solutions aligns with PHINIA's broader product leadership strategy. ""We are not trying to be a tech stock,"" Todd added, ""but rather to focus on steady, consistent, and reliable growth.""

Conclusion

As I wrapped up the conversation with Brady and Todd, it struck me how grounded PHINIA's approach is. They aren't dazzled by the rush to adopt the latest trends; instead, they're focused on offering the best solutions for today's challenges, with a keen eye on the future.

The era of combustion engines is far from over. PHINIA's leadership in combustion technology, alternative fuels, and system integration will undoubtedly shape the future of transportation. For instance, despite a flat market, PHINIA expects to see increased content per vehicle due to Euro 7 compliance, which will lead to higher average prices for their systems. Their aftermarket business also remains a constant grower, contributing 3-5% annually, providing reliable cash flow and margins even in cyclical markets."
'Beetlejuice Beetlejuice' Is Now Streaming -- How To Watch The Blockbuster Sequel At Home,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicamercuri/2024/10/08/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-is-now-streaming-how-to-watch-the-blockbuster-sequel-at-home/,2024-10-08T13:41:03Z,"Beetlejuice fans, the sequel to Tim Burton's beloved classic is now available for digital streaming ahead of its future release on Max. Find out how to watch Beetlejuice Beetlejuice from the comfort of your home -- just in time for spooky season.

Three generations of the Deetz family returned to Winter River in the highly anticipated Beetlejuice Beetlejuice sequel, which premiered on September 6, 2024. The film marks a reunion for director Tim Burton with original actors Michael Keaton, Catherine O'Hara, and Winona Ryder, along with his Wednesday leading actress Jenna Ortega.

""Still haunted by Beetlejuice, Lydia's life is turned upside down when her rebellious teenage daughter, Astrid, discovers the mysterious model of the town in the attic and the portal to the Afterlife is accidentally opened,"" the official synopsis reads. ""With trouble brewing in both realms, it's only a matter of time until someone says Beetlejuice's name three times and the mischievous demon returns to unleash his very own brand of mayhem.""

Beetlejuice Beetlejuice has had an impressive run at the box office, amassing $403 million worldwide, including $265 million in domestic sales, according to Box Office Mojo. The blockbuster sequel is currently the sixth highest-grossing film domestically in 2024 and continues to break box-office milestones four weeks after its debut.

The Tim Burton sequel holds a 77% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from critics, while audiences have rated it positively at 80%. In his review, NPR critic Justin Chang praised the film, writing, ""Fortunately, there isn't a whiff of cynicism to Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. Burton shows real affection for the first film's characters and genuine curiosity about how they're doing three decades or so later.""

Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is now available to stream on digital video-on-demand sites like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, and Fandango At Home. You can purchase Beetlejuice Beetlejuice for $24.99 or rent the film for $19.99 (for a 48-hour period).

The film will debut on 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and DVD from online and physical retailers starting November 19. The home video release will include special additions like a commentary track from Burton, a documentary called ""The Juice is Loose!"" and mini-documentaries about the cast, the movie's stop-motion animation, and more.

Max has yet to announce a release date for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. Typically, studios wait about 60 to 90 days after a film's theatrical premiere to make it available on their streaming platforms. Warner Bros.'s recent films have tended to lean toward the longer end of that range. Based on this timeline, the earliest Beetlejuice Beetlejuice could premiere on Max is in early November 2024.

For example, Godzilla X Kong premiered in theaters on March 29, 2024, and became available on Max 97 days later, on July 4, 2024. Dune: Part 2 had a shorter theatrical-to-Max release timeline of 81 days, while Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga was added to Max 84 days after its theatrical debut.

Before tuning into the sequel, there are a few ways to watch the original 1988 Beetlejuice film starring Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin, Winona Ryder, Catherine O'Hara, and Michael Keaton. Beetlejuice is available to stream on Max with a subscription. You can also buy the film for $14.99 or rent it for $3.79 on Prime Video and AppleTV."
Conference Realignment: What's Next For The Pac-12 And Mountain West?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikbuchinger/2024/10/08/conference-realignment-whats-next-for-the-pac-12-and-mountain-west/,2024-10-08T13:40:56Z,"The conference realignment dust has settled (for now) with the Pac-12 and Mountain West at the center of this round of movement. Both conferences still have work to do in increasing their membership to the NCAA-required eight teams, but they're almost there.

As it stands today, the 2026 edition of the Pac-12 includes the current two-team conference of Washington State and Oregon State, in addition to Utah State, Boise State, Colorado State, Fresno State and San Diego State from the Mountain West. The conference also snagged Gonzaga from the West Coast Conference, which does not have a football program, so the Pac-12 needs to add one more.

Memphis might be the most valuable Group of 5 program at this point, so don't be surprised if the Tigers and Pac-12 become a match. UConn briefly explored the idea of joining the Pac-12 for football only but is no longer interested.

Sacramento State has been aggressive in showing its interest in joining the conference from the FCS level. The school announced plans for a new football stadium and created a committee called SAC 12, which claimed it secured $35 million in NIL funds in 24 hours to prove its worth as an FBS program.

The Pac-12's next move could take a while because the conference is not adding another member until its media rights evaluation is completed, according to The Action Network's Brett McMurphy. Last week's report said this could take anywhere from two weeks to three months, and the Pac-12 is not negotiating with anybody right now despite programs continuing to reach out.

After the Pac-12 raid, the conference's 2026 membership consists of UNLV, Air Force, Nevada, New Mexico, Wyoming, San Jose State, Hawaii and UTEP. Eight programs are listed in that group, but Hawaii does not count due to not being a full member as a football-only program, so the conference needs one more. UTEP is the only addition so far as they announced their exit from Conference USA to the Mountain West last week.

One idea that comes to mind is just to elevate Hawaii to being a full-time member in all sports, and this is already being discussed, according to McMurphy. The Rainbow Warriors' non-football programs currently compete in the Big West.

Elsewhere, the Mountain West notified the MAC of its interest in Northern Illinois and Toledo as football-only options in 2026, McMurphy reported. Again, schools need to be full-time members so even if those two joined, the Mountain West still needs at least one more full-time member.

If the Mountain West wants to snag an FCS program, it held deep discussions with Tarleton State, Yahoo's Ross Dellenger reported last week. Tarleton State had been a Division II program before elevating to the FCS level for the 2020-21 season.

Texas State declined a Mountain West offer and announced it will remain in the Sun Belt, so the conference will need to pivot to other viable options.

The Mountain West can take a sigh of relief because it no longer has to play defense at this point. The remaining schools signed a binding agreement with the conference, according to Dellenger. This includes Air Force and UNLV, which have both been rumored for exits to other conferences.

If you need a guide to what has already been announced when it comes to conference realignment, here's the latest tracker."
Is Billie Eilish About To Score Her Second Career Hot 100 No. 1?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/10/08/is-billie-eilish-about-to-score-her-second-career-hot-100-no-1/,2024-10-08T13:40:37Z,"Billie Eilish has ranked as one of the hottest new names in the music industry for at least half a decade now -- and even longer to those who are especially plugged in. The young talent took the business by storm years ago with a completely new style of alternative pop, one which resonated with the masses. She claims a catalog filled with smashes, but some may be surprised by her track record on the Hot 100.

To date, Eilish has only sent one single to No. 1 on Billboard's ranking of the most-consumed songs in the U.S. In 2019, as she was working her way to true stardom, she pushed ""Bad Guy"" to the summit on the Hot 100. That cut, which only managed one frame in charge of the most competitive songs tally in the country, is her only ruler.

Eilish nearly returned to the throne on the Hot 100 this week, but she misses out on doing so by just one space. ""Birds of a Feather"" flaps its wings and flies to a new high point of No. 2 on the list.

This frame, newcomer Shaboozey blocks Eilish from charting her second career leader on the Hot 100. His breakout smash ""A Bar Song (Tipsy)"" is in charge of the ranking for the thirteenth nonconsecutive turn -- one of the longest reigns of the decade.

Before this week, ""Birds of a Feather"" had only risen as high as No. 5. Last frame, the tune sat down at No. 6, but now it shoots to second place.

""Birds of a Feather"" gains significantly thanks to a number of factors. Eilish recently delivered the single's official music video, which fans had been waiting to see for weeks. The visual spurred a sales and streaming bump for the title, and all plays of the treatment also help it climb on the Hot 100.

Eilish also just kicked off her Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour, which promotes her latest album of the same name. The trek started on September 29 in Canada, and it's expected to run into next July, when it's slated to end in Dublin -- at least at the moment. The beginning of the venture made headlines and went viral, which helped her catalog's consumption figures.

""Birds of a Feather"" is one of Eilish's seven top 10 hits on the Hot 100, and it's currently tied as her second-highest-rising ever. Her single ""Therefore I Am"" also stalled at No. 2 on the tally in late 2020.

For the moment, ""A Bar Song (Tipsy)"" has an iron-tight grip on the Hot 100, and it doesn't look like Shaboozey will be replaced anytime soon. At the moment, that No. 1 blockbuster's biggest competitor is Eilish's latest, but whether she can best his gargantuan hit and earn a second career winner will be revealed in the coming weeks."
New Prime Day Security Warning -- 100 Amazon Scams To Avoid,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/10/08/new-prime-day-security-warning-100-amazon-scams-to-avoid/,2024-10-08T13:35:58Z,"With Amazon's annual Prime Day shopping extravaganza now upon us, spanning Wednesday, Oct. 08 and Thursday, Oct. 09, there are undoubtedly many bargains to be snapped up. However, shoppers are being warned to be careful as security experts have uncovered more than 100 different Prime-focused threat campaigns and nearly 900 malicious new Amazon-related web domains in the run-up to the sales. Here's what you need to know and do to enjoy your shopping while staying safe and secure.

Security researchers from the Check Point Research team have uncovered a staggering 100 different Amazon Prime-focused email scam campaigns and more than 1,000 newly-registered and Amazon-related domains, of which 88% of the latter were malicious in nature.

Typical of the email campaigns are those pertaining to be from Amazon Financial Services and urging the recipients to update their payment methods so as to be able to enjoy the Prime Day sales. Check Point Research has also warned that ""Some scammers have gone so far as to contact Prime members directly, citing urgent account issues and soliciting payment information.""

Of every 54 new Amazon-related web domains to be registered, the researchers found that one included the phrase ""Amazon Prime"" and are suspected to be ready for use in phishing attacks.

Amazon has a vested interest in keeping customers safe from scammers and hackers all year round, and especially when it comes to time for Prime Day sales. After all, a customer who loses money to a scammer, or one whose account gets compromised by a hacker, is likely to be less inclined to participate in what should be an enjoyable and money-saving experience in future.

With this in mind, the e-commerce leviathan has published a list of six tips to stay safe from scams this Prime Day:

Amazon also said that if you ever receive a communication that you think might not be legitimate, then you should report it immediately using the self-service tool that enables you to do this in just a few quick steps or by sending an email to reportascam@amazon.com if you prefer."
Council Post: Why Team Identity Matters During Change,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/10/08/why-team-identity-matters-during-change/,2024-10-08T13:35:49Z,"Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author.

Dr. Loubna Noureddin is cofounder and CEO of Mind Market and author of ""Determined to Change,"" helping organizations thrive during change.

When organizations face change, the focus often skews heavily toward systems, processes and timelines. But here's the thing: Change has two sides -- the process side and the people side. The latter is often neglected, even though it's the driving force behind any successful transformation.

Managing Change Takes Work

One of the biggest hurdles in managing change is rework, which usually stems from gaps in the process. The procedures aren't always flawed; rather, it's the disconnect and confusion that lead to failure. Even with a mastery of execution, many teams stumble when it comes to implementing a perfect plan. Not paying enough attention to the human side of change often leads to incomplete or failed transformations.

Michael Hammer, a leader in business process reengineering, suggested that the biggest problems in organizations don't come from how individual tasks are done, but from how those tasks connect within the larger system. His insight underscores the importance of collaboration and communication across departments.

Instead of improving isolated tasks, organizations should focus on how teams outputs impact one another to find inefficiencies and boost overall performance.

The Impact Of Team Dynamics During Change

Take, for instance, a global marketing team we worked with in the pharmaceutical industry facing significant leadership changes. They had an ambitious growth strategy that required immediate alignment across various functions.

Despite a solid plan, they hit a roadblock: team dynamics. The primary resistance arose from clashing personalities and a lack of trust in new members, who were perceived as unprepared for the complexities ahead.

Team Identity: The Hidden Catalyst For Change

To bridge this gap, I recommend teams focus on four key elements that drive alignment during change:

1. Team identity: Begin with open, honest conversations about what the team wants to stand for, what success would look like, and why aligning on the change effort is crucial. Clarity on these points can help reduce friction between team members and facilitate the creation of a shared sense of purpose.

2. Commitment: Next, discuss what each team member is willing to commit to, highlighting both positive and negative behaviors that typically surface during change. Reflecting on past experiences can provide insights into tendencies that could either support or hinder progress.

3. Team resistance: By identifying fears, assumptions and biases, teams can pinpoint where and when resistance is most likely to arise. This isn't about shaming team members for their concerns but rather about listening with empathy to the real fears behind their hesitation.

4. Team agreement: Finally, develop a team agreement that outlines expectations for communication, collaboration and accountability.

Recognizing behaviors that empower or diminish the team can give members a clear guide for staying aligned throughout the change journey.

Addressing Resistance Through Time Reflection

Resistance to change often stems from unaddressed fears or unresolved past experiences. To move forward, it's essential for teams to have the space to process these feelings and turn them into strengths.

We use a framework called ""time reflection"" to guide this process:

1. Make peace with the past. Before diving into change, allow the team to express their frustrations and validate their concerns. Ignoring these emotions can fuel more resistance down the road.

2. Claim the present. Next, identify the current roadblocks and discuss how upcoming changes could remove those barriers. This step helps teams see change as a solution rather than a threat.

3. Honor the future. Connect the dots between the team's challenges and aspirations. By co-creating a vision for success, you give team members a compelling reason to invest in the journey ahead.

The Power Of Team Identity During Change

The key to promoting collaboration and commitment during change is to validate the experiences of the people impacted by the change.

People don't resist change; they resist the disregard for their experiences during change. By reflecting on where they've been, where they are now, and what they want to become, teams can shift from resisting change to actively driving it.

Building Team Identity Amid Uncertainty

During times of uncertainty, processes are essential, and they're half the equation. The other half lies in your culture readiness for change. By prioritizing the people side of change, leaders can turn resistance into resilience and build a culture that thrives in uncertainty.

Whether you're navigating a major transformation or simply trying to get through the next quarter, take the time to align your team around a unified vision, purpose and identity.

Team alignment is often underrated, but when teams are clear on their identity, commitment and expectations, you not only pave the way forward but also create a stronger, more united team that can weather any storm.

Prioritizing people during change can turn resistance into commitment to change. For example, Patagonia's leadership team has decided to focus on the people side of change. They show that nurturing a sense of belonging is fundamental to their bottom line results. The company has implemented three-day weekends, wellness programs and in-house services including child care support.

When leadership teams create specific forums where employees can share their ideas and identify new solutions to old problems, townhalls can take a different spin with transparent communication. As a result, employee satisfaction and retention rates can improve. These practices can also boost sales by enhancing a company's reputation among loyal clients.

By focusing on basic, yet essential, human elements, you can shift a culture of resistance to one of commitment.

Design people-centered change. Align your team to row in the right direction. Inspire humanity, and watch magic happen.

"Neural Networks Co-Inventor Hinton Wins Physics Nobel, Fears AI",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2024/10/08/neural-networks-co-inventor-hinton-wins-physics-nobel-fears-ai/,2024-10-08T13:29:05Z,"On October 8, the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics went to a computer scientist and a physicist for ""for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks,"" according to the New York Times.

Since neural networks fall more in the domain of computer science, rather than physics, this news raised many questions in my mind:

The answers: Possibly; some already do; and no.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics to two professors: John Hopfield, a physics professor at Princeton University and Geoffrey Hinton, a University of Toronto computer scientist. The Academy awarded the prize for their discoveries that helped computers learn ""more in the way the human brain does,"" noted the Times.

While such neural networks are a tremendous breakthrough, their connection to physics is not their chief feature. To be fair, the Nobel committee said neural networks have a major role in scientific research -- including in the creation of ""new materials with specific properties,"" the Times wrote.

By this logic, the Nobel committee might have justified awarding the prize in Physiology and Medicine. How so? After all, among many other such models, Stanford Medicine researchers devised SyntheMol, an AI model to create ""recipes for chemists to synthesize drugs in the lab,"" according to Stanford Medicine News Center.

The 2024 Nobel in Physiology and Medicine went to two Massachusetts researchers -- Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun -- for their discovery of microRNA, ""which helps determine how cells develop and function,"" according to the Times. I wonder why the Nobel Committee did not award the prize to researchers closer to the center of the Physics bullseye.

We should fear AI's bad consequences -- and already do.

Hinton spoke with journalists about the significance of neural networks. ""It will be comparable with the Industrial Revolution,"" he said, according to the Times. ""Instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it's going to exceed people in intellectual ability. We have no experience of what it's like to have things smarter than us.""

While he envisions the technology will boost health care productivity, he worries about its dark side. He expressed worry ""about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control,"" noted the Times.

This summer I participated in a conversation with retail industry board members and experienced their palpable terror. My interpretation is these board members are torn between strong emotional poles.

The bright green light says companies should invest heavily in AI to avoid falling behind rivals while the glowing red light holds companies back due to the risk of AI hallucinations potentially harming the companies reputation and prompting lawsuits.

This Nobel will not affect how companies use AI since the hype is already at a peak.

Meanwhile those competing emotional poles are keeping many companies from putting generative AI in front of their customers.

How so? Of 200 to 300 generative AI experiments the typical large company undertakes, about 10 to 15 have led to widespread internal rollouts, and perhaps one or two are released to customers, according to my June Forbes interview with Liran Hason, CEO of Aporia, a startup that sells companies a system that detects AI hallucinations.

In my conversations with company executives since the July publication of my book, Brain Rush, two questions from business leaders have predominated:

I have a different idea about what a payoff from AI would look like. Rather than focusing on how long it takes for a company's profits to cover the cost of building AI, I think business leaders should focus on a different metric.

Specifically, what matters to investors is expectations-beating growth. Hence business leaders should use generative AI to spur the creation of new, fast-growing products and services that can offset the company's dependence on maturing core products.

Few companies are actually pulling this off. As I noted in my Value Pyramid case study, most generative AI use cases help people overcome creator's block -- such as the anxiety about writing an email. Fewer generative AI applications help improve the productivity of business functions such as customer service or coding. And few, if any, applications of AI chatbots enable companies to add new sources of revenue.

One reason so few generative AI applications are found at the summit of the value pyramid is the role of the CEO.

To understand why, consider two approaches to developing new products: relay race and rugby.

In the relay race approach, engineers develop a blueprint for a new product. When they are done, they hand the blueprint baton to the head of manufacturing who protests the blueprint will be too expensive to manufacture and will produce quality problems.

Once manufacturing has built what the engineers ordered, the head of manufacturing hands the baton to the head of sales -- asking them to find customers for the products on the loading dock. The head of sales inspects the products and says they do not have the features customers want and will be hard to sell.

Now consider the rugby approach. Here the CEO pulls together a scrum -- consisting of leaders from sales, purchasing, manufacturing, and finance. The scrum visits with early-adopter customers and listens to them talk about their unmet needs.

After that, the scrum develops a prototype -- taking into account the concerns of each business function and how well the new product will meet the needs of the early-adopters.

The scrum then gives the prototype to the customer and asks for feedback. Typically, that will send the team back to add new features, delete others, and after a few iterations -- produce a product customers are eager to buy.

Last month I did a podcast with retail executives who told me the typical retail CEO uses the relay race approach. When it comes to generative AI, the most common approach is similar -- the CEO delegates the design and deployment to a chief AI officer who lacks a deep understanding of the business strategy.

Rather than delegating AI, the CEO must understand how AI can help redesign how a company works with customers to create value -- modeled after the rugby approach I described above.

A case in point is TechSee, a company that built an much more effective way to provide remote customer service. The company founder and CEO Eitan Cohen could not help a family member solve a computer problem over the phone, according to my October Inc. column.

His mother-in-law called and said her printer was not working. ""People can't communicate the problem over the telephone,"" he told me.

""I would have to drive over to look at the printer to figure out what was wrong and solve it. I didn't like that. I thought there must be a solution. I could take remote control of the computer. But that would not help me realize that the dog chewed the cable, or it was not plugged in to the right place on the printer,"" he added.

TechSee's solution pays off for customers. ""We enable our customers to go from defense to offense,"" he said. ""Contact center employees can solve customer problems quickly so they can spend time selling products. We reduce average call duration by 20 percent to 50 percent -- from an hour to less than 30 minutes,"" he added.

TechSee's solution enables customers to send images of the products for which they are seeking service. Those pictures reveal the source of the problem in a way words can't. Moreover, the company uses its ability to analyze the most common problems and use an AI chatbot to deliver faster problem resolution through self-service.

If more companies follow TechSee's approach to deploying generative AI, there could be more of the good Hinton has helped create and less of the bad."
Joker: Folie A Deux's Terrible Ending Is One Christopher Nolan Vetoed,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/08/joker-folie-a-deuxs-terrible-ending-is-one-christopher-nolan-vetoed/,2024-10-08T13:29:01Z,"In case you wanted another reason to dislike Joker: Folie a Deux, one of the worst comic book movies in the last twenty years, here's another fun fact for you.

The ending of the film (spoilers ahead) is one of the most universally disliked aspects of Joker: Folie a Deux, a miserable end for Arthur Fleck and the alleged birth of the ""real"" Joker, according to some. In it, Fleck is stabbed by a former fanboy and then out of focus, we see him carve a smile into his own face. Cheesy, but there's also a history to this moment.

According to THR, this was supposed to be the ending of the original Joker, where Arthur, in front of a crowed of supporters, carved a smile into his face. This, of course, is something that is inextricably linked to Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight (""wanna know how I got these scars?) and is not usually how the traditional Joker smile is portrayed.

As such, back then, none other that Christopher Nolan stepped in with WB and Todd Phillips to kill that idea, wanting to leave that as Ledger's Joker's signature only. Even though this was 11 years after The Dark Knight, Nolan still shot it down, and I think most would agree that was the right call.

But now in 2024, Christopher Nolan is no longer making movies with WB after a falling out in 2021 about Tenet's theatrical release. He went on to make Oscar-winner Oppenheimer with Universal Pictures. Since he left, however, he was no longer there to reject the carved smile this time around, which is how it made it into the ending, even if it was somewhat out of focus.

""He's always trusted his gut -- and it's gotten him pretty far. He thought people would get the joke,"" a source told THR about Phillips' idea for the smile. But...no, they didn't. No one liked that.

There is not going to be another film set in this universe about the ""rise of the true Joker"" or anything like that. Phillips has very publicly declared he is done with DC, and there is no real reason to continue on this Joker ""Elseworld"" universe after the colossal failure of Folie a Deux. DC is now moving on to James Gunn's new widespread DC universe and its main Elseworld project is the hugely popular The Batman sub-verse from Matt Reeves, currently airing The Penguin, the much beloved HBO show. No need for Joker, at least that Joker, to live on. The running theory is that The Batman 2 will feature Barry Keoghan's briefly teased Joker in a main role this time. No more Joaquin Phoenix, who is, of course, dead anyway.

The ending is only one of many problems with Joker: Folie a Deux, but it's interesting to know there's history as to why part of it was bad. 16 years later, the moment still seems like a stain on 2008's Dark Knight, and a bad attempt at a link to that film."
Harris turns Trump's Helene lies into election-season scandal,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/harris-turns-trumps-helene-lies-election-season-scandal-rcna174446,2024-10-08T13:26:14Z,"The consequences of Trump's duplicity are real: As my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim explained, officials have said that the election-season lies and conspiracy theories ""are hindering relief efforts,"" while forcing agencies to waste time and resources combatting lies that too many people are falling for.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who started the week with an on-the-ground visit to North Carolina, has started pushing back against her GOP rival in earnest. NBC News reported:

""It's extraordinarily irresponsible,"" the Democratic nominee said, adding in reference to Trump, ""It's about him; it's not about you.""

It was an important point. For months, at the heart of the Democratic Party's election-season messaging was a straightforward condemnation of the former president: Trump's only priority is what's best for Trump. Period. Full stop.

It's against this backdrop that the Republican saw devastated communities and human suffering, which apparently led him to see a political opportunity: If he repeatedly lied about the heartbreaking circumstances, Trump concluded, it might benefit his campaign.

The whole idea behind so-called ""October Surprises"" is that there are sometimes unexpected developments that jolt the public conversation in the runup to Election Day and affect the results. Except, in 2024, Trump has arguably imposed an October Surprise on himself: With four weeks remaining, the Republican Party's presidential nominee got caught trying to exploit human suffering, lying about a deadly natural disaster to advance his own interests.

As it turns out, we have a word in American politics for situations like these. That word is ""scandal."" Trump actions -- drawing fresh attention to his lack of integrity and character -- deserve to be seen and characterized as scandalous.

Making matters worse, these developments also offer a timely reminder that Trump's own record related to responding to disasters is abysmal -- a point the Harris campaign hopes to drive home in a hard-hitting new television ad."

"Founder Mode Versus CEO: Why Leading Is About Vision, Not Control",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/aytekintank/2024/10/08/founder-mode-versus-ceo-why-leading-is-about-vision-not-control/,2024-10-08T13:21:50Z,"If you follow business news, chances are you've come across the buzz surrounding ""founder mode."" Recently, Paul Graham penned a post about why the common thinking for CEOs, to hire good people and get out of their way, is flawed.

Graham cited Airbnb founder Brian Chesky, who spoke in an interview about how taking a hands-off approach, or ""manager mode,"" caused disastrous results at his company. According to Chesky, as the leadership team expanded, Airbnb became more siloed, creating bottlenecks and a power-grab culture of middle managers. So the founder completely overhauled his approach. Said Chesky, ""I basically got involved in every single detail.""

I agree with some of the premises of Graham and Chesky -- founders are uniquely equipped to lead their companies. I agree that leaders are tasked with creating a clear vision for the company. I'm the CEO of the business I launched -- I've been in ""founder mode"" for nearly two decades. However, I disagree with their notion of the best way to execute founder mode. Here's why.

As a father of three, I find that launching a business is not unlike being a parent. You've been there from day one, so you know everything about your business. Years down the road, you have a deep understanding of why things are the way they are. You've learned what works and what doesn't work concerning your particular business and customers. You're intimately aware of the reasoning behind any of its pain points. You can appreciate how the culture has grown and evolved.

When you launch a company, you're instilled with a sense of ownership. Founders may have a knee-jerk reaction against the term ""owner"" -- you can ""own"" a car. You can ""own"" a mom-and-pop shop. A start-up is more far-reaching. But I think a sense of ownership gives founders resilience. When times get tough, as inevitably happens for businesses in today's rapidly progressing world, owners don't just give up. Their business's success is their success, and they'll do what it takes to persevere.

At the same time, this sense of ownership can become a double-edged sword when founders feel compelled to immerse themselves in every detail in order to succeed.

I've always seen the role of founder as more expansive than CEO. But a few years ago, I changed my typical way of functioning. Inspired by anecdotes of highly successful founders, I became directly involved in every single decision -- I got ""in the details,"" as Chesky puts it. And for the first time, I stopped enjoying my role as founder and CEO of Jotform.

At a certain point in my entrepreneurial journey, I switched my focus from founder to CEO. I switched to a more ""manager mode."" I made it my mission to touch every project. Each day was a succession of back-to-back meetings. I would regularly stay at the office past 9pm, returning home when my kids were already asleep.

After months of this grueling routine, I realized I had left behind my duties as founder. Meetings were sapping up all my time and energy, leaving no room for big-picture, strategic thinking -- the stuff that makes me tick. I wrongly assumed that the shift was due to our company growing. It had to be that way, I figured. But I was wrong.

Research shows that the most successful founders don't stay locked in ""founder mode."" Instead, they understand that long-term success requires strategic delegation and empowering others to lead. As founder and researcher Rich Hagberg explains, successful founders focus on setting a vision, ensuring alignment, and fostering a culture that embodies their values, like accountability, openness, and shared ownership. What's more, Hagberg's research highlights that founder-mode ""hyper-involvement"" can lead to serious personal consequences -- burnout being just one of them.

Faced with the reality that I was no longer enjoying leading the company I had worked so hard to build, I did a leadership 180. Once again, I began entrusting high-level responsibilities to my executive team. While keeping a finger on the pulse of the ins and outs of Jotform, I refocused my energy on being a founder.

When people think about a founder, they often imagine a key role in the past. The way I see it, a founder is a forward-looking role. As founder of Jotform, for example, my main concerns are currently AI and enterprise growth -- how to carry the company into the future on both of these fronts. Whereas our executive team focuses on -- as the name suggests -- the execution of countless daily decisions, my job requires researching and discovering. A growth mindset is indispensable. This continual learning would be impossible were it not for strategic delegation and utmost confidence in my team.

The truth is that the dichotomy between founder and manager mode doesn't exist. Each company is unique and each CEO-founder functions in a unique space on the spectrum from founder to manager. Founders must delegate effectively while continually shaping the company's vision. What matters most isn't adhering strictly to one mode or another, but recognizing when to adapt. It falls on each leader to determine where they fall on the spectrum and how they can make adjustments to ensure their company's continued growth."
Lady Gaga's New Album Narrowly Misses Debuting At No. 1,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/10/08/lady-gagas-new-album-narrowly-misses-debuting-at-no-1/,2024-10-08T13:21:45Z,"Usually, when Lady Gaga has a new album to share with the world, there's a good chance that it will soar right to No. 1. She remains not just one of the most famous musicians on the planet, but also a Hollywood A-lister-and both of those facts combined make her a certified superstar.

Despite her massive following and immense fame, Gaga's new full-length debuts fairly low on a number of charts as it arrives-but it almost conquered one tally.

Harlequin reaches several U.K. charts this week, but it doesn't open in a particularly impressive position-especially for a Gaga release. The set does stand out as one of the most successful when looking only at paid downloads, however.

The latest from Gaga launches at No. 3 on the Official Album Downloads chart. That list is the only one in the United Kingdom where Harlequin manages to crack the highest tier, which is unusual for her.

This week, Harlequin manages the third-loftiest debut on the Official Album Downloads tally, as it's beaten only by other fellow new arrivals. Shed Seven's Liquid Gold opens in first place, while the Ezra Collective's Dance, No One's Watching is new in the runner-up rung.

Harlequin marks Gaga's eighth top 10 hit on the Official Album Downloads chart. It's her first new placement on the tally since 2021, when she and Tony Bennett started their second collaborative full-length Love For Sale at No. 4. Gaga hasn't appeared higher than her current position since 2020, when Chromatica hit No. 1.

As it starts its time on the downloads ranking inside the top 10, Harlequin is forced to settle for much lower opening positions on several other charts. The set debuts at No. 59 on the main albums ranking. It's also new to both the Official Albums Sales (No. 37) and Official Albums Streaming (No. 77) lists.

Gaga released Harlequin as a tie-in with her new movie, Joker: Folie à Deux. The album is something of a stop-gap between her proper full-lengths, and it doesn't appear that the singer is pushing the standards collection as a project she intends on focusing on for a while. She's been clear that her seventh full-length is in the works, and the first single from that pop effort is expected at some point this month."
10 Smart Ways To Manage A Financial Windfall,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2024/10/08/10-smart-ways-to-manage-a-financial-windfall/,2024-10-08T13:19:43Z,"A generous inheritance. A booming investment. A big raise. What should you do with a large sum of unexpected money you discover coming your way? In particular, how should you handle such a windfall when you are aged 50 and up? Surprise! Some of it can be used for fun.

Here are some of the best ways experts recommend to handle a windfall.

1. Don't make any sudden decisions. Acting too quickly can be the wrong move.

""One client we work with in their mid-50s received a sudden, unsolicited offer for their business. Against our advice, they quickly accepted the offer and were left bored and without purpose for a few years after the sale,"" says David Wilson, a Certified Financial Planner and managing partner at Sincerus Advisory, in New York City. ""After a series of inward facing assessments and exercises, they found activities, hobbies, a social network and charitable work that gave them the daily purpose and fulfillment that was missing after the business was sold.""

2. Give yourself a break. Take some time to pause and relax.

""When it comes to a large financial windfall, it's important to recognize that this can be an overwhelmingly stressful and emotional phase of one's life,"" Wilson says. ""So, the first step we recommend to people in this situation is to take a little break and relax so that no major financial and life decisions are made early on during what usually is an emotionally tumultuous time.""

So give yourself a little vacation as you ponder your next financial steps.

""A staycation or some time hanging by the pool on a tropical island can help someone who has received a windfall think through what's important to them and brainstorm ideas on what the next phase of their life could be,"" Wilson says. ""We highly recommend that people don't make any large purchases or sudden lifestyle changes during this period.""

3. Think and plan. Consider all the different ways you want to spend the additional money coming into your life.

""Typically, I suggest allocating the wealth into four buckets: debt payoff, major purchases, retirement and fun,"" says Chris Diodato, a certified financial planner and founder of WELLth Financial Planning in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. ""Yes, I typically recommend allocating between 5% to 10% of a windfall for 'fun,' such as travel and recreation opportunities.""

Don't go too wild with spending. Your windfall can disappear in no time.

""The worst thing somebody can do with a windfall is increase their recurring lifestyle expenses,"" Diodato says. ""In other words, if a family makes $100,000 per year and gets a $250,000 inheritance, they should maintain their recurring lifestyle expenses as if they were still only making $100,000 per year to prevent drawing down on their inheritance.""

4. Pay down high-interest debt. A great use of a hefty windfall is to pay off high-interest debt such as credit cards.

""The first consideration should be to reduce high-interest rate debt,"" says Mike Hunsberger, a Certified Financial Planner and owner of Next Mission Financial Planning in Saint Charles, Missouri. ""After that, I'd suggest they determine if they're on track for their retirement. If they're not, this extra money could be devoted to that.""

5. Max out retirement savings plans. A windfall can be used to boost retirement savings.

""To grow this pot of money and pay less taxes, max out your 401(k) contributions. If you're 50 and up, you can put in as much as $30,500 for 2024,"" says Alvin Carlos, a certified financial planner and managing partner at District Capital Management in Washington, D.C. ""If you're still working, max out your Roth or research the backdoor Roth. This is a great way to grow your wealth tax-free.""

6. Re-evaluate retirement plans. How big is your windfall? Will you be able to retire earlier than you expected? It is a good place to be.

""Can you retire a few years earlier? Can you stop saving for retirement and spend more on vacations, assuming you have enough assets?"" says Justin Pritchard, a Certified Financial Planner at Approach Financial Planning in Montrose, Colorado. ""Perhaps you can work less or change to a different job, given your new circumstances.""

7. Keep some liquid savings. Set aside some of your newfound wealth in a checking, money market or savings account, so you can tap it instantly if needed.

""Consider a high-yield savings account that gives at least 4% interest, or a money market that yields about 5%,"" Carlos says.

Tuck away several months' worth of living expenses into these accounts.

""Ensure you have a robust emergency fund in place, ideally covering six to 12 months of living expenses,"" says Gene Thompson, a Certified Financial Planner and director of financial planning at Iconoclastic Capital Management in Rochester, New York. ""This safety net can help you weather unexpected financial storms.""

8. Diversify your investments. Choose a mix of investments for your financial windfall.

""Resist the urge to invest all your money in a single stock or opportunity, even if it seems promising,"" Thompson says. ""Diversifying your investments can reduce risk and increase the potential for steady growth.""

If you are close to retirement, you'll want to be more conservative with how you invest your money.

""As you approach retirement, your investment strategy should be more conservative to preserve capital while still allowing for some growth,"" Thompson says. ""Consider a mix of stocks, bonds and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.""

9. Review your estate planning. A windfall may give you the opportunity to give more to your loved ones.

""Update your estate plan to reflect your new financial situation,"" Thompson says. ""This may include revising your will, setting up trusts, or designating beneficiaries for your accounts.""

Remember to prepare for your own longevity.

""Given increasing life expectancies, it's crucial to ensure that your funds will last throughout your retirement,"" Thompson says. ""Consider long-term care insurance or setting aside money for future health care needs.""

10. Give to others. Share your windfall of wealth with family members.

""Pay it forward. You can make someone else's year (dependents most obviously) by giving them a tax-free gift -- $18,000 per recipient per giver in 2024 without any need to file any tax forms,"" says Karen Ogden, a Certified Financial Planner and partner at Envest Asset Management in Ridgefield, Connecticut.

By giving now, you may be able to see how your loved one uses your financial gift. Donating to a favorite charity is another option.

""If you have children, loved ones or causes that you'd like to contribute to, perhaps now is the time,"" Pritchard says. ""You can enjoy the satisfaction of giving while you're still alive, and you might be able to see the impact of your gift."""
The 'iPhone Of Air Conditioners' Brand Debuts A Sexy Air Purifier,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhochman/2024/10/08/the-iphone-of-air-conditioners-brand-debuts-a-sexy-air-purifier/,2024-10-08T13:18:44Z,"Windmill made a splash with a chic, sleek air conditioner that broke the mold on a/c design. Now the family-run company is back with an air purifier to disrupt a ho-hum market.

Air filters aren't the sexiest of appliances. You can't really see what they're doing and even when they work, you might chalk up positive results to something else -- a restful night's sleep, a clear and sunny day, the conclusion of Mercury in retrograde.

Still, consumers are practically inhaling these devices. Driven by an awareness of airborne diseases, including coronavirus, as well as rising pollution levels in urban areas (plus, let's face it, cats!), the global air purifier market size was estimated at $15.94 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at an annual rate of 7.1% through 2030, according to market analytics firm Grand View Research. New technologies in air purification (meaning: quieter, smaller, and tougher on micro-particles) are also pushing interest in products by market leaders, including Coway, IQ Air, Winix, Blue Air, and Levoit.

Finding breathing room in this market, particularly on the boutique end, isn't easy for newcomers. Big box retailers like Costco and Walmart have low-cost air purifiers from mega-brands like Dyson and Shark coming out of the nose, so it caught my attention when the family-run air-conditioner company Windmill announced a first-of-its-kind sleek air purifier as design-forward as the A/C units I once likened to ""the iPhone of air conditioners.""

The Windmill Purifier that launches today is made to look like a stylish piece of furniture. Designed in white, navy, and bamboo, it's fashionable and eco-conscious, and part of the company's continued build-out of products rolling out with a nearly-completed $5M Series A funding round, backed by the founders of YETI, Pentland Ventures, and other VC and angel investors.

Windmill founder Mike Mayer, the third generation of a family air-conditioning biz in New York, is great at talking about business ventures without emitting too much hot air, so I checked in with him on the eve of introducing Windmill's newest product.

David Hochman: Where did the idea to expand beyond air conditioning come from? Was it during the pandemic?

Mike Mayer: We never intended to be just an air conditioning company. From the start, we wanted to be a broader air care brand, focused on home comfort. Air purification was always high on our list, and the pandemic -- and environmental issues, including wildfires -- made it more relevant. During COVID, a flood of ugly, loud, clunky air purifiers hit the market. We saw a gap for a product that was both beautiful and high-performing.

Hochman: Honestly, to me, air purifiers are all the same. What sets yours apart from others?

Mayer: First, it's the only purifier with a real bamboo finish -- handcrafted, not just plastic made to look like wood. It also comes in sleek white and bold navy. Design-wise, it's inspired by the minimalist ""Japandi"" style, which is a blend of Japanese and Scandinavian aesthetics. It fits beautifully into nurseries, bedrooms, and living rooms. Functionally, it has true HEPA filters, energy-saving modes, and sleep modes -- whisper-quiet or white noise to help improve sleep quality.

Hochman: How often do you need to change the filter?

Mayer: We recommend every six months, but it depends on usage. You can extend the filter's life a bit by vacuuming the outside, but eventually, the HEPA filter will need replacing.

Hochman: What have you learned over the past five years?

Mayer: The biggest lesson? Stay level-headed. Early on, it's easy to get wide-eyed and excited, but things don't always go as planned. COVID hit just as we launched, shutting down factories. That was tough. But I've learned that perseverance pays off. We've grown to over 100,000 customers and entered stores like Home Depot, Best Buy, and Lowe's. Success takes real grit and a steady hand.

Hochman: What's next for you after air purifiers?

Mayer: We're building a suite of smart air care products. We've already launched an air circulator and fan. It has five speeds and connects to the same app that controls our air conditioners and purifiers. We plan to keep expanding the line, but right now, we're focused on perfecting this suite.

Hochman: Any cool moments where you've spotted your products unexpectedly?

Mayer: It's always fun when an influencer or reality TV star posts a picture with one of our products in the background. Recently, someone sent me a picture from a show where they spotted a couple of Windmill AC units on a building facade. It's rewarding to walk around a city and see them dotting buildings. We started with a few hundred units. Now we see them everywhere. In the air conditioning world, that's as cool as it gets."

As a poor kid growing up on the frayed edges of the most violent neighborhood in Detroit, I learned to look out for myself at an early age. A warm bed at the end of the day wasn't a guarantee; neither a safe home.

After my father left us without as much as a goodbye, my mother cycled through boyfriends upon whom she depended to make ends meet. That didn't stop one of them from hitting her in the head with an iron fireplace poker as I watched, horrified. I never got the chance at a sheltered childhood.

Perhaps because of my rocky upbringing, I'm proud that my home state of Massachusetts gives poor kids a chance at a sheltered childhood; at least, it tried to. Inaction, elitism, and apathy at the federal level, including from senior Bay State Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have forced state officials into a series of excruciating choices.

Almost invariably, the losers in those decisions have been disadvantaged children.

REPUBLICAN MARINE VET WINS PRIMARY TO TAKE ON ELIZABETH WARREN IN MASSACHUSETTS SENATE RACE

Since the 1980s, the state's ""right to shelter"" law has mandated that pregnant women and children will be housed no matter what, and for a long time that law worked really well; we were proud to be the only state to enshrine that in statute.

We had the lowest rate of homelessness in the country and the lowest number of veterans living on the streets. Through public-private partnerships, we built the model for how to meet our most vulnerable residents at the front door.

Then the migrant crisis began.

'SO-CALLED EXPERT BUREAUCRATS': FISHERMEN RIP SEN WARREN'S NEW PLAN TO 'SILENCE' THEM

Suddenly, millions of desperate men, women and children seeking better lives sought out Massachusetts as a haven where they knew lawmakers enshrined a right to have a roof over your head and three meals a day. It's become much more than that: no-bid contracts worth tens of millions of dollars went out to provide dry cleaning, cab rides, job training, and even down payments to afford first and last months' rent. To flip an old cliche, that's not a hand up; it's a handout.

Massachusetts is now spending more than $1 billion annually to plug the leaks in a system that isn't just breaking - it's breaking families.

Violent criminals, a small fraction of our 7,500 homeless migrant residents, have been charged with rapes, statutory rape, throwing bricks at police officers, and much more we don't know about because the state won't release full incident reports. Often, it's fellow migrants living alongside these individuals who are the victims.

ELIZABETH WARREN HAS FIERCE CLASH WITH CNBC HOST ON HARRIS' PRICE CONTROL PLAN: 'A FOOL'S ERRAND'

I'm running for United States Senate because I believe the most powerful deliberative body in the world needs a poor kid as a member. In Highland Park, my hometown, we had signs that literally read ""Police do not patrol here."" Today, Sen. Warren, is pressuring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to terminate its violent migrant detainer partnership with the only remaining sheriff in the state who will honor it - a good man who just happens to be from the opposite party.

The irony of escaping my childhood home only to see that same warning apply in my chosen home isn't lost on me.

Violence is just one symptom of the problem. Despite promising a right to shelter, we're seeing more and more migrants shoved out of the system to make room for the next surge. In Quincy, just south of Boston, more than 50 women and children are sleeping on sidewalks outside a train station. All because politicians who never had to sleep outside a day in their lives are too afraid to deal with a problem they created.

RIPPLE BACKS MARINE VETERAN, PRO-CRYPTO LAWYER IN BATTLE FOR ELIZABETH WARREN'S SENATE SEAT

One state can't house the whole world, but we certainly tried. Comprehensive immigration reform, including a secure southern border, is the minimum threshold to meet this crisis head on. But when President Biden supported a bipartisan bill that would cap migrant crossings to 1,400 per day, Warren voted against it. She insists that a pathway to citizenship for every migrant is the right thing to do, but makes no mention of how or where they're supposed to live.

Pandering to extreme special interest groups keeps people like Warren in power, and it's the first habit I intend to break if I'm fortunate enough to serve the families and neighbors I now call friends. We must get back to commonsense, bipartisanship in this country to find real solutions for our problems.

Our immigration system is broken. It is bankrupting the commonwealth and placing the burden on the taxpayers. It is stressing our state's education system and infrastructure. The migrant crisis is not a problem that will just go away, it takes real leadership and courage to find a solution that puts people before party.

In Massachusetts, we pride ourselves on leading in everything from democracy to the digital age. We've lost sight of that in this crisis, and it's time we admit it.

How Immigration Can Become A Strategic Solution For U.S. Housing Needs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2024/10/08/how-immigration-can-become-a-strategic-solution-for-us-housing-needs/,2024-10-08T13:11:57Z,"As the United States grapples with housing shortages, the influx of migrants and homelessness, the need for innovative, scalable, and humane solutions has never been more urgent. Traditional housing approaches prioritizing permanent solutions, often miss the mark. Whether it is young people seeking to buy their first home, individuals moving to new cities, immigrants who have just landed, migrants shuttled to a new state, or unsheltered homeless people in California, a flexible and forward-thinking housing model is essential. And Immigration may be able to contribute to such a solution.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have made housing a key issue in the current presidential race. Vice President Harris promises to ""cut the red tape that stops housing construction, take on corporate landlords hiking rental prices, work with builders and developers to construct 3 million new homes and rentals, and help first-time homebuyers with $25,000 down payment assistance."" On the other hand, President Trump focuses on deregulation, proposing the opening of federal land for housing development and reducing regulatory hurdles to speed up construction. He opposes rent controls and aims to preserve single-family zoning, framing it as protecting suburban communities.

While these proposals target housing shortages through construction and regulatory reform, neither candidate has sufficiently focused on a critical opportunity: using immigration policy to address U.S. housing needs.

When Congress passed the Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 (RIA) to reform the EB-5 investor immigration program, it created three priority areas for EB-5 funding: high unemployment areas, infrastructure, and rural development. The EB-5 program enables foreign investors to obtain U.S. residency by investing in job-creating projects. Historically, the program has been used for commercial developments, luxury housing, and large-scale projects. However, expanding the EB-5 program to include affordable housing projects could significantly benefit U.S. cities facing severe housing shortages. By directing foreign capital into affordable housing developments, investor immigration could become a key component in solving the U.S. housing crisis. What is proposed here is to add housing to the EB-5 program as a fourth priority. This expansion would encourage foreign investors to channel their investments into developments in cities with the most pressing housing needs, such as affordable apartments in urban centers or temporary housing for new migrants in need of immediate shelter.

To further enhance the program, the U.S. could introduce an Expression of Interest (EOI) system for selecting such EB-5 investors. Such a system is currently in use in Canada, for example, to avoid long backlogs in processing of applications. The system would allow the government to pre-select investors based on factors such as their language proficiency, integration potential, ties to the U.S., and the urgency of housing needs in specific areas. By prioritizing high-quality investors who align with U.S. housing goals, the government can ensure that projects are completed efficiently and in a timely manner. This approach adds flexibility, allowing the U.S. to target investors who are not only financially capable but also committed to contributing to the communities they are entering while preventing frustrating backlogs.

Apart from helping young people looking to buy their first homes and people moving across the country to locate a house they can afford, expanding the EB-5 program for housing, together with some innovative programs we will mention shortly, would also help ensure that migrants and refugees arriving in the U.S. have access to adequate living conditions as they settle into new communities. This approach could reduce the pressure on cities and states already struggling with limited housing availability and strained public resources.

As migrants and refugees continue to arrive in the U.S., the availability of immediate, safe housing is critical to their successful integration. Cities that experience sudden surges in migrant populations often face a severe shortage of affordable housing, leaving many new arrivals without a place to live. Traditional housing models, focused on permanent homes, can take years to develop, and temporary shelters are often overcrowded and unsafe.

A more flexible housing model is needed to address these immediate needs. The U.S. could adopt innovative solutions like those used by Dignity Moves, a California-based nonprofit that provides interim housing for homeless individuals. Dignity Moves constructs affordable, dignified prefabricated units on vacant or underutilized land, providing private, lockable spaces for individuals in need of temporary shelter. This approach could be adapted to house migrants and refugees, offering them a safe place to live while they go through the immigration process and work towards more permanent housing.

To make these solutions work, public-private partnerships will be essential. Local governments, private investors, and nonprofits must work together to ensure that new housing is built quickly and affordably. As already mentioned, the EB-5 program can serve as a key funding mechanism by incentivizing foreign investors to contribute to affordable housing projects in exchange for U.S. residency. Local governments can further support these efforts by offering tax incentives, zoning benefits, and streamlined permitting processes to developers focused on affordable housing. Additionally, philanthropic organizations and corporate social responsibility initiatives can play a role by providing grants and operational support to nonprofits working on innovative housing solutions.

The U.S. housing crisis demands bold and innovative solutions that go beyond traditional construction and regulation reforms. By integrating immigration programs like EB-5 with innovative housing development programs like those mentioned and incorporating an Expression of Interest system to select the most suitable investors, the U.S. can address both the immediate housing needs of migrants and refugees and the broader national shortage of affordable housing while avoiding long immigration backlogs. This could be a game-changing approach to solving the problem involving creative partnerships between governments, private investors, and nonprofits -- all working together to ensure that everyone, from young couples buying their first home, to newly arrived migrants, to homeless people, has a place to call home."
Jason Schreier's 'Play Nice': The Monstrous Evolution Of Blizzard Is A Fascinating Ride,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/08/jason-schreiers-play-nice-the-monstrous-evolution-of-blizzard-is-a-fascinating-ride/,2024-10-08T13:11:52Z,"Author of Blood, Sweat and Pixels and Press Reset, Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier is back with yet another deep dive into the industry, this time focused on one of its most storied companies, Blizzard Entertainment.

Out today, Play Nice: The Rise, Fall and Future of Blizzard Entertainment spans the entire history of the company including a ""break point"" when ""Old Blizzard"" became ""New Blizzard,"" thought Schreier says that's not where you'd think.

As a frequent player of most of Blizzard's catalogue, the book was an excellent read. It did everything from make me wish Blizzard made a Star Wars RTS to feel empathy for Diablo 3 scapegoat Jay Wilson.

Of course the subject matter is as relevant as ever in the wake of the Microsoft acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and as that's only spooling up, it's briefly touched on. The future under Microsoft is an unwritten chapter but everything up until this point is fascinating to read, though sometimes tragic with the company's recently unearthed treatment of women.

Any fan of Blizzard games at any point in the company's lifespan would be well to read Play Nice, and to get a bit more into it, I sat down with Schreier recently to ask him about some specifics.

How long does something like this take to write?

SCHREIER: Well, the book took about three years to report and write. I would say the reporting takes the majority of the time. Bloomberg was very generous and gave me three months of book leave to sit and write the thing. The reporting took a lot longer than that just because I spoke to 350 plus people for the book. Very time consuming.

There are an endless amount of big gaming companies, so why did you think you wanted to pick Blizzard specifically?

There are a few reasons. It's true that there are endless numbers of gaming companies, but few are as storied and are as interesting and inspire as many strong emotional reactions as Blizzard. In fact, I would say that they and Nintendo are probably the only two companies that have achieved what they have with that. There are no other companies in the world that have not just had one hit franchise, but five multibillion dollar franchises, franchises that are beloved and inspire fan fiction and sequels and spin-offs and costumes. And how many other gaming companies have their own conventions dedicated just to them? It's pretty wild, so those things Blizzard have done are the seeds for this book.

Was there something kind of specific that you found out about the origins of Blizzard during the research, something that you didn't know when you were starting?

There were some a mix of big things and little things, like little details that have never been reported that I had no idea about. So for example, the fact that Blizzard was briefly flirting with making a Star Wars RTS game, and that was before they started making StarCraft. It was kind of like, hey, we got this deal with Lucas to do Star Wars. Ohh actually it's not happening. Who knows how real that was, but hey, well, we have this this sci-fi thing. Might as well do our own new sci-fi RTS game. Little details.

One of my favorite anecdotes in the book is about the Blizzard folks back in 1996, when Warcraft 2 came out, they knew they really made it because they got a customer service call and it was this guy calling to ask about some bug or something, and then his wife got on the phone and was like, are you on the phone with that stupid company? That game is why we don't have sex anymore. People got a kick out of that to the point where they kept playing the recording of it on the office intercom over and over.

And then of course, there's also kind of more negative stories and anecdotes as well that that surprised me that I get into in the book. But yeah, so many things made me think holy crap, I can't wait for people to read this and see all of these wild stories.

What's your favorite Blizzard game?

I would say StarCraft 2 is the game that I have played the most and love the most. It used to be Diablo 2. Diablo 2 was my thing. When I was a teenager and I had nothing else to do but hang out in my parent's attic.

Same, yeah.

It's like if you're a millennial in your mid 30s, you've probably spent a lot of time playing Diablo 2 back in the day, but StarCraft 2 really resonated with me. That was the game where I started playing it as my career as a video game reporter was starting. The beta came out at the beginning of 2010...I started watching videos from Day9 that showed you how to play and how to get good at it and that became my game that I was good at and just stuck to for years and years and years. It's still a game I revisit every once in a while, and just kind of play one-on-one online with people, so StarCraft 2 is definitely my favorite.

Well, too bad they can't monetize RTS games anymore, so we'll see if it ever returns.

It is too bad they can't seem to. They can't seem to get other StarCraft projects off [the ground] either.

Is there a moment or kind of inflection point that when you think ""Old Blizzard"" became ""New Blizzard""?

Yes. And I think my answer is probably different than your average Blizzard fan's answer, because my answer is that Blizzard changed irrevocably and completely the day that November in 2004 with World of Warcraft. That was the day the Blizzard changed entirely. Because when World of Warcraft came out and then it wound up exploding and reaching 5 million players within a year, which was beyond the even most optimistic projections of anyone at the company. When that happened, Blizzard, almost overnight, turned from a company of hundreds of people into a company of thousands of people to keep up with the demand. Customer service and the community management and all the other stuff that they needed, they started BlizzCon, they moved to their big campus in Irvine, they merged with Activision, it set them on this path of growth and transformed them into an entirely different company, which had so many different repercussions, both positive and negative.

That's a good answer. I did think you were going to say the Activision merger. I'm sure that's probably one of the more common answers.

Blizzard was owned by Vivendi and Vivendi Games merged with Activision in 2007. For the first few years of that merger, nothing really changed or happened differently. It was only really a little bit later, closer to 2013, that the pressure from Activision started to come on Blizzard executives, and that didn't really even manifest on lower levels until much, much later. After that, closer to 2017/2018, so almost 10 years after the merger is really when it started having the biggest impact on people on the ground level at Blizzard.

If we're doing spoilers, what was one of the most kind of surprising revelations you found over the course of writing the book?

Oh man, like, there's so many. There's so many things that surprised me. I know you're Diablo guy, so getting to sit down with Jay Wilson for a while, the director of Diablo 3, and hearing his story about the kind of emotional breakdown that he went through and him really opening up about his his struggles in the wake of Diablo 3, becoming the internet's punching bag, that was really interesting to hear. I was certainly surprised by some of the details about the corporate drama between Activision and Blizzard. That was another interesting one. Really everything. I mean, there's so much in there, like every game that Blizzard made has some interesting kind of twist or story behind it that I think people don't know about or maybe kind of tangentially saw years ago.

What was a Blizzard game that got killed that you would have actually wanted to see released?

The one that I heard the most about and this book is reporting on this for the first time is a game called Avalon. And Avalon was supposed to be Blizzard's take on Minecraft, kind of the Warcraft spin on Minecraft and a better comparison might be Dragon Quest Builders. It's got more story and is more of an RPG. I think that was part of the idea of Avalon as well. I heard from a couple of people who were like ""this game was so cool, man.""

Gamers and also journalists and critics and people who just observe the video game industry tend to romanticize cancelled games, and I think there's a good reason for that because cancelled games exist in in amber, perfectly preserved, never to come out and reveal their flaws to us. There are a lot of times where we're like, oh, man, I wish that had come out. And if it had come out, it might have been terrible. So I do think there's something fun about the romanticization of these canceled games because they can never come out and disappoint us.

We could live in a parallel universe where Project Titan was the biggest game on the planet.

As a project it sounded interesting as kind of a novelty, but as a player it didn't sound up my alley

In terms of the Xbox situation now and just sort of the Old Blizzard versus New Blizzard thing, when separated out from Activision and Call of Duty, if it's standing with it's just current existing franchises, would you consider Blizzard healthy at this point? Obviously, it might not be in its glory days, but do you think it's healthy or is it still sort of on the decline?

I mean from a business perspective, I don't think Blizzard has ever not been profitable. I think there's a question of whether those profits have grown and grown consistently enough for some like Bobby Kotick, we don't have numbers of them anymore. Activision Blizzard every year used to publish breakdowns that was like here is our revenue and profit for each division. Here's Activision's. Here's Blizzard's. Here's Kings. And that was very helpful in that you could see Blizzard's trajectory and that is no longer the case. Microsoft doesn't do that.

Do you think going over this whole story of Blizzard's history now, do you think anything from the past might be predictive about the future of Microsoft?

I don't know because Xbox is such a big question mark. I think you and I have both written a bit about how baffling their current moves are and even people who run the division know what they're doing or what's going to happen in the coming years, I mean, their decisions this year have been just incomprehensible, so it's hard to know what they're going to do with Blizzard."
New Study Finds Harris's Down Payment Subsidy Would Raise Home Prices,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adammillsap/2024/10/08/new-study-finds-harriss-down-payment-subsidy-would-raise-home-prices/,2024-10-08T13:11:46Z,"Back in August, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris proposed $25,000 in taxpayer-funded down payment assistance to four million first-time homebuyers. While the intent of the program is to offset the high cost of housing, a new analysis from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) finds that it would have the opposite effect, actually raising national home prices by 4%.

Kamala Harris's plan sounds simple enough: Give people money they can use to supplement their down payment, thus making it easier to buy a home. Unfortunately, real life is more complicated. Shortly after the plan was announced, more astute observers pointed out that subsidizing demand when there is a housing shortage in most areas would likely increase prices, not lower them. Why? Because when supply is constrained, subsidies that boost demand do not lead to more supply. Instead, the price rises until the higher demand meets the limited supply.

In housing markets throughout the United States, the supply of housing is constrained by land-use regulations -- density restrictions, minimum lot sizes, apartment bans -- and permitting processes that restrict construction. In such markets, economic theory tells us that housing subsidies are largely captured by the sellers of homes in the form of higher prices. Sure enough, that is what AEI scholars Edward Pinto, Tobias Peter, and Sissi Li find in their new study.

Building on a study published in the Journal of Housing Economics, Pinto and coauthors find that Harris's down payment assistance would increase home prices by 4.1% on average. They estimate the program would increase the total cost of the homes purchased by the four million subsidized homebuyers by $177 billion, which is more than the $100 billion total value of the subsidy (four million times $25,000 each). This means that on average the subsidy is not even helpful for those who get it. But it gets worse: The first-time homebuyers who receive the subsidy would bid up the prices of all homes, not just those they ultimately purchase, and the authors estimate that the total price increase would hit $1 trillion. Ouch.

America is a big place with hundreds of regional housing markets, so in addition to the national impact the authors estimate the impact of the subsidy on the 100 largest metropolitan areas. The program's impact on housing prices would vary by place due to differences in current home prices and inventories, as shown in the map below. In expensive areas, such as coastal California, $25,000 doesn't go very far so the impact on prices would be relatively small, around 1% to 2%. In cheaper areas like the Midwest, the program would boost prices by as much as 6%.

Though the AEI study's results may seem counterintuitive, they support what economic theory predicts: When supply is constrained, subsidies that boost demand also increase prices. The only sustainable way to decrease housing prices, or at least slow their growth, is to build a lot more housing. The only way to build more housing is to reform the land-use regulations and permitting processes that artificially constrain it. Harris should put her down payment assistance plan back on the shelf and instead urge state and local officials to make it easier to build housing in their communities."
Ron DeSantis says Harris has 'no role' in Hurricane response: 'I don't have time for political games',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ron-desantis-says-harris-has-no-role-hurricane-preparation-i-dont-have-time-political-games,2024-10-08T13:08:05Z,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis discusses Vice President Kamala Harris accusing him of 'political gamesmanship' on 'Hannity.'

Gov. Ron DeSantis hit back at Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday during an interview on Fox News' ""Hannity,"" as the Florida governor prepares for another hurricane, Hurricane Milton, to hit the state.

""For Kamala Harris to try to say my sole focus on the people of Florida is somehow selfish is delusional,"" DeSantis said. ""She has no role in this, in fact, she's been vice president for three and a half years, I've dealt with a number of storms under this administration, she's never contributed anything to any of these efforts.""

NBC News, and later ABC News, reported on Monday that the Florida governor was not taking calls from Harris regarding storm recovery efforts, citing unnamed aides to the governor who said the calls seemed political in nature.

Asked by Fox News' Sean Hannity if she has ever called before while preparing for hurricanes, DeSantis said, ""no.""

""She has no role in this process. I'm in contact with the President of the United States. I'm in contact with the FEMA director, I'm obviously managing all of our state agencies, we're supporting all our local government,"" he added.

When Harris was asked about DeSantis reportedly dodging her phone calls on Monday, the vice president accused him of playing politics.

""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations ... is just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris said to reporters on Monday. ""It is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first.""

DeSantis said he worked well with both the Trump and the Biden administrations when it came to dealing with hurricane preparation and response efforts.

""She's the first one who's trying to politicize the storm, and she's doing that just because of her campaign,"" DeSantis said. ""I don't have time for political games. I've got people whose lives are on the line, I've got people whose homes and possessions are on the line, and we are focused 100% on that mission.""

Regarding the White House response, spokesperson Andrew Bates told Fox News Digital, ""A wide range of leaders in both parties and from every affected state have praised the bipartisan response to Hurricane Helene. The Republican governor of South Carolina, Henry McMaster, has called the response 'superb.' Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a Republican, said, 'They're doing a great job.' Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer said, 'We are seeing incredible help from the Federal government to the state.' The Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, has said he 'appreciated' President's Biden's offer to 'call him directly' with any 'other things we need.'""

Bates then listed other Republican officials, including Republican governor of Virginia and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham who offered praise for Biden.

Fox News Power Rankings: The biggest surprises come after October,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-power-rankings-biggest-surprises-come-after-october,2024-10-08T13:04:54Z,"Fox News Poll Republican partner Daron Shaw on how Trump and Harris are polling with significant voter groups and in swing states ahead of the general election.

A Democratic win in Indiana. A Republican victory in New Mexico. And an election where Missouri was decided by less than 4,000 votes.

They've all happened in the last twenty years.

These results are little more than trivia questions today (the answers are 2008, 2004, and 2008 again). At the time, they raised eyebrows and changed our understanding of the electorate.

Surprises happen on election week. And when the national race looks this close, one unexpected flip can decide who wins the White House.

Vice President Harris still has the edge in this week's forecast. It predicts that Harris will take home at least 241 electoral college votes to Trump's 219.

Her advantage is no larger than it was in September, and as this column has mentioned, battleground states are usually - and mostly - won and lost together. The six toss-up states in this forecast are worth 78 votes, enough to give either candidate a victory on election night.

National polls show a tight race: a Quinnipiac survey has Harris and former President Trump tied at 48%-48% with likely voters, while Marist has the candidates at 50%-48%, well within the polls' margins of sampling error.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON TWO TOP ISSUES

Neither poll shows Trump slipping with the national electorate. Other recent polls showed a point worth of erosion after the September presidential debate.

Battleground state polls have been sparse. (Hurricane Helene has devastated communities in Georgia and North Carolina, and Hurricane Milton will soon make landfall in Florida. This will affect the accuracy of polling in these areas.)

Overall, this race is still anyone's game.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance debated a week ago in New York City. Vance mostly broke through the character that Democrats had constructed for him, while Walz stumbled out of the gate.

A flash poll showed neither candidate winning the night. As always, wait for results from multiple polls conducted in the weeks after the debate to properly assess the polling impact.

That was the only scheduled event that could surprise voters this month. (Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate later in October.)

Of course, it's the unexpected events in years past that have done more to reshape the race. And events in two categories have already resurfaced.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Polarization will limit the impact of these events on the horserace. But watch Harris and Trump's support with independents over the coming weeks. Those voters made up 5% of the electorate in 2020, and they broke for President Biden by 15 points; recent polls put Harris in that ballpark. Trump likely needs to claw that back to win the race.

Two states that could surprise in November

There are nine ""likely"" races on the Power Rankings map. The two that would have the biggest impact on the race are Florida and Virginia.

Former President Trump improved his performance in Florida in the 2020 presidential election, bringing his margin up to about 372,000 votes.

That's a win of 3.4 points, or his second-closest victory of the cycle. (The closest was North Carolina, a toss-up in the rankings, which he won by 1.3 points.)

Republicans have strong advantages. The state's White working-class and senior voters lean towards Trump, while its large Hispanic population, particularly the Cuban and Venezuelan communities, has shifted right in recent years.

The GOP won big at every level in the midterms and enjoys a 1 million-plus voter registration advantage, and most tellingly, the Democratic Party is not making significant investments.

Democrats hope that a competitive Senate race, where incumbent Republican Rick Scott has personally spent more than $8 million, means the presidential election is closer than people think. Florida is also one of three competitive states with an abortion measure on the ballot.

It would take a blowout night for Harris to flip the Sunshine State. It would also be the first state after the battlegrounds to go blue.

Florida stays at Likely R in the rankings.

A win for Trump in Virginia would also be shocking, especially since Biden won this state by more than 10 points in 2020.

The state has a higher proportion of Black, suburban, and college-educated voters than the rest of the country, and all three groups help Democrats run up the margin. While Republicans talked about Virginia after the June presidential debate, the race has changed, and neither party is making big investments in the state today.

Some polls show a race that isn't over for the GOP. A survey from Virginia Commonwealth University in September put Harris at 47% with registered voters and Trump at 37%. A poll from the Washington Post earlier in the month had Harris at 50% to Trump's 42%.

Still, it would take a blowout in the other direction for the Old Dominion to reject Harris. Virginia remains a Likely D race.

Notion And Stripe Trust This Year-Old Startup To Make Sure Their AI Tools Work,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2024/10/08/braintrust-ai-evals-raises-36-million-a16z/,2024-10-08T13:03:09Z,"Ankur Goyal built infrastructure for AI products twice before at Impira and Figma. Now, his AI evaluations startup Braintrust is valued at about $150 million following a $36 million Series A round led by a16z.

Three months after a tech company releases new software utilizing artificial intelligence, Ankur Goyal's team usually gets the call for help. As more users try the company's shiny new AI tools, complaints that it provides nonsensical answers follow close behind.

""People are good at predicting what people will need an AI tool for. The hard part is that if you just type something up and ship it, it doesn't work,"" Goyal said. ""It's like baking without measuring the ingredients: you end up with mush.""

Goyal's startup, Braintrust, caters to that challenge. Its software evaluates and monitors how an AI product is performing, then helps pinpoint the problem when something breaks. Bake in Braintrust for just a few weeks, and companies typically see their AI products' self-reported accuracy - how it scores on a test such as for factual accuracy - soar from below 40% to north of 80%, Goyal claimed.

Just a year old, Braintrust is already used by several unicorns, including Airtable, Brex, Instacart and Stripe. The company's dozens of customers, a group that have doubled in the past three months, Goyal said, typically pay tens of thousands of dollars and sometimes more than $100,000. Now, Braintrust has raised $36 million in a Series A round led by a16z partner Martin Casado to reach more companies beyond the Silicon Valley bubble.

The funding values the San Francisco-based startup at about $150 million, according to a source with knowledge. Braintrust and a16z declined to comment on the valuation. Cloud leaders Databricks and Datadog also joined the round.

Braintrust works by providing a software development kit, or SDK, for a business to operate within its own IT infrastructure. At first, AI early adopters like Notion and Zapier layered its evaluations (""evals"" to industry practitioners) on top of what they'd already built to better gauge performance. It could show them how tweaks, like using more customized prompts or switching from OpenAI's GPT-4 to Anthropic's Claude, helped or hurt accuracy.

Today, companies are integrating Braintrust's evaluations before a tool launches, then using its monitoring tools to track and trace how well and how often its delivering prompts. The company also offers building blocks of code, known as functions, to help product developers and others newer to AI to help bridge the gap between a company's non-AI core product features and its experimental, model-based additions. ""We're not an AI product ourselves, although there are AI components in it,"" Goyal said. ""We're more a tool for helping everyone else to build AI software.""

With Braintrust, Goyal is hoping to solve a problem for others that he previously worked on twice: first at a startup he founded and led as CEO called Impira, earning Goyal a spot on the Forbes Under 30 list for 2020, and later at Figma, the product software unicorn that acquired it in January 2023. Impira's use of machine learning to automatically extract data from documents and invoices required building out in-house evaluations; at Figma, Goyal helped with similar problems, but this time for features like the design software's visual search, which can surface similar results from a user's assets library.

Goyal only lasted eight months at Figma. While on a long walk with one of the backers of his previous company, Elad Gil, he realized that the jury-rigged solutions he'd built internally addressed a more universal and growing problem. After speaking with 25 potential customers, Goyal decided to launch Braintrust in August 2023.

""There was a common stack that enterprises need to build over and over in order to use modern AI approaches, and the key wedge into that stack is the evals,"" Gil told Forbes. ""This allows you to take the vibes out of AI development and actually understand what's happening.""

At $5 billion-valued Zapier, cofounder Bryan Helmig said the workflow automation platform's AI tools now handle tens of millions of tasks every month. But before using Braintrust, controls to catch when the AI hallucinated were ""ad hoc."" The company turned to the startup first for its evaluations, then started using its logging and management of datasets of prompts, too. ""It's a grab bag of a lot of the utility stuff you need, the grunt work around deploying generative AI,"" Helmig said.

Notion, the productivity software maker last valued at $10 billion, also fancied itself an aggressive early adopter of LLMs. But as developers shared individual failed prompts and errors with each other manually via files, ""it felt like we were in the dark ages,"" said cofounder Simon Last. One of Braintrust's heaviest users, Notion is now pushing the startup to be able to process more and more of its product interactions, he added. ""It lets us build much more complex stuff, more confidently,"" he said.

With evals increasingly a subject of conversation and recognition among developers in the AI community ( ""The future belongs to those who do evals"", X.ai cofounder Greg Yang posted on X last month), Braintrust isn't the only company eyeing solutions. A startup called Galileo announced its own models for evaluating other LLMs in June; one large software unicorn's CTO told Forbes that their company had selected a U.K.-based challenger, Humanloop, instead of Braintrust for a trial. The model providers themselves are also unlikely to stay out of Braintrust's turf. A week ago, OpenAI announced its own basic evaluations tools.

For Braintrust and its supporters, more attention on evals is a good thing. Prominent AI research labs are power users of Braintrust, in frequent contact with the team for insights into how customers are using their models, Goyal said (he declined to name them). Braintrust also counts as investors and supporters the CEOs of Datadog, AI unicorn Hugging Face, customers Airtable and Instacart, as well as former Lattice CEO Jack Altman; OpenAI cofounder Greg Brockman and board director Adam D'Angelo, the CEO of answers site Quora, are also personal backers.

Investors also noted that Braintrust and its ilk will provide more neutral building blocks for companies looking to work with the major AI research labs interchangeably, similar to cloud businesses flourishing alongside heavyweights Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. At Notion, cofounder Last said that companies would be ""insane"" to put all their eggs in one basket with one model provider like OpenAI. ""Nobody wants to be stuck,"" he said.

""I view this as a new systems layer, where you've got an unreliable substrate - the AI models - and you need a bunch of code to make programming work on top,"" said a16z's Casado, who first tested Braintrust against its peers as a hobbyist programmer looking to build games with LLMs, then again more formally with his firm. ""I think there's a new type of product developer that's emerging... this can make you a sophisticated LLM programmer right away.""

The biggest risk to Braintrust, according to Goyal, is not that it might be outmaneuvered; it's that AI tools in general might fail to live up to their promise. ""If AI is impactful, Braintrust is incredibly well positioned,"" the CEO said. ""If it turns out not to be a big disruptive thing, well, that's a bet I'm willing to take."""
'Valorant' 9.07 Patch Notes Prove Updates Come Too Frequently,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/10/08/valorant-907-patch-notes-prove-updates-come-too-frequently/,2024-10-08T13:03:05Z,"Riot Games has released the patch notes for Valorant update 9.07, and they are underwhelming to say the least.

Not for the first time this year, the new Valorant patch is set to change nothing of note, with the most important parts of the patch notes being some bug fixes and tiny changes to competitive modes. There's basically nothing that will actually change your experience in most matches, unlike some more recent patches.

I feel like I've written similar patch notes updates quite a few times this year already, which tells me it's time for Valorant to move away from its rigid patch schedule and just release updates when there is something worthwhile to change. Releasing a patch every two weeks is great for a game like League of Legends, which always needs at least one or two changes, but for Valorant which has a smaller pool of characters to balance and a reasonably stable meta, it feels like overkill a lot of the time.

I also think it would improve the life of fans, as it can be pretty disappointing to see a tiny set of patch notes when you were hoping for a more significant change. It's just one of those small things that can make a bad day worse, and it seems like there's little to gain.

Looking at the 9.07 notes, there's seemingly nothing that couldn't be delayed for another two weeks and included in the next patch. Assuming that there is something a little more significant in the next set of patch notes, these updates can just be thrown in at the end as a bit of extra info, that won't get players' hopes up of significant changes.

I'm obviously not advocating for a Dota 2 style of patch schedule where updates come seemingly at random with little warning, because that's annoying for everyone. But I feel like the Valorant team shouldn't be afraid to skip a patch or two if there's very little going on.

Of course the more positive side of this argument is that Valorant is in such a good place that it clearly doesn't need a big balance patch every two weeks. When a game works as intended, which for the most part Valorant does, there isn't really any need to change it, as there is just as much chance that you will mess things up instead of making them better.

So, my message to Riot Games is to consider if each Valorant patch is really worth it, and to sack one off if it doesn't feel important enough."
How To Plan the Ultimate F1 Las Vegas Grand Prix Experience,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robreed/2024/10/08/how-to-plan-the-ultimate-f1-las-vegas-grand-prix-experience/,2024-10-08T13:02:45Z,"The Formula 1 season of the century arrives in Las Vegas, Nevada, on November 19th for the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Yes, that's a Tuesday, and the racing action doesn't start until Thursday night, but this is the party of the year. Bigger than the Super Bowl. Bigger than the Phoenix Open. Bigger than any single music festival. There's just no comparison. So you'll want a couple extra days to ramp up ahead of the official race weekend.

Formula 1 arrived back in Las Vegas in 2023 after a prolonged hiatus. This modern Las Vegas Grand Prix (LVGP) features a street circuit on the famed Strip, and despite so much criticism and hopes that it would fail, the new LVGP was an absolute banger. It was voted the second-best race of the season by F1 fans, but it was actually the best race -- defined by on-track action -- as fans only voted for Singapore last year because Red Bull didn't win. This year promises to be even better because everything is at stake.

We'll be coming off the US-Mexico-Brazil triple header. We'll have two weeks to catch our breath before F1 cars are, once again, pegged in eighth gear and hitting 200-plus mph on the Strip. No one knows where we'll stand in terms of the World Drivers' Championship (WDC) and World Constructors' Championship (WCC). Will Lando Norris close the gap to Max Verstappen over the next three races, such that he can take the WDC lead in Vegas? Will this be the race where Ferrari surpasses Red Bull in the WCC? Will Mercedes spoil the party? Will Colapinto make Williams further question its 2025 driver lineup? Will Verstappen return to his winning form? These are the known unknowns. What we do know at this point is how to plan for an ideal F1 Vegas experience, as the 2023 race offered a ton of insight on how best to plan a trip to the LVGP.

The Wynn Las Vegas

The Wynn hosted a majority of the celebrities and VIPs for the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023. This kicked off with a red carpet welcome party. There was also a celebrity golf tournament with Drive to Survive stars i.e. F1 drivers, which was broadcast live on Netflix (a first for the streaming network); there was a film premier for Michael Mann's Ferrari; and a Sotheby's auction that featured Lewis Hamilton's first race-winning Mercedes F1 car. This was all part of the Wynn's ""Ultimate Race Week"" experience, which offers more than any single person can possible take in. You also had a string of great shows at the Wynn's famed XS Nightclub that featured top EDM artists: Marshmello, Dom Dolla, Rüfüs Du Sol, Black Coffee and others.

The ultimate flex, though, was Saturday night's afterparty at Delilah. This is one of the most exclusive restaurants in all of Las Vegas. It's part of the legendary, Los Angeles-based h.wood Group aka Brian Toll and John Terzian, which is known for superb dining experiences set in a party atmosphere with music and unrivaled star power. This invite-only gala following the race had four stages of velvet ropes to gain access, and it was packed with celebrities: Justin Bieber, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Casey Affleck, Brooklyn Beckham, James Harden, Sofia Vergara, Jon Hamm, Tyga, Shaun White, Nina Dobrev, Wiz Khalifa and Odell Beckham Jr. to name a few.

For 2024, the Wynn is offering three packages. Each features three nights' accommodations with two tickets. The premium package includes access to the Wynn Grid Club. This is an exclusive hospitality suite on the second floor of the Paddock building overlooking the start/finish straight with views of the pit boxes directly below -- which means you're on top of the team garages. A superb selection of food and beverages is included, along with convenient shuttles to and from the hotel. The location of the Wynn is ideal, as it's just north of the track so it's not as encumbered by the race as hotels that sit on the course itself.

Fontainebleau Las Vegas

The Fontainebleau is new to Las Vegas and the LVGP, as the luxury resort hotel and casino just opened this year. The Miami property is certainly one of the best hotels for the Miami Grand Prix, so the brand has plenty of experience in hosting F1 fans. This is home to LIV Nightclub with resident DJs including Dom Dolla, John Summit and Calvin Harris. So the post-race EDM entertainment will be on point. The property is located on the Strip to the north of the track, which is just close enough to the action without succumbing to the congestion of being on the course itself.

The Fontainebleau is offering one of the more compelling Paddock Club packages. It's called LIV on the Grid, and it's located on the rooftop of the Paddock building. This was an open area for 2023, which allowed all Paddock Club guests to check out the unique view of the start/finish straight along with turns 1-3 and 17. This new activation will be similar in spirit to the Hard Rock Beach Club in Miami, where you'll experience the Grand Prix from an open-air nightclub with premium tables, bottle service and top DJ performers. The headliner for the race on Saturday night is none other than Dom Dolla. This is a three-day ticket that is inclusive of the same premium food and beverage offerings you'll get in a standard hospitality suite.

In addition, the Fontainebleau is offering a Race Club Grandstand Package in the T-Mobile Zone at the Sphere, which is one of the better spots for seeing on-track action. The packages include a room, two three-day passes and transportation to and from the T-Mobile Grandstand area.

Resorts World

If you're choosing one of the club experiences (see below), then you don't need a hotel package with official race access. If this is the case, then Resorts World is offering a few ""Race World"" experiences that bundle a multi-night room at the Conrad tower with VIP access to Zouk Nightclub or else a wellness package with spa credit and other amenities to aid in recovering from the parties. Zouk will host shows featuring DJ artists James Hype, Meduza, Kaskade, Deadmau5, Carl Cox and Illenium throughout the race weekend. As with the Wynn and Fontainebleau, Resorts World is ideally located on the Strip just north of the race course.

In addition to grandstand tickets and the top-tier Paddock Club experiences, there are a number of clubs along the Strip that will offer multi-day race parties with views of the track. These won't offer an ideal perspective for on-track action. Each is located on the Strip, so you just see cars going straight at high speed. However, the dirty secret about attending F1 races is that you watch most of it on TV no matter where you sit because it's the only way to know what's actually happening in the race. These club experiences are similar in spirit to what you get in the Paddock Club -- premium food and drink, freedom to roam around and socialize, comfortable seating, VIP treatment -- for a fraction of the cost.

Tao Group Hospitality Skydeck at Bellagio Fountain Club: An elevated, exclusive experience awaits race fans at the Tao Group Hospitality Skydeck at Bellagio Fountain Club for Friday (qualifying) and Saturday (race) nights. The Skydeck offers unobstructed views of the race and the iconic fountains, complete with VIP bottle service. Given that this is hosted by Tao Group, the DJ entertainment is certain to feature global headliners e.g. Fisher, Martin Garrix, Steve Aoki, etc. Though they may not be announced until the day of. Tables are offered with views of the fountain or the track with relative pricing tiers.

Boulevard Watch Party at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas: The Cosmopolitan is elevating race weekend with the ""Boulevard Experience,"" a souped-up watch party atop the Boulevard Pool. New for this year's race, the event will feature an alternative experience highlighted by a closed-circuit viewing of the live Las Vegas Grand Prix TV feed. The festivities will take place within a nightclub atmosphere above the circuit. There are general admission tickets available along with several VIP tiers.

Race Watch Party at OMNIA Nightclub: This is where I ended up watching the rescheduled FP1 from last year (recall the drain cover incident) at 2:30am while Steve Aoki played in the main room. This was without the benefit of TV screens, and it was still amazing. For 2024, Omnia (at Caesars Palace) is hosting an official watch party on its outdoor terrace for the race on Saturday night. Tickets will include elevated cuisine, VIP bottle service, views of the Strip and massive television screens to broadcast the race action. Plus, you can seamlessly transition to the main room at 12:00am for the post-race party. Max Verstappen ended up at Omnia last year (having already secured the WDC) to see fellow Dutchman Martin Garrix play, so this will certainly be one of the premier F1 after parties.

Papi Steak Las Vegas F1 Garage: Whereas its proper home is found in the Fontainebleau, Papi Steak from David ""Papi"" Einhorn & David Grutman's Groot Hospitality will offer a unique, three-day activation (Thursday - Saturday) in a garage alongside the F1 teams. This is on the track level of the Paddock building if that wasn't clear. It's tough to imagine what this will be like, but it's certain to be a privileged F1 viewing experience with over-the-top cuisine.

LAVO Party Brunch Presented by Casamigos: A special race-week themed edition of LAVO's famed Party Brunch will be powered by Casamigos. Decadent dishes, dancing on tables, bottle-popping presentations and sounds by the hottest DJs combine for a hedonistic daytime party. Casamigos cocktails will fuel the wild affair that takes over LAVO's dining room and expansive terrace overlooking the pre-race festivities as the Las Vegas Strip transforms into the racetrack for the weekend.

Cocktail Circuit at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas: The booziest lap in the city can be experienced November 22 and 23 at The Cosmopolitan for its ""Cocktail Circuit"" scheduled at Vesper Bar, Ghost Donkey, The Chandelier Bar and LPM. F1 fans will be guided to four destinations to explore a range of signature drinks from classics to new-age concepts created by the resort's award-winning mixology team.

Many of the F1 teams will offer activations with partner hotels, and these are open to all fans.

Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team Activation at ARIA: The lobby at ARIA will become the epicenter of excitement for Mercedes-AMG Petronas fans with an installation featuring race simulators, team merchandise and photo opportunities with a show car, among other specialized experiences.

Williams Racing Fan Zone at New York-New York: The Brooklyn Bridge in front of New York-New York will transform into a motorsport fan's dream with interactive experiences curated by the Williams Racing team. Free to explore, fans will get an inside look at what it means to be on the team.

MoneyGram Haas F1 Team Show Car and Memorabilia Display at The Cosmopolitan of Las VegasGuests wandering The Cosmopolitan will find a variety of complimentary race-weekend experiences including MoneyGram Haas F1 Team memorabilia as well as photo opportunities with a MoneyGram Haas F1 Team show car. A selection of race suits also will be on display while several local Las Vegas artists will be invited to customize helmets that celebrate the technology, sleek design and fashion of racing culture."
Brooke Shields Wants You To Rethink The Way You Use Hair Conditioner,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/celiashatzman/2024/10/08/brooke-shields-wants-you-to-rethink-the-way-you-use-hair-conditioner/,2024-10-08T13:02:41Z,"The new shampoo and conditioner by Commence, Brooke Shields's hair line, is completely changing wash day.

As the Founder & CEO of Commence, her haircare line for women over 40, Brooke Shields knows people can be a little skeptical about celebrity beauty lines. ""I actually embrace that, because I've never rested on my laurels with anything,"" Shields says. ""If I know somebody to get in the room, you have to be able to stay in the room. You have to prove yourself. That's why we see a lot of brands launch high and then fall off. I never wanted that. To me, it's about the long haul and the only thing that's going to give it that longevity is the efficacy of the product.""

The proof of that approach is in the latest launches for Commence. ""The new shampoo and conditioner are brilliant,"" Shields says. ""There were many discussions that went into them. My main concern was a deep cleansing shampoo that didn't strip the hair of the oils that you need in your hair and scalp. A lot of what we've seen does not do that. The other thing I wanted was foaming, which has no purpose, but we're all pretty attached to it. It stems from when we're little babies, and we still hold on to it. I was adamant about making sure that that was being satisfied, but in a way that would not strip your hair.""

The result is the Commence Detoxifying Shampoo, which includes the very first foaming oat ingredient found in haircare. The detoxifying shampoo deeply cleanses the hair at a micro level sans stripping, damaging or irritating the scalp. Perfecting the formula to Shields's specifications wasn't easy.

""There were a lot of challenges, but what we came up with was this plant-based, very almost organic feel that keeps your natural oils,"" says Mark Knitowski, head of Commence R&D. ""It's a soapberry sulfate, which works to create this rich foam lather that plays up this richness to your scalp. Soapberry is plant-based; it is able to cleanse deeply of any impurities while maintaining your natural oils. Then we use a foaming oat, which also has minerals and vitamins that work on your scalp, so it has multiple benefits.""

Then there's the matching conditioner, the Commence Probiotic Smoothing Conditioner, which, unusually, is designed to be applied to the scalp through the ends of hair to boost scalp health. The deeply nourishing and hydrating formula balances the biome of the scalp for maximum performance while protecting the hair and scalp from outside stressors.

""The conditioner is unique and different because we're starting with the scalp,"" Knitowski says. ""Upcycled orange polysaccharide helps to support hair growth. When you go into the salon, they massage your scalp because they want to stimulate it. We also have a coconut wax that creates that barrier, and a pre and probiotic that help to balance the scalp and the microbiome to accept all the nutrients and ingredients that help hair growth.""

Most conditioners are meant to be applied to the hair from the mid-shaft to the ends. ""People are afraid of putting a conditioner on their scalp because it's going to weigh down hair,"" Shields says. ""This is the first one that I'm not afraid if it touches my scalp; it's not going to suffocate my roots. The scalp environment has to be ready and appropriate to be able to accept the good stuff and the best of the ingredients."" It's a known fact that good hair starts from the scalp, and that's what the new shampoo and conditioner are all about. For maximum results, they should be used in tandem.

Though some would shy away from the formulating challenges that Shields proposes, Knitowski embraces them. ""We're always trying to figure out the right balance of creating something that's going to be beneficial to the scalp and the hair, but also provides a new way of doing it,"" he says, explaining that not a lot of brands are using these plant-based surfactants because they don't create a foaming effect, but they were able to rise to the challenge by adding the foaming oat.

""What's been amazing is we're not reinventing the wheel,"" Shields says. ""We're taking basics and finding a way to make them work. The efficacy is important, but there's other elements to it. There's the bigger DNA of the brand, which is for women over 40 and paying attention to them, because they are overlooked, and they are an incredible demographic. You can throw the millennials in, because they're now turning 40, so if you look exponentially at just numbers alone, it's a powerful demo.""

When Shields was in the process of launching Commence, she went straight to the source and asked women over 40 what they wanted and needed, as well as the challenges in their hair routines. ""I always start with an emotional standpoint,"" she says. ""Mark is working directly with the chemists, so there's no middleman."" As a result, thanks to their bespoke products, they can formulate exactly to the Commence community's specifications. That approach has paid off, with products selling out, consumers shopping an average of two products per purchase and plenty of repeat business.

Everything is considered from the point of view of the 40+ customer, down to the larger font on the packaging so they can grab the right bottle without their glasses. There are several ways these products are formulated specifically for women over 40. ""Part of it is the gentleness,"" Knitowski says. ""In addition to the non-stripping action of the shampoo, we're adding nutrients to the scalp so that when your hair starts to grow, it grows in healthier, so you're not trying to fix a problem.""

Once women turn 40, biochemical changes start to take place, as well as hormonal changes. ""Your hair [diameter] is smaller and the quality of your scalp is different,"" Shields says. ""There's patches of oily and dry with age. There are all these physical changes that happen, so we're formulated for those. How do you make sure that the root and pore get back to that voluptuousness so that we can grow healthier hair? We're analyzing what the shifts are, what the changes are and then how to address these things.""

A 2022 study found that all of the women participating had some degree of menopausal hair loss, and low estrogen levels can impact the growth cycle of hair by reducing the growth phase and delaying the stage when the hair regrows. Additionally, other research has found that during menopause, changes in hormones and aging can cause hair thinning, loss of volume and changes in hair texture. Going gray isn't the only sign of aging hair, according to research, but also a decline in the quality and quantity of hair.

While Shields has a large focus group thanks to the Commence community, she is squarely in the demographic herself and has seen her hair needs evolve. ""I come from a little bit of a different perspective, because I've had so much done to my hair over the course of decades,"" she says. ""It's been every color. I never really addressed skin health on my scalp because I didn't focus on it, but I needed to. I was always behind the eight ball and trying to get healthy hair back. It really does start at 40; I started noticing my hair was duller and it was thinning a little bit. I have a lot of hair, but the quality of it was starting to be lackluster. Also, my scalp got much more sensitive.""

Crucially, the Commence line is designed to work quickly. ""What I'm impressed with by us is that the undoing of damage is very quick in the process -- you don't wait a year to see a result. You feel the result,"" Knitowski says. ""I'm really proud of what we built because the efficacy of the products for what we've done and the price point we're offering is unsurpassed. We came together to understand the community and understand Brooke's vision and strategy.""

Commence will always focus on delivering what women over 40 need. ""I have a great team of experts around me,"" Shields says. ""There's so much that I've learned. I know what I want and I know what I don't want, and I know that I have communication with a demo of women that are being overlooked. They're not being paid attention to or respected enough, and they are looking to me to find answers for them through experts. Those are the pieces that are important to me as the founder."""
"Diversity Targets Met, But Engagement Lags - Why Inclusive Leadership Is Hard.",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/esmtberlin/2024/10/08/diversity-targets-met-but-engagement-lags--why-inclusive-leadership-is-hard/,2024-10-08T13:02:39Z,"By Dr. Sarah Horn, Program Director and Executive Coach, ESMT Berlin

For many, inclusive leadership is associated with one or both: compliance targets or diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives driven by external policymakers, HR departments, senior management, or assigned diversity officers. Over the past decades, these initiatives have made important strides but failed to create deeper change at a systemic level.

As a result, companies continue to find themselves puzzled by low employee engagement survey results. And despite having attended bias trainings, prioritized DEI goals, and followed recommended best practices in their people management processes, leaders remain unsure how to improve scores around sense of belonging or psychological safety. Why? Traditional approaches have failed to provide leaders with sufficient support to confront their deeply rooted beliefs, or those of their team members, often leaving them on their own to face challenges and feelings of failure.

Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt's ""elephant and the rider"" offers a helpful analogy. The ""rider"" symbolizes the rational mind, guiding leaders toward inclusive goals and practices. Yet, the ""elephant"" - representing ingrained beliefs, habits, and unconscious biases - frequently resists, pulling in another direction.

There is thus growing recognition that a new approach is needed. The #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which exposed systemic inequities in race, gender, and socioeconomic status, have further caused expectations around DEI and leadership to evolve. Inclusive leadership is increasingly regarded as both a business strategic and moral imperative. Today, psychological safety, mental health, fairness, and feeling connected and valued are considered essentials to a workplace where everyone thrives. Belonging (the ""B"" in DEIB) as the outcome of DEI initiatives is what ultimately defines success.

True inclusive leadership isn't easy, though. It demands self-awareness, a capacity for self-regulation, and the ability to communicate with compassion. At its core, it is grounded in vulnerability and self-knowledge, particularly an understanding of positionality.

Positionality is how our diverse identities (race, gender, socioeconomic or family of origin background, nationality, sexuality, education etc.) and life experiences shape our worldviews and guide how we navigate social environments, encouraging us to understand diversity beyond the typical (e.g., legally regulated) dimensions. It also informs our perception of privileges and barriers.

By reflecting on their positionality, leaders can understand how they might unintentionally reinforce exclusion and privilege, and how they can act to disrupt these patterns. This requires being mindful of both visible and invisible differences in people's backgrounds and experiences, and how these differences shape the way individuals engage with the world. Recognizing the intersectionality of diverse identities also helps leaders appreciate that these complexities not only deserve space to be expressed but can also enhance business outcomes. Engaging authentically with their own identities allows leaders to notice and actively dismantle barriers that prevent others from fully participating. While hard or uncomfortable for some, this inward journey is critical.

Inclusive leaders and employees co-create environments where different perspectives are considered and innovation thrives. They embody key qualities like empathy, which helps them listen, understand, and put themselves in others' shoes. They show courage by challenging the status quo and calling out biases, both individual and organizational. They hold themselves and others accountable - setting and demanding measurable DEIB goals, regularly reviewing the organization's culture, and seeking feedback to ensure everyone's sense of belonging. Humility allows them to recognize their limitations and admit mistakes. Curiosity keeps them learning and open to new, evolving perspectives.

Inclusive leadership is more than a style - it's a mindset grounded in values of respect, holistic well-being, and collective responsibility. Leaders and employees with an inclusive mindset take a stand, even if it means discomfort, conflict, or resistance. They lead through moments of awkwardness and embrace tension and conflicting demands. They take time for introspection and self-care to role model inclusive leadership at multiple levels:

Inclusive leadership is an ongoing journey of self-discovery and shared learning, which benefits individuals, teams, organizations, and society. The best leaders recognize that while we may not know where DEIB will be in a decade, the responsibility lies in taking the best decisions and actions today, based on the current knowledge and context.

To make the shift from a focus on DEIB programs to a more introspective, inside-out approach to inclusive leadership that everyone is responsible for:

Inclusive leadership is not only about compliance or quotas - it's about creating spaces where everyone can be their true selves. Leaders and employees who commit to this journey of growth and vulnerability build cultures of belonging, truly making a sustainable difference for people, their organization, and society."
Kazakhstan Referendum Will Reshape Nuclear Energy In Central Asia,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2024/10/08/kazakhstan-referendum-will-reshape-nuclear-energy-in-central-asia/,2024-10-08T13:02:32Z,"Kazakhstan has employed the time-honored practice of obtaining societal feedback by holding a referendum on October 6th, 2024, to determine whether it should begin constructing a nuclear power plant. With 64% of registered voters in the country submitting ballots, the referendum passed. 71.12% of voters voted in favor of building the plant, according to the Central Referendum Commission. At a time when several countries are giving nuclear a second look as part of the move toward lowering carbon emissions for energy production, this expression of popular opinion impacts the national energy supply and hydrocarbon export capacity at an important juncture in Kazakhstan's modernization. It is also an example of the region's popular engagement in major public policy questions.

The public perception of nuclear power in Kazakhstan has been marred by its history with the Soviet nuclear program. Formerly the location of the USSR's atomic weapon test grounds and poorly protected nuclear waste sites, Kazakhstan quickly and enthusiastically relinquished all things nuclear - including the world's fourth-largest nuclear arsenal when the Soviet Union dissolved. Even today, nuclear power remains divisive. Twenty public hearings were held by the government in the run-up to the referendum, with emotions running high.

Kazakhstan is the world's largest supplier of uranium, which puts it in a position to greatly benefit from introducing a nuclear power plant, moving the nuclear energy cycle up the supply chain, and eliminating the need to import natural gas. Currently, the country's population growth and industrial expansion are causing electricity deficits and forcing it to buy electricity from neighboring countries, a trend projected to worsen. As the world's largest uranium producer, Kazakhstan has the domestic supply to fuel a nuclear power station, offsetting a significant portion of the power deficit while diversifying its energy mix with zero carbon emissions generation.

As the country pursues the construction of a nuclear power plant, Kazakhstan must address several concerns, ranging from allaying public fears to navigating geopolitical headwinds, which can get rough. Soliciting the people's opinion aligns with the aspirations of Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who advanced the concept of the ""listening state"" that addresses the concerns of its citizens.

Now that it has the popular approval to build a nuclear power plant, Kazakhstan must partner with international actors to construct a safe and modern reactor. Russia, China, and South Korea are among the most likely partners, with Western powers like France also placing their own bids.

Russia's development of nuclear power in the region would draw upon the multi-decade experience of the state nuclear energy company, Rosatom, in building reactors abroad. Recently, Russia inked a deal with Uzbekistan to build Central Asia's first nuclear power plant. According to the Kremlin, Rosatom will build up to six nuclear reactors with a capacity of 55 megawatts, a smaller undertaking than the 2.4 gigawatts one agreed in 2018.

Kazakhstan and Russia cooperate across strategic and economic lines. They are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Eurasia Economic Union, the Common Security Treaty Organization, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Rosatom has an existing relationship with Kazatomprom, which draws it into Russia's nuclear energy orbit. An agreement with Rosatom would be understandable but could well raise eyebrows in the West, as the U.S. prohibited Russian uranium imports in August.

China, another strategic competitor to the West, is in the process of building enough nuclear energy capacity to surpass the U.S. and France by 2030. It has already entered a relationship with Kazatomprom to fuel this endeavor as a supplier of uranium ore and fuel assemblies. This has allowed the uranium industry in Kazakhstan to modernize further and increase its output. Chinese officials have expressed a desire for the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) to build reactors in Kazakhstan under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme.

Though Rosatom has demonstrated experience building reactors in other nations and is making a push to generate nuclear power in Central Asian nations, Chinese reactors have technological advantages. Notably, China has started to develop molten sand reactors (MSRs), which use molten sand rather than water to cool the reactor, an increasingly scarce resource in several Central Asian states. MSRs also produce less highly radioactive waste and can adapt to uranium-plutonium and thorium-uranium fuel cycles. China also plans to build dozens more nuclear reactors by 2030 with 13 under construction overseas, meaning early cooperation with China could get Kazakhstan in on the ground floor of a nascent supply chain with a powerful neighbor.

South Korea can provide Kazakhstan with some of the most advanced reactor technology in the industry. Astana may be interested in the Korean APR1400 reactors rather than other models with lower output. Korean Hydro and Nuclear Power (KNHP) has had a relationship with Kazakhstan since 2019, and the two parties signed a memorandum of understanding in 2022 to cooperate in exploring nuclear technology.

In the spirit of a multi-vector policy, President Tokayev admits that the decision is not simple. ""...my personal vision of this issue is that an international consortium should work in Kazakhstan, which will consist of global companies with the most advanced technologies. But then, as they say, life will tell.""

The geopolitical tightrope Kazakhstan must walk isn't new or surprising for the Central Asian nation - but it is vital. Kazakhstan engages in a continuous balancing act that involves assuring strategic partners and investors even as it selects one or the other for key development projects. This balancing act continues domestically as well, as questions remain among the population even though the referendum has passed. According to a poll conducted prior to the referendum asking Kazakh citizens about concerns they have regarding the project - 49.5% worried about the potential impact on public health, 42.9% looked at possible negative effects on the environment, 22.8% were concerned about the adequacy of emergency preparedness; 18.6% had questions about radioactive waste disposal, and 15.3% had questions about regional benefits that might be associated with the project.

The pursuit of nuclear power demonstrates the development of Kazakhstan both globally and domestically. By seeking to construct a nuclear plant, Astana is moving up the value chain in the nuclear sector, addressing the country's economic and energy needs, and contributing to the green transition by adding environmentally friendly capacity. The referendum allowed the government to implement its ""listening state"" policy. Nevertheless, Kazakhstan's multi-vector geopolitical challenges mean it must balance the concerns of Beijing, Brussels, Moscow, and Washington. Yet even the soundest environmental and energy policy could backfire without this balancing act. With the approval of Kazakhstan's people and several actors vying for a part in building a reactor, the production of nuclear energy is a key milestone in Central Asia's route to further modernization."
Blake Shelton Ties A Country Music Legend-With Help From Post Malone,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/10/08/blake-shelton-ties-a-country-music-legendwith-help-from-post-malone/,2024-10-08T13:02:29Z,"Blake Shelton has been working his way steadily toward legendary status in the country music world for decades. He inches closer to that title this frame, as one of his most recent releases hits a very special new high-and its success helps him match a musician who is certainly referred to as a legend with some frequency.

""Pour Me a Drink"" rules the Country Airplay chart this week. The tune lifts from third place to No. 1 on Billboard's ranking of the most successful singles at country radio stations across the U.S.

""Pour Me a Drink"" is fronted by Post Malone, and it credits Shelton as a featured artist. Malone relied on a number of high-profile collaborations with well-known figures in the country space, such as Shelton, to help grant his jump from hip-hop and pop into the genre legitimacy, and it worked brilliantly.

Malone collects his second No. 1 on the Country Airplay chart. He led for the first time earlier this year with ""I Had Some Help,"" which introduced him to the country audience. That tune also stars Morgan Wallen, who may be the hottest hitmaker in the field at the moment.

""Pour Me a Drink"" marks Shelton's twenty-ninth career No. 1 on the Country Airplay tally. That's one of the most impressive accumulations of winners of all time on what is known as one of the most competitive charts published by Billboard-especially when looking specifically at airplay.

Billboard reports that with his new No. 1, Shelton matches Tim McGraw on the list of artists who have reached the summit on the Country Airplay list most frequently. At the moment, the two musicians are tied for the second-most rulers ever, coming in behind only Kenny Chesney. That superstar is in the lead by four more chart-toppers.

""Pour Me a Drink"" serves as the second official single from Malone's first country album F-1 Trillion. Since it was selected as a promotional cut, two more songs have also been chosen for the same honor. Third single ""Guy For That,"" which features Luke Combs, returns to its No. 26 high point this frame on the Country Airplay chart."
How You Can Fail Forward And Make Mistakes Work For You,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminlaker/2024/10/08/how-you-can-fail-forward-and-make-mistakes-work-for-you/,2024-10-08T13:02:19Z,"Failure is one of the most feared words in the world of entrepreneurship. For most people, failure represents defeat, embarrassment, and a blow to one's self-worth. Yet, for successful entrepreneurs, failure isn't just an inevitable part of the journey -- it's a vital stepping stone to eventual success. In fact, many of the world's most successful entrepreneurs attribute their biggest breakthroughs to the lessons they learned from their most devastating failures.

But learning to embrace failure is easier said than done. It requires a shift in mindset, a reframing of what failure really means, and the ability to see beyond the immediate setbacks to the opportunities they create. So how can entrepreneurs learn to see failure not as the end, but as a critical step on the road to success?

One of the first steps to embracing failure as an entrepreneur is to reframe how we think about it. Society often teaches us that failure is something to be avoided at all costs, a mark of inadequacy or incompetence. This fear of failure can be paralyzing, keeping people from taking risks or venturing outside their comfort zones. But in the entrepreneurial world, playing it safe rarely leads to innovation or growth.

Entrepreneurs who succeed in the long term don't view failure as a dead end. Instead, they see it as valuable feedback -- an indication that something didn't work, but also an opportunity to learn, pivot, and improve. Failure, in this sense, isn't a reflection of one's abilities but a natural part of the process of trying something new. For those willing to adopt this mindset, failure becomes a teacher, not a punishment.

This shift in mindset can be transformative. When entrepreneurs begin to see failure as part of the process rather than a reflection of their abilities, they are more willing to take bold actions, test new ideas, and push the boundaries of what's possible. Instead of avoiding failure, they embrace it, knowing that each misstep brings them closer to eventual success.

Failure isn't valuable unless it comes with reflection. One of the reasons successful entrepreneurs are able to use failure as a stepping stone is that they take the time to analyze what went wrong and why. Rather than sweeping mistakes under the rug, they dig deep into their failures to uncover the lessons hidden within.

For many entrepreneurs, failure can be emotionally difficult, especially when it involves losing money, time, or reputation. But the most successful among them don't let their emotions cloud their judgment. Instead, they use failure as a moment for introspection -- what could have been done differently? What were the blind spots or assumptions that led to the mistake? What can be learned from the experience to avoid similar pitfalls in the future?

This process of reflection not only prevents entrepreneurs from repeating the same mistakes, but it also helps them develop resilience. Failure becomes less daunting when it's viewed as a learning tool rather than a personal defeat. By actively seeking out the lessons in their failures, entrepreneurs build a kind of emotional muscle that allows them to bounce back stronger, more informed, and more determined.

Innovation and failure go hand in hand. Many of the greatest entrepreneurial successes in history have come on the heels of monumental failures. Thomas Edison famously failed thousands of times before finally inventing the light bulb. Steve Jobs was fired from his own company, Apple, only to return later and lead it to unprecedented heights. These stories aren't just exceptions -- they highlight a fundamental truth about entrepreneurship: failure is often the precursor to breakthrough innovation.

The reason failure is so integral to innovation is that it forces entrepreneurs to think differently. When a project or idea fails, it's often because it challenged conventional thinking or ventured into uncharted territory. In the process of failing, entrepreneurs discover what doesn't work, but they also uncover new possibilities, refine their ideas, and build something better.

Entrepreneurs who are afraid to fail often stick to what's safe and familiar, limiting their potential for growth. Those who embrace failure, however, are willing to take risks, try new things, and push the boundaries of what's possible. They understand that failure isn't a sign of incompetence -- it's evidence that they're trying something bold, something that hasn't been done before. And in the world of entrepreneurship, that's where true innovation happens.

Failure is inevitable in entrepreneurship, but what matters most is how entrepreneurs respond to it. Resilience -- the ability to bounce back from setbacks -- is one of the most important traits an entrepreneur can develop. Without it, the first major failure could be the last.

Entrepreneurs who cultivate resilience view setbacks as temporary obstacles, not permanent roadblocks. When they encounter failure, they don't dwell on what went wrong. Instead, they focus on what's next -- what can be done to move forward, pivot, or adjust the strategy. This ability to adapt and keep going is what separates those who eventually succeed from those who give up after their first major failure.

Resilience isn't just about determination -- it's about maintaining a long-term perspective. Entrepreneurs who are resilient understand that failure is part of a larger journey, and that one setback doesn't define their entire path. They learn to weather the ups and downs of entrepreneurship with patience, knowing that success is rarely a straight line.

It's not just individual entrepreneurs who need to embrace failure -- organizations as a whole benefit from fostering a culture where failure is seen as a necessary part of growth. In many traditional corporate environments, failure is stigmatized, and employees are afraid to take risks for fear of punishment. But in entrepreneurial settings, where innovation is key, failure should be encouraged as a learning tool.

Entrepreneurs who lead teams can build a culture that embraces failure by rewarding experimentation and risk-taking. Rather than penalizing employees for trying something new and failing, they can celebrate the lessons learned from those failures. This type of culture not only encourages innovation but also creates an environment where employees feel safe to explore new ideas without fear of retribution.

Creating a culture that embraces failure also means being transparent about mistakes. When leaders are open about their own failures and the lessons they've learned, they set the tone for the rest of the organization. By normalizing failure, they make it clear that mistakes aren't something to be ashamed of -- they're part of the process of growth and success.

At the end of the day, failure is inevitable for anyone who chooses the entrepreneurial path. The question isn't whether failure will happen -- it's how entrepreneurs will respond when it does. For those who learn to embrace failure as a stepping stone rather than a roadblock, the possibilities are endless.

Failure, when approached with the right mindset, becomes fuel for success. Each misstep is an opportunity to learn, grow, and refine one's approach. It's in the moments of failure that entrepreneurs discover what doesn't work, but it's also where they uncover new ideas, forge resilience, and find the courage to keep going.

Successful entrepreneurs understand that failure is not the opposite of success -- it's part of it. By reframing failure as a necessary and valuable part of the journey, they are able to turn setbacks into stepping stones that lead to breakthroughs, innovation, and long-term success."
Amazon Slashes Google Pixel 8 Price In New Prime Day Sale,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/10/08/google-pixel-8-pro-pixel-9-amazon-prime-day-deal-discount/,2024-10-08T13:02:15Z,"Amazon has kicked off its Prime Day sale with a raft of new discounts for the Pixel smartphone range that rival Google's own recent price cuts.

The bad news is that Pixel 9 deals are limited and Amazon's trade-in prices aren't the best, but you can pick up a base Pixel 9 for £80 ($104) less if you're shopping in the U.K. For U.S. buyers, the Pixel 8, Pixel 7 and Pixel Tablet are all cheaper in this flash sale.

The Pixel 8 in particular is worth your attention because there is very little, in terms of ability, between it and the Pixel 9. Google will bring some Pixel 9 exclusive features to the Pixel 8 and history suggests more will be on the way. Last year's flagship Google phone also comes with eight years of Android and security updates, future-proofing the device.

Check out my breakdown on why the Pixel 8 is the superior purchase choice for serious deal hunters here. Below are the best deals Amazon is running right now.

It's worth pointing out that these discount percentages reflect when the devices were at their most expensive, and likely don't represent their fluctuating values throughout the year. Most companies do this and it's a bit cheeky because it gives the impression of huge discounts that isn't entirely accurate.

With that said, these are good deals. Google has typically stuck with a $250 price cut for the Pixel 8 Pro, which would bring the price down to $749.99 -- the Amazon deal is $31 cheaper. Amazon's trade-in prices are competitive with Google's prices, too.

Sticking with buying the Pixel 8 Pro, Amazon will offer $135 for the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra (the most recent Samsung phone Amazon will accept), whereas Google will pay $120. Google values the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max (the most recent Apple phone Amazon will accept) at $200 while Amazon will pay $225.

These prices are poor in comparison to Samsung's trade-in values, or even Google's when it is running a promotion. If you're planning on picking up a Pixel phone, don't feel rushed to buy it during this Prime Day sale because Google has discounted almost all of its devices repeatedly throughout the year."

"The Best Skincare Treatments For Fall, According To Three  Experts",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/katebdonnelly/2024/10/08/the-best-skincare-treatments-for-fall-according-to-three--experts/,2024-10-08T13:02:09Z,"Refresh, rebalance and resurface. With the start of autumn, a trio of New York City skincare experts share their favorite non-surgical skincare treatments and products.

With fall in full swing, skincare pivots to a targeted approach. ""We're focusing on skin resurfacing and taking advantage of the cooler weather to address the effects of summer fun,"" says Dangene Enterprise, the celebrity facialist and co-founder of the Core Club. From fine lines to wrinkles, hyperpigmentation and scarring, below, three of New York City's top skincare experts weigh in on their favorite, non-surgical treatments and hydrating skincare products for autumn.

""I love LaseMD Ultra,"" says Manhattan-based dermatologist Evan Rieder, M.D. ""It's a very gentle laser that causes a very mild dusty exfoliation over the course of four or five days."" The laser -- known for its resurfacing powers and miminal downtime -- delivers immediate improvements in age spots, and overall skin tone and texture. Ideal for summer skin woes, Rieder points out that in less than a week, pesky sunspots will be gone; leaving your complexion both glowy and soft. ""Unless you're in an extremely bright room and sitting right next to someone, noone will be able to tell that you've had anything done.""

While slathering your favorite moisturizer will assist in skin healing, Rieder likes the epidermal barrier repairing properties Skin Better Trio Luxe Moisture Treatment ($175), Alastin Regenerating Skin Nectar ($236), and Avene Cicalfate ($28). Perhaps most important however are ""maintaining your gains by using a broad spectrum sunscreen, potent antioxidant, and retinol,"" explains Rieder.

For addressing forehead wrinkles, glabellar (frown lines) and crows feet, FDA-approved, anti-wrinkle neuromodulators are ideal. But, it turns out, not all injections are created equal. Referred to as a ""naked"" injectable, Xeomin contains only one active ingredient: botulinum toxin. ""What makes Xeomin unique is its double filtration, which removes some of unnecessary proteins and additives, "" explains Dr. Jaimie Glick, a board-certified dermatologist for the New York Dermatology Group.

That's not all: it carries a lower risk of triggering resistance development, as some studies show that one can develop antibodies against neurotoxin treatments -- decreasing its efficacy and calling for higher doses. ""If you find yourself developing resistance, or it's not working as well as it used to, Xeomin is for you,"" says Glick (treatments typically last three to four months).

Sunscreen remains the gold standard for healthy and youthful skin. Dr. Glick likes Alastin ($76) and MB Solar Sciences Mineral Tinted Creme SPF 30 ($34), which in a pinch doubles as make-up replacement. ""I have a melasma and I put that on, brush my eyebrows and go to work,"" she says. Don't forget to keep your skin hydrated in cooler weather. ""Hydrolonic acid serums are great,"" explains Glick, who suggests NeoCutis Restore Mask whose peptides and hyaluronic acids keep you hydrated throughout the fall season (and post-treatment too).

Situated on the 16th floor of the members-only CORE: New York, Dangene Enterprise is ""obsessed"" with The Secret DUO by Cutera. Working on the skin's inner and outer layers, the cutting-edge device uses a mix of customizable radio frequency microneedling with the 1540 Erbium laser. ""It delivers skin remodeling and collagen-boosting benefits without intense downtime,"" says Dangene, adding she wraps up the treatment with a LightStim LED Bed -- whose whopping 18,000-plus LEDs lights (from light red to deep infrared) emit multiple wavelengths that boost circulation, relieve pain, and ""leave your skin calm and evenly-toned from head-to-toe.""

Into the colder months skin renewal and protection is key. At home, Dangene likes the newly-reformulated MZ Skin Reviving Bio-Placenta & Stem Cell Serum ($335) whose ingredients include stem cells, bio-placenta, and peptides -- helping to reduce redness, smooth texture, and plump fine lines. For sensitive skin, Dangene suggests Faith Cosmetics soothing, milky Lamellar Mode Balancing Lotion suppressing the skin's histamine responses, repairing cell damage and promoting healing."
Healthcare CIOs Must Fix Two Areas Now Before AI Adoption,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidchou/2024/10/08/healthcare-cios-must-fix-two-areas-now-before-ai-adoption/,2024-10-08T12:58:08Z,"Hospitals and health systems are grappling with shrinking margins, workforce shortages, and rising patient expectations, which makes the balance between quality care and value-based models increasingly challenging. While AI is often seen as a quick fix, healthcare CIOs must urgently address foundational gaps in cybersecurity, operations, and the clinical workforce.

As we step into October, a month dedicated to cybersecurity awareness, it's a timely reminder for healthcare CIOs to prioritize one of their most pressing concerns: cybersecurity. This month can serve as a starting point to reevaluate and strengthen cybersecurity measures in healthcare organizations.

A recent Sophos report shows a sharp rise in ransomware attacks, with 73% of healthcare organizations affected in 2024, up from 66% in 2023. Several factors drive this surge, including the growing sophistication of cybercriminals, widespread use of legacy systems, and the expanded attack surface from healthcare's digitalization. The hybrid remote and in-person care model has also increased vulnerabilities by creating more entry points for cyberattacks. The need to regularly review and update their organization's security posture has never been more evident for CIOs.

Healthcare leaders face a crucial dilemma when deciding whether to pay the ransom during ransomware attacks. According to the Sophos report, 60% of healthcare organizations hit by ransomware opted to pay the ransom. However, only 47% of those who paid could recover all their data. This statistic illustrates the uncertainty and risk of relying on cybercriminals to restore access to critical systems.

The data on ransomware attacks reminds healthcare CIOs that paying the ransom is not a guaranteed solution. Instead, investing in robust backup and disaster recovery solutions is essential to ensure data restoration without relying on ransom payments, breaking the cycle of attacks and discouraging cybercriminals. Experts in the healthcare industry advise against paying the ransom.

The report also highlights the evolving landscape of cyber insurance. While it can offset some of the ransomware costs, obtaining coverage is becoming increasingly complex. Many insurers now require healthcare organizations to demonstrate advanced cybersecurity controls as a condition for coverage. This underscores the need for CIOs to balance reliance on cyber insurance with investments in preventive measures. A comprehensive cybersecurity strategy is essential in today's digital healthcare landscape.

A survey released by Symplr reveals a disconnect between IT leaders and clinicians. Clinicians (72%) believe they should have more influence in software purchasing decisions, while IT leaders (60%) and operational leaders (51%) are more hesitant about involving them. Additionally, only 57% of clinicians feel their hospital operations software allows them to deliver the best possible patient care.

Healthcare CIOs have a long history of collaboration with clinical leaders like the chief medical officer or chief medical informatics officer. However, it's not just about involving a physician 'super user' in vendor selection. It's about engaging them from the start. Similarly, clinical leaders must include IT at the outset when exploring technology solutions, not after making a decision. This close communication between clinical and IT teams is crucial in bridging the gap and ensuring the best possible patient care.

As we approach 2025, healthcare leaders must focus not only on AI but also on strengthening foundational elements like cybersecurity and bridging the gaps between IT and clinical teams. While these efforts may not be as flashy as adopting AI, they are essential for keeping organizations safe and ensuring sustainable progress. Prioritizing robust processes over quick technology fixes will ultimately drive long-term success and enable healthcare systems to thrive in an increasingly digital world."

The bitcoin price shot past its previous all-time high of over £70,000 per bitcoin this year before dropping back to around $60,000 as the U.S. and China begin what could become a crypto cold war.

Now, as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk warns the U.S. could collapse under the weight of its $35 trillion debt pile, JPMorgan analysts have predicted a so-called ""debasement trade"" could fuel a bitcoin price boom going into the U.S. election -- with Trump expected to add $7.5 trillion to U.S. debt.

""Rising geopolitical tensions and the coming U.S. election are likely to reinforce what some investors call the 'debasement trade' thus favoring both gold and bitcoin,"" JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients seen by Marketwatch.

Gold and bitcoin could be boosted by ""persistently high government deficits across major economies, to waning confidence in fiat currencies in certain emerging markets, and to a broader diversification away from the dollar,"" according to the analysts who said a Trump election win would likely reinforce the debasement trade.

Trump is forecast to increase the federal debt by around twice the increase expected if Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris is elected, according to a report from the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Trump would raise federal debt by $7.5 trillion by 2035 if he retakes the White House next month while vice president Harris is estimated to increase the debt by $3.5 trillion over the same period.

U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures.

JPMorgan analysts later wrote the bitcoin price has ""yet to see the 'pop' ... expected from lower rates since the Fed's September 18 cut,"" predicting in a note seen by The Block that the market may be waiting for more sustained stability before making a major move.

Trump now leads Harris by almost three percentage points in the crypto-powered Polymarket's election contract, with 52% to 46%.

Meanwhile, billionaire investor Mark Cuban has teased a plan floated by Trump to pay off U.S. national debt with bitcoin or crypto -- and the Doge Department of Government Efficiency backed by Musk.

""We don't know what Elon would actually do,"" Cuban said during an appearance on the All-In Podcast alongside fellow investors David Friedberg, Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis and David Sacks, responding to a question about how the U.S. could begin to tackle its huge debt pile.

""Maybe [he'll] put doge in the Treasury, who knows, and that's how we make it all up,"" Cuban joked, referring to Elon Musk's on-again-off-again relationship with the meme-based bitcoin rival dogecoin.

Earlier this year, Trump floated the possibility of using bitcoin to pay off the U.S.'s $35 trillion debt pile.

"" Crypto is a very interesting thing,"" Trump told Fox Business in August. ""Maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion, hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our $35 trillion."""
Inside Wynn Las Vegas' Newly Renovated $70 Million Villas,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestravelguide/2024/10/08/inside-wynn-las-vegas-newly-renovated-70-million-villas/,2024-10-08T12:52:03Z,"Take a behind-the-scenes peek into the six extravagant, exclusive garden suites that have museum-quality art, stunning decor, gilded accents and much more.

When Todd-Avery Lenahan, president and chief creative officer of Wynn Design and Development, shares the design details behind reimagining the six villas at Forbes Travel Guide Four-Star Wynn Las Vegas, he makes the process sound simple. In reality, the attributes of the $70 million project blow the mind.

""When the hotel was designed 24 years ago, these [villas] were the best in [Las Vegas],"" Lenahan says of the invitation-only suites that Wynn's top international customers have sought after for two decades. ""But so [many new accommodations] have come on board since that time that it was important for us not just to create the finest villas in Las Vegas, but the finest accommodations in the world.""

With that call to action, he set out to eclipse what guests will find at the finest hotels in Paris, London, New York and Dubai. ""I looked at what our customers experience on the world stage of travel and how they live in their homes,"" he says, drawing on his 20-year history as an independent designer of lavish hotels and residences.

The renovation costs average about $11.6 million per villa, including the gallery space that serves as the entryway. Two villas have two stories with four bedrooms and 10 bathrooms each, and four are single-story with two bedrooms and six bathrooms per unit. The top-to-bottom makeover took more than two and a half years.

""Your private accommodation, while you're in residence with us, has to be this incredibly distilling sanctuary that feels highly anticipatory,"" Lenahan says. ""It feels like a home to you in the truest sense. We wanted to eschew everything that people conventionally associate with a hotel mega-suite because that's not what these are. These are incredible garden residences.""

He aimed to create spaces that discerning, well-traveled Wynn guests haven't seen or stayed in before. ""We focused on supreme comfort and luxury, supreme sensitivity to function and how you live and unwind,"" Lenahan adds. ""But we do this with an element of surprise that makes the experience memorable, positive emotionally, and with an incredible number of bespoke responses in the design details.""

Accessible by private elevators in the Tower Suites arrival conservatory, the transition from the real world to this ""rarefied air"" environment, as Lenahan characterizes it, happens swiftly. As the golden doors open, the villa's dramatic arrival gallery, which acts as a processional way to discover a treasure chest of artworks and artifacts from 20th-century vintage objects to rarities dating back to the 17th century, welcomes you.

Awash in daylight during the early hours and glowing in the evening from champagne-gilded Murano chandeliers and vintage alabaster pendant globes, the gallery's collection of furniture and antiques is just the beginning of the experience.

Every villa ranges from 13,000 to 18,000 square feet and embodies ""supreme comfort"" with multiple master suites, media rooms and gardens with pools. They feature new furnishings, finishes, lighting, bedding, in-room technology and comprehensive en-suite fitness and wellness elements. Lenahan redid the bathrooms and closets and changed the architectural cadence of the floor plans.

""Although the villas are impressive in scale,"" he says, ""the goal was still to bring a level of detail, appointment and finish that creates incredible intimacy and humanity. It's about what I call 'intimacy within grandeur,' where you feel like this space has been created with you in mind.""

The design draws upon Classicism, Cubism and Fauvism with Fortuny textiles, whimsical touches of Fornasetti decor, Baccarat crystal and Hermès accents. Mirroring what is found in the gallery, each villa showcases a rare collection of art and furniture that Lenahan acquired, collected or created.

""[The furniture] has to be beautiful, but most importantly, extremely comfortable,"" he says. ""It is the quality that you would find in a very fine home. We can take care of the villas at a very high level. So, we can do things that are a bit more fragile and delicate [than the typical resort] because it's a low-use environment.""

Many precious pieces displayed at the villas were recently purchased from an auction of treasures from the Getty estate. Over the years, Lenahan has developed deep relationships with art dealers and auction houses, and they make a personal call when extraordinary things become available.

""I'm an art collector,"" he says. ""Many of the world's best galleries know of me. They'll call me first to let me know about something that might be coming available. I'll acquire something knowing that I can incorporate it into a project at some point.""

Lenahan points out two glass and crystal cabinets made by the same craftsman who created the iconic Crystal Palace in London's Hyde Park. ""It came to us in over 380 individual pieces, all of which had to be fully assembled on site,"" Lenahan says. ""It's an extraordinary work. We had a very sophisticated and highly trained art installation company, but there were detailed instructions, and then we had the specialists at Christie's.""

Colombian textile artist Olga de Amaral is also one of his favorites; her work can be seen at the villas. ""She's in the most important collections in the world, from the Museum of Modern Art to the Tate, and a piece of hers came available through a private owner,"" he says.

Lenahan guarantees a safe, museum-like environment for these prized works: ""The different climates through which these rare and extraordinary pieces have traveled in is often what ages them and damages them. In Las Vegas, we have one of the most incredibly stable environments, atmospherically, that is wonderful for preserving them.""

Some furniture and artwork will depart Las Vegas in 2025 and eventually be incorporated into Wynn's upcoming Al Marjan Island resort in the UAE. The villas will act as a canvas for the design and development of other future projects.

""It's a beautifully collected palette,"" says Lenahan of the ongoing work, which juxtaposes contemporary with historical. ""Everything has an incredible seamlessness to how it feels. That's a big part of what I do -- the commingling of then and now."""
Are hurricanes getting worse? Here's what you need to know,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5143320/hurricanes-climate-change,2024-10-08T12:51:48Z,"Hurricane Milton is bearing down on Florida, threatening areas such as Tampa that were hit hard by Hurricane Helene less than two weeks ago.

Milton will be the fifth hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. this year. Like Helene, the storm has gained strength rapidly as it spins across the Gulf of Mexico, where water temperatures are abnormally high.

The back-to-back storms illustrate potential dangers as human-caused climate change makes hurricanes more intense.

Below, we break down how warming temperatures are changing hurricane season. In the U.S., hurricane season officially ends Nov. 30.

Climate change has not led to an increase in the total number of hurricanes hitting the U.S. each year. But the storms that do form are more likely to become more intense, with higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and more severe storm surge.

So while the total number of storms doesn't appear to be changing, dangerous storms are becoming more common.

This year has actually seen fewer hurricanes than expected. But an unusual number of those storms have made landfall in the U.S.

When Hurricane Milton reaches Florida, it will be the fifth named storm to make landfall in the U.S. this year. That's close to the record seven storms that hit the U.S. in 2020.

The number of storms that make landfall in a given year doesn't necessarily indicate how destructive a hurricane season is. Neither does the category, which measures wind speed but not rainfall or storm surge. In 2012, only two hurricanes hit the U.S., both were Category 1 at landfall. But one of them was Hurricane Sandy, which caused tens of billions of dollars in damage up and down the East Coast.

To put it simply, warmer ocean temperatures fuel more powerful storms - and climate change is driving record-high sea surface temperatures.

The Atlantic Ocean, where hurricanes that hit the U.S. form, and the Gulf of Mexico just off Florida, have been hotter than average for more than 18 months, driven both by climate change and the recent El Nino weather pattern.

Warmer ocean temperatures can lead to heavier rainfall and more severe flooding. Storms like Hurricane Helene suck up huge amounts of moisture as they move towards land, which then falls as rain, and can cause flooding far from the coast.

Climate change is also driving sea levels higher, which means more dangerous storm surges.

Scientists are also exploring whether climate change is causing storms to gain strength more quickly, as Hurricanes Beryl, Helene, and Milton have all done this year. In recent years, the U.S. has been hit by many storms that became more powerful just before landfall, which can make it more difficult to prepare and evacuate communities in time.

So far, four hurricanes have made landfall in the U.S., and Hurricane Milton is projected to reach Florida within days."
"Yankees Aaron Judge Has Season For The Ages, Deserves AL MVP Award",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyblengino/2024/10/08/yankees-aaron-judge-has-season-for-the-ages-deserves-al-mvp-award/,2024-10-08T12:49:58Z,"The regular season is over, so it's time to make a final call on the Cy Young and MVP races in both leagues. We started it off last week with the Cy races in the AL and NL. Yesterday, we looked at the NL MVP contest - today, it's the AL's turn.

If you're new to my work, I take a slightly different approach to evaluation of current season performance. It's a purely analytical approach, and relies on batted ball data. I simply take every batted ball hit by every qualifying MLB hitter, and calculate the damage they ""should have"" produced based on their exit speed/launch angle mix. That's expressed by their Adjusted Contact Score - 100 equals league average, the higher the number the better. I then add back the Ks and BBs to determine each hitter's ""Tru"" Production+, and then spread it across their plate appearance bulk to determine their ""Tru"" Batting Runs Above Average. I then add Fangraphs baserunning and defensive runs into the mix, resulting in ""Tru"" Player Runs Above Average (TPRAA).

While using replacement level as a baseline typically makes sense when doing most kinds of player evaluation, I find league average to be quite useful in evaluating elite performance, i.e., for award voting, Hall of Fame-worthiness, etc..

I normally go ten deep on this lists, but the race for the 10th spot was so close that I'm including both combatants. Guardians' 3B Jose Ramirez (22.1 ""Tru"" Player Runs Above Average) will likely rank much higher in the actual balloting. He doesn't fare quite as well in this method because he - to be honest - just doesn't hit the ball very hard. There are a lot of ""just-enough"" homers down both lines from both sides of the plate here. He's also quite the pop up machine. Great all-around player, just doesn't do the things this metric values. Red Sox' CF Jarren Duran (22.5 TPRAA) is also likely to finish higher in the actual award voting. He has a hefty speed premium, i.e., his speed tends to be over-counted by traditional metrics. He overperformed across all batted ball types. Duran's teammate, 3B Rafael Devers (24.6 TPRAA) saw his season shortened by a shoulder injury. His performance fell off dramatically in the second half. He actually had a higher average liner exit speed (99.7 mph) than our projected award winner.

It's really tight from #4-8 on this list. Liker Devers, Rangers' SS Corey Seager (33.8 TPRAA) saw his season shortened by injury. He had bad fortune on both fly balls and liners, and his 157 ""Tru"" Production+ was far better than his 140 wRC+. Mariners' C Cal Raleigh (35.5 TPRAA) has an arguable claim as the best all-around player in the majors at his position. The Brewers' William Contreras has a better bat, but Raleigh is a superior defender. And the bat isn't bad at all - he's a low average hitter with big power. Like Seager, he also was unlucky on flies and liners, and also had to deal with a pitcher-friendly home park. Blue Jays' 1B Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (36.5 TPRAA) is a bat-only player who gets dinged big time for negative baserunning/defensive value, but oh that bat. He finished in a virtual dead heat with the next hitter below for 3rd best bat in the AL.

#5 - DH Yordan Alvarez (Astros) - 39.8 TPRAA - Here is yet another MVP contender who finished the regular season sidelined by injury. It's a scary thought that Alvarez was never really quite right this season - his 93.5 mph average fly ball exit speed and 155 Adjusted Fly Ball Contact Score were both far short of the leaders and his own career norms. Still, his K/BB profile is strong, he hits same-handed pitching well and hammers his liners and grounders. A fully healthy Alvarez is right there with the big dogs.

#4 - 3B Gunnar Henderson (Orioles) - 41.5 TPRAA - The Oriole shortstop did seem to fade a bit by season's end, but he has clearly stamped himself as a candidate to bring home the MVP hardware in the future. He hits all batted ball types hard to all fields, and rarely pops up despite hitting a representative number of fly balls. His average launch angle of 9.2 degrees has plenty of room to grow - watch out when that happens. He's solid but not an ace defender at short, and could eventually slide over to third base.

#3 - SS Bobby Witt Jr. (Royals) - 70.1 TPRAA - And the remaining three performances are pretty much legendary, worthy of bringing the MVP trophy in most seasons. Witt is as complete a ballplayer as there is in the game today. Hits for average and power with impact speed and defense, plus top of the scale durability. There is a bit of a speed premium that needs to be taken out of his actual numbers - I don't care how fast you are, you shouldn't be hitting .362 AVG-.407 SLG on grounders, as Witt did this season. There just might be another gear there power-wise, which should be fun to watch.

#2 - RF Juan Soto (Yankees) - 87.7 TPRAA - The race between the two Yankee outfielders is a much closer contest than you might think. Soto was very unlucky on grounders this season (64 Unadjusted vs. 130 Adjusted Grounder Contact Score), though he narrowly missed being assessed an extreme grounder-pulling penalty that would have dinged his projection by a few runs, but not enough to drop him behind Witt. We forget how young this kid is - his K/BB profile is elite, his 101.7 mph average liner exit speed is easily the highest among this group, and his 10.1 degree average launch angle has room to grow. It's scary to think that the free-agent-to-be has substantial remaining upside.

#1 - CF Aaron Judge (Yankees) - 97.1 TPRAA - While Soto is still getting better, Judge is the fully actualized version of himself. He hits substantialy more fly balls than Soto, with slightly more authority (330 vs. 317 Adjusted Fly Ball Contact Score). He also hits fewer pop ups than Soto. Judge strikes out quite a bit more, but with this absurd amount of reward comes some risk. Both players are bat-only guys - Judge is a better baserunner, Soto perhaps a slightly better/less bad defender, with Judge playing a more valuable position. There is really no remaining upside here - after a scary toe injury last year, Judge played virtually every day this season without incident. His fly ball rate is pretty much maxed out. This is as good as he gets. Enjoy him."
"Mike Lee outlines roadmap for McConnell successor, warns the 'health of the Republican Party' is at stake",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mike-lee-outlines-roadmap-mcconnell-successor-warns-health-republican-party-stake,2024-10-08T12:49:49Z,"Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., joined 'The Ingraham Angle' to discuss his bid for Senate GOP leader and his plans to turn the page from the McConnell era.

Utah Sen. Mike Lee has sent a letter to Republican offices outlining his suggested course of action for the successor of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, warning his colleagues that ""the health of the Republican Party and the future of the republic itself are at stake.""

Senators John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D. and Rick Scott R-Fla., are among those jockeying to take over McConnell's leadership role after the 82-year-old announced in February that he would be stepping down in November.

""The best way we can help lower the temperature of our politics and restore public trust in our institutions is to ensure that the people have more say in the laws that govern their lives,"" Lee wrote in his letter, which was obtained by Politico. ""We have a once-in-a generation opportunity to do so with the upcoming election for our Senate Republican leadership.""

""This is our moment to reaffirm and strengthen the greatest features of the Senate and set a new course for our conference,"" he added. ""I am confident that with the right leadership and a commitment to these reforms, we can create a stronger, more accountable Senate that truly serves the people.""

JOHN CORNYN FLEXES FUNDRAISING CHOPS AS BATTLE TO SUCCEED MITCH MCCONNELL RAMPS UP

In his letter, Lee outlined three reforms that he says should ""guide"" the approach of Senate Republicans going forward.

He called for more time for debate and deliberation, writing that ""We all know the pressure that comes with last-minute votes on massive spending bills that are dropped on our desks hours before a deadline"" and ""This is not how the Senate should operate.""

""First, at the beginning of each year, the republican floor leader should propose a structured process and floor schedule for considering appropriations legislation, just as the leader publishes a calendar of days in session at the beginning of each year,"" Lee said. ""Second, when omnibus spending bills are considered, we should ensure at least four weeks to debate and amend them.""

Lee also said ""We must be strategic in promoting the conservative values that our voters elected us to champion"" and that ""currently, must-pass legislation is overwhelmingly shaped by the progressive priorities of the Democratic Party.""

""First, we should ask that our new floor leader to propose policy goals at the start of each year, to be ratified by the conference,"" he said. ""Second, in addition to having general policy goals, the leader should present specific strategies for achieving Republican victories in connection with must-pass legislation.""

SENATE GOP BRACING FOR LAST-MINUTE LEADER BIDS - POTENTIALLY BY KEY TRUMP ALLY

""Third, the Republican floor leader and whip should whip for or against a bill or nominee only with the support of the majority of the conference,"" Lee continued. ""Above all, this would protect Republican leadership from ever being in the position of having to whip for legislation advancing Democrat priorities, as happens from time-to time when must pass legislation is up against a critical deadline.""

In addition, Lee told his colleagues: ""One of the fundamental issues we face is that our current processes are shutting out the people we represent. Most Americans would be shocked to learn that their senators often cannot offer amendments to legislation. Filling the [amendment] tree has become commonplace in recent years. Since Sen. Harry Reid began centralizing the process in the early 2010s, the vast majority of senators have been largely excluded from the legislative process for most bills.""

The Senate describes filling the amendment tree as ""a process by which a certain number and type of amendments are offered under Senate precedents"" and ""Once these amendments are offered and the 'tree is filled' no other amendments are allowed.""

It's a process that the Congressional Research Service says majority leaders can use to ""freeze"" the amendment process in place and block additional floor amendments.

Lee wrote that ""One simple, additional reform"" for this process ""could involve requiring three-fourths of our conference to agree before the tree can be filled."""
Emmylou Harris Triples Up As One Of Her Fan Favorites Returns,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/10/08/emmylou-harris-triples-up-as-one-of-her-fan-favorites-returns/,2024-10-08T12:46:08Z,"Emmylou Harris is more of a genre favorite than a global powerhouse, but she's so beloved in her chosen styles that she can usually be found on at least some charts around the world. The country and Americana musician is having a great week in the U.K. on one tally she's come to know well throughout the years, as her fans have helped her increase the number of wins she places on that ranking at the moment.

On the latest edition of the Official Country Compilations chart, Harris fills three spaces. One of her classics returns to the ranking of the most successful compilations that can be specifically classified as country when it comes to sound and style, while two other titles from the singer-songwriter hold on.

Harris' Original Album Series reappears on the Official Country Compilations list this frame. The set, which features her first five full-lengths released by a major label, blasts back onto the tally at No. 15.

That collection -- which is really more like a box set in some ways -- is not new to the Official Country Compilations chart. Original Album Series has now lived on the tally for more than 500 weeks, which makes it one of the most successful projects to ever land on the list.

This frame, that bestselling project is not even Harris' highest-rising title. Up one rung to No. 13 on the Official Country Compilations chart is The Complete Trio Collection. That gathering of the albums she released alongside Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt can almost always be found on this ranking.

This frame is special for The Complete Trio Collection. The former No. 1 effort hits 400 weeks on the Official Country Compilations chart in the U.K.

Harris rounds out her trio of appearances on the country-only roster with the second installment of the Original Album Series. Volume two of that product keeps at No. 20 on the latest edition of the list of the top-selling country compilations in the United Kingdom."
FamilyOfficeHK BrandVoice: Hong Kong: Key Link Between Mainland China And The Middle East,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/familyofficehk/2024/10/08/hong-kong-key-link-between-mainland-china-and-the-middle-east/,2024-10-08T12:46:03Z,"Hong Kong stands to benefit from strengthening Sino-Arab ties, drawing family offices and investors from the Middle East.

The global balance of economic power is undeniably tilting eastward as the strengthening ties between China and the Arab states are a testament to this seismic shift. This deepening cooperation extends beyond two-way trade to encompass a multifaceted partnership reaching political, cultural and technological dimensions.

During the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in May 2024, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to step up the building of a China-Arab community with a shared future. The effort was fortified when Premier Li Qiang visited the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) and Saudi Arabia in September 2024 when Li urged enterprises to seize new investment opportunities as partnership with China entered a crucial historical juncture.

In the past two decades, the trade volume between China and Arab states surged from US$36.7 billion in 2004 to US$398 billion in 2023. This exponential growth reflects the deepening economic integration between the two regions, underpinned by shared interests, complementary strengths and a collective vision for a prosperous future.

At the forefront of this transformation stands Hong Kong, a unique and strategic jurisdiction that bridges the East and West, empowering Middle Eastern investors to capitalize on China's rise.

""China is Saudi Arabia's first economic partner. Trade between the Kingdom and China is equivalent to 90% of the total trade of the G7 countries,"" Saudi Minister of Investment Khalid Al-Falih says. The ties between the two countries have gradually grown beyond trade.

China built the Haramain High-Speed Railway that links Makkah and Madinah in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the Arab states are important partners to China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative, and this solidifying partnership aligns with other significant national rejuvenation policies in the Middle East, such as Saudi Vision 2030. Under which, energy-transition investment into Chinese companies in areas including electric vehicles, batteries, energy storage, renewables and industrial technology has been focused on by Saudi investors.

The latest China-Arab States Cooperation Forum also agreed to set up 10 joint laboratories covering fields such as life and health, artificial intelligence, green tech and agriculture. China is leveraging its existing institutions for training satellite management and other aerospace projects. For example, China is set to help Oman build its first satellite.

These are but a fraction of the breadth and depth of the evolving partnership between China and the Arab world, covering key high-tech and strategic sectors that present significant investment opportunities for Middle Eastern investors looking to access China's growth potential through Hong Kong.

At the heart of this dynamic landscape stands Hong Kong, a city with a GDP surpassing US$380 billion in 2023 and the world's 10th largest trading economy. It is China's largest source of overseas direct investment, as well as the leading international asset management hub, and the largest cross-border private wealth management and hedge fund center in Asia.

The city is uniquely positioned to serve as a conduit between the Middle East and mainland China's vast opportunities. Strategically located at the mainland's southern doorstep, Hong Kong's status as the gateway to China and the Greater Bay Area is reinforced by its world-class infrastructure, including the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and the high-speed rail link to Guangzhou.

Beyond its geographic advantages, Hong Kong's distinct governance framework under the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle, coupled with its robust legal and financial institutions, endows the city with a unique competitive edge.

It is home to the world's largest offshore hub in renminbi (RMB) settlement, allowing businesses convenient access to a wide variety of RMB services from banks and financial institutions. The city's free market economy, low taxation and international orientation make it an attractive destination for Middle Eastern businesses and family offices seeking to establish a foothold in China and the broader Asia-Pacific region.

The bilingual international city has also emerged as a crucial Middle East connector, serving as a vital link between the two regions in areas such as trade, investment and cultural exchange.

Between 2017 and 2021, Hong Kong and the U.A.E. enjoyed an annual average growth of 4.1%, and about 9.5% of the buoyant and growing trade between the U.A.E. and mainland China was routed through Hong Kong in 2021.

Hong Kong also boasts the highest number of ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) in Asia and a long-standing tradition of family wealth management, providing a compelling ecosystem for Middle Eastern family offices to thrive.

As of 2023, there were around 2,700 single-family offices in Hong Kong, with over half of them set up by UHNWIs with wealth of US$50 million or above. The city is actively working to attract at least 200 more single-family offices by 2025, with the Middle East region remaining a key target market in its strategic vision to cement its status as Asia's single-family office hub.

Moreover, Hong Kong's development advantages as a crucial node in China's Belt and Road Initiative have further solidified its position as an indispensable conduit between the Middle East and the world's second-largest economy.

By leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages, Middle Eastern businesses and family offices can position themselves at the forefront of this dynamic regional transformation."
4 Things To Know About Hurricane Milton A Day Before Landfall,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2024/10/08/4-things-to-know-about-hurricane-milton-a-day-before-landfall/,2024-10-08T12:45:50Z,"Hurricane Milton is a Category 4 hurricane and looks quite healthy on satellite imagery at the time of writing Tuesday morning. As a meteorologist, I am very concerned. Our best forecast models continue to bring the storm into the Tampa Bay region, which has not taken a direct hit from a storm of this magnitude in over one hundred years. With landfall expected Wednesday evening, here are four things to know about Hurricane Milton right now.

It Is A Dangerous Major Hurricane

Hurricane Milton is a dangerous Category 4 hurricane located just north of the Yucatan peninsula. Hurricane warnings are currently posted for that part of Mexico as well as much of the Florida Peninsula. The storm is starting to turn towards the northeast and is on a direct track into the Tampa Bay region. For this reason, parts of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina are under hurricane or tropical storm watches. Milton is expected to remain at hurricane strength as it crosses the peninsula and exits in the Atlantic Ocean.

Stunningly, Hurricane Milton had peak winds of 180 mph on Monday. It exhibited rapid intensification. What does that mean? It was a powerful storm at the upper end of the Saffir-Simpson wind scale. It went from a Tropical Storm to Category 5 hurricane in less than two days. In other words, its wind speeds increased by roughly 130 mph over that period of time. Geez! At that time, a hurricane hunter aircraft released a dropsonde into the storm that measured a pressure of 897 mb. That pressure places Milton in some pretty rare air in terms of strongest hurricanes on record in the Atlantic basin. According to University of Albany doctoral student Minghao Zhou, five hurricanes had pressures below 900 mb. Wilma (2005), Gilbert (1988), Labor Day Storm of 1935, Rita (2005), and Allen (1980). Lower pressure means a stronger storm.

As stunning as these values were, Hurricane Milton was not projected to remain at that level of intensity. Dry air and wind shear may limit the storm from the extreme top end scenarios from yesterday. This creates a messaging challenge. It is important for people to not perceive a category 3 or 4 hurricane as less dangerous. Knowing human tendencies, I cringed watching people post statements like the storm will ""weaken"" from a category 5 before landfall.

Though technically correct from a meteorological standpoint, there needs to be more nuanced messaging. A Category 3 or 4 storm on direct approach to the Tampa Bay area is a potentially catastrophic scenario given the lack of familiarity with a storm on this track, particular surge vulnerabilities in Tampa Bay, and a population of over three million people in the region who have never experienced a storm like this. For context, Hurricane Katrina (2005) was one of the deadliest and costliest hurricanes in U.S. history. It had a similar intensity trend to what is expected for Milton. The ""bottom line"" message has not changed. Hurricane Milton will be a major hurricane at landfall and a devastating blow for a region in recovery from Hurricane Helene.

Hurricane Milton Had An Eyewall Replacement Cycle

Overnight, Hurricane Milton went through an eyewall replacement cycle. What's that? Strong storms often go through a process in which the original eyewall collapses and is replaced by a broader one. To this point, Hurricane Milton has been a relatively small but powerful storm. The National Hurricane Center wrote, ""The structure of Milton has changed significantly overnight. The pinhole eye seen yesterday has filled and earlier aircraft data showed a double eyewall structure. More recent microwave images show only one larger eyewall, and it is clear that Milton is completing an eyewall replacement cycle.""

The eyewall replacement cycle is a blessing and a curse. They typically bring the wind speeds down, but they expand the size of the storm. That expansion leads to a larger storm with broader impacts. We now have a storm with 155 mph winds extending over a much broader area than the tiny four-kilometer eye on Monday. As Milton approaches Florida, I expect the footprint of the storm to be larger. NHC forecasters noted in their Tuesday morning discussion, ""In fact, the official forecast shows the hurricane and tropical-storm-force winds roughly doubling in size by the time it makes landfall."" Why does that matter? It means storm surge, wind, tornadoes, and rainfall impacts can be expected well ahead of landfall. If you are in this area, it is also useful to remember that storm surge can pulse into rivers and inlets. It is not exclusively a coastal phenomenon.

The Track Subtleties

The latest track forecast brings the storm into the Tampa Bay area on Wednesday afternoon or evening, which means we are less than forty-eight hours from landfall. In that timeframe, historical track forecast error is around fifty nautical miles. This means we have less uncertainty in the track forecast and a narrower cone. Slight wobbles and shifts are likely, but a Tampa Bay area landfall appears locked and loaded.

There are subtleties that must be understand. The first point is that there will be wind, rainfall, and surge damage in the entire region irrespective of the track. However, the distribution of strongest winds and surge is usually on the ""dirty side"" of the eye, which tends to be to the right of the center. Meteorologist Craig Setzer shared the most currently likely scenario above on his X platform.

However, some of the hurricane models indicate the potential for strong winds in the northern eyewall of the storm too. The impacts and resulting damage will not be equal and will vary according to how your location is positioned relative to the track line. While winds and category disproportionately dominate headlines and posts, water is the deadliest aspect of a hurricane. The combined impacts of storm surge and rainfall will have implications along the west coast of Florida, Tampa Bay, and inland.

The Seasonal Forecast and Bigger Picture

NOAA and forecasters at Colorado State University predicted a very active season. The presence of La Nina, extremely warm ocean waters, and other factors sent clear signals in the Spring. However, an August lull in activity prompted naysayer whispering. Currently, the season is now running head of normal activity due to the burst of later season activity, and there are still over six weeks left in the hurricane season. Phil Klotzbach, the noted seasonal forecaster at CSU, lays out the numbers in a recent post on the platform X.

Scientific understanding the atmosphere, ocean, and climate is the underpinning of current hurricane activity. Unfortunately, there has been a rash of conspiracy theories around HAARP, chemtrails, cloud seeding and other nonsense. It is disappointing and distracting, but it is worth noting because people are suffering and in the case of Florida, facing another threat. Rather than grasping the science, some people are clinging to conspiracy theories. During the pandemic I wrote a piece on why that happens. Recent studies have identified natural processes and anthropogenic climate change signals in storms like Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. Yes, hurricanes happen naturally in September and October, but abnormally warm waters are certainly optimal for their development.

After that slight digression, let's get back to Hurricane Milton. This is a statement from the National Hurricane Center that summed things up this morning, ""It is worth emphasizing that this is a very serious situation and residents in Florida should closely follow orders from their local emergency management officials. Milton has the potential to be one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida."""
Mexican mayor's severed head placed atop pick-up truck 6 days after taking office,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/mexican-mayors-severed-head-placed-atop-pick-up-truck-6-days-after-taking-office,2024-10-08T12:42:59Z,"The mayor of a city in Mexico was assassinated days after taking office with his severed head placed atop his puck-up truck.

The mayor of a violence-plagued city in Mexico was killed on Sunday with his decapitated body left in a pickup truck and his severed head placed atop the vehicle's roof.

Alejandro Arcos, 43, was killed just six days after he took office as mayor of the city of Chilpancingo, a city of around 280,000 people in southwestern Mexico.

The city, the capital of Guerrero state, is so violent that a drug gang openly staged a demonstration, hijacked a government armored car and took police hostage in 2023 to win the release of arrested suspects.

SHOOTING NEAR LUXURY MEXICO RESORT LEAVES 1 DEAD, SUSPECTS FLEE ON JET SKIS

Images of what appeared to be Arcos' severed head atop a white pick-up truck have been circulating on social media. In other images, his headless body partially covered with a blanket can be seen in the passenger side of the truck.

Arcos' social media posts leading up to his death showed him supervising disaster relief efforts following the impact of Hurricane John last month, which caused severe flooding in beach resort Acapulco and surrounding towns.

Mourners, including Arcos' wife, attended a funeral for the slain official on Monday.

""His loss mourns the entire Guerrero society and fills us with indignation,"" Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado said in a statement shared on social media.

Alejandro Moreno, the national leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, lamented Arcos' killing and said it came just three days after the new city government's secretary, Francisco Tapia, was shot to death.

""They had been in office less than a week,"" Moreno wrote on his social media accounts. ""They were young and honest public servants who were seeking progress for their community.""

MEXICO'S ARMY SEIZES LOCAL POLICE WEAPONS IN CARTEL HEARTLAND AMID GUNFIGHTS, VIOLENCE

Moreno called on the federal attorney general's office to lead the investigation into Arcos and Tapia's murders, given ""the situation of ungovernability in Guerrero.""

Guerrero has become one of the deadliest states for aspiring and elected public officials, as well as for journalists. At least six candidates for public office were killed in the state in the run-up to Mexico's June 2 elections.

Bloody turf battles have raged between two drug gangs, the Ardillos and the Tlacos. The battle has resulted in dozens of gruesome killings and some high-profile scandals.

A previous mayor was caught on video apparently holding a meeting with leaders of one of the gangs at a restaurant. She was subsequently expelled from her party.

In July 2023, federal officials said a demonstration held by hundreds of people in Chilpancingo that month had been organized by the Ardillos gang to win the release of two gang leaders arrested for drugs and weapons possession.

The demonstrators largely blocked all traffic on the highway between Mexico City and Acapulco for two days, battled security forces and commandeered a police armored truck and used it to ram down the gates of the state legislature building.

The demonstrators abducted 10 members of the state police and National Guard, as well as three state and federal officials, and held them hostage to enforce their demands before releasing them.

Last week, the Mexican army seized the weapons of local police in the cartel-dominated city of Culiacan in the country's northwest Sinaloa state, as violence and gunfights have ravaged that city in recent weeks also. The Mexican army has been known to seize weapons from distrusted police forces it suspects of either being involved in aiding the cartel, or over concerns the units were carrying unregistered arms that made abuses harder to trace."
Markets In The Balance: Election Impact Hinges On Sweep Or Gridlock,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreyschulze/2024/10/08/markets-in-the-balance-election-impact-hinges-on-sweep-or-gridlock/,2024-10-08T12:40:55Z,"I write about financial market trends and recession risk indicators.

With a month to go before election day, the presidential race remains tight with Kamala Harris maintaining a slight lead over Donald Trump. Based on the prediction markets, the two most likely outcomes are either a Republican sweep or a Harris presidency with a divided government. This is due to races for the Senate favoring the Republicans.

Different presidential and congressional configurations will dictate how much legislation can be passed and ultimately how much an effect politics will have on stocks and the economy. A sweep scenario can lead to drastic changes in tax and spending policies. With a divided government, regulation and trade policy will come into play, because those are the areas where the president can act unilaterally.

Taxes

The new president will face a unique tax situation because major elements of the TCJA, the Trump tax cuts, are sunsetting in 2025. If nothing is done, almost every taxpayer will see a higher average tax rate. This should act as an incentive from both sides of the aisle to negotiate and extend some of these expiring provisions.

Kamala Harris recently released tax proposals to dramatically increase the tax rates on corporations and high-income households while leaving most Americans taxes unchanged, promising to protect households making under $400,000 from higher taxes. Her tax goals are unlikely to become reality, however, unless the Democrats retain control of the Senate and flip the House of Representatives.

Meanwhile Donald Trump would likely prioritize extension of the TCJA, including reinstating individual provisions that expired, including business depreciation allowances such as immediate expensing for equipment, property and research and development.

Regulation

From a regulatory standpoint, Harris is focused on prescription drugs, more affordable housing, a higher minimum wage, lower grocery costs and a supportive stance toward clean energy. She has also talked about accelerating Medicare negotiations on more drugs and cracking down on pharmacy benefit managers, creating more risk in health care.

Trump significantly dialed back regulation in his first term. Most of the former president's efforts on the deregulation front will likely be focused on labor, education, the environment and health care, with a slowdown in the transition to EVs. Energy production and fracking in particular should increase. A potential negative, at least from a labor market perspective, is more stringent immigration policies, which could hurt labor-intensive companies.

It's worth noting, however, that the expected election outcomes due to regulation are usually very different from what ends up occurring. The consensus thought energy would thrive under the Trump administration, yet it was one of the worst-performing sectors in his four years. Under Obama, health care was expected to be a tough sector, but it performed well on a relative basis. So, it's important not to read too much into higher regulation and what the impacts will be for these sectors.

Trade

Harris is expected to mostly maintain the status quo on trade policy from the Biden administration. Changes are expected to be more surgical compared to the broad brush approach Trump has discussed. Harris would likely remain firm on China to protect industries like solar and semiconductors.

From a Trump perspective, we expect a repeat of what we saw under his first term. He is proposing two types of tariffs: a 10% across the board tariff on all imported goods and increases on Chinese tariffs to 60%. According to a Tax Foundation analysis, a 10% tariff and retaliation from U.S. trading partners would be expected to contract the economy by 1%. From a trade perspective, equities would face more headwinds under Trump while a Harris win would continue the status quo.

Fiscal Spending

The most bipartisan view right now is that government spending will keep growing. Neither candidate wants to rein in spending. Deficits are forecast to be in the 6%-7% of GDP range for the foreseeable future and potentially even higher in a sweep scenario where more legislation gets passed. Harris would prioritize spending on health care, housing, childcare, clean energy and infrastructure.

Trump is expected to keep spending focused on defense and infrastructure. The fiscal thrust from a Republican administration will come in the form of tax cuts, while the Democrats will likely lead with more spending. We expect such policies to boost the economy in either scenario.

Impacts of a Trump Victory

In aggregate, we view a second Trump presidency under a sweep scenario as net positive for equities. The expectation is for a more favorable corporate tax regime and less of a regulatory burden, both of which should boost corporate profits. Conversely, there is the potential for increased tariffs and retaliation from U.S. trade partners. A gridlock scenario where the House is under Democratic control would be mildly negative as fewer provisions of expiring tax legislation would get extended.

We view U.S. stocks as best placed under Trump, with banks and capital markets, as well as the oil and gas complex, well positioned due to lighter regulation. Aerospace and defense is also likely going to benefit as well as biopharmaceuticals.

Impacts of a Harris Victory

We see a Harris win as mildly negative to equities should she preside over a divided Congress. It will be more of a headwind to the markets should we see a Democratic sweep as she will then be able to implement higher taxes on corporations and high-income individuals, as well as push a more ambitious regulatory agenda. However, tax credits for low-income individuals would provide an offset, creating an economic boost to this segment of the economy.

Tighter regulation could weigh on biopharmaceuticals, banks, capital markets, energy as well as mega cap technology. Areas to be bullish about under Harris would be consumer discretionary, specifically restaurants & leisure, home building and building products.

It's easy to categorize each candidate as bullish or bearish, but markets have gone up regardless of the party in control. In our view, economic momentum will be a bigger driver of equities over the medium to long term."
Hurricane Milton Now 'Extremely Dangerous Category 4' En Route To Florida -- Here's What To Know,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/08/hurricane-milton-now-extremely-dangerous-category-4-en-route-to-florida-heres-what-to-know/,2024-10-08T12:39:24Z,"Hurricane Milton has been downgraded to a Category 4 hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico but was still described by the National Hurricane Center as ""extremely dangerous"" Tuesday morning as it barrels toward the Florida Gulf coast, less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene killed at least 20 people in the state before causing devastating flooding across parts of the southeastern U.S.

""I can say this without any dramatization whatsoever. If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you are going to die,"" Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told CNN.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Saturday declared a state of emergency for 35 counties, including all of the Tampa Bay area, and warned of a ""flurry"" of evacuation orders. According to the Associated Press, Milton could trigger the biggest spate of evacuation orders in the state since 2017's Hurricane Irma -- where 7 million people were urged to leave their homes. Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, ordered evacuations for areas near Tampa Bay and for all mobile and manufactured homes by Tuesday night. Lee County, home to Fort Meyers, issued a mandatory evacuation order for the island of Fort Myers Beach. Other mandatory evacuation orders have been issued in Pinellas County, Pasco County and Manatee County. Volusia County has issued a curfew and enacted evacuation orders starting Wednesday morning and Marion County is under a mandatory evacuation order for mobile homes, RVs, and modular-type homes.

Tampa International Airport will close at 9 a.m. Tuesday with plans to reopen ""as soon as it is safe"" later this week. Major U.S. airlines, including American, Delta, Southwest, United and JetBlue, are issuing travel waivers that will allow passengers flying through impacted airports to rebook without paying far differences. American Airlines' travel alert covers 12 airports in Florida, Delta's covers nine and Frontier covers eight. United Airlines' advisory covers travel to and from only five airports -- Key West, Orlando, Fort Myers, Sarasota/Bradenton and Tampa.

There is no such thing as a Category 6 hurricane. The National Hurricane Center uses the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale to classify storms, which ranks only up to a Category 5 and defines those storms as having sustained winds at or greater than 157 mph. Earlier this year, researchers with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Space Science and Engineering Center argued for adding a sixth storm category as climate change continues to intensify weather events. Under their proposal, Category 5 hurricanes would be redefined to encompass storms with sustained wind speeds between 157 and 192 mph and a new Category 6 would describe storms with wind speeds above 192 mph.

Milton is expected to arrive less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene, a major Category 4 storm, hit Florida on Sept. 26. Helene was the hardest hit for the Tampa Bay area from a hurricane in 103 years, according to the Associated Press. Despite staying offshore, Helene inundated parts of the area with several feet of storm surge. At least 20 people died in Florida from the storm, which then traveled 500 miles across the Southeastern U.S. and caused heavy flooding in the Carolinas, Georgia, Virginia and Tennessee. At least 230 people across six states died as a result of the hurricane, which was the deadliest to hit the continental U.S. since Katrina in 2005. Helene made landfall near Perry, Florida, approximately 160 miles north of Tampa, with winds of 140 mph before it was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved northward.

Milton will be the fifth hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. this year, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts 2024 will be one of the busiest hurricane seasons on record, estimating 8 to 13 hurricanes and between 4 and 7 major hurricanes.

Some Bad News About 'Fallout' Season 2's Release Date On Amazon Prime Video,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/08/some-bad-news-about-fallout-season-2s-release-date-on-amazon-prime-video/,2024-10-08T12:39:18Z,"Fallout was a smash hit for Amazon Prime, an Emmy nominee and a well-watched favorite among critics, audiences and exceptionally hard-to-please gamers who believe it did the series proud.

But while Fallout was renewed just over a week after its April debut, when Fallout season 2's release date will be is another thing entirely. And it does not sound great, based on new information from star Ella Purnell.

While she is positive about season 2, there's essentially no information she has about it...as its lead:

""I'm excited, I really cannot wait. I don't have anything, I don't know when we're going to do it, I don't have a script. I have literally nothing. I don't even know if I'm in it. I hope I'm in it. I think I'm in it. No, I'm probably in it...I really want to get going. I need to start practicing my accent again and getting back into the Lucy headspace.""

What we seem to have here is yet another situation where large streaming shows have yawning gaps of time between seasons. The issue here is that this show aired in April, it is now October and the star doesn't even know the film start date nor has seen a script.

Fallout season 1 began filming in July 5, 2022, and aired almost two years later in April 2024. So that's 21 months of filming and post-production. With no idea of when a start date is even happening, it stands to reason that it will be some time in 2025, given how late in the year it's getting. So if the schedule is the same, we could be talking 2027 before season 2 of Fallout gets here, somewhere close to three years after the first one aired. If we're lucky maybe that could shrink to two and a half. But given what Purnell is saying here it...does not sound great from a timeline perspective.

I don't know what's going on here. It may have something to do with cast availability as its two main stars, Purnell and Walton Goggins are in high demand (Goggins in particular will start in 2025's White Lotus season 3). So maybe that pushes things.

But these streaming service are mangling these stories by forcing this kind of massive wait between seasons for their most popular projects. Netflix is doing the exact same thing with Wednesday right now where it's going to be roughly three years from season 1 to season 2. But this keeps happening, and it doesn't look like it's going to stop any time soon. We used to get a season of Game of Thrones every year. Every year!"
Kris Kristofferson Debuts Several Albums On The Charts Following His Death,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/10/08/kris-kristofferson-debuts-several-albums-on-the-charts-following-his-death/,2024-10-08T12:39:12Z,"Kris Kristofferson passed away on September 28 at the age of 88. The country, Americana, and rock musician and actor was beloved in his time, and he's been known as a powerful force in the music world for decades. Following the legend's passing, fans all around the world rushed to both buy and stream his work, which is a common sight in such times. All that listening helps several of the musician's albums debut on the charts in one of the largest music markets.

On the U.K. rankings this week, Kristofferson sees three different projects debut. They don't all appear on the same tally, and one even manages to bring the talent back to the highest tier on one list.

Kristofferson debuts highest on the Official Country Compilations chart, which specifically measures the most popular non-traditional albums in the country space in the U.K. On that ranking, the late musician's Original Album Classics opens at No. 6. The title marks his fourth career top 10 win.

The two other projects that Kristofferson manages to send to a chart for the first time both reach the Official Albums Downloads ranking. 16 Biggest Hits launches at No. 25, while The Essential begins its time on that tally at No. 32.

Amazingly, those two titles mark Kristofferson's first to land on the U.K.'s ranking of the most-downloaded albums in that nation. He's never been the power player across the pond that he was in America for quite some time, but the fact that throughout his lifetime, he never managed to claim one of the top-selling downloads in the United Kingdom is somewhat surprising.

At the same time that he scores three new hit releases, one of Kristofferson's most successful projects begins a comeback. The full-length that accompanied his version of the film A Star Is Born, in which he co-starred with Barbra Streisand, is back on the Official Soundtrack Albums chart. This week, it reappears at No. 19.

Unlike the other titles of Kristofferson's that debut, A Star Is Born is not new to the tally it appears on. The soundtrack has now spent 36 frames on its respective ranking, where it's risen to No. 7 in the past."
2 Mental Health Benefits Of 'Participative Leadership' -- By A Psychologist,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/10/08/2-mental-health-benefits-of-participative-leadership-by-a-psychologist/,2024-10-08T12:39:07Z,"""Participative leadership"" is a management style where leaders involve employees in decision-making processes, promoting collaboration and shared responsibility. While final decisions lie with the employers, employees are encouraged to share their ideas, given the resources and support they require in their work process.

A 2022 review published in Frontiers in Psychology suggests that such leadership benefits employee mental health, as well as organizational growth.

""Participative leadership, characterized by autonomy, collaboration and openness, encourages employees to work innovatively by providing creative ideas and solutions that lead to the best decisions,"" the researchers explain.

Here are two reasons why participative leadership benefits employees, according to the study.

When employees feel that their voices are heard and their input is valued, they develop a deeper connection to their work, a greater sense of personal achievement and higher psychological security in their workplace.

Researchers also found that participative leadership fosters a sense of autonomy and belief in one's ability to achieve desired goals, which is essential to their well-being. Rather than being told exactly what to do or having their every move scrutinized, employees are trusted to succeed. This sense of ownership can boost morale and well-being within the workplace.

Participative leadership plays a vital role in helping employees psychologically thrive by fostering a work environment that prioritizes emotional well-being. By encouraging open communication and collaboration, employees can feel supported and safe to express their needs and concerns.

When employees have a say in the decision-making process, it also reduces feelings of helplessness and increases their sense of control over their work, which is key to reducing stress and burnout.

One recent study found that participative leadership can alleviate workers' emotional exhaustion and contribute to a greater work-life balance.

Researchers suggest that when leaders are empathetic and emotionally intelligent, it can ease employee stress. Such leaders are better equipped to understand the pressures employees face and can provide necessary support.

Additionally, a 2021 study published in Frontiers in Psychology examined the effects of participative leadership and the perceived integrity of a leader on frontline workers' well-being during Covid-19. Researchers found that receiving a leader's attention, support and empowerment enhanced employees' workplace thriving and their ability to help others during the crisis.

Additionally, the sense of community and shared responsibility that participative leadership offers can create a buffer against workplace isolation, a rapidly rising mental health issue.

It's crucial, however, for leaders to strike a balance. Involving employees in decision-making should empower them, not overwhelm them. If participative leadership leads to an unmanageable workload, it can have the opposite effect and increase stress. Leaders must be mindful of not only delegating responsibilities but ensuring employees have the resources and time to handle them.

For workplaces to move in this direction, leaders must prioritize trust, empathy and open dialogue, while encouraging input from all levels of the organization. Companies can start by training managers in emotional intelligence, creating platforms for feedback -- and taking it seriously -- and ensuring that employees have meaningful opportunities to contribute.

Employees deserve more than just a paycheck. They thrive in environments where they feel respected, heard and supported. When leadership prioritizes their well-being, it fosters a positive workplace culture that benefits everyone.

To build a truly positive workplace, leadership must go beyond management. It must actively champion employees' well-being, making their growth and fulfillment the foundation of the organization's success."

"The 4,000 items in the Staffordshire Hoard make it the largest collection in history of its kind",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/4000-staffordshire-hoard-make-largest-collection-history-its-kind,2024-10-08T12:33:32Z,"Archaeologists from the University of Aberdeen recently found a more than 1,000-year-old ring during a volunteer dig near Burghead, Scotland. The university believes the Pictish ring means the ""painted ones.""

The Staffordshire Hoard is truly one of a kind as the largest collection of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver found to date. There are around 4,000 items, most of which are military pieces.

The discovery of the Staffordshire Hoard came in 2009. A metal detectorist was scanning farmland in the village of Hammerwich in England when his detector signaled a find.

What was found buried in the soil turned out to be monumental. Over the following days, the metal detectorist began to pick up pieces of a collection that would later be known as the Staffordshire Hoard. He later contacted a finds liaison officer for the Staffordshire and West Midlands Portable Antiquities Scheme for further assistance, according to Ancient Origins.

COLLEGE STUDENT IN DENMARK USES METAL DETECTOR TO DISCOVER ANCIENT JEWELRY

With permission from the landowner, a full excavation was conducted. Birmingham Archeology later joined in to assist, according to the source.

After the items were collected, a 10-year conservation and research project was in pursuit. The findings of the project were published in 2019 in the book ""The Staffordshire Hoard: An Anglo-Saxon Treasure"" and online.

During this period, ancient objects found were carefully cleaned and x-rays were taken, according to Birmingham Museums.

IRISH FARMER FINDS NEAR 60-POUND SLAB OF ANCIENT BOG BUTTER ON HIS LAND BY 'PURE LUCK'

Another part of this effort was to begin matching fragments that belonged to the same object because many of the items were found in incomplete parts.

Through detailed research, there has been so much knowledge gained about this collection, including when it dates back to, but there are still questions unanswered.

Archaeologists believe the collection was buried during the 7th century (650-675 AD), according to Birmingham Museums.

Many objects that have been discovered from the time period have been jewelry, specifically brooches and pendants, according to the Stoke Museums.

RARE ANCIENT CELTIC ARTIFACT IN POLAND, 2,300-YEAR-OLD METAL OBJECT EXCAVATED FROM CHARCOAL PIT

An element of the Staffordshire Hoard's uniqueness is that it is mostly made up of war gear, according to Stoke Museums.

One of the Staffordshire Hoard's most valuable items is an ancient war helmet. The helmet was far from complete when it was discovered because it was broken into 1,000 pieces, according to Stoke Museums. During the days when the helmet was completed, it likely sat atop the head of a king.

After months of research, there were two replicas of the helmet created, one of which is on display at the Potteries Museum & Art Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent and the other at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.

Fragmented pieces make up the majority of the Staffordshire Hoard, which put together equals 700 items, according to Birmingham Museums. Of the items in the collection, the large majority are swords, according to the source.

In large part, the items are gold. Since gold doesn't corrode in soil, the precious metal is able to stay well-preserved, according to the source. Around 150 of the items are silver.

Why the Staffordshire Hoard was buried in the first place is still a mystery, though experts have developed many theories. One is that the gear could have been buried as an offering to the gods, according to Birmingham Museums.

New York Yankees pitcher Carlos Rodón had a tough outing against the Kansas City Royals in Game 2 of their American League Division Series matchup on Monday night.

Rodón pitched 3 2/3 innings, allowing four earned runs on seven hits. It started with the game-tying home run from Salvador Perez and finished with three more Royals players crossing the plate in the inning. Kansas City won the game, 4-2.

Rodón's wife, Ashley, showed the vile messages she received from people who were upset with her husband.

""DM's already willlllld. I love interacting with everyone, but there's no place for this s---,"" she wrote on X along with screenshots of some terrible messages.

Carlos Rodón signed with the Yankees before the start of the 2023 season. He had an abysmal first season but rebounded in 2024. He won a career-high 16 games in 32 appearances. He brought his ERA down to 3.96 from 6.85.

However, when the Yankees needed him the most, he came up short.

""Obviously, I want to be better than that -- especially how the first three innings went,"" Rodón said. ""I wouldn't say I tired out. Just got to be better with those pitches, just more fine with them and get to better spots.""

The Yankees took an early lead when Giancarlo Stanton brought home Gleyber Torres. New York tried to put pressure on late in the game when Jazz Chisholm Jr. hit a solo home run, but the Royals closed the deal."
"Bizarre laws in Washington, such as being charged with reckless driving if hugging while behind the wheel",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/bizarre-laws-washington,2024-10-08T12:33:24Z,"K'Shawn Konscience Jimerson, 19, is accused of killing 65-year-old veteran Michael Gray.

Strange laws that will have you scratching your head are present in states across the country.

Washington's most bizarre laws include consequences for using x-ray machines for nonmedical foot measuring, hugging while driving and more.

Read on to learn about these and more strange laws in Washington.

BIZARRE MINNESOTA LAWS, INCLUDING PENALTIES FOR DRIVING A FILTHY CAR, THAT WILL SHOCK YOU

First among Washington's strangest laws is one against using X-ray machines for the purpose of nonmedical foot measuring.

This is stated in Section 70A.388.190 of the Revised Code of Washington.

""The operation or maintenance of any X-ray, fluoroscopic, or other equipment or apparatus employing roentgen rays, in the fitting of shoes or other footwear or in the viewing of bones in the feet is prohibited,"" the law states.

50 BIZARRE LAWS THAT HAVE EXISTED OR STILL EXIST IN AMERICA

""This prohibition does not apply to any licensed physician, surgeon, *podiatrist, or any person practicing a licensed healing art, or any technician working under the direct and immediate supervision of such persons.""

Lots of factors can be distracting for a driver on the road. In Washington, a law prohibiting hugging while driving is explicitly laid out.

This law can be found in the Revised Code of Washington, Section 46.61.665, which goes over the Rules of the Road and prohibits ""embracing another while driving.""

""It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a motor vehicle upon the highways of this state when such person has in his or her embrace another person which prevents the free and unhampered operation of such vehicle,"" the law states.

6 WEIRD BEACH LAWS AROUND UNITED STATES THAT MAY SURPRISE YOU

""Operation of a motor vehicle in violation of this section is prima facie evidence of reckless driving,"" the law continues.

Washington law prohibits the harming of a carrier or racer pigeon.

Breaking this law is a ""class 1 civil infraction,"" the law states.

In Washington, it's illegal ""for any person, other than the owner thereof or his or her authorized agent, to knowingly shoot, kill, maim, injure, molest, entrap, or detain any Antwerp Messenger or Racing Pigeon, commonly called 'carrier or racing pigeons,' having the name of its owner stamped upon its wing or tail or bearing upon its leg a band or ring with the name or initials of the owner or an identification or registration number stamped thereon,"" the law reads.

BIZARRE LAWS IN CALIFORNIA THAT COULD GET YOU INTO TROUBLE

This is according to the Revised Code of Washington 9.61.190.

Think twice before using a laser as a form of intimidation against another in Washington.

This law can be found in the Revised Code of Washington 9A.49.020, which highlights ""unlawful discharge of a laser in the first degree.

""A person is guilty of unlawful discharge of a laser in the first degree if he or she knowingly and maliciously discharges a laser, under circumstances not amounting to malicious mischief in the first degree,"" the law states.

WEIRD SOUTH CAROLINA LAWS THAT WILL SURPRISE YOU, INCLUDING THE RAMIFICATION OF BUYING SILVERWARE ON SUNDAYS

The law is then broken down more specifically, including details about pointing a laser in the direction of a law enforcement officer, a pilot, a transit operator and a school bus driver.

One of the most popular laws swirling around the state is one regarding Bigfoot.

Many believe that Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch, is a creature that lives in the Pacific Northwest.

In Washington, specifically Skamania County, there was a law passed in 1969 that protects the Sasquatch from harm, according to the Skamania County Chamber of Commerce website.

An amended ordinance went into effect in 1984.

According to Skamania Country Chamber of Commerce, ""harming Sasquatch within Skamania County's borders could cost you one year of jail time and/or a $1000 fine.""

Questions about legalities regarding Sasquatch have come up through the years.

For example, in March 2024, Stevens County Sheriff's Office posted on Facebook about a call they received from an individual ""inquiring about the legality of hunting Sasquatch.""

The patrol chief responded with the following information.

""So our Patrol Chief called the inquiring party back to pass on two important pieces of information: Meadow Lake is in Pend Oreille County Sheriff jurisdiction and he would have more information on that topic,"" the office said.

""2. There are no Sasquatch in Stevens County. We know this because one of our deputies would have accidentally hit one with a patrol car by now!"""
Harris takes slim lead over Trump in new poll as voters view her as candidate of change,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-takes-slim-lead-over-trump-new-poll-voters-view-her-candidate-change,2024-10-08T12:30:58Z,"Reason senior editor Robby Soave and syndicated columnist Josh Hammer on the media interviews agreed to by Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton suggesting social media censorship.

Vice President Kamala Harris has taken a slight edge over former President Donald Trump in a new poll released Tuesday that looked into which candidate voters view as the candidate representing change. Trump, however, maintained his lead among male voters and has kept the trust of most voters on economic issues.

The latest New York Times/Sienna College national poll found that if the election were held today, 49% of respondents would vote for Harris while 46% would vote for Trump. It marks the first time Harris has led Trump in the Times/Sienna poll since President Biden dropped out in July.

Harris took a slim lead among respondents who saw the vice president, not Trump, as a break from the status quo, garnering 46% compared with 44% for the former president.

Harris' lead in this category was greater when broken down into non-White and younger voters, garnering 61% and 58%, respectively, compared to 29% of non-White and 34% of younger voters favoring Trump, according to the poll.

MICHAEL MOORE MOCKS DEMOCRATS PANICKED BY TIGHT 2024 RACE: 'SHOCKING TO ME' THEY BELIEVE TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN

Despite the slight change for Harris, the poll found Trump still maintained the majority of voter trust on what they consider their most important issues, such as the economy, with 48% compared to 46% for Harris.

Trump is also leading Harris with male voters by 11 points, a group which also favored Trump over Biden in the 2020 election, according to the poll.

NORTH CAROLINA GOP FOCUSING ON 'HAND-TO-HAND POLITICAL COMBAT' TO RAMP UP GROUND GAME IN BATTLEGROUND STATE

While national polls are often a good indicator of the general mood among Americans, they don't always predict who will win elections, which often come down to important battleground states.

In the latest Fox News survey of registered voters in North Carolina, viewed as one such battleground state, Harris has a 2 percentage-point edge over Trump, 50% to 48%. A month earlier, Trump was ahead by 1 point (50% to 49%), for a 3-point shift in the presidential race.

Respondents in this poll also found Trump more likely to better handle the economy and also gave him the edge in making the country safe."
Beyond Pink: How 3 Brands Are Marketing This October,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andreawasserman/2024/10/08/beyond-pink-how-3-brands-are-marketing-this-october/,2024-10-08T12:29:18Z,"Wikipedia defines cause marketing as ""marketing done by a for-profit business that seeks to both increase profits and to better society in accordance with corporate social responsibility, such as by including activist messages in advertising."" October sees a spike in cause marketing given the number of companies globally that want to acknowledge Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which itself began in 1985, when Imperial Chemical Industries - the maker of breast cancer drug tamoxifen - partnered with the American Cancer Society. In an extension of that cause marketing, the pink ribbon became synonymous with breast cancer in October 1992 when SELF magazine partnered with Evelyn Lauder, an Estée Lauder executive and breast cancer survivor, to distribute pink ribbons in conjunction with the magazine's second annual Breast Cancer Awareness Month issue (also known as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month in the United States).

Today, the pink ribbon has proliferated in brand marketing, especially each October. There's nothing wrong with limited-edition products that yield a percent of sales or profits to breast cancer causes, corporate donations and employee-match programs, social media campaigns, and events or retail displays. All of these tactics can make important contributions to increasing the attention and funds going to an important cause.

But Ann Inc., inclusive of Ann Taylor and LOFT, is focused on community and resilience. More specifically, the Sisterhood of Strength honors the company's 20 years of partnering with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) by shining the spotlight on 20 breast cancer ""thrivers."" In addition to sharing the stories of these women, a banner atop each brand's digital home page encourages visitors to make donations to the BCRF.

Saneel Radia, CEO and Chief Innovation Officer of Proto, an innovation, brand and experience consultancy, calls himself ""a huge fan of when companies actually design products - not just messaging - for the audience they're supporting as it's the clearest form of investment, and the design conversation alone requires real knowledge of the customer.""

Radia highlights two examples of companies doing this. First, he shares, ""[In 2021], Athleta created the Empower Bra, specifically designed for women who have undergone mastectomies, tailored to the unique needs of post-surgery bodies."" There's also an Empower Masectomy Bra Insert, which has garnered more than 400 five-star reviews. A category page on Athleta's web site aggregates sports bras that are compatible with these inserts for easy shopping. All of this is consistent with Athleta's refreshed mission to ""empower women and girls to build confidence, strength, and belonging through movement.""

Second, Radia cites Ralph Lauren, which combines the approaches above. He points out how the brand has ""designed multiple product lines from which a range of proceeds go directly to cancer research or patient care, and markets them via campaigns that tell powerful stories of breast cancer survivors."" All of this is under the Pink Pony umbrella, with its own robust digital landing page and a stated mission ""to reduce disparities in cancer care and ensure that access to quality treatment is available to everyone at an earlier, more curable stage."" Links are available to both shop and donate."

Stevie Nicks' New Single Instantly Debuts In The Same Position On Multiple Charts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/10/08/stevie-nicks-new-single-instantly-debuts-in-the-same-position-on-multiple-charts/,2024-10-08T12:28:51Z,"Stevie Nicks returned a little more than a week ago with ""The Lighthouse,"" her latest solo single. The Fleetwood Mac star's fan base snapped up copies of the tune the moment it dropped, and they've collectively sent the song to multiple charts in the U.K. this week, immediately making it into something of a quick, if minor, hit.

""The Lighthouse"" launches on both the Official Singles Sales and Official Singles Downloads charts this time around. Coincidentally, the tune is new at No. 48 on the two tallies.

It's not entirely uncommon for songs to debut in similar spots on those two rankings, as they are both ranked based on pure purchases. Most sales of individual tracks take place on download storefronts like iTunes and Amazon, so it makes sense that new arrivals on the Official Singles Downloads list would also perform just as well-or, almost as well-on the Official Singles Sales roster at the same time.

""The Lighthouse"" marks Nicks' second solo hit on the Official Singles Sales chart. She debuted on the list of the top-selling songs in the U.K. in 2020. That year, ""Edge of Seventeen"" peaked at No. 7, and it still stands as her top placement.

Nicks' latest offering marks her fourth career win on the Official Singles Downloads ranking. It's her second-highest appearance, coming in ahead of the No. 72 high point that ""Dreams"" by Deep Dish reached years ago, as well as the No. 98 peak that ""Show Them the Way"" mustered.

""The Lighthouse"" stands as the fifth-highest debut on the Official Singles Downloads chart, landing behind tracks from Kylie Minogue, Callum Beattie, Jack Savoretti and Miles Kane, and Josh Baker. On the Official Singles Sales list, Nicks claims the sixth-loftiest entrant. In addition to the five names mentioned above, The Veronicas also hit the tally with their years-old single ""Untouched,"" which reaches the list for the first time.

Nicks released ""The Lighthouse"" as a means to inspire discussions about women's rights and the issue of abortion. For the moment, the track is a standalone single, as it's not connected to any larger project-at least for the time being."

Whoopi Goldberg calls Biden the 'acting president' on 'The View',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/whoopi-goldberg-calls-biden-acting-president-the-view,2024-10-08T12:20:48Z,"While defending Vice President Kamala Harris, ""The View"" co-host Whoopi Goldberg referred to President Biden as ""our acting president"" on Monday.

The ABC morning program commented on Harris' recent appearance on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast Sunday night and the start of what some are referring to as a ""media blitz"" by Harris, who started making more stops on podcasts, radio shows and other programs. On Tuesday, she will do interviews with ""The View,"" Howard Stern and Stephen Colbert.

The panel praised Harris' media tour for reaching out to voters, with Goldberg pointing out that she is still the vice president alongside the ""acting president.""

""I think people should just know it is not easy to do what she's doing. Because she's still also the vice president, so she's still got other things she's supposed to be doing, as does our acting president Joe Biden,"" Goldberg said, in an apparent Freudian slip.

'THE VIEW' CO-HOST JOY BEHAR BEGS REPUBLICANS TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATIC PARTY: 'JUST DO IT THIS ONE TIME'

The term ""acting president"" historically refers to people who temporarily hold the position while the actual president is incapacitated, such as the vice president assuming the powers of the office while the president is having a medical procedure done. Biden stepped aside from seeking the 2024 Democratic nomination amid growing party concerns about his mental acuity and ability to defeat Donald Trump.

Other women on the panel also complimented Harris' upcoming media appearances, particularly her attention to podcasts.

""I've been saying for a while she should be doing these podcasts because one thing people are doing with their podcasts is everything else in their life. You can listen to a podcast and conquer life. So the amount in these audiences she's reaching is fascinating, and she is hitting it all,"" Sara Haines said.

Alyssa Farah Griffin added, ""I think it's incredibly smart. I would have done it two months ago, but I'm glad she did it.""

In a fiery rant, Ana Navarro complained how ""[t]here's been a lot of moaning and groaning for weeks now that Kamala Harris hasn't been doing interviews and then doing interviews.""

Kansas City Chiefs rookie wide receiver Xavier Worthy had one of the sweetest moments of the game on Monday night as the team went on to defeat the New Orleans Saints, 26-13.

Worthy only had one carry on the night, but he made it count. Travis Kelce lined up as the quarterback in wildcat-type formation. He handed the ball off to Worthy, who ran it into the end zone for the three-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter.

The former Texas Longhorns standout went near the stands and handed the ball off to his mother. They embraced and she went back to her seat. The ESPN broadcast caught Nicky Jones celebrating with the football back in her seat.

It was Worthy's second rushing touchdown of the season. He showed off his speed in Week 1 for a clutch score against the Baltimore Ravens. He also caught a touchdown in that game against the Ravens. He caught another touchdown against the Los Angeles Chargers last week.

'MANNINGCAST' GETS AWKWARD AS TAYLOR SWIFT APPEARS ON SCREEN DURING BROADCAST

The 21-year-old's role is expected to increase with the injury to Rashee Rice. In four games, he has 12 catches on 21 targets for 179 yards and two touchdowns.

In the win against the Saints, the defense appeared to focus more on him and Kelce, which allowed JuJu Smith-Schuster to have an incredible game."

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

The Peach State could be critical to deciding the winner of the 2024 presidential race between Harris and former President Donald Trump.

The traditionally red Georgia has trended more favorably toward Democrats in recent years, particularly since Trump became the face of the GOP. Its pivotal turning point came in 2020, when President Biden won the state by just over 11,000 votes.

SPEAKER JOHNSON RIPS 'LACK OF LEADERSHIP' IN BIDEN ADMIN'S HELENE RESPONSE: 'ALARMED AND DISAPPOINTED'

""I think it's going to be a tough call. I think the current polls are pretty tight,"" said Atlanta resident Jose Malabo, who spoke with Fox News Digital in the city's Piedmont Park.

""I think if people show up and vote in numbers, I think Kamala has an edge here.""

Another person who only identified himself as Kevin said Harris would ""definitely"" win Georgia.

""She's the best candidate, in my opinion, from what I've read. And I follow it closely,"" he said.

However, despite Atlanta's reputation as a blue stronghold, not everyone there agreed Harris would take the state - a testament to Georgia's purple trends.

""Really, we're a Republican state,"" Tramel Simpson, a music producer, told Fox News Digital. ""Most people who voted in 2020 were just voting non-Trump...it's more of a decision now.""

The club announced on Monday that Sinclair, the highest international scorer in men's and women's soccer with 190 goals, will join majority owner Greg Kerfoot on the Vancouver Rise FC ownership team.

The 41-year-old recently announced that she would retire from playing at the end of her current season with Portland Thorns in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). She retired from the Canadian national team in December 2023.

""Growing up in Burnaby, I would have never imagined becoming an owner of a professional women's soccer club in my hometown,"" said Sinclair, who previously played semi-professional soccer with the Vancouver Whitecaps in the USL W-League.

""I want every little girl in British Columbia and Canada to be inspired to play, coach or manage - see the opportunity for women in sport. I'm so excited to be a part of this movement, and to be able to share my passion to help this club grow.""

The club's sporting director Stephanie Labbe said there are few names in the history of Canadian sport as big as Sinclair, who guided Canada to their first-ever gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.

Sinclair also received the Best FIFA Special Award for Outstanding Career Achievement in 2021, has two Olympic bronze medals from 2012 and 2016, and is also a 14-time Canadian women's player of the year.

""She has made an unmatched impact on the sporting landscape in Canada, inspiring millions of people across the country,"" Labbe said.

""We are thrilled that she has taken an ownership role with our club to make an equally large impact on the future of the game. We have won gold together and now we are both excited to take this next journey together in Canada with Vancouver Rise FC.""

Vancouver Rise will be part of the six-team Northern Super League, a new Canadian professional women's soccer league set to kick off in spring of 2025. The other teams will be based out of Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Halifax.

Sinead King, Vancouver Rise FC president, said they were thrilled to have Sinclair onboard.

""Her unparalleled experience as a professional player, combined with a deep connection to our community, makes this partnership truly special,"" King said.

""This collaboration underscores our commitment to elevating women's soccer and solidifying Vancouver Rise FC as a key player on both the national and international stage."""

As Hurricane Milton intensifies and heads toward Florida's Gulf Coast, residents are not only preparing for weather impacts but also dealing with misinformation about FEMA. The disaster relief agency has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in aid so far to help those affected by Hurricane Helene. Former President Donald Trump claims FEMA is running out of money after spending it on undocumented migrants. However, FEMA's administrator says those false claims are discouraging people from applying for the federal funds they desperately need.

Israelis yesterday observed a day of grief and reflection to mark one year since the Hamas-led attacks on communities near the country's border. Multiple memorials took place, partly due to disagreements over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence on continuing the war in Gaza. Families of hostages and their supporters boycotted the official government memorial service. They're seeking an immediate cease-fire deal to end the war and secure the release of the remaining 101 hostages.

In a wide-ranging interview with 60 Minutes yesterday, Vice President Harris was pressed for specifics on how she would pay for her economic plans and work to end the war in Ukraine. Her appearance on the show is part of a long tradition of presidential candidates sitting for interviews with 60 Minutes, dating back to 1968. Trump has criticized Harris for being unwilling to sit for difficult interviews with the press. The show says Trump was scheduled to appear for an interview as well, but his campaign canceled last week. Here's a deeper dive into Harris' responses during the interview.

NPR is visiting six key swing states that will likely decide this year's historic election. This week, Morning Edition is in Michigan to listen to voters about what matters to them and how that will affect their vote.

In 2017, Trump introduced ""Opportunity Zones,"" a tax incentive program aimed at encouraging investment in low-income and distressed communities like Detroit. Some were concerned at the time that investors would benefit more from the program than residents. Detroit Public Radio's Russ McNamara says it's a ""firm maybe"" that the program has reached its goal.

This 'Investing 101' Advice Is A Mess When It Comes To Dividends,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/10/08/this-investing-101-advice-is-a-mess-when-it-comes-to-dividends/,2024-10-08T12:09:36Z,"Having a diversified portfolio is pretty much Investing 101, right?

I mean, it's one of the first things we all learn as investors. But there's a problem here: Going for balance in ""regular"" stocks, bonds or ETFs can mean leaving income on the table.

To see what I'm getting at here, check out the average yields on two ETFs many people buy for stock and bond exposure. For stocks, I likely don't have to tell you about the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). It's the popular S&P 500 tracker. And it yields a microscopic 1.2%.

There are plenty of options on the bond side, but let's go with a fairly high-yielding ETF, the SPDR Bloomberg High-Yield Bond ETF (JNK). It holds the high-yield, or ""junk,"" bonds many investors (wrongly, as we'll see in a moment) see as too risky.

JNK yields 6.4%, which is obviously a lot better than 1.2%. But if you average the two together, you get just a 3.8% yield.

Good news is, there's an asset class out there that gives us the same level of diversification but with way more income: I'm talking 8%+ yields, with payouts often going out monthly.

If you've been reading me for a while, or are a member of my CEF Insider service, you likely know where I'm heading next: to closed-end funds (CEFs), which yield around 8% on average as I write this.

Below I've got three CEFs (one holding stocks, one holding high-yield bonds and one holding a nice stock-bond combo) that, when taken together, pay an average yield of 8.1%. Two of these funds pay dividends monthly, too.

Let's talk about them, starting with our equity CEF.

As CEF Insider's Investment Strategist, I've had plenty of occasions to speak to the staff at Adams Funds, sponsor of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX). These conversations have always left me impressed. These people are professional, dedicated to shareholder value and committed to ensuring stable and reliable payouts.

ADX, which yields 8.2% today, also gives us access to a level of institutional experience that's very hard (if not impossible) to find elsewhere, inside or outside CEFs: The fund was launched in 1929, on the eve of the Great Depression. That's nearly a century of dealing with anything the market can throw at it.

As we'll see in a moment, the result of that long experience has been market-beating performance.

A long-time knock on ADX is that up until earlier this year, it paid most of its dividend in as a one-time, year-end special payout that fluctuated according to the fund's net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio). That caused some CEF investors to give ADX a pass in favor of monthly or quarterly paying funds.

Management has now dealt with that issue: Under a change brought in earlier this year, ADX promises to pay no less than 2% of NAV per quarter, for an average 8% yield on NAV. That adds stability to the payout while still letting it ride with the value of the fund's portfolio.

So if you own SPY or one of its cousins now, consider swapping it out for ADX. You'll get exposure to many of the same stocks, and ADX's dividend policy means it essentially ""converts"" stock gains to dividends, giving you a solid income stream if you draw these funds off as cash.

And if you reinvest your payouts, you get a real shot at beating the market. ADX has crushed SPY since we added it to the CEF Insider portfolio in July 2017:

Now let's talk discounts: As I write this, ADX trades at an 11.7% discount to NAV, meaning we get its portfolio of top-quality stocks, including Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon.com (AMZN), for around 88 cents on the dollar.

As you can see above, the discount narrowed to just below 7% earlier this year, on news of the new dividend policy. It has since fallen back, but as interest rates decline and investors go looking for higher yields, I expect them to flock back to ADX, drawn by its new dividend policy, its strong performance history and its high yield, too

For bonds, let's go with the Barings Global Short Duration High Yield Fund (BGH).

BGH focuses on high-yield corporate bonds and yields 8.4%, while focusing on short-term bonds as a way to lower the risks of those bonds falling in value during a market panic, since they come to term so quickly.

The fund's payout is monthly and steady, having gone unchanged for years, with the odd special dividend (the spikes below), too:

That's a much bigger dividend than JNK offers. And even though JNK does pay monthly, BGH's payout is a picture of calm in comparison to JNK's ""squirrely"" dividend:

By lending to large, established companies, BGH generates reliable cash flow. Limiting its investments to short-term bonds also lowers the risk of these investments going sour.

And as you can see below, BGH's discount is still wide, at around 6%, but it's trending higher -- a very nice setup.

I see this one trading at a premium as more income-seekers make their way to bonds as Treasuries yield less and CDs mature.

Finally, a word on junk bonds and the risk of defaults, which is overblown. As we discussed in the September CEF Insider, American companies are far from struggling to meet their obligations, with fewer than 1% of issuers defaulting:

So don't let the words ""junk"" or ""high-yield"" put you off -- and cause you to miss out on BGH and its steady (and monthly paid) 8.4%-yielding dividend.

The Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Opportunities Fund (ETO) gives us exposure to top US large caps like Microsoft and Apple, much like ADX. But US stocks make up just 48% of the portfolio.

The next-biggest slice (36%) goes to international equities like Nestle SA, pharmaceutical firm Sanofi and Compass Group PLC, a British food-service firm.

The remainder (around 16%) is in fixed-income assets, mostly investment-grade bonds, to add a bit of extra stability. The whole package delivers a 7.8% dividend, paid monthly. And management recently raised it:

Trading at an 8.7% discount to NAV as I write this, BGH offers a smart blend of growth and income at a bargain price and, as with BGH, that discount is slowly disappearing.

To cap it off, the fund has also delivered a strong annualized total return of 9.6% over the last decade, adding strong performance to our high, rising monthly payout and ""stair-stepping"" discount."
Author Post: The Five Most Important Choices You Make,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbooksauthors/2024/10/08/the-five-most-important-choices-you-make/,2024-10-08T12:09:26Z,"I have been thinking about the important choices we make in life, and being an analytical chap, I have whittled down the following five things that I believe are the most important choices you will make in your life.

I carefully use the word 'choices' because I believe these are cognitive choices you can make or not make. Like any list, this is open to spirited debate, constant picking-at, potential revisions, and absolute disagreement.

The list starts with the least important of the five and builds to the most important of the five:

This is the least important of the five choices, but it is very important nonetheless. You try to decide on this when you are young and can/will adapt and change throughout life multiple times.

This choice is important since this is where you will spend most of your waking hours, and it can/will be a great source of satisfaction and pain (sometimes both on the same day). This choice also includes the decision to be a stay-at-home parent ... as that is surely a full 'work life.'

What you choose to 'be' is something you wake up to just about every day -- so choose wisely.

The next most important choice involves picking that special someone with whom you will spend the bulk of your life. This will also be a source of great fun, great challenges, and maybe great pain.

While this choice is No. 4 on the list and super important, it is also 'changeable,' even though that decision will surely carry some heartache. I read once that ""your commitment is not only to the person but also to the marriage,"" which I felt was a good perspective.

For some, marriage may not be in the cards or something that is not high on their list... once again, it's a choice!

Now, the decisions get serious ... and this one is big ... and irreversible. There are no do-overs like there are in Nos. 5 and 4.

While this generally will/could be your greatest source of joy and satisfaction, it can also have downsides. Once you have a child, they are yours for life -- for life! Through all the ups and downs, you are on-call as a parent, no matter the circumstances.

Additionally, whatever the health/situation is with your child/children, you are signed up for the entire ride. This one is not reversible, and while you have control over some things (nature vs. nurture), you do not have control over many things. As the saying goes, ""A parent is no happier than their saddest child"" and this has some grains of truth to it.

I'm not trying to scare you, but recognize this is a BIG choice.

There is a saying: ""Without your health, you really have nothing,"" I think it's somewhat true.

The decision to stay as healthy (physically and mentally) as you can, genetics aside, is a really important choice you have. Even if decisions 5, 4, and 3 are going great ... not having overall health can detract from them.

While you will all be dealt momentary, sometimes serious, even life-altering setbacks, you need to strive for healthiness, be active for your family and friends, and be able to do the things you enjoy.

You also need to prepare your body (and mind) for the later years of life. You make daily decisions to stay fit, flexible, and healthy. When you make the decision to be healthy and fit - almost all things are possible. If you are ever dealt a health blow that is really difficult, you still have to find your way to the No. 1 choice below -- somehow.

This is, without a doubt, the most important decision you will ever make! No matter what life throws at you in the four choices above, you can always choose happiness -- always.

Don't get me wrong, we all know there will be bad days/weeks/times, and being happy is not some fake sense of emotion or trying to kid oneself. Choosing happiness is about looking for the good in things, believing there is an upside, and generally being grateful about being alive and finding ways to enjoy it.

We only get one life/chance here on earth -- so choose happiness while you are here. As an added benefit to this choice, you will find that others like to be around happy people and, conversely, will avoid unhappy or mean-spirited people. By choosing happiness, you will surround yourself with happiness.

So, debate and disagree with these as you may, but make sure whatever your list is, you choose wisely."
Why Did JetBlue Stock Rise 15%?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/08/why-did-jetblue-stock-rise-15/,2024-10-08T12:09:22Z,"JetBlue stock (NASDAQ: JBLU) currently trades at $7 per share, more than 65% below its peak level of $22 seen in March 2021. In comparison, its peer - United Airlines stock (NASDAQ: UAL) saw its stock decline by around 3% over the same period. JBLU stock was up nearly 15% on Friday, Oct 4, after the reports of Spirit Airlines exploring bankruptcy filing emerged.

Spirit Airlines has been struggling to stay afloat amid losses. The company's reported losses increased from $473 million in 2021 to $677 million in the last twelve months. Now, JetBlue and Frontier Airlines are key competitors to Spirit Airlines, and if Spirit were to go bankrupt, JetBlue and Frontier stand to gain. This was reflected in Friday's uptick for these stocks.

But if we look at a slightly longer term, JBLU stock has performed worse than the broader market each year since 2021. Returns for the stock were -2% in 2021, -54% in 2022, and -14% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could JBLU face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months -- or will it see a recovery? After its recent rise, we think JBLU stock now looks overvalued. Even if Spirit were to file for bankruptcy, other airlines will need to invest more to capture the market share. With JetBlue's already high debt level, the company may find it difficult to raise additional funds. Moody's downgraded the ratings for JetBlue to B3 in August, after the company raised more money. Also, the company has spent cash for its operations in the last twelve months.

We estimate JetBlue's Valuation to be $6 per share, slightly below the current levels of $7. Our forecast is based on 0.2x sales for JetBlue, compared to its last eight-quarters average of 0.3x. A slight decline in valuation multiple seems justified, given the near-term headwinds.

Our detailed analysis of JetBlue's upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company's stock during the turbulent market conditions seen over 2022. It compares these trends to the stock's performance during the 2008 recession.

In contrast, here's how JBLU stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.

JBLU stock declined from nearly $9 in September 2007 (pre-crisis peak) to below $4 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying JBLU stock lost almost 60% of its pre-crisis value. It recovered post the 2008 crisis to levels of around $5 in early 2010, rising over 40% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124.

JBLU Fundamentals Over Recent Years

JetBlue's revenues increased sharply from $6.0 billion in 2021 to $9.3 billion in the last twelve months, owing to a solid recovery in travel demand post-pandemic. The company has benefited from increased capacity and higher yields in recent years. Despite higher revenue, the company saw its reported loss expand from $0.57 per share to a loss of $2.79 per share, due to a rise in both fuel and non-fuel expenses.

Does JBLU Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock?

JetBlue's total debt increased from $4.8 billion in 2021 to $6.0 billion now, while its total cash decreased from $2.8 billion to $1.5 billion over the same period. The company utilized cash of $73 million toward its operating activities in the last twelve months. Given that JBLU stock has lost significant value in recent years, its market capitalization now stands at just over $2.5 billion and its total debt of around $6 billion translates into a very high debt to equity ratio of 240%. The high debt burden is a near-term risk that the company faces.

Conclusion

With the Fed's efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiment, we believe JetBlue stock has the potential for gains once fears of a potential recession are allayed. That said, elevated fuel prices, high debt levels, and the impact from engine inspection remain the key near-term risk factors.

While JBLU stock appears to be fully valued, it is helpful to see how JetBlue Airways' Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons."
The Beatles See Multiple Songs Hit The Charts Again,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/10/08/the-beatles-see-multiple-songs-hit-the-charts-again/,2024-10-08T12:09:17Z,"The Beatles showed how popular they still are as a band a year ago when they returned with their first new single in decades. The group's ""Now and Then"" stormed charts everywhere, bringing them back to the uppermost regions on many lists. That smash is back on multiple tallies in the rockers' home country this week, and it's not the only release from the Grammy champions that manages to return to at least one roster across the pond.

""Now and Then"" is back on the Official Vinyl Singles chart this frame. The tune, which was made available to purchase on wax, is a top 20 win once again, as it reappears at No. 18.

The same cut is also on the rise on the Official Physical Singles tally. On that ranking, which looks at all formats that songs can be sold on -- with vinyl leading the charge most of the time -- The Beatles lift from No. 20 to No. 17 as their smash nears a full year on the roster.

As ""Now and Then"" reappears on one chart, ""From Us To You - 2 March 1964"" breaks back onto a pair as well. That single -- which is actually an EP -- returns to two lists at once.

""From Us To You - 2 March 1964"" joins ""Now and Then"" on the Official Vinyl Singles and Official Physical Singles charts. The short collection wasn't present on either list last frame, but now it's become a big hit again on both of them.

Between the two, ""From Us To You - 2 March 1964"" lands highest on the vinyl-only roster, where it re-enters at No. 14. On the Official Physical Singles list, the title is back at No. 25.

The Beatles regularly appear on charts in the U.K., where they remain one of the most successful and popular names in music. ""Now and Then"" and ""From Us To You - 2 March 1964"" stand as two of the band's most recent offerings, with one being a previously-unheard tune, while the other is a collection of largely already-known recordings. But because they come from the group that can do no wrong, both projects became sizable commercial wins, and they remain bestsellers, even months after their release."
"Author Post: Live, Work, and Play at Sea: Fast Internet Revolutionizes Cruise Life",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbooksauthors/2024/10/08/live-work-and-play-at-sea-fast-internet-revolutionizes-cruise-life/,2024-10-08T12:09:08Z,"The world changed in 2020 with the pandemic. We all had to find a way to change the way we worked. ""Zoom meetings"" became the standard, our wardrobes evolved to focus on comfort, and our time with family became important again.

Fast-forward a few years, and we are beginning to see how we might have appreciated the pandemic work environment: working wherever and whenever we wanted to.

Since then, our lives have become our top priority, and smart companies have learned to wrap their companies around their employees' lives, as opposed to the traditional work environment where employees suit up and cube up in a vast office universe.

When traveling on Royal Caribbean's Jewel of the Seas last year in the North Atlantic, probably one of the most remote places on the planet, I was surprised to discover that they had high-speed internet.

I could do Zoom calls, podcasts, and interviews. They installed the new ""Starlink,"" developed by Elon Musk's firm Space X. It is a low-orbit, freakishly fast satellite. Typically, satellite internet is not very responsive, slow, and frustrating. Anyone who has tried to use the internet in the past knows exactly what I am referring to. It's expensive, and you can't get it to work properly, so you just give up after a few too many coffees and swear words.

The cruise lines seem to be doubling down.

I reached out to Royal Caribbean for their thoughts on the matter, and it seems they are going 'all in' to a universe of high-speed internet. ""Seamless connectivity has been a game changer in the onboard guest experience,"" said Martha Poulter, SVP and Chief Information Officer of Royal Caribbean Group. ""Starlink enables us to provide high-speed internet across our fleet so that our guests can be connected, no matter where they sail with us.""

This innovation begs the question- is Starlink a tech shift that could transform the way we work to a whole new level? With Starlink, anyone can use the internet for business or pleasurethe world. Are we on the verge of being able to work ""whenever"" and ""wherever"" we want, including the North Atlantic Sea?

The book Start. Scale. Exit. Repeat. discusses how tech shifts can transform the world and how that shift can impact humanity. Tech shifts happen all the time. We saw how internet access in the 90s connected the world, how broadband created online cloud computing, and how the internet enabled a sharing economy with companies like Airbnb connecting renters with homeowners.

Today, we are seeing AI transform industries. The advent of high-speed internet anywhere by SpaceX and similar startups will unleash another paradigm shift: Live, Work, and Play anywhere in the world.

Today, you can book a cruise and continue to work at your company. Hammer out a few deals and hit the afternoon cocktail hour overlooking the icebergs in Alaska.

I was impressed with the speed of the internet, but I have to admit I was also frustrated with the lack of privacy needed to conduct my meetings. I would usually be found in the suite lounge doing meetings and podcasts, only to find other like-minded workaholics punching keys on their laptops and doing video meetings. At one point, I even tried to find space in the closed casino, but too many people were walking by and giving me strange faces.

My room wasn't that much better, as my wife and kids really didn't want me working there. In the near future, I predict cruise companies will begin to build some office infrastructure to allow people to work at sea, extending the time people can spend on a cruise ship.

The idea that youally work at sea prompted my wife and decideision to purchase a condo on a ship called Storylines MV Narrative, due to launch in 2027.

The ship comes fully equipped with all the amenities you would expect with a cruise ship: restaurants, a gym, and a theater, but it also includes private and shared offices in a facility dedicated to remote workers. Think of it like a ""We Work"" at sea. The ship is not a typical cruise ship but a residential ship -- a mobile lifestyle where your home travels with you all over the globe.

The notion that we need to work in an office from 9 to 5 has gone out the window with the pandemic. Now, the notion that we need to live in one location has changed with the advent of the internet everywhere on the planet.

At Storylines, they think about the importance of living and working at sea. ""There are many workspaces onboard, including meeting rooms, office spaces, the recording studio, hobby and makers center, artist studio, the medical lab, and more,"" says Alister Punton, the CEO of Storylines.

Storylines is committed to installing the most advanced internet available, making it possible to work at any location on the globe. ""Starlink is high on our list of suppliers. We are working towards providing at-home, at-work levels of connection for all the ship's residents, which will be provided utilizing a combination of methods, including LEO, VSAT & MBB.""

The ship, which tends to attract retirees, also appeals to families and entrepreneurs who want to live a traveling lifestyle while still building wealth.

My wife and I plan to travel three to six months yearly. Along with connecting with a community of fellow travelers and exploring the world, I see it as a unique opportunity to advance my mission of speaking globally about helping entrepreneurs start, scale, and exit their companies."

Amazon Prime Day Is Here -- Our Deals Editors Found The 70 Best Markdowns Based On Price Research,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2024/10/08/october-prime-day-2024/,2024-10-08T12:08:57Z,"Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days (you may know it as October Prime Day 2024) officially started this morning. Now through the end of the day tomorrow, you can shop hundreds of thousand of Black Friday-level discounts on both gift-worthy items and everyday essentials. So far, the best deals we've spotted include a self-emptying Roomba at its lowest price ever, Crest Whitestrips for 35% off and a 2024 MacBook Air for under $900.

Prime Day deals can be deceiving -- sometimes, the retailer will inflate the original price of an item to make an offer look better than it really is. So to help you find the discounts that are truly worth shopping, our deals editors have thoroughly researched the price history of every item on this list. We've separated them by category for easy browsing, and listed some of our best tips for shopping Prime Day like a pro.

The holidays will be here before you know it, and Prime Day is the perfect opportunity to start stocking up on gifts. In many cases, the prices you'll see during the sale are on par with what's coming during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so you may as well check a few items off your list a little early.

It can be hard to know whether you should pick up a Prime Day deal or wait for a better offer to come along closer to the holidays. But in some cases, this could be your only shot to save. For example, last year the Dyson Supersonic was $100 off for October Prime Day, but didn't go on sale again over Cyber Week. If you see a deal that'll save you a substantial amount, claim it. Chances are, you'd only be saving an additional 5 to 10% at most by waiting for Black Friday to roll around.

As we mentioned above, not every Prime Day deal is as great as it first appears. Sometimes, items will be at their deal price for months on end, or Amazon will inflate the original price of a product to make a discount look steeper than it really is. If you're shopping for items beyond the ones listed here (we've thoroughly researched all of these) be sure to use a price tracking site like CamelCamelCamel, or do some Googling to see what the products have sold for in the past.

Prime Big Deal Days is Amazon's annual fall sale for Prime members. The retail giant has run a second Prime Day-like event ahead of the holidays for the past two years, and it's continuing the tradition in 2024. The sale is a great opportunity to get a head start on your holiday shopping -- some of the offers are comparable to what you'd see during Black Friday or Cyber Monday.

Amazon Prime Day used to be a once-a-year occurrence, but in recent years the retailer has begun hosting a second sale in the fall. Although Amazon doesn't typically call the October event Prime Day, it's essentially the same thing -- a 48-hour event featuring hundreds of thousands of exclusive deals for Prime members.

Prime Big Deal Days, colloquially known as October Prime Day, will kick off on Oct. 8 at 12:01 a.m. PDT and last through 11:59 p.m. PDT on Oct. 9.

No. Prime Big Deal Days is meant to be a special perk for Prime members. In order to shop the deals, you have to have a Prime membership. If you're not a member already, here's how to sign up for a 30-day free Amazon Prime trial -- you'll be eligible to shop the sale with that.

An Amazon Prime membership costs $14.99 per month. You have the option to pay an annual $139 fee, which brings the price down to about $11.58 per month. If you haven't had an Amazon Prime membership for the past 12 months, you can also sign up for a free 30-day trial period first."

The first thing that came to my mind was this: Be aware of the pace.

First, you need to brace yourself because everything is going to come at you at a very fast pace. Then you need to understand that you are now living a different kind of life. When you're in that CEO role, there's no place else to go.

All of a sudden, you're it -- and that's a different animal. It's more intense than I ever expected. You have to make the decisions that matter because the buck stops with you.

It was a solid month before I was even kind of used to it. Everybody's coming into your office, everybody's asking for a decision or a direction. But don't worry -- at some point, everything will slow down, and you'll be able to settle in.

Think about it like this: Remember when you first started driving a car? Everything came at you fast when you were behind that wheel for the first time. It was overwhelming. You had to watch the speedometer, check all your mirrors, keep an eye on traffic, stay in your lane, follow the laws, pay attention to the people in your car with you, watch out for that engine light, and on and on. It was constant stress.

But now?

After years of experience, you probably barely think about most of those things. You've settled into a rhythm. Driving has slowed down for you. Not the speed you drive but the speed your brain takes to process things. You are comfortable with the vehicle, understand the signals, and can confidently navigate the road ahead.

I think it's the same for any high-intensity activity. Kayaking, horseback riding, cycling, football, surfing, you name it. At some point, everything will slow down, and you'll be able to handle the pace that you need to keep.

Returning to that new driver who goes from seeing a confusing blur of traffic and signs to being able to read cues from other vehicles and make split-second decisions, a new CEO will start seeing patterns in the chaos. You'll develop that CEO instinct where you can quickly assess situations and make the right calls.

My advice to anyone who has found themselves in this role is to hang in there and give your brain a chance to adjust. It doesn't matter if you've been in the C-suite already. The role of the CEO is different. The world comes at you faster.

You're trying to juggle financials, employee needs, strategic decisions, and a million other things. Give it time. Trust that things will begin to slow down and that your brain will get better at processing the patterns and signals, just like it did when you were learning to drive.

Every CEO tackles this new phase differently. Depending on your personality, you might find yourself either trying to slow things down around you or trying to bring everyone else up to your pace. There's no right or wrong way to adjust, but try to be aware of how you're handling that pace and how those around you are handling the pace as well.

Self-awareness is always important, particularly in a new role like this. With everything you are doing, it's easy to forget you're only human. It is also easy to forget that not everyone is like you.

Look for my blog next month with a few tips on what to do when you reach that stage, when you find you are risking stagnation or complacency. Every good CEO knows that the real work begins when things start to feel comfortable with the pace. That's when you dig deeper, push harder, and find new ways to lead your team and your company into the future."
Unlock Your Question Mindset To Become Your Own Best Career Coach,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pialauritzen/2024/10/08/unlock-your-question-mindset-to-become-your-own-best-career-coach/,2024-10-08T12:08:47Z,"""I wish to work with something really meaningful and purpose-driven but I do not know what it is or what I'm really good at. Can you help me?""

""I long to work less, fewer hours and without pressure and stress. And I want to spend more time with my family -- is this even possible and how?""

These are examples of questions that drive people to seek out a career coach. Or at least that's what the career coaches say.

When I asked my LinkedIn network to share the questions they believe are driving the growing demand for career coaching, all the responses I got were from career coaches. Not a single response came from people receiving coaching.

This confirms what my lifelong study of questions has shown time and again: that while some people make it a part of their job to share their own and other people's questions, the vast majority of us keep our questions to ourselves.

But what if it is this resistance to sharing, reflecting on and listening to our own questions that creates the need for career coaching in the first place?

What if it's not our lack of answers that makes us feel inadequate and insecure, but our failure to ask the questions that connect us to each other and the world we share?

According to a new study from EduBirdie, 63% of young Americans believe astrology has positively impacted their careers, and 15% claim it helped them get their dream job. As reported in Forbes, the participants in the study are a biased group of young people who already ""embrace astrology,"" so these findings cannot be generalized to the entire Gen Z or millennial population.

But according to Pernille Boege, a pioneer in business astrology, the study confirms a growing trend for people to ask deeper questions. When leaders consult Boege, it is with questions like, ""Why am I still not satisfied, even though I got my dream job?"" and ""How can I lead from a place that is true to my company's DNA?""

Boege believes ""the real task of a career coach is to help clients shift their perspective toward a more profound and existential one -- one that doesn't have answers 'out there' but requires a much deeper exploration of the self. A perspective that is philosophical, and even spiritual.""

While the opportunity to integrate professional astrology into career coaching is a welcome option for some, others might benefit more from reconnecting with the big questions everyone asks themselves from time to time.

In addition to existential questions about who we are and aspire to become, it applies to all humans across age, gender, ethnicity, education, and profession that we grapple with ethical questions about what is the right thing to do and epistemological questions about how we know whether something is right or wrong.

Just as business astrologers help their clients understand themselves in a bigger planetary picture, taking the time to ask yourself -- and people around you -- these basic human questions can help you tap into a 2,400-year tradition of navigating a (working) life that is defined more by what we don't know than by what we know.

Unlike other ancient traditions such as religion and science, philosophy is not so much concerned with the answers to the big questions as with continuing to ask and explore the questions. And by unlocking your question mindset, you will see why.

By taking the time to ask ourselves existential, ethical, and epistemological questions about what it means to be me in relation to you and everyone and everything around us, we automatically activate The Magical Question Triangle.

While answering questions posed by coaches, managers and HR professionals who have it as part of their job to ask, interview and conduct surveys makes us react to what others think is important, asking our own questions enables us to proactively,

This is exactly what it takes to find meaning and purpose in life and work. And this is exactly why outsourcing the responsibility of asking questions to a career coach can have the opposite effect of what you are looking for.

Instead of finding the answers you think you need, you risk distancing yourself from the questions that connect you to your life purpose as well as your surroundings.

Drawing on the tradition of astrology, Boege reminds her clients that we have to navigate the tension between the will of nature and our own will as human beings. ""We cannot simply choose whatever we desire; rather, we are woven into the greater web of life. Each of us with our own unique thread to discover and explore."" To find our path, Boege says, we have to listen carefully to what is emerging.

Whether you consult astrology, philosophy, or another tradition to reflect on the big questions that all people struggle with from time to time, the most important thing is not whether you talk to a professional coach or a friend about them, but that you don't leave it to others to ask, listen to, and explore the magic of your own questions."
Mix And Monitor Immersive Audio On Headphones With APL Virtuoso,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marksparrow/2024/10/08/mix-and-monitor-immersive-audio-on-headphones-with-apl-virtuoso/,2024-10-08T12:03:48Z,"Based at the UK's University of Huddersfield, Applied Psychoacoustics Laboratory was founded in 2013 by renowned spatial audio and psychoacoustic engineering expert, Professor Hyunkook Lee. The project's mission was to push the boundaries of sound technology, focusing on how ofpsychoacoustics and immersive audio interact.

Originally launched in May of 2023, APL Virtuoso software has been built on 10 years of research into binaural audio and spatial sound, giving users the ability to mix and monitor immersive audio without needing complex loudspeaker setups. Today, APL releases Virtuoso v2 which has three newly developed features for pushing what's possible from binaural rendering technology.

Powered by ASPEN technology, APL Virtuoso brings immersive audio mixing and listening to headphones, offering customizable virtual listening rooms that mimic real environments. APL claims Virtuoso delivers accurate externalization and localization of sound, ensuring mix decisions translate well to loudspeakers. The software also provides tonal naturalness, simulating the experience of listening to premium loudspeakers in a perfectly tuned room, while reducing headphone fatigue.

Key features of the new version include support for 53 speaker configurations, ranging from mono to Dolby Atmos and Auro-3D, seven virtual room presets, fully customizable acoustic settings, plus built-in HRTF and head tracking. The software currently provides EQ compensation for 100 headphone models, giving a personalized, high-fidelity listening experience across any setup.

The Virtuoso v2 plug-in is available as AAX, VST3 and AU. It is also available as standalone software, opening potential uses and providing a new level of flexibility.

Head-Related Transfer Function settings in APL Virtuoso are crucial for creating a natural and immersive listening experience. HRTF is a filter that models how an individual's ears, head and torso affect the way sound reaches the eardrum from different directions. Users can either use one of the five presets built into Virtuoso or upload their personalized settings for an even more realistic adjustment.

By adjusting HRTF and virtual room acoustic settings, Virtuoso can accurately simulate how sound would naturally be perceived in a physical space, providing realistic spatial cues. This allows listeners to experience audio that feels externalized, as if coming from around them, rather than from within their headphones. This precise spatial representation is key to reducing ear fatigue and delivering an authentic and natural listening environment.

Virtuoso v2 adds three new features to its toolbox. The 10-band parametric EQ for headphone equalization takes the previous compensation tool to a new level. Users now can load built-in or custom EQ profiles and tweak the 10-band EQ for a more accurate representation of their desired headphones.

The standalone version of Virtuoso v2 has a built-in WAV/ADM player so users can cue up their favorite music in stereo, multichannel format or Dolby Atmos ADM master files for easy listening. Making the most of audio customization will transport music lovers into their perfect listening room, equipped with an array of loudspeaker options for the ultimate real-life headphone experience.

With a newly developed 3D interactive GUI, users can better visualize speaker arrangements and customize their settings more intuitively. This improvement allows for more control over the mix.

With the release of Virtuoso v2, APL introduces seamless Audeze Maxwell head-tracking integration, offering users a more immersive experience. Unlike traditional head-trackers, typically requiring wired connections and additional bridge software, Maxwell's built-in head-tracker works wirelessly.

Virtuoso v2 reads the Maxwell's tracking data directly, eliminating the need for complicated setups. This integration allows Virtuoso+Maxwell users to experience more realistic binaural audio effortlessly, making spatial audio mixing and immersive listening simpler and more precise.

For professional users, APL Virtuoso v2 provides a tool for mixing and monitoring audio in a variety of environments. With realistic virtual loudspeaker setups and a new interactive GUI, engineers can make precise mix decisions on headphones with a new level of accuracy and spatial localization. The software's accurate translation to real loudspeakers brings consistency across listening environments. This, says APL, makes Virtuoso v2 ideal for professionals demanding precision and flexibility in their workflow, whether working in the studio or remotely.

The new multichannel WAV/ADM player in the standalone app can be used for checking how stereo or immersive mixes would translate in various playback environments, it is also a useful quality control tool when working remotely with a client.

APL Virtuoso v2 offers audiophiles and music lovers an immersive, high-fidelity listening experience for enjoying music as if they were in a professional studio or live concert venue. With its ability to create realistic virtual listening rooms, Virtuoso v2 claims to provide tonal accuracy and precise spatial representation, placing the audio source outside of the listener's head as though listening to real speakers. This offers a more natural and engaging experience, with reduced listening fatigue for longer and more comfortable sessions. The headphone compensation EQ feature also ensures that each user can enjoy perfectly tuned audio, tailored to their specific setup, enhancing both clarity and immersion.

World-renowned mastering and mixing engineer Bob Katz highlights Virtuoso's power in professional use. He said: ""I thought I was listening to my speakers! Virtuoso fooled me. Amazing creation. We finally have a translation tool that allows mixing with headphones.""

Katz added: ""Using Virtuoso, I got a sense of height and rear localization which is far better than other binaural systems I have tried.""

Hans-Martin Buff, who is a long-time engineer for artists like Prince and Peter Gabriel, called Virtuoso: ""A game-changer for my binaural adventures."" Emphasizing its reliability and portability whether in a studio or on the road.

With the release of APL Virtuoso v2 audio professionals and enthusiasts can experience an enhanced and immersive listening experience. Whether used for critical mixing decisions or simply enjoying music, Virtuoso's technology redefines how people interact with sound.

Pricing & Availability: APL Virtuoso v2 is available from apl-hud.com with three options: Plugins $199 (AAX, AU and VST3), Standalone app $149 (macOS and Win) and Bundle $299 (plugins and standalone). APL will offer a 50% discount on all three versions for a limited time starting from October 8."
iPhone Privacy Warning -- iOS 18 Mirroring Bug Could Expose Your Data,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2024/10/08/iphone-privacy-warning-ios-18-mirroring-bug-could-expose-your-data/,2024-10-08T12:03:44Z,"An iPhone warning has been issued by security researchers, after they found a ""major systemic privacy bug in iOS 18 and macOS 15.0 Sequoia.""

In the research, titled ""Broken Mirror: iPhone Mirroring at Work May Expose Employees' Personal Information, security software firm Sevco Security says it has ""discovered a major systemic privacy bug whereby the applications from a user's personal iPhone may become part of the company's software inventory via a new Apple feature known as ""iPhone Mirroring.""

In case you aren't familiar, iPhone Mirroring is a new feature that requires macOS Sequoia, iOS 18 and Apple Silicon that aims to enable a more seamless user experience between a person's phone and laptop.

The iOS 18 bug means the applications on an employee's personal iPhone may be exposed to their corporate IT department, Sevco says. ""For iPhone users, this Apple bug is a major privacy risk because it can expose aspects of their personal lives that they don't want to share or that could put them at risk.""

""This could include exposing a VPN app in a country that restricts access to the internet, a dating app that reveals their sexual orientation in a jurisdiction with limited protections or legal consequences, or an app related to a health condition that an employee simply does not want to share,"" the researchers say.

When Sevco saw personal iOS applications reported as installed on Mac devices, it assumed this was a one-off bug in its processing or an upstream customer inventory provider. ""As we dug in, we recognized it was not a glitch -- personal iOS apps were indeed being reported on Mac devices from multiple upstream software vendors at multiple customers. This issue was something new and systemic.""

The consequences of this data exposure may be severe, the researchers say. For companies, this bug represents a ""new data liability from potentially collecting private employee data,"" which could violate privacy laws such as CCPA, potential litigation, and federal agency enforcement, they warn.

I have contacted Apple for comment on this issue and will update this article if the iPhone maker responds.

That's all well and good, but what's the actual risk of this iOS 18 bug to the user? Not huge, if you are already being careful with your privacy at work. ""If you don't trust your employer, I certainly would not recommend using any personal device in work capacity, and vice-versa,"" says Sean Wright, head of application security at Featurespace.

At the same time, he points out, your employer already deals with your personal data including your bank details and address. ""So it's important to keep that in mind when determining how much of an issue this really is. Sure they could tell what apps you have installed and used, but the reality is most in the organization are not going to be interested.""

If anything the iOS 18 bug will be more of a problem for employers as they now need to determine what software is on work devices and what is not, says Wright.

Another important consideration to take into account is, many organizations will have not switched to macOS 15.0 Sequoia yet, Wright says.

Finally, and perhaps most crucially, Wright asks: ""How many people are actually going to use this functionality on their work laptop, or even be able to? Those already untrusting of their employers are highly unlikely to do so. So while this is an interesting finding, I view the risks as low -- and for most people is not even going to be an issue.""

Even so, Apple will need to fix this iOS 18 bug to ensure no privacy violations take place.

Sevco says it has notified Apple and the iPhone maker is working on a fix. It claims it has also notified several enterprise software vendors where Sevco, Apple, and the vendor have common customers and these have confirmed the issue.

For now, Sevco advises employees to refrain from using iPhone Mirroring on work computers.

""Companies should identify any enterprise IT systems that collect software inventory from Macs and work with those vendors to mitigate the risk until a patch is available.""

""We expect Apple to patch macOS before long based on our conversations with them. When a patch becomes available, companies will need to apply the patch to stop collecting private employee data. After the patch is available, Sevco recommends that companies purge any mistakenly collected employee data to eliminate liability risk,"" the researchers say.

The researchers have provided technical details about how to reproduce the bug and also detailed a time line. Sevco reported the bug to Apple on Sept 27 and the iPhone maker acknowledged receipt within an hour. By Sept 30 Apple confirmed it had reproduced the issue. On Oct 3, Apple confirmed intent to address the issue in an update coming soon.

On Tuesday, Sevco published the blog. The more astute among you may notice that this timeline is a little rapid for dislosing security bugs in software. The best practice is 30 days to allow a tech giant to fix a flaw.

Sevco says it has its reasons for the shorter timeframe: ""While typical responsible disclosure timelines are usually at least 30 days, we've decided to release this information now because we are watching the number of people and companies impacted grow with every day that passes. The biggest risk in this situation is to individuals in a potentially compromising situation and their best defense is their own awareness.""

But what's also important to note is, Sevco is a vendor, and it wants to sell security services, so take that into account when assessing your risk.

However, the bug is legit and worth noting if you use Macs in an enterprise setting -- or if you are an employee who uses their personal device at work.

But as Wright points out, a lot of companies using Macs won't even have upgraded to the latest version yet -- and the same goes for many iPhone users updating to iOS 18."
Five Things I Wish I Knew When I Started 'Diablo 4: Vessel Of Hatred',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/08/five-things-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-started-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred/,2024-10-08T12:03:37Z,"After an unfortunate delay on release night, Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred is ready to launch this morning, and with it, the new Spiritborn class.

I got to play the expansion early for review (8.5/10 was my verdict) and as such, I have a few dozen extra hours in so far compared to those playing at launch. So, I figured I would give you some advice to get you started here based on what I've played so far.

1) Spirtborn Is OP Right Now - This is not terribly surprising given that Diablo 4 wants everyone to enjoy the new class, but even with tuning and new skills across other classes, Spiritborn is sort of in a power level all its own right now, and if you weren't planning to start with them (I'm sure 90% of people were) I would definitely consider doing so.

While it's possible that Spiritborn is reined in over time, for now Blizzard seems to be content to unleash its full power and you will want to take advantage of that before any future nerfs.

2) Best Spiritborn Animal Spirits - You are given the choice between heading down tracks for Jaguar, Gorilla, Eagle and Centipede, or a mix of them. Chances are you will probably eventually do a blend of two of them, but as it stands, the poison-based Centipede is the top choice for the moment with powerful builds that are going to be meta, at least for a while.

Eagle is probably the next best class, lightning element while focus on mobility. I personally did a Jaguar Gorilla combo which was fun for a while but eventually my damage dropped off significantly as I reached later Torment tiers.

3) New Difficulty Curve - With four pre-Torment levels and four Torment levels, things have changed on the difficulty side in that...oftentimes things are a lot harder. I and most other reviewers had to play the campaign almost entirely on Normal, something I never did previously, but we also had zero renown for bonuses, which did not help matters. But if you're feeling like Hard is too hard to start, you're not alone. So far, it seems to be a bit smoother than release, however, with those extra boosts.

The endgame has also been made much more difficult with big boosts to enemy health so the best players in the game aren't necessarily blowing through everything the way they used to be. So if you hit max and it feels more punishing than before, that's how it's supposed to be.

4) Don't Overlook Companions - At first I thought that companions were sort of just a thing that Diablo 4 added because the game had them previously and they figured they'd just have them show up eventually.

But these companions are actually pretty good, even if you're not gearing them up the same way you did in other games. They can be pretty core to your build. For instance, I had a Spiritborn build based around Vulnerable, and the little demon child has a skill that can make large swaths of enemies vulnerable at a time which consistently helped me. Others can give you buffs to enemies with certain status effects, etc. Take time to examine all their skills and which one might be best for you. And they're tougher than they look in terms of survivability as well.

5) Runes Over Gems - Diablo 4 wants to encourage players to use the new rune system which takes advantage of double armor gem slots that you were previously using. That's...not great, right? Given how important those were.

Well, one thing you may miss is that gems now have been modified to be less necessary. For instance, a ruby in your armor no longer gives you important Max Life %, it gives you +Strength. So in that instance, you may want to be using runes in those slots over gems even if gems felt pretty essential previously. Some are unchanged, like jewelry gem slots for elemental resist, but with single slots, they can't use runes anyway.

That's my early advice, I may do more down the line. Have fun! See you out there."
Justice As Medicine: Legal Representation As A Public Health Strategy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/reneehsia/2024/10/08/justice-as-medicine-legal-representation-as-a-public-health-strategy/,2024-10-08T12:03:30Z,"From San Francisco to Miami to Baltimore, mayoral elections this fall will shape the future of American cities for decades to come. While many of these elections are focused on housing, homelessness, and public health, an overlooked approach that sits at the intersection of all three is access to legal representation. Many have argued that legal representation is a civil right; it may also be a fundamental public health necessity.

Consider Michelle's story. Michelle is a 52-year-old grandmother living in public housing with her two young granddaughters. Their unit was riddled with black mold and sewage backups so severe that they had to use buckets of water to bathe. Despite repeated pleas to her landlord, no repairs were made. As their living conditions worsened, so did their health. Michelle made several trips to the emergency room -- first for respiratory issues due to mold exposure and later for gastrointestinal problems exacerbated by the unsanitary conditions. Michelle's health, along with her granddaughters', kept deteriorating as the underlying issue was not addressed. Worse yet, due to a rent miscalculation, her landlord threatened to evict her and her family. However, once she got legal services, the issues were fixed within weeks, and the threat of eviction was removed.

Michelle's story isn't an isolated case. Legal issues frequently snowball into health crises, especially in housing. As an ER doctor in San Francisco, I have treated patients who have lost their homes because they can't afford legal counsel to contest unsafe living conditions, address domestic violence, or prevent wage theft. In California, for example, it's estimated that 92% of low-income families with legal issues are unable to access legal help. And once someone becomes homeless, their health deteriorates rapidly.

Legal barriers often accelerate, or even trigger, the journey from housing instability to homelessness. Without access to legal representation, people are evicted, lose access to critical services, or face unsafe conditions without recourse. For two decades, I've witnessed the devastating toll of untreated mental health issues, substance use, and chronic illnesses in homeless populations, as well as the impact it has on our emergency departments and health care system. Research shows that homelessness exacerbates both mental and physical health issues. A study from San Francisco's Open Door Legal found that legal representation prevented 46% of clients at risk of homelessness from losing their homes. The cost? About $3,100 per person. Compare that to the $83,000 Santa Clara County spends annually on each homeless individual, with 61% of that cost going to healthcare services.

It's no secret that healthcare and housing are inextricably linked. And while there's growing recognition of this reality through, for example, new Medicaid programs that provide housing support and non-medical services like air purifiers or financial coaching, there's an essential missing piece. People living in precarious housing need legal advocates to protect their rights.

We could prevent countless public health emergencies by providing legal aid before people reach the point of crisis. Legal representation can keep people in stable housing, prevent evictions, and address unsafe living conditions before they lead to ER visits. The downstream effects of legal intervention are profound: fewer health crises, fewer ER visits, and fewer people forced onto the streets.

Universal legal representation may be both a moral imperative and a pragmatic one. It's an essential part of the strategy for the rising healthcare costs associated with homelessness. If we can reduce homelessness cost-effectively, our healthcare system will be far less burdened.

As we enter an election cycle where public health and housing are central concerns, policymakers may benefit from understanding that legal representation can be a health intervention. We need a system where access to justice is prioritized as highly as access to healthcare because in many cases, they are one and the same. It's time we treat access to legal representation as an essential part of our public health infrastructure."
"""It Was Vibrant"" Sir King Castro Remembers Their Father As Castro NYC Jewelry Retrospective Opens",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/katematthams/2024/10/08/it-was-vibrant-sir-king-castro-remembers-their-father-as-castro-nyc-jewelry-retrospective-opens/,2024-10-08T11:57:33Z,"The US master jeweler Castro NYC was at the top of his game when he died suddenly in 2022. As a major retrospective of his work opens at Carpenters Gallery in London, his son, Sir King, talks about how they are planning to keep their father's flame alight.

Terry Castro's jewels thrum with a singular energy. To handle them feels like a privilege, like handling artefacts or precious objects weighty with meaning. When I first came across Castro's work in a Paris showroom in 2019, I was staggered by their opulance, the uncompromising craftsmanship and design skill behind each extraordinary piece. The man himself also ""blew me away"", as I wrote in my notes from that meeting; for the rich web of references deftly interwoven in his work, from Medieval architecture to Victoriana and African tribal masks; tiny monkey dolls, a huge opal held in place with ruby cat tails, and his richly decorated lockets. ""Incredible"", I tapped out.

In 2022, Castro was riding high. Sixteen years after starting his brand, after stints making jewelry repairs and running his own clothing line, he was selling internationally. In 2021, Sotheby's had included his jewels in the Brilliant & Black exhibition, co-curated by Melanie Grant, alongside 20 other Black designers. Castro cut a charismatic figure in the group; ""I went for people who make my heart beat faster,"" she told me at the time; ""I'm driven by emotion."" And the wearable art of Castro NYC certainly delivered.

""What makes Castro NYC unique, is that it's spirit first and jewelry after,"" says Sir King Castro, who took over their father's business last year. ""Every design comes from Source which means God or the Universe, which is why people resonate with the pieces. They see a piece of God, which is themselves, in all of it."" They explain that Castro grew up in a mixed Jewish-Catholic household, a Victorian mansion in a post-industrial factory town in Ohio; that his mother, Mary, exposed him to travel, fashion and culture from an early age, forging the soul of the artist he would become. He ""emphasized the power of words, and prayed every morning and night,"" in an expression of personal spirituality rather than religious devotion.

After their father's untimely death, Sir King gathered examples of their father's work from around the world, along with his sketches and notes, to build an archive. Today, 40 of those jewels see the light in a Castro NYC retrospective at the Carpenters Workshop Gallery in London, ""providing an intimate glimpse into the artist's creative process,"" according to the Gallery, which worked with Sir King to bring the show to life.

Back in 2019, those lockets I marvelled at sold for around $3,000. Today, they go for nearly three times that figure, and the rest of Castro's body of work has seen a similar increase. One of Sir King's favorite pieces is the Catamondo ring, an antique carved jade tiger and set with cabochon emeralds and rubies on a gold and silver band with a man's diamond-set body and a screaming face on the inside: ""it exudes massive energy; everyone who gets to see it falls in love.""

The exhibition presents Castro's creative practice as an exploration of themes as broad as cultural identity, mortality, the relationship humans have with animals and his reinterpretation of folklore and motifs from around the world. For Loic le Gaillard, co-founder of Carpenters Workshop Gallery, ""it is a privilege to showcase the remarkable talent of the late Terry Castro, whose innovative approach continues to inspire and captivate audiences worldwide. This retrospective is a testament to his enduring legacy and our commitment to preserving and celebrating artistic excellence.""

Sir King, also an artist, describes their father as ""full of stories, history and knowledge, like a fountain of wisdom,"" from extensive reading, watching documentaries and self-educating, all of which he poured generously into his art. He took the time to learn about the spaces he occupied and ""had a very developed map of the history of the world in his head. Growing up around him was an adventure,"" they continue, remembering a time the pair snuck into a junkyard for metal scrap, Sir King riding on the handlebars of their father's bike.

""It was magical in a lot of ways. When it came to work, it was hard, and I didn't like it when I was younger. When I got older and became an apprentice [Sir King joined their father in Istanbul in 2021] I remember my dad would wake up before me and go to sleep after, oftentimes around 6am."" They remember stopping to chat with strangers in the street: ""talking to him was a lesson in philosophy, history, spirituality and culture. It was vibrant.""

Several of the pieces in the show -- the Terry Berry and Bunny Doll brooches and Flying Monkey pendant -- were originally designed by Terry Castro and left unfinished when he died. They were completed by Sir King, a labor of love that they describe as ""really healing. I think that diving into his work, and him as a person has made me feel connected to him. These pieces are a bridge from him to me."" They plan to continue Castro's ""legacy of innovation,"" working across different mediums to connect with a new generation, expanding the joint creative practice of father and son. ""I'm happy to continue the story that he began,"" they finish. ""I don't know where it will lead, but the journey has been magical already."""
10 Rhetorical Techniques To Help You Communicate Your Strategy Better,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sherzododilov/2024/10/08/10-rhetorical-techniques-to-help-you-communicate-your-strategy-better/,2024-10-08T11:57:23Z,"With the year-end fast approaching, many organizations are diligently wrapping up their strategic planning for the upcoming year.

While crafting a robust strategy is commendable, Harvard Business School Professor Robert Kaplan's book, The Balanced Scorecard: Translating Strategy into Action, highlights a glaring issue -- 90% of organizations fail to execute their strategies successfully. Why?

In my experience leading countless strategy transformations, one of the key reasons for failure is poor communication. The truth is, the bridge between strategy and successful execution is built on the power of words.

However, just talking about your strategy for hours on end won't cut it. The most effective leaders use various rhetorical techniques and literary devices, designed to create rapid understanding and buy-in of their strategies. Here are a few to consider.

How can you make your strategy memorable? By turning it into a story. Stories have a unique power to captivate, engage and inspire an emotional response from your audience. When you weave vivid imagery and relatable characters into your strategy, you provide context that helps others understand its impact.

Imagine you're presenting a new customer service strategy. Instead of listing metrics and procedures, you tell the story of ""Jane,"" a customer who had a great experience thanks to your team's efforts. You describe their journey from frustration to satisfaction, highlighting how each strategic element played a role in their positive outcome. This narrative approach gives life to abstract ideas, making them tangible, capturing your audience's attention.

Why do slogans like ""a penny saved is a penny earned"" stick with us? It's not the literal meaning but the rhythmic effect of repetition. Repeating two or more words or key phrases deepens understanding and aids retention.

In strategic communication, repeating core elements ensures your audience grasps the essence of your message. It also drives your main points home, making them more likely to be retained.

Imagine you're leading a team meeting to introduce a new project strategy. By consistently repeating the core objectives of your project -- like innovation, collaboration and efficiency -- you reinforce these priorities in your team's mindset.

Parallel structure (or parallel sentences) involves using the same grammatical structure in successive phrases or sentences to make an idea more compelling. This linguistic tool enhances clarity and makes complex ideas easier to digest.

Imagine you're presenting a business strategy for expanding into a new market. By using parallel phrases or structure -- ""analyze the demand, strategize the entry, maximize the growth"" -- you create a rhythmic and persuasive argument.

Why say something directly when a metaphor can spark a deeper sense of understanding? Metaphors allow you to draw comparisons between your strategy and something familiar, creating a bridge to complex concepts. They evoke vivid images and an emotional connection. The same word can have multiple meanings, adding layers of depth.

Imagine describing a new business investment you just made as ""planting seeds for future growth."" This metaphor conveys the patience and nurturing required for success in a way that is both accessible and inspiring. Use metaphors to infuse your strategy with figurative language that fosters clarity and engagement.

Does your audience understand the depth of your strategy? Rhetorical questions provoke thought and invite introspection. By posing questions that require deeper consideration, you guide your audience towards greater alignment with your strategic goals.

Imagine yourself in a board meeting, introducing a new brand vision. Instead of simply stating the vision, you ask, ""What does this brand signify to you? to our customers?"" This prompts your colleagues to reflect and better understand the significance of your strategy.

How do you build a logically sound argument? Through deductive reasoning. Start with a general principle and lead your audience to a specific conclusion. This approach structures your message and increases its credibility.

Imagine you're presenting a new strategy to improve customer engagement. You may begin by establishing the general principle that enhanced customer interaction leads to increased brand loyalty and consequently, higher sales. This isn't just about sentence structure -- it's about crafting a narrative that resonates with your audience. From there, you guide your audience to the specific conclusion that investing in a personalized customer service platform will achieve these outcomes. By clearly outlining this logical progression, you help your audience understand the strategy's rationale and its potential benefits, grounded in solid evidence.

Is humor appropriate in strategic communication? Absolutely! Humor lightens the tone and builds rapport, making your message more relatable and less intimidating. A well-placed humorous effect can enhance engagement and ease tense discussions.

Imagine you're presenting a new marketing strategy to your team. You sprinkle in a light-hearted joke about viral cat videos to highlight the importance of engaging content. This not only grabs attention but also opens the floor for creative ideas, making your strategy more approachable without compromising professionalism.

Ever used a figure of speech to emphasize a point? Hyperbole -- a deliberate exaggeration -- can drive home the importance of your message. It draws attention, creates emphasis and makes your strategy more memorable. However, use it sparingly to avoid undermining your credibility.

Imagine you're discussing a new cost-cutting strategy with your team. You may exaggerate the potential savings by saying, ""This strategy will save us a fortune!"" This hyperbolic statement creates impact and highlights the significant benefits of implementing this strategy. Just be sure to provide concrete evidence to back up your claim.

When was the last time you paused for effect? The strategic pause is a powerful tool that lets your audience absorb your message. A speech consisting this rhetorical device creates anticipation and allows key points to resonate. It's not about silence, it's about creating space for reflection.

Imagine you're presenting a new sustainability strategy to your stakeholders. After outlining the key objectives, you pause and ask your audience to consider how this strategy aligns with their values and goals. This brief moment of reflection allows them to connect with the message on a deeper level and increases the chances of buy-in.

How do you inspire action? By concluding with a call to action. Your strategy is only as effective as its execution, so motivate your audience to take the next step. Whether it's adopting a new initiative or engaging with your team, make your call to action clear and compelling.

Imagine you're presenting a new change management strategy to your organization. After outlining the steps for implementation, you conclude by saying, ""Let's work together to make this vision a reality. Are you ready to join us on this journey?"" This closing statement empowers your audience to take action towards achieving the strategic goals.

By incorporating these common rhetorical devices into your communication toolkit and your own writing, you'll bridge the gap between strategy and execution. Make your strategy a story that resonates, a plan that engages and a call to action that ignites change."
Forbes Daily: Nvidia Overtakes Microsoft As Market Cap Hits $3.19 Trillion,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/10/08/forbes-daily-nvidia-overtakes-microsoft-as-market-cap-hits-319-trillion/,2024-10-08T11:57:16Z,"When inflation spiked in the wake of the pandemic in 2021 and 2022, the Federal Reserve was ""behind the curve"" in its response, one official from the central bank told Forbes.

Forbes recently spoke with Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and an alternate member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which votes on the target federal funds rate. The Fed began hiking rates in March 2022, and then raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to over 5% -- the fastest interest rate increase in four decades.

Looking ahead to the second half of the decade, Goolsbee is keeping a close eye on growth in productivity, which he said would support an expanding economy without inflation.

Despite losses for its big tech peers, Nvidia's stock rallied Monday, leading it to eclipse Microsoft as the second-largest company in the world amid the AI boom. Nvidia registered its highest market cap since August at $3.19 trillion, trailing only Apple, valued at $3.4 trillion.

Influencers are touting egg donation as a cash cow to millions of followers on the internet. But while social media is helping to destigmatize fertility problems and procedures, some donor-conceived people and experts say the vast majority of content that lures donors with big payouts is doing more harm than good.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 suffered their worst days since early September following two new hurdles for investors that threaten to increase the cost of doing business and cut into profit margins. Crude oil prices and government bond yields, which influence borrowing costs as many loans are benchmarked against Treasury notes, both moved to multiweek highs Monday.

Andreessen Horowitz cofounder Ben Horowitz tweeted that he and his wife will make a ""significant"" donation to Vice President Kamala Harris, a notable reversal of his previous support for former President Donald Trump. Still, Horowitz said Harris' campaign has yet to formally state its intentions with their tech policies and that the ""Biden Administration has been exceptionally destructive on tech policy across the industry.""

Vice President Kamala Harris defended her economic plan in an interview with 60 Minutes on Monday, predicting Congress will go along with paying for her agenda, as the nominee has already called for an ""opportunity economy"" focused on the middle class and released plans that include lowering grocery and prescription drug prices and addressing the housing crisis. Harris' economic plan would increase the federal deficit by $3.5 trillion through 2035, according to an estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

One of Donald Trump's prized properties, the landmark building 40 Wall Street, now appears underwater. The remaining 35 years on Trump's leasehold in the Financial District tower is worth about $116 million, which is $2 million less than the estimated $118 million Trump owes on his mortgage, according to a Forbes analysis.

The Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge brought by social network X on Monday, after the Elon Musk-owned company sued the federal government for forcing it to turn over information about former President Donald Trump to Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team. Prosecutors asked the company, formerly known as Twitter, to sign a non-disclosure agreement barring them from informing Trump or his associates about the warrant.

As Hurricane Milton, now a Category 4 storm, is slated to make landfall in Florida this week, major U.S. airlines are issuing travel waivers allowing passengers flying in or out of impacted airports to rebook without paying the fare difference. Even if you're not traveling through Florida this week, your flight may be impacted, so monitor your airline's app for flight notifications.

The Supreme Court's new term kicked off Monday, and the justices are slated to hear cases on major issues like guns, transgender rights, vaping and environmental impact studies. The nation's highest court is likely to add a number of other key cases to its docket, including former President Donald Trump's criminal cases and challenges to the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness relief efforts.

TOPLINE Phoenix Capital Group, founded in 2019, says it's an oil and gas company, specializing in acquiring mineral rights and drilling independently. But its core competency seems to be raising funds from yield-hungry investors.

Mostly through advertising run on conservative radio shows like The Sean Hannity Show and webinars which it holds daily, founder Adam Ferrari reports that Phoenix has so far raised $700 million of a planned $750 million private high yield bond offering. Some 95% of its sales, says Matt Willer, head of Capital Markets, are to people above the age of 55, with half of the funds coming from 401(k)s and IRAs.

Phoenix is one of a growing number of little-known financial firms taking advantage of Congress's Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2012, which enabled companies to more easily sell unregistered securities, otherwise known as private placements, directly to individual investors.

From 2009 through 2020, $15 trillion of so-called Reg D offerings were sold, according to a 2023 study by SLCG Economic Consulting. During the same time period, fully SEC registered offerings, of stocks, bonds and ETFs trading on exchanges, tallied $16.4 trillion in sales.

As the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) movement gained traction, many banks and large institutional investors began withdrawing from fossil fuels, citing environmental concerns. This opened a window for sellers of unregistered securities, especially those with enticing offerings like Phoenix and its oil bonds yielding as much as 13%.

WHY IT MATTERS ""The private placement market is booming, offering a fast track for companies to raise capital,"" says Forbes senior reporter Brandon Kochkodin. ""Phoenix Capital Group has tapped into this trend, drawing mom-and-pop investors to its debt with promises of high yields and the opportunity to create 'generational wealth.' Yet, a recent deal between Phoenix and Fortress Investment Group, a Wall Street behemoth, suggests that smaller investors might not be getting paid enough interest for the risk they're taking.""

Elon Musk announced his pro-Trump America PAC will pay for each successful referral of a registered swing state voter who signs a petition ""to show support for free speech and the right to bear arms"":

1 million: The number of swing state voters the petition seeks to sign on

$23.5 million: The amount the PAC would pay out if 500,000 signatures came from successful referrals

A lack of response, or ""ghosting,"" can be frustrating in the workplace, especially when it comes from your boss. First, assess whether their absence is out of character, and if so, give them leeway. Ensure your communication is concise and prioritized, establish regular check-ins and keep a detailed record of your communication attempts. If the behavior becomes a chronic issue, consider seeking advice on potential solutions from a mentor or senior leader.

B. He scored zero points for the first time in his career

DeFi Is Catnip For Hackers - It's Time The Industry Strikes Back,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nimrodlehavi/2024/10/08/defi-is-catnip-for-hackersits-time-the-industry-strikes-back/,2024-10-08T11:57:14Z,"Cybersecurity is frequently referred to as a game of cat and mouse, encapsulating the need for companies to keep on top of all the latest scams and hacking techniques in a bid to outwit ever-savvier attackers. However, in DeFi, it's fair to say that the cats have a significant advantage, with the ability to redeploy the same attack tactics repeatedly, as the industry fails to address some of the most fundamental challenges that have persisted for years.

A case in point - one of the biggest DeFi hacks of recent months was carried out using the same technique as the infamous 2016 DAO attack on Ethereum. In early September, hackers took $27 million from yield farming protocol Penpie by exploiting a reentrancy vulnerability, which enables the attacker to call a function multiple times before the blockchain state updates. In the case of the Penpie incident, this allowed them to falsely inflate reward balances with fake tokens, which they later claimed.

Reentrancy attacks underscore a key issue with Solidity as a programming language - the ease with which it can allow for unintended outcomes. Li.Fi, a cross-chain DeFi protocol, suffered an attack in July this year where a hacker was able to exploit smart contract calls that could execute arbitrary functions, resulting in losses of $8 million. Wrapped Bitcoin protocol Bedrock suffered a similar incident in late September.

Flash loans, which leverage the composability of dApps to execute a loan and repayment in a single Ethereum transaction, have also proven highly exploitable. Following the first spate of such attacks in 2020, the code underlying flash loan protocols has become target practice for hackers. Even following the massive exploit of Euler Finance in 2023, which resulted in losses of $197 million, Hedgey Finance and Dough Finance were hit over recent months, resulting in combined losses of over $45 million.

All this before we even get to those attacks that can be traced back to more old-school means. Truflation was hit for $5 million in late September, with the CEO confirming that the company had suffered a malware attack, which had enabled unauthorized access to the project's treasury wallets.

While DeFi hacks tend to be on a smaller scale than those on centralized exchanges, recent findings from Peckshield and ImmuneFi confirm that the number of incidents involving decentralized protocols is far higher, underscoring how easy hackers are finding it to launch a successful attack.

One argument is that blockchain has a different set of challenges to Web2 security, meaning it needs its own set of tools and protocols to maintain security. It's a fair argument, but at this point in the maturity cycle, a lack of available means is no longer an argument. It's time to take a leaf out of the Web2 security handbook and put in place a stack of security measures that's up to the job.

A few ideas to get started? Firstly, robust security audits need to become an industry standard. Reentrancy attacks and many basic smart contract exploits could be avoided with this fundamental step. While many projects may state they've been audited, the quality and extent of audits can vary significantly between firms.

Taking it a step further, on-chain security protocols can also monitor on-chain activity for suspicious transactions and potential zero-day exploits and prevent them before they happen.

Leveraging developments in encryption introduces a further layer of security. One example is a fully homomorphic encryption on-chain, enabling data to be kept completely confidential and secure. This development introduces the highest level of security to data that would previously have been publicly available and used by hackers to source lucrative targets.

The cat-and-mouse analogy works so well because it frames the ongoing power struggle between hackers and cybersecurity experts as one that will never necessarily be won by either side. However, the sheer number of DeFi attacks indicates that the odds are skewed heavily in favor of the hackers. Given the pace of development in this field, project founders should take any opportunity to level up the fight and tip the odds in favor of user funds and a more secure future for the industry itself."
President Biden promotes press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre to new top role,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/president-biden-promotes-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-new-top-role,2024-10-08T11:53:11Z,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy grills the press secretary about the Biden-Harris administrations response to Hurricane Helene and what it says about its values.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre received a promotion to senior adviser to the president Monday.

""Karine has been a trusted advisor to the President and all of us here at the White House since day one. Her counsel will be critical to get as much done as possible for the American people in the coming months,"" White House chief of staff Jeff Zients told ABC News.

ABC News reported Jean-Pierre would begin the role ""effective immediately"" while still maintaining her job as press secretary. This would be the first time in decades a press secretary has also served as a senior adviser.

A White House official also told ABC News how ""her promotion shows the faith that Biden has in her, as well as his commitment to having diverse and inter-generational voices guiding him in his decisions.""

KARINE JEAN-PIERRE'S MOST MEMORABLE CLASHES WITH REPORTERS THROUGHOUT 2023

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House.

Earlier this year, reports suggested there were inside efforts to remove Jean-Pierre as press secretary.

The New York Post reported in April that Biden insiders, including Zients and longtime senior adviser Anita Dunn, were recruiting prominent Democrats to convince Jean-Pierre to step down after what they considered to be a poor job.

Sources told the Post that the press secretary relied too much on her notes to be able to provide the quick-thinking pushback needed in the role, with one arguing that she ""doesn't have an understanding of the issues"" despite Jean-Pierre thinking that she's ""doing an amazing job.""

Deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates denied those allegations at the time.

""Not only are these claims wildly false, but the reality is the polar opposite. Karine was never approached by anyone with such a message. She spends four hours preparing every day. And neither Jeff nor Anita did any such thing; both have been unflinchingly supportive of her,"" Bates told the Post.

Regarding Jean-Pierre's reliance on notes, he added, ""Every press secretary uses the binder. Why is she being singled out?""

Taylor Swift appeared at her third Kansas City Chiefs game of the season, and for the first time, was spotted in the same suite as Brittany Mahomes at Arrowhead Stadium.

For the first two games of the season, Swift and Mahomes sat separately as it seemed there may have been a growing rift between the two women because of the latter's apparent support for former President Donald Trump during the 2024 election cycle, while the former openly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.

The two showed face to the world at the U.S. Open when they went on a double date with their significant others - Swift with Travis Kelce and Mahomes with her husband Patrick. But still, they had not sat next to each other like they did for most of the 2023 season when the pop star first started to come to games.

That changed Monday night as the Chiefs went on to defeat the New Orleans Saints, 26-13. The ESPN broadcast showed the two women in the same suite cheering on the team.

Swift showed up to the stadium wearing a plaid dress while Mahomes had on a red get-up in which she posted about on her Instagram page.

On the field, Mahomes and Kelce appeared to be clicking again. While the star tight end did not have a touchdown catch in the game -and has yet to find the end zone at all this season - he had a season-high nine catches for 70 yards.

Kansas City remained undefeated to start the season and have a bye week in Week 6."

Former President Trump announced a campaign rally in Aurora, Colorado, for Oct. 11 on Tuesday, vowing to highlight the ""flood"" of migrants in the city.

The rally comes after weeks of Trump blasting the migrant situation in Colorado, saying some 43,000 illegal immigrants have made their way into nearby Denver and Aurora. His campaign also highlighted the Tren De Aragua gang's takeover of multiple apartment buildings.

""Aurora, Colorado has become a 'war zone' due to the influx of violent Venezuelan prison gang members from Tren de Aragua. With approximately 43,000 migrants flooding the neighboring city of Denver since December 2022, many of these migrants have made their way to Aurora, bringing chaos and fear with them,"" the campaign said in a statement.

""Local families have been forced to flee their homes as Tren de Aragua members terrorize apartment complexes with guns, theft, and rampant drug activity. Kamala Harris' open-border policies are turning once-safe communities into nightmares for law-abiding citizens,"" the statement continued.

AURORA POLICE REACT TO ALLEGED VENEZUELAN GANG PRESENCE AT APARTMENTS: 'HAVE NOT TAKEN OVER'

""Kamala's border bloodbath has made every state a border state, leaving Colorado families at the mercy of criminals. The only solution to stop the border crisis is to elect President Trump, who will secure the border, deport dangerous criminals, and Make America Safe Again,"" the campaign added.

Bitcoin Is Here To Stay As Institutional Support Grows,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/08/bitcoin-is-here-to-stay-as-institutional-support-grows/,2024-10-08T11:47:27Z,"In the older, less polite trading floors of Wall Street there was an adage that may be paraphrased as money talks, male bovine excrement walks. When the buyside titans of the investment industry like Larry Fink from Blackrock get involved in something, then the money has spoken. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are not going anywhere.

On January 10th, there was a massive change in the institutional attitudes and legal categorization of Bitcoin when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs). The movement of Bitcoin into a traditional investment vehicle facilitates a potentially vast increase in the universe of bitcoin investors. Through the use of an ETF, an investor does not need to be concerned about how to actually purchase and store bitcoin, and instead can receive exposure to the bitcoin price movement through an instrument that trades in a standard equity brokerage account.

The bitcoin ETFs were quickly sought out by institutional and retail investors alike. There are now 36 different ETFs traded on the U.S. markets, and total assets are now over $61 billion. Only gold ETFs have a larger total asset size than bitcoin ETFs.

The stature of bitcoin ETFs was further enhanced on September 20, when the SEC approved the listing and trading of options for asset manager BlackRock's spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund on the Nasdaq. BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF has become one of the fastest-growing ETFs of all time, and now has almost $23 billion in assets.

The BlackRock chief executive, Larry Fink, was previously a bitcoin critic, and in July 2024 he said he had been ""wrong"" about bitcoin and now believes bitcoin is ""digital gold"" and a ""legitimate"" financial instrument.

Another supporter of bitcoin is Howard Lutnick, Chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald. In July he announced plans for his firm to launch a bitcoin financing business to provide leverage to investors who hold Bitcoin. He said, ""We are excited to help unlock Bitcoin's full potential and continue bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets.""

When the leadership of firms of the stature of Blackrock and Cantor Fitzgerald get behind something, it is not going anywhere. The large financial institutions are driven by customer demand, which in turn generates revenues. These firms are likely responding to their customers and are reaping the financial benefits from being early institutional bitcoin supporters.

The SEC approval of the ETFs also clarified the agency's position regarding the proper characterization of bitcoin as a commodity. This clarity was welcomed by bitcoin proponents and will likely lead to further institutional support.

Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), believed to be the world's largest custodian bank, is approved to provide custody services for bitcoin ETFs and is expected to enter the market shortly. The bank is expected to also be servicing the second approved cryptocurrency ETF, ether. Perhaps the bank will even provide services for additional cryptocurrencies as the SEC chair Gary Gensler, in an interview with Bloomberg, suggested that the BNY crypto custody model could extend to numerous digital assets.

Cautious and carefully other banks should be expected to support bitcoin as investor interest continues to grow. My own company, LevelField Financial, is seeking to acquire a chartered bank to, among other goals, serve customers who are interested in bitcoin and the digital asset class. Well managed financial institutions can safely and soundly support bitcoin while working within the framework of the U.S. banking system.

Whether bitcoin is going to lead to a transformation of the global banking and payment industries is something still very uncertain. What is clear, however, is that bitcoin is part of a new digital asset class that is very much in demand by institutional and retail investors. Traditional banking and financial service companies have the opportunity to support bitcoin now, while adoption is still in the early stages, and to participate in wherever the path of adoption leads. The growth of bitcoin will result in changes, perhaps more of an evolution than a revolution, but it is not going away."
3 Things To Know About A Company's Parental Leave Before Taking A Job,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelletravis/2024/10/08/3-things-to-know-about-a-companys-parental-leave-before-taking-a-job/,2024-10-08T11:47:17Z,"Parental leave policies are not all the same, even among the largest U.S. companies. Getting the answer to three key questions will enable job candidates to better assess the real value of a company's paid leave plan before accepting a job offer. How many weeks of paid leave are provided for primary parents? How many weeks of paid leave are provided for secondary parents? What are the eligibility and tenure requirements to access and use paid leave?

These questions are critical because new research reveals that large companies vary widely on core features of their parental leave plans. So just asking whether a company offers parental leave is not enough to make an informed career decision.

Job candidates might assume that all large companies have responded similarly to the increasing demand for paid parental leave. More than eight out of ten American millennials said in an Ernst & Young survey that they would be more likely to join a company if it offered paid parental leave. This competitive pressure presumably would push large companies to converge upon a standard package for paid parental leave.

It turns out, that's not case.

A comprehensive study by Hillary Cookler, PhD candidate and researcher at UCLA Anderson School of Management, dispels the notion that large companies are all the same when it comes to paid parental leave.

""People assume there's a standard practice on paid parental leave,"" said Cookler. ""But in fact, there is no standard."" The lack of a standard means that the real value of parental leave plans varies significantly across companies, even within the same industry.

Cookler evaluated the paid parental leave policies of the 500 largest U.S. public companies. The list of companies was generated from S&P Capital IQ based on LTM revenue as of August 20, 2024. Cookler created an online database that rates all 500 companies on their paid parental leave policies. The top performing companies are those that score well on both the transparency and quality of their paid leave.

One of the most surprising findings was the lack of policy standardization. The wide variation existed even on core policy features, not just peripheral details. ""The massive variation in these firms' paid parental leave policies was stunning,"" said Cookler in a phone conversation.

Women are more likely to take leave and typically take longer leave than men. So Cookler focused on the length of paid time off for full-time, U.S.-based primary parents following the non-C-section birth of a child. Data on that metric was available for 64% of the 500 largest U.S. public companies.

What Cookler found was the opposite of a ""standard."" The length of paid leave for primary parents ranged from zero to 52 weeks. In other words, some large companies offer not a single day of paid primary parent leave, while other companies offer a full year.

The study also debunked the possibility that most companies are similar, with just a few extreme outliers. ""Leave policies aren't tightly clustered around a single value,"" Cookler explained via email.

Although the average paid leave for primary parents among the large companies in Cookler's database was just over 11 weeks, there was a standard deviation of about 6.5 weeks. Even when Cookler eliminated outliers and considered just the middle 50% of the distribution (which researchers call ""the interquartile range"" or ""IQR""), there was still a 10-week range in the length of paid primary parent leave.

Cookler's research highlighted not only the lack of an overall standard paid parental leave policy among the largest U.S. companies. The research also revealed the lack of a standard parental leave policy within most industries.

The 500 largest U.S. public companies include 19 different industries, based on the North American Industry Classification System. For each industry, Cookler graphed the average and range of the number of weeks of paid primary parent leave.

As Figure 1 shows, paid leave policies varied widely within at least 17 of the 19 industries.

Because Cookler could only confirm the length of paid primary parent leave for 64% of the largest companies, the graph likely paints an overly rosy picture of industry-specific leave policies. Cookler found a strong correlation between transparency and quality of paid leave. This finding suggests that the companies that are missing due to lack of data are likely to be on the low end of the policy ranges.

Parental leave policies at large U.S. companies also vary widely on dimensions other than the length of paid leave for primary parents. Those variations can significantly impact the value of a parental leave policy.

For example, there is no standard length of paid leave for secondary parents, who often include male partners of birth parents. A 2022 study by JUST Capital found wide variation on paid leave policies for secondary parents among Russell 1000 companies, with 75% failing to offer leave parity to primary and secondary parents. Among the 25% of companies that did offer leave parity, only 9% provided paid leave at a length of 12 or more weeks.

Large companies' paid parental leave policies also vary on eligibility requirements. Some companies offer paid leave to salaried but not hourly workers. Some companies offer paid leave to full-time but not part-time employees.

Polices also vary on when paid parental leave can be used. Some companies make paid leave immediately available to new hires, while others require a lengthy period of service with the company before paid leave is available. Some companies allow leave to be taken intermittently or on a part-time basis, while others require leave to be taken all at once.

""Just like the range of strollers available on the market, not all parental leave is the same,"" said manager Claire Hastwell in a 2023 blog post for Great Place To Work.

The challenge of navigating the variations among large companies' paid parental leave policies is exacerbated by an overall lack of public transparency. Among the 500 largest U.S. companies in Cookler's database, only 51% confirmed on their website whether they did or did not offer paid parental leave.

Far less than half of the company websites included sufficient details to enable employees to make informed job decisions, or to enable companies to ensure that their policies remain competitive. Only 34% of the company websites included details about the length of parental leave offered. Just 10% of the company websites provided details about eligibility and tenure requirements for paid parental leave.

The 2022 study by JUST Capital found similarly low levels of parental leave transparency among the larger group of Russell 1000 companies.

Large companies can no longer ignore the connection between adequate paid parental leave and women's workplace advancement.

Women in Gen Z are the first cohort to rank paid leave as their top priority among employee benefits -- even higher priority than health insurance -- according to 2024 data from MetLife. Among all working adults, 62% identified access to paid family leave as an ongoing challenge for women in the American workforce, according to a 2022 JUST Capital survey.

Not only do Americans care about paid parental leave, they also share a belief about the length of leave that is required. In the JUST Capital survey, nearly two-thirds of workers said they believed that it is necessary for companies to provide at least 12 weeks of paid parental leave to all workers. Job candidates should not assume, however, that large U.S. companies have adopted this expectation as a standard practice."
Pork Tacos Taken To New Levels At Carnitas Ramirez And Taqueria Ramirez In NYC,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/garystern/2024/10/08/pork-tacos-taken-to-new-levels-at-carnitas-ramirez-and-taqueria-ramirez-in-nyc/,2024-10-08T11:47:04Z,"When the married couple Tania Apolinar and Giovanni Cervantes opened Taqueria Ramirez in Greenpoint, Brooklyn in 2021 and then followed it with Carnitas Ramirez in the East Village in 2024, their goal was to create a pork taco that you could order in Mexico City. Their pork tacos are made the Mexican way by braising, simmering and frying the pork in its own fat.

According to Priya Krishna's New York Times September 17, 20024 restaurant review of Carnitas Ramirez, the couple uses a variety of parts of pork in their tacos including the oreja or ear, the cachet or cheek, the tropa or snout, and all come ""dressed with diced onion and cilantro and wrapped in supple, lard-stained tortillas that are cooked to order."" Krisha adds that the surtida taco, which ""includes a little bit of everything is crunchy, creamy, tender and slick.""

The couple operated a photo production studio in Greenpoint when Giovanni started cooking tacos in their backyard in Williamsburg and invited friends to taste them. That led to cooking his tacos on the grills at McCarren Park for friends on Friday's in Williamsburg, notoriety on Instagram, and finally opening their own storefront in Greenpoint.

Krishna in her review noted that ""The restaurant quickly became the most talked-about New York taqueria since Los Tacos No.1.""

Knowing that opening a restaurant, without a background in that area, could be overwhelming they brought in the chef Yvon de Tassigny and Kari Boden, who became the manager. The four of them capitalized the restaurant tapping their own savings, without bringing in outside investors. It was modest in size, seating 12 people inside, 4 or 5 at outside the window, with a few benches directly outside.

Preparing Pork Tacos the Mexican Way

Their goal was to make their carnitas tacos the original Mexican way. Cervantes says that ""Carnitas is synonymous of a certain way to cook pork involving, cooking it nose to tail, in its own fat.""

Apolinar pointed out that ""The American approach of tacos lacks the richness of corn, spiciness, complexity of salsa and variety of fillings."" She describes that salsa in the tacos as a key ingredient, ""adding the acidity and spiciness that cuts the fat from the pork and adds balance to the palate.""

Two pork taquerias are showcasing a new taste for most New Yorkers, reminiscent of dining in Mexico City.

Won't Find Shrimp or Chicken Tacos on the Menu

But don't expect to order shrimp or chicken tacos because you won't find them at either of their taqueria. ""We are a carnitas taqueria,"" Apolinar says bluntly. ""So if you go to Mexico and eat at a carnitas place be ready for pork and only pork,' she adds.

Vegetarians who enter one of their restaurants can order the ""nopales de mercado"" or cactus taco, and avoid the pork, she suggests.

They have kept their prices down to $5 a taco, and about $4 for a beverage so 2 tacos cost $14, and 3 tacos about $19, or still under $20 for lunch or dinner, though their prices are a trifle higher than Los Tacos No.1.

Apolinar says ""tacos are and should be always accessible to everyone. It's the casual food of the working class.""

The East Village location on East Third Street off of Avenue B accommodates 35 people and that includes stools on the street, inside dining, and a back room.

Unlike most eateries in New York City, it doesn't offered third-party delivery. Why not? Apolinar cited that ""time is the enemy of the taco. Tacos are meant to be eaten fresh and right after the taquero is handling them to you."" Once the fat in the taco gets cold, it won't taste good, she adds.

It now offers paper plates for guests who want to take their tacos to go. At Carnitas Ramirez, it also sells kilos to go, which includes 3 cuts of meat wrapped, with the tortillas separate, with toppings.

Each of the taquerias is named Ramirez because that is one of Cervantes' surnames, and by naming it that way, it conveys that it's a family business.

With two restaurants going full speed ahead, Apolinar says they're ""exploring another classic Mexican taqueria that we would love to bring to New York."" It would likely be in Brooklyn, and it would specialize in Barbacoa or lamb. The message is: they start with pork and move on to lamb."
How To Plan A Memorable Transatlantic Cruise,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidnikel/2024/10/08/how-to-plan-a-memorable-transatlantic-cruise/,2024-10-08T11:47:02Z,"Why spend seven hours flying across the Atlantic when you can use an entire week instead? That's the mentality of passengers on Cunard's Queen Mary 2, the world's only remaining true ocean liner.

But the storied Cunard Line is not the only way of experiencing an Atlantic crossing. Here are all your options for experiencing this historic travel route for yourself, starting with the one that features on many cruise travelers' bucket lists.

Cunard's Queen Mary 2 offers the classic transatlantic experience, sailing regularly between Southampton and New York. With her deep hull and sleek design, she was built to handle the sometimes choppy waters of the Atlantic, ensuring a smoother ride than most traditional cruise ships.

Queen Mary 2 has modern amenities, but its heart and soul remains rooted in a luxurious past. The week-long journey is a step back in time to the golden age of ocean travel, before the advent of the jet liner changed everything.

Passengers can expect afternoon teas, formal dress codes for dinner, and grand ballroom dancing. If you want to embrace the romance and tradition of crossing the Atlantic by sea, there are few better options.

Looking to save money? Book an inside cabin. This isn't a Norwegian fjords or Alaska itinerary with endless sights to see from your own private space.

Although the sail-in to New York on the westbound leg crossing is one of the iconic ocean travel experiences, it alone isn't worth splashing out thousands of extra Dollars when you can enjoy it from the spacious outside decks.

Something else to bear in mind is that westbound itineraries give you an extra hour on most days because of the almost daily time zone changes.

If Cunard's regular crossings aren't your style, there's another way to experience a transatlantic voyage -- by hopping on a repositioning cruise.

Many cruise lines relocate their ships between Europe and the Americas twice a year, in the spring and fall. Rather than sail them empty, each line tends to offer unique one-way itineraries at bargain prices.

These repositioning cruises often come with unique perks: fewer crowds, more sea days to relax, and often some unexpected ports of call, like the Azores or Bermuda.

Major lines like Royal Caribbean, Norwegian Cruise Line, and Celebrity Cruises all offer these seasonal voyages, which are perfect for those looking for a blend of adventure, relaxation, and a cost-effective way to cross the Atlantic.

A word of caution though: be sure to factor in the cost of a one-way flight when evaluating the overall value of the deal.

By their very nature, world cruises and grand voyages cross oceans, offering passengers the chance to explore multiple continents over the span of weeks or even months.

Of course, these types of cruises come with a hefty price tag and are usually priced out of the reach of most cruisers, instead appealing to wealthy retirees or individuals with flexible schedules and ample resources.

However, to ensure the ships are as full as possible, many cruise lines offer segments of world cruises or longer, one-off, taster voyages that give people the chance to experience the luxury and adventure of an extended cruise without the commitment and expense of a world cruise.

Holland America is one line known for its transatlantic crossings, both repositioning but also one-off themed itineraries. This 35-day Voyage of the Vikings is a roundtrip summer cruise from Boston that takes in Newfoundland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, and the British Isles. Because of its northerly routing, there's never more than two consecutive days at sea.

Another option is one-off itineraries from some cruise lines, often in shoulder seasons. For example, Fred Olsen Cruise Lines offers a 26-day trip to allow its predominantly British guests to enjoy Canada in the Fall, featuring five sea days in both directions.

In most cases, including the two examples above, shorter one-way trips are available with flights for the return.

So, what are you waiting for? Well, before rushing out to book a great deal, it's important to know that a transatlantic cruise has its quirks.

First and foremost, it's not a good idea to pick one for your first cruise as there's a heightened risk of motion sickness when sailing on the open ocean for days at a time. If you've never experienced the motion of the ocean, perhaps choosing a shorter cruise with more port days might be a better first move.

While for many people a cruise is all about the itinerary and ports of call, the choice of ship is much more important on ocean crossings. You'll be spending several consecutive days with nowhere else to go, so make sure the ship has the facilities you want.

If you plan on relaxing in the spa, or dining in a specific premium restaurant, book in advance to avoid disappointment.

Finally, be prepared for unpredictable weather. The Atlantic can be calm, but it's not unusual to encounter storms or rough seas, especially in spring and fall. Of course, that's when repositioning cruises are much more likely to take place."
The end of smallpox was ... the beginning for mpox,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/10/08/g-s1-26474/smallpox-mpox-virus-outbreak-vaccine-public-health,2024-10-08T11:45:32Z,"It all started with an unremarkable trip to grandma's house in 1970. But two days into the visit, something went terribly wrong.

The 9-month-old grandson fell ill. First, a fever. Then, a nasty rash. Alarmed doctors suspected smallpox but, instead, they soon discovered something even more bewildering: The first-known human case of monkeypox, now called mpox. The child was patient zero.

Today, more than 50 years after that case in a remote corner of the Democratic Republic of Congo, that same virus is sending public health experts scrambling. So far this year, there have been more than 30,000 suspected mpox cases in 15 African countries -- dwarfing previous yearly totals. The surge is prompting some to revisit mpox's history.

""Monkeypox was detected in 1970 and now it is blowing out of proportion in 2024, what happened along the way?"" asked Ugandan health minister Jane Ruth Aceng at a regional World Health Organization meeting in Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo in August.

Looking back, researchers now see that the origins of mpox are inextricably intertwined with the fight against smallpox.

""We vaccinated for smallpox and eradicated it. But look, something came out of that: monkeypox,"" said Aceng.

Smallpox and mpox are so closely related that immunity to one helps fight off the other. When smallpox vaccinations were terminated, the world's immunity to mpox evaporated, and the medical training needed to combat a pox virus started to dissipate too.

This is a story about unintended consequences, and how triumphing over smallpox accidentally created an opening for mpox. Experts say examining the history of mpox carries valuable lessons about how the virus has changed, how our medical toolbox has changed -- and what people might do to regain the upper hand over the virus.

Doctors don't know how the grandson contracted mpox on that ill-fated trip to his grandma's house. And even though his grandma lived about a week's journey from the DRC's capital, the boy's doctors made sure crusts from the little boy's sores were sent to Moscow for analysis. That's where the mpox diagnosis was made; the virus has been known since 1958 but had previously only been thought to infect monkeys.

The grandson's rash attracted global attention because, at that moment in time humanity was closing in on a major accomplishment: The eradication of smallpox, a virus that had killed hundreds of millions in the 20th century alone.

""It's one of humanity's greatest triumphs,"" says Dr. William Moss, an epidemiologist and international health expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

In order to prove that smallpox was really, truly gone, scientists needed to investigate every rash that looked like smallpox.

Moss says it was only because of this ""very intensive surveillance"" for smallpox that the boy's case of mpox was identified. The same was true for the other cases of mpox that soon started to trickle in. By 1978, there were a total of 36 documented monkeypox cases in humans.

At the time, the exact source of the virus stumped scientists: Was it from contact with monkeys? Or perhaps another forest animal? What scientists did know was that mpox is biologically related to smallpox; they're in the same family of viruses.

Case investigators studying the suspicious rashes quickly realized that those who got mpox had not been vaccinated against smallpox. For example, the 9-month-old was the only one in his family not vaccinated against smallpox and the only one to get monkeypox. He hadn't been born yet when a mobile smallpox vaccination team rolled through town a year earlier.

Public health experts soon realized that in a world without smallpox infections and vaccinations, nobody would have immunity against mpox. Before stopping smallpox vaccinations, they weighed this risk.

""The overall recommendation was that [smallpox] vaccination was not needed [to protect against mpox],"" says Anne Rimoin, a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and a leading mpox researcher.

For one thing, they didn't see mpox as a big threat. ""The potential for human-to-human transmission was low,"" says Rimoin. Researchers surmised that mpox came from contact with forest animals ""and the overall outlook - in those days - was that with urbanization the chances of exposure to wild animals would be lower,"" she says.

In addition, the smallpox vaccine was far from ideal. ""People could die from the smallpox vaccine,"" says Moss, noting that it contained a live virus and wasn't suitable for those with weakened immune systems.

In a case report from 1978, the WHO concluded: ""Evidence is that this [mpox] rare and sporadic disease is not highly transmissible and does not appear to be a public health problem.""

And so, smallpox vaccinations were stopped. In the DRC, they ended in the early 1980s. And a generation of children vulnerable to mpox came into the world.

Fast forward to 2022, and then again to 2024, and the WHO declared mpox a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" its highest level of alarm.

""No good deed goes unpunished, right?"" says Rimoin.

She published a study in PNAS in 2010 documenting how mpox cases have ""dramatically increased"" as immunity from smallpox has waned. And many experts believe the lack of smallpox immunity is one reason that the majority of cases -- and deaths -- in the current outbreak are in children who were too young to have smallpox immunity.

Yet, Rimoin thinks the edict to stop smallpox vaccinations was ""absolutely"" the right choice. ""You can put those resources towards other vaccines, other health problems. Cross [smallpox] off your list, move on to something else,"" she says.

Others agree. ""It was definitely the right decision,"" says Dr. Mitch Wolfe, former chief medical officer of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But, Rimoin acknowledges, the world is now paying the consequences for that decision.

In addition to the global loss of immunity, there are three big ways the mpox landscape has shifted since the time mpox was discovered -- and largely dismissed.

First, the virus itself has changed.

Just about every piece of the WHO's 1978 assessment that mpox is a ""rare and sporadic disease [that] is not highly transmissible"" is no longer true.

Traditionally, a person got mpox after handling infected wild animals, often little rodents. Today, it spreads readily from one person to the next, often through close contact -- like, say, sharing linens within a family -- or through sexual contact. This means the virus can spread much further and faster than before.

The idea that urbanization would reduce wildlife interactions and therefore squash this virus is now proven preposterous. To the contrary, the DRC's Ministry of Health has reported more than 500 cases in the capital of Kinshasa. ""That is something that worries us very much,"" says Dr. Ngashi Ngongo, chief of staff at the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pointing out that Kinshasa is a big and overcrowded city. ""That makes it very prone for rapid expansion.""

The second big change? Key medical skills have been lost.

When the smallpox eradication campaign was in full swing, not only were vaccines reaching the most remote corners of the world but staff all over the globe were trained to give the vaccines, detect the rash and collect samples for analysis. Now, those skills have waned.

Barely an mpox discussion goes by without experts lamenting the lack of high-quality data. Remember the 9-month-old's scabs that were sent from deep in the DRC rainforest to Moscow for testing? That type of maneuver is now proving very challenging.

""Most of the people that collected these specimens have not been trained to understand what is a quality specimen,"" says Dr. Jean Kaseya, the director general of Africa CDC. He says specimen collection and correct storage during transportation are proving to be major challenges.

Similarly, vaccination skills have been lost. Many of the mpox vaccines were first developed for smallpox. And most smallpox vaccinations were done with a special needle that scrapes the skin, leaving that famous scar on the upper arm. That's the same technique used for the Japanese mpox vaccine, which is the only vaccine currently approved for kids in the DRC. One of the hurdles to rolling out that vaccine in the DRC is that it will require a major training effort.

""That's quite a skilled technique, and [teaching that skill] will take time. [It] hasn't been used in vaccination programs for decades now,"" says Dr. Mike Ryan, who runs WHO's Health Emergencies Program.

And, a final way things have changed: The world's appetite for cooperation has shrunk.

The international collaboration that was present during the smallpox eradication campaign is ""almost unimaginable right now,"" says Moss of Johns Hopkins. It took coordination across war zones and political differences.

While the current mpox outbreak in Africa has garnered major donations from the U.S. to Europe to Japan, many argue that a lack of collaboration is, at least partly, to blame for setting the current outbreak in motion.

""We are talking with our partners, with our colleagues from Western countries, and we are telling them, they are also responsible for the situation that's happening in Africa,"" says Africa CDC's Kaseya.

He says during the 2022 mpox outbreak, the world was only concerned with the strain of mpox circulating in Europe and the U.S. When it came to the strain in Central Africa, ""they didn't conduct studies. They didn't conduct research...Eighty percent of the unknowns [about the current outbreak] are because our colleagues and partners didn't want to see the reality that was going on,"" he says.

""We are not blaming them, but we are telling them the truth,"" Kaseya says.

A lot has changed since the fateful decision to stop vaccinating for smallpox -- and by extension mpox. Rick Bright believes it is a good time to reconsider that decision.

Bright, who used to lead the U.S. Center for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, says he'd like to see a discussion about whether to ""begin, once again, vaccinating the population, the global population, with the vaccine to make sure that we are all protected from mpox and smallpox and other derivatives that we might see.""

Bright points out that, in the intervening decades, the smallpox and mpox vaccines have become a lot safer. And the mpox virus has certainly proven its ability to evolve and spread widely.

However, he's quick to admit, any mass vaccination effort would not happen immediately. Right now, there aren't enough mpox vaccine doses to address the current mpox outbreak, let alone add it to the routine vaccination list.

Moss, of Johns Hopkins, isn't so sure mass vaccination is the way to go since mpox has not spread widely in the general population. ""I still see it as more targeted, whether it's a high risk population or spatially,"" he says. That's the approach the DRC has taken, focusing on hotspots as well as populations that are most at risk, like children, health care workers and sex workers.

What they agree on is that there needs to significantly more vaccine production and availability -- and a broader discussion about what protection from pox viruses is needed."
Three UK Hotels For Slow Travellers,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelinavillaclarke/2024/10/08/three-uk-hotels-for-slow-travellers/,2024-10-08T11:37:53Z,"These new or revamped hotels are perfect for exploring more 'under-the-radar' destinations in the UK. They offer the very essence of the joy of slow travel.

Check out these three hotels that put some of the UK's 'second cities' and pretty, rural villages 'on the map'. Perfect for exploring lesser-known spots, they offer laid-back luxury and give an insider's view of their destinations.

Having first opened in 1937, The Queens Hotel in Leeds is one of the city's most iconic buildings. The heritage hotel is not exactly new, but a recent £16m refurbishment has brought its heyday back to life, with all 232 bedrooms revamped with a minimalist, urban aesthetic while still giving plenty of nods to its 30s heritage and design aesthetic.

Previously a landmark railway hotel -- for the former London, Midland and Scottish Railway -- the property is found next to Leeds Rail Station, meaning guests are within walking distance of all the city's attractions. The revamp has captured the glamour of the building's Art Deco roots, with many original features still intact, coupled with a modern design sensibility (think: leather headboards, graphic-print rugs and velvet and linen seating).

The ground floor has been transformed into a dynamic social hub, with plenty of convivial communal areas, while the Grand Pacific Restaurant has also been revamped, with the latter leaning into a Jazz Age vibe with banquette seating, parquet flooring and opulent chandeliers. This homage to the golden age of high society also gives a nod to far-flung travel experiences, with Asian-inspired cocktails in the bar and a menu that features British classics alongside Chinese and Japanese dishes.

Due to open next month is No. 124 by GuestHouse, Brighton -- the fourth property from GuestHouse Hotels known for its laid-back luxury vibe found within characterful places to stay. The coastal bolthole is the group's biggest project to date, and has been designed to be the new flagship property of the brand.

Inspired by the cultural hub that is Brighton, No. 124 will offer three suites and 32 bedrooms with sweeping sea views looking out across the English Channel. Carved out of a Regency-style building, the façade straddles three Victorian and Georgian townhouses, which have been restored to embrace the city's colourful personality and vibrant history. Playful quirks in each room (and across all GuestHouse properties) include in-room record players and 'help-yourself' pantries.

No. 124 also offers thoughtful perks, such as complimentary luggage collection from the station if travelling by train. The hotel will also feature a Bar, Terrace, Lounge, Games Room and Courtyard, to be followed by a FieldTrip Spa and resident restaurant Pearly Cow opening in the coming months.

One to put on the calendar for spring next year, is The Signet Collection's fourth hotel, The Alfriston, set to open its doors by March 2025. Located in the picturesque village of Alfriston, within the South Downs, the latest addition to the collection of award-winning hotels, which includes The Mitre The Mitre Hampton Court and The Retreat at Elcot Park near Newbury, promises a unique blend of luxury, comfort, and breath-taking scenery; all in keeping, says the brand, with its ethos of breathing a new chapter to a time-honoured places.

Set in some of the UK's most picturesque countryside, The Alfriston will offer 38 bedrooms and suites, each individually styled, with warm, playful colours, upcycled antiques and glamorous bathrooms. For dining, the 1554 Brasserie (which takes its name from the date of the building) will offer dishes that use ingredients sourced from local, independent suppliers and produce grown in the hotel's own herb and vegetable plots. The hotel's bar will offer casual dining, while in the light-filled Orangery guests can enjoy breakfast and afternoon tea.

In a second phase of opening, the hotel will launch its signature Signet Spa, with GAIA treatments, and an outdoor swimming pool. Situated in the scenic village of Alfriston, the hotel is surrounded by a bustling community famed for throwing fetes and fayres on the 'Tye' (the village green), the sweeping South Downs National Park and chocolate-box-pretty pubs. Hidden gems along The Sussex Heritage Coast are just moments away, too."
How To Successfully Secure A Grant For Your Small Business,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissahouston/2024/10/08/how-to-successfully-secure-a-grant-for-your-small-business/,2024-10-08T11:37:46Z,"Many in business are struggling with cash flow these days and qualifying and receiving a grant is a great cash infusion you may need. Whether you are just starting your business or growing it, receiving a grant may just be the boost you need to help your business.

Unlike loans, grants don't need to be paid back, making them a highly attractive resource to small business owners. But securing a grant is a competitive process, so knowing how to apply can put you ahead of the competition.

Grants are funds provided by government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and private companies to support specific business activities. The main difference between a loan and a grant is that with grants you do not have to be repay it, where loans must be repaid. However, grants often come with specific requirements, such as focusing on a particular type of business, promoting sustainability, or serving underrepresented communities.

Not every business is eligible for every grant. Many grants are targeted toward certain industries, demographics, or stages of business. For example, there are grants for women entrepreneurs, minority-owned businesses, startups in tech, and those focused on environmental sustainability.

To determine if you qualify for a grant, carefully review the eligibility criteria. Some common factors include:

It's time-consuming to find grants that you qualify for. It requires meticulous research to sift through various grant opportunities and determine eligibility criteria. Each grant has specific requirements, such as funding focus, geographical restrictions, industry relevance, or organizational type.

You may spend significant time examining detailed application guidelines and filtering through numerous databases or websites to identify the opportunities best suited to your needs. This step is crucial, as applying to irrelevant grants not only wastes time but also decreases the likelihood of securing funding.

When you've found a grant that fits your business, you must now submit a stellar application that stands out from your competitors. Tailoring your application specifically to the grant's goals is key. If you want your application to stand out, follow these tips:

Follow Directions Carefully: Each grant application will have different requirements and submission processes. You must follow instructions or you risk automatic disqualification. Make sure you submit all required documents and answer every question completely.

Clearly Outline Your Business Goals: Most grant providers want to see how their funds will make a tangible impact. Be specific about how you will use the grant money and how it will contribute to the growth of your business. For example, explain how the funds will help you expand your product line, hire new employees, or market your business.

Showcase Your Unique Story: Whether you're a women-owned business, a startup in a niche market, or a mission-driven company, sharing your unique story and vision can help connect you with grant reviewers. Authenticity and passion are essential components of a successful grant application.

Provide Supporting Data: Include information such as revenue growth, customer testimonials, market research, or statistics that highlight the need for your product or service. The more data you can provide to prove your business's potential, the stronger your application will be.

A business plan is often a requirement when applying for grants. This document shows grantors that you are serious about your business and that you have a solid strategy in place. You'll need to create a business plan if you don't have one already.

This plan will not only be useful for grants but also for securing future funding and guiding your overall business strategy.

Grants can be highly competitive, and it's common to face rejection. Don't get discouraged. Keep refining your applications and continue searching for opportunities that match your business.

You can apply for multiple grants to increase your chances of success. Some grants may be small, but every bit helps, especially when you're just starting out.

The bottom line is that securing a grant for your small business can provide a much-needed financial boost without the burden of repayment. By researching available grants, preparing a strong application, and remaining persistent, you can increase your chances of getting the funds you need to grow your business. Stay focused, be strategic, and take advantage of these opportunities to make your entrepreneurial vision a reality."
Data Revisions Reveal: Consumers Have More Spending Power Than We Thought,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2024/10/08/data-revisions-reveal-consumers-have-more-spending-power-than-we-thought/,2024-10-08T11:37:42Z,"Consumers are in better financial shape than we had previously realized, according to revisions of critical information about U.S. incomes, spending and saving. Savings, in particular, are much higher than we had known.

Like virtually all of our economic data, early releases are best-estimates from incomplete information. The numbers are collected from surveys of consumers, businesses and governments. Over time, the statistical agencies get better data. I previously explained the process in relation to employment data. (The information on income, spending and savings comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis as part of the National Income and Products Accounts.)

The biggest change in our understanding regards savings, 78% higher than previous estimates. Savings is a relatively soft estimate, one we cannot take to the bank, so to speak. But whether the true number is a bit higher or lower than the latest estimate, it's still very good.

The data revision showed more income than earlier estimates, but only a little more spending. Savings is the difference between the estimate of disposable income and the estimate of consumer expenditures. That's an important point: savings is not measured directly. It's simply the residual between income and expenditures. The calculation starts with a very big number (income) and then subtracts another very big number (spending). The result is a small number (savings) which critically depends on the accuracy of those two big numbers. Some small errors in the big numbers can make a very large difference in the small number.

Here's why this matters a great deal for the current economic outlook. Most people got substantial stimulus checks during the pandemic, in 2020 and early 2021. And most of the money was saved. This is the typical pattern of surprise income, explained in a pathbreaking book by Milton Friedman back in 1957. He wrote that spending is driven by ""permanent income,"" what a person expects financial resources to be on a long-term basis. Suppose someone gets big winnings from a lottery ticket. There may be a small splurge after the happy event, but the consumer will spread most the expenditures out over a long period.

The chart above shows the month-by-month savings (income less expenditures). Income jumped up sharply with the stimulus checks, and most of it went into savings. Consumers would likely spend the money gradually in the following years. This was a commonplace belief among us economists and one that we got right.

To judge how the savings would impact future spending, many economists calculated ""excess savings."" We looked at the path of savings before the pandemic and projected it into the future as if nothing happened. Then we subtracted this trend savings from actual savings and called the result excess savings. We accumulated it month by month as savings exceeded the trend, then reduced the cumulative excess savings as consumers spent more than they otherwise would have, bringing savings below trend.

Before the recent data revision, excess savings was thought to be coming down briskly, meaning that it would run out some time in 2025. After that, consumers would be likely to tighten their belts, reducing their discretionary spending. Now, however, the recent consumption path looks like it could go on for four or five more years.

However, it bears repeating that savings is not measured with high accuracy. And different economists have calculated excess savings using different assumptions about the underlying trend. Finally, the pandemic and related economic changes may have altered the trend that consumers wish to be on. So this optimistic take on the outlook for consumer spending should be taken cautiously.

The best data we have at this point clearly points to solid consumer spending in the aggregate. News reports will continue to feature a family with financial difficulties, as total income can grow even though some people struggle with falling income. But the overall economy is driven by the aggregates, and they look good."
AI Will Not Destroy The World -- AI Illiteracy And Misuse Could,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/luisromero/2024/10/08/ai-will-not-destroy-the-world-ai-illiteracy-and-misuse-could/,2024-10-08T11:37:25Z,"""The real problem is not whether machines think but whether men do."" This quote by influential psychologist B.F. Skinner aptly captures two human tendencies that are becoming particularly dangerous in the age of generative AI. First, the tendency to ascribe intelligence and free will to machines, and second, the assumption that computer output is always more accurate than human output. These tendencies could have significant consequences as generative AI becomes more pervasive and sophisticated.

Powered by advanced deep learning architectures (e.g. transformers, variational autoencoders (VEAs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs)), generative AI can produce outputs that are, at face value and without scrutiny, indistinguishable from human-generated content. However, upon second and third observation, certain patterns start to emerge that reveal their artificial origin. The problem is that, according to several studies, 45% to 50% of people lack the ability to detect such patterns, which may lead them to make important decisions based on entirely false premises. If we combine this with the fact that generative AI is getting better by the day, and large portions of the world population unconsciously seeking reaffirming 'evidence' of personal beliefs online, we can see how AI illiteracy mixed with intentional misuse can spell disaster.

AI Lacks Free Will and Conscious Thought: Only Humans Can Do the Right Thing, or Not

When philosophizing about AI, it helps to consider the following distinctions. There is a difference between free will and autonomy; and there is also a difference between thinking and computing. Human beings have free will and the ability to think. Computers, including AI systems, have neither.

Having free will means that humans can stop executing a task midway, either on a whim or as a result of an intellectual realization, an existential epiphany, or a deep intuition. Conversely, computers cannot stop executing a task midway for any of these reasons because they lack the human traits that allow free will to emerge. Similarly, humans can realize when their train of thought is heading in the wrong direction and reassess a thought midway -- this is due to our ability to think about our thoughts as they happen, often called meta-consciousness. On the contrary, a computer cannot realize that the algorithm being executed is wrong during the process because it cannot think, only compute.

Since the general population does not make these distinctions, they become easy prey to the fear that computers, and AI in particular, can take over the world. What they need to understand is that those who build AI tools, and those who know how to use them properly, will take over the world if we do not make a concerted effort to raise the average level of AI literacy quickly. If the current trend continues, the gap between small AI-proficient groups and AI-illiterate masses will become so large that the world order could inevitably change. Nothing good can come from such an asymmetry in knowledge and skill in the generation and assessment of information.

In the words of the late Carl Sagan, ""We've arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.""

The Growing Concern: Generative AI's Potential for Manipulation

While Generative AI tools like GPT models (which generate text) and DALL·E (which creates images) represent tremendous advancements, they also introduce new challenges. One of the most pressing concerns is the misuse of generative AI to create misinformation. The illusion of human-like intelligence in these models can mislead people into believing that the content they generate is factual or human-made, when in reality it is synthesized based on patterns in training data and prompts devised to create false narratives.

Consider the exponential rise in deepfakes, AI-generated images, or realistic videos of public figures saying things they never said. These fakes, which look and sound credible, also have evident signatures of AI-generate content, some of which are glaringly evident. However, they get rapidly disseminated across the internet as factual content, manipulating perceptions, opinions, and even political decisions. This becomes a particular issue on social media platforms, where engagement algorithms boost sensational content -- whether true or false.

The statistics are concerning:

These findings highlight the inherent risk of AI-generated disinformation, especially as AI tools become cheaper and more efficient.

Real-World Examples of Generative AI Failures

Beyond the hype, the truth is that Generative AI, as applied to different fields, produces a vast amount of incorrect technical assessments, fake information, incoherent content, and, in short, unreliable ""hallucinations."" Domain experts must always be present for assessment and validation. Even when AI is mostly correct, we cannot delegate ultimate responsibility to a system that cannot ever be driven by the desire to do the right thing. Only entities subject to morality and ethics can be held responsible, and the only ones capable of such a thing are humans.

Here are three real-world examples where these systems have caused significant problems, thus emphasizing the need for ultimate human accountability:

1. Legal: In New York, a lawyer used ChatGPT to generate legal precedents for a case, only to find out that the AI had fabricated six non-existent cases. This led to a court order demanding an explanation, demonstrating the risks of using generative AI in legal contexts without human oversight.

2. Technical: CNET experimented with AI-generated articles on finance topics, but 41 out of 77 published articles were found to contain significant factual errors, including plagiarized content. The company had to issue multiple corrections, illustrating the dangers of trusting AI to produce factually accurate content without careful human review.

3. Diversity: Levi's faced backlash when they announced plans to use AI-generated models to promote diversity in their advertising. Critics argued that using AI to simulate diverse body types and skin colors bypassed real inclusivity efforts, underscoring how generative AI can sometimes be misapplied in areas requiring authentic representation .

These examples make it clear that Generative AI is not without significant risks. AI systems depend entirely on the data and instructions provided by humans. When they generate incorrect or harmful content or make faulty decisions, the problem lies in how they are designed, deployed, or supervised -- not in any inherent malevolence. There is no such thing as ""AI going rogue."" The real concern is for people not to go rogue -- or become negligent -- with AI.

Real-World Examples of Generative AI Successes

Generative AI can only reach its highest potential when paired with human supervision and verification. Deep learning systems, at least so far, are nowhere near achieving the sense of clarity, relevance, appropriateness, and justice humans provide. Unsupervised AI sounds like a utopia until it starts acting beyond its training: then, it becomes irrelevant at best, disastrous at worst.

Here are three examples where generative AI, duly supervised and verified, maximizes human potential for real benefit.

1. Drug Discovery: Insilico Medicine, a drug discovery company, used generative AI to design a new drug candidate to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. They used generative AI throughout the preclinical drug discovery process to identify targets, generate drug candidates, and predict clinical trial outcomes. This approach reduced the time and cost significantly, achieving results for one-tenth of the traditional cost and in one-third of the time, reaching the first clinical trial phase in just 2.5 years, compared to six years using conventional methods.

2. Design: Forma, a generative AI tool by Autodesk, enhances the early stages of the design and planning process by automating repetitive tasks and offering AI-powered insights. It enables architects to explore multiple design concepts quickly and evaluate environmental factors like sunlight and wind, helping to optimize building designs. Its contextual modeling feature allows users to set up 3D models of entire projects in minutes, with real-time analyses on various site conditions. This tool empowers architects to work iteratively, improve productivity, and create higher-quality deliverables without requiring deep technical expertise.

3. Customer Service: Verizon uses generative AI to streamline business customer interactions by offering agents quick insights into customer histories and suggesting solutions, which are then verified by human agents. The AI also automates tasks like call summaries, reducing workload and improving efficiency. Continuous feedback from agents helps refine the system for better performance.

The Importance of AI Literacy in the Age of Generative AI

As Generative AI continues to evolve, AI literacy is becoming an essential skill for individuals and businesses alike. Understanding how AI-generated content is created, recognizing its limitations, and learning how to critically assess the validity of AI outputs are necessary steps in navigating an increasingly AI-driven world.

AI literacy will define success or failure in various areas, from businesses that need to use AI responsibly to individuals navigating complex political landscapes. Without a basic understanding of how AI works, people are vulnerable to manipulation by AI-driven misinformation. This issue isn't just about technology -- it's about society's ability to discern truth from falsehood in a world where AI-generated content is ubiquitous.

Conclusion: Generative AI Won't Destroy the World, But Its Misuse Might

In conclusion, Generative AI itself is not a threat to humanity, but the potential for its misuse poses a significant risk. The combination of AI illiteracy and the intentional exploitation of AI tools for profit or political manipulation could lead to societal instability. Generative AI models are powerful tools, but they are still just that -- tools. The real danger lies in how humans choose to use or abuse them.

To mitigate the risks associated with Generative AI, we must prioritize AI literacy and develop ethical frameworks for the responsible use of AI technologies. Without proper oversight and understanding, Generative AI could provide bad actors with unprecedented scale and reach, potentially leading to systemic societal failures."
One boy's story shows the impact of rising Israeli settler violence in the West Bank,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/the-picture-show/2024/10/08/g-s1-22630/photos-palestinian-family-impact-israeli-settler-violence-occupied-west-bank,2024-10-08T11:33:53Z,"Noor Assi, 15, sits on his bed while watched by his 5-year-old sister Jenna in the village of Qarawat Bani Hassan, Israeli-occupied West Bank, on Feb. 23. Ayman Oghanna for NPR hide caption

In a carpentry shop in the village of Qarawat Bani Hassan, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Noor Assi is at work packaging a wooden table. He tears off strips of tape, tying it to padded cardboard, before flipping the table on its side.

He says he is 15 ""and a half,"" a measurement in age split between the innocence of youth and a desire for manhood.

The war in Gaza has caused tensions to flare across the Middle East, especially in places like the West Bank. The Israeli-occupied territory is the most violent it has been in decades. United Nations figures say that almost 700 Palestinians in the area have been killed, either by Israeli forces or settlers, in the past year. Noor's father was among those fatally shot.

""My childhood is gone,"" Noor says. He was forced to grow up by a grim rite of passage.

On Dec. 2, Israeli settlers raided his village in the central West Bank and shot his father, Ahmed Assi, dead, according to the family, residents and local officials.

The Israeli military told NPR that they responded to a physical confrontation between Palestinians and Israeli citizens in Qarawat Bani Hassan with riot disposal means and live fire and that the circumstances of Assi's death were still under review.

Ahmed Assi's mother, Noor's grandmother, shows bloodied clothes and a sweatshirt with a single bullet hole in the back. Assi's 5-year-old daughter, Jenna, looks on, wearing a necklace with a picture of her dead dad.

""When my father was martyred, I started to work, I took over my father's profession, I started working and spending on the house. I was smart and managed things, meaning I became responsible for the house,"" Noor says.

Noor dropped out of school, working full time in the family's carpentry warehouse, sometimes for 13 hours a day, to provide for his five siblings.

""I am responsible for them now. I take care of them and whatever they want, I get them. I don't let them want for anything.""

Noor looks young, is shy and has a boyish haircut -- long on top, a fade on the sides and back. He maintains his look with regular visits to the village barbershop.

In the Middle East, the barbershop is not just a place to cut your hair. It's also a place to socialize, hang out and talk about everything from family to sports and politics. Not long after Noor gets his trim, the village's mayor, Ibrahim Assi, enters. He is a distant relative of Noor's. It's a small community and family ties are strong. A poster of Noor's deceased father is plastered outside.

The mayor explains that Qarawat Bani Hassan is surrounded by an ever-expanding network of Israeli settlements and outposts. About 500,000 Israeli settlers live in the occupied West Bank, according to the United Nations. The settlements they live in are deemed illegal by the international community. Israeli politicians like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, have promoted their expansion, and they're growing through a web of smaller outposts.

The mayor says that violence from the settlers is terrorizing the Palestinians who live here.

""The West Bank is currently living in a nightmare, a nightmare that has lost its security and safety due to the violence of the Ministry of Settlers, who are -- on a daily basis -- assaulting, killing and harassing and stealing. They are committing real crimes against citizens and farmers that are present on their own land,"" the mayor says.

On Dec. 2, he says, settlers entered the village, damaging property, burning cars, wounding one man and shooting Noor's father dead. His lifeless body was found hours later in an olive grove on the outskirts of Qarawat Bani Hassan.

Noor may maintain his teenage haircut. But he has the hardened hands of an older working man, no longer hanging out with friends, devoting himself, instead, to work, faith and family.

At home, he helps out with the household chores, learning to cook from his mother. He sometimes feels pangs of envy for other teenagers.

""I do get jealous, I sometimes feel like playing, like them, but it doesn't work. I have a family to take care of,"" Noor says.

On Friday, the holiest day of the week in Islam, Noor prays at the village mosque before his weekly ritual of visiting his father's grave, draped in a Palestinian flag.

Prayer is important to Noor, from morning to night. Fighting back tears, he says the Islamic funeral prayer for his father on the porch outside his home.

""O God, forgive him and have mercy on him, and heal him, and pardon him, and grant him an honorable reception.""

Noor says that each night, after prayer, he speaks to his father.

""I tell him what is happening, what we are doing, and who is coming over, for example,"" he says. ""Last time, he came to me in a dream and told me, 'Take care of your family and your brothers.' """
"Real Madrid Legend Criticizes Mbappe, Bellingham And Club's Style Of Play",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomsanderson/2024/10/08/real-madrid-legend-criticizes-mbappe-bellingham-and-clubs-style-of-play/,2024-10-08T11:29:13Z,"Real Madrid legend Guti criticized the first team's current style of play plus the performances of Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham during one of his regular appearances on popular Spanish television program El Chiringuito.

While Madrid trails bitter rivals FC Barcelona by just three points at the top of the La Liga table, it has recently seen its 36-game unbeaten run ended by Lille in the Champions League while failing to dazzle punters with the same level of football that landed a treble last season.

Club legend Guti believes something is off and stated that he is ""worried about Madrid's game"".

""The spotlight is on Mbappe because there was a lot of expectation with him, the bar was very high. Now, Real Madrid's whole game can be summed up by the fact that Mbappe is not well, but I think it's the team that is not good.

""If the team is not well, it is very difficult for a player to do things well on his own. This is the reality,"" Guti added.

The former attacking midfielder said that he doesn't understand Madrid's game, where there has only been one change which is Toni Kroos retiring and Mbappe arriving on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain

""The team isn't working. That's the reality, the reality is that the team doesn't work. They win matches because there is so much quality up front. In the end, in small details, Real Madrid win matches - but the game is not good,"" he reiterated.

Being more specific about where he believes the problem could lie, Guti said there is ""no connection between the midfield and the forwards"".

""Offensively, Real Madrid are not doing things well. There is no need to think about it any more. Hopefully that key or that detail [to rectifty things] from [Carlo] Ancelotti arrives as soon as possible for Real Madrid to play well, but the truth is that they are not playing well"".

""Toni Kroos left, who was a very important player, who gives different passes to the others. You have to be daring to play for Real Madrid. It's not enough to play to the side or behid, you have to dare to do something more and that demand for the midfielders has to be there,"" Guti pointed out.

""Real Madrid are predictable, they are slow, [and] it is very difficult for them to filter passes. It is very difficult for them to play in space, everyone wants the passes at their feet and that is very difficult in today's football.""

In addition to Mbappe, Bellingham was also singled out for criticism.

""Bellingham shone before, [and] Vinicius shone because the team played well, now the team doesn't play well and it's difficult for a player to shine,"" he said.

""We talked about Barcelona, how [Robert] Lewandowski was doing... Because the harmony is good, because they are playing well and when you play well, everything goes well, everything goes better. When things go wrong, in the end, everyone shuts down a little bit,"" he concluded.

With an international break now upon us, Ancelotti has time to think about how he can get his men to perform better ahead of an early title race showdown with Barca in El Clasico on October 26."
Could African Penguins Disappear From South Africa By 2035?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/10/08/could-african-penguins-disappear-from-south-africa-by-2035/,2024-10-08T11:29:07Z,"Researchers in South Africa are trying to find a way the African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus), while balancing the needs of the fishing industry.

At the turn of the 20th century, Africa's only penguin numbered in the millions, but the global population is estimated only about 18,500 pairs now and and could be extinct in the wild by 2035 thanks to poor breeding habitat, disease and reduced availability of food.

Nicky Stander, head of conservation at the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds explains that as specialized predators of anchovy and sardine, penguins play a crucial link in the marine food web and serve as an indicator for when this prey falls below critical levels for other marine predators such as whales, dolphins, seals and linefish.

""Effective long-term measures to manage these fish stocks sustainably, in line with an effective ecosystem approach to fisheries management, has not been forthcoming,"" she says, ""Implementation of meaningful closures aligned to important penguin foraging areas is recommended as an urgent conservation intervention to alleviate resource competition around African Penguin colonies.""

In a paper published in August 2024 in the ICES Journal of Marine Science, Alistair McInnes and co-authors including Stander looked at the six largest South African penguin colonies, holding over three-quarters of the global population.

The researchers argue that, based on the results of their trade-off analysis, adjusted no-take zones should be implemented, representing an optimal compromise between conservation and the fishing industry at each of the six colonies.

""The availability of prey, mainly sardine and anchovy, has been consistently linked to the survival, breeding success and foraging performance of the African Penguin,"" Stander says, adding that undernourished penguins are vulnerable to the range of ongoing threats including predation, oil pollution, vessel noise and disease.

""Protecting this species means taking a stance for global ocean advocacy, and as part of this project, SANCCOB, alongside BirdLife South Africa and Blue Marine Foundation, have launched a petition for the international community to sign,"" she says, ""By supporting the protection of the African Penguin, we as global citizens can protect our planet.""

Stander grew up in Wales, dreaming of living in Africa and working to save wild animals.

""As a young girl, I loaned books from my local library to read from my wildlife ""greats"", Dian Fossey and Jane Goodall, I studied Animal Science and tried to determine how to accomplish my dreams,"" she says, ""The magic happened during a gap year in Botswana; this confirmed my deep connection to Africa and my profound love for wildlife was now burrowed under my skin, and I knew it's where I belonged.""

Stander later relocated to South Africa and while working at a wildlife rehabilitation facility on the east coast of South Africa, she helped relocate rescued African Penguins to Cape Town where they could continue their rehabilitation at SANCCOB.

""That was 15 years ago: working with birds was never the plan, it was never the dream,"" she says, ""Now, my biggest dream is to save Africa's only penguin species from extinction.""

Stander explains the reality of competing priorities relating to socio-economic issues in South Africa presents complex challenges when addressing environmental issues.

""For the last few decades, scientists have revealed the tragic story of crashing fish stocks, and correlating declines in seabird populations,"" she says, ""In the South African context, marine scientists and NGOs provide the science and the data to inform the government which is intended to improve management practices.""

Another researcher working in southern seas is Chilean oceanographer Andrea Piñones at the Research Center of Dynamics of High Latitude Marine Ecosystems (IDEAL).

The researchers realized that if they could understand the behavior of the crabeater seal, they could understand the future distribution of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) - which has important implications for food chains and the carbon cycle.

""Crabeater seals feed primarily on krill -more than 90% of their diet - so basically if you understand where the predator feeds, you not only understand their feeding behavior but also understand where the prey is,"" she says, adding that to track the krill, they first needed to track the seals.

Sensor data from trackers on seals captured and released in Antarctica showed their movements, the depth of the dives, salinity, temperature and density of the sea, among others. The devices directly sent the data to satellites, which researchers were then able to crunch.

""The results obtained by the study suggest that under a climate change scenario crabeater seals will have to take longer and farther trips to feed because there will be a shift in the distribution of their prey,"" Piñones says, ""There will be a southward and oceanward shift of the distribution of Antarctic krill."""
Inflation Reduction Act Two Years Later: Building Clean Electricity Faster Than Ever,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/10/08/inflation-reduction-act-two-years-later-building-clean-electricity-faster-than-ever/,2024-10-08T11:22:17Z,"This is the fourth article in a series exploring the Inflation Reduction Act's impact after two years. The first summarizes its total impact, the second details historic industry investment, the third tracks a clean manufacturing boom.

In August 2022, when the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, it became the most significant investment in climate that the United States has ever made, making long-term, transformational investments in clean energy deployment, manufacturing, electric vehicles and buildings, and targeted investments to support communities disproportionately impacted by our energy system.

America's electricity sector is the IRA's cornerstone, making up 30-44% of the bill's expected economy-wide emissions reductions. Now, two years after the IRA's passage, signs of progress are emerging.

Before the IRA passed, clean electricity incentives were caught in a cycle of short-term extensions and expirations, creating enormous clean energy industry uncertainty. The IRA invested in the clean energy industry's long-term economic health by creating a decade's worth of certainty for electricity providers, developers, and investors solidifying that clean energy was the better deal for electricity consumers, shareholders, and the planet.

The IRA owes its name to the era of rising prices in which it passed. Global fossil fuel price volatility and supply chain constraints were driving up inflation and interest rates. With clean energy costs largely coming as upfront capital expenditures, the industry was in a period of moderating growth when the bill passed.

Key policies included extension and expansion of clean electricity tax credits, providing up to 60% off the cost of clean energy for ten years, the creation of manufacturing tax credits that bring clean energy manufacturing to the U.S., and billions of dollars to grant and loan programs to make sure upfront funding is there for projects that will save money in the long-term.

A New Energy Era

The effect of the IRA has only just begun to show up in clean energy deployment. While the first half of 2023 was still relatively slow on installs of solar, wind, and energy storage, 2023 ended with a new record of over 35 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity added, and the first half of 2024 saw a 91% increase over installs in the first half of 2023 at 19 GW. Not only were installations in the higher than 2023, but they were 10 GW higher than average of the previous five years. The U.S. Energy Information Agency expects a total of 59 GW of wind, solar and energy storage to come online in 2024. The growth in renewable energy installations is only expected to rise, with planned projects reported to the EIA overwhelmingly comprised of wind, solar, and batteries in coming years.

Since 2021, utility plans have also become increasingly bullish on adding new clean energy. An RMI analysis of 121 utilities representing 48% of U.S. electricity demand showed utilities are now planning to add 34% more wind and solar than they were as of August 2022. Unfortunately, plans to add gas have also increased, as utilities respond to rising electricity demand while they work to modernize their planning assumptions. Utilities don't need to rush to gas, however, as good planning and procurement practices can help utilities meet growing demand with cleaner and cheaper resources.

The IRA extended support for clean electricity across the whole sector, but publicly owned and non-profit electricity providers saw some of the most significant changes. First, tax credits that were previously inaccessible due to lack of tax liability were converted to direct pay, so non-profit entities could take direct advantage.

Rural electric cooperatives in particular are set to receive significant direct funding. Rural electric cooperatives provide electricity to 42 million people across 56% of the nation's landmass. They serve a disproportionately low-income segment of the population, but lag behind the rest of the nation in moving away from coal power, with 30% of their electricity coming from coal in 2022 compared to 19% nationwide. However, the IRA breathed new life into these non-profit utilities, setting aside $9.7 billion in funds to help cooperatives reduce emissions and install clean energy projects.

The first round of funding announcements into this program were made in September, with $7.3 billion awarded to 16 utilities across 23 states, leveraging an additional $29 billion in private investment. These funds are expected to support 10 GW of new clean energy projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from rural electric cooperatives by 43.6 million tons each year, or about 30% of cooperatives current annual emissions. Projects are also expected to reduce electricity rates substantially compared to a continued reliance on fossil energy, according to several of the awardees.

Clean Electricity for Everyone

The IRA didn't stop at driving new clean energy investment - it sought to create a positive feedback loop between the clean energy transition and the health of American manufacturing via a new set of tax credits that can be earned by producing components that go into clean energy projects.

Since the bill's passage, manufacturing facility announcements rolled in, with over $112 billion in investment slated for batteries, electric vehicles, solar, and wind. Batteries are by far the largest share of investment at 68%, shared between batteries for the electric grid and for electric vehicles which utilize slightly different chemistries. However, solar manufacturing boasts no small stake with $14 billion in announcements, which will continue to abate supply chain delays that have lingered after the pandemic.

The power of the IRA does not lie in its direct investment alone. The bill's clean energy provisions also enabled state action with four states implementing 100% clean energy targets for the first time in 2023. Minnesota and Michigan passed legislation requiring 100% of electricity sales to come from clean sources by 2040, while the New Jersey governor signed an executive order requiring 100% clean electricity by 2035. Delaware, too, passed clean energy legislation, requiring a 100% clean economy by 2050.

While interest in clean energy from states, utilities, and investors has increased, many bottlenecks remain, namely in interconnection queues, or the projects waiting to connect to the grid. Research by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that at the end of 2022, over 2,000 GW clean projects were waiting to connect, and at the end of 2023, that number had skyrocketed to over 2500 GW. Overall U.S. energy capacity is about 1,400 GW, meaning significantly more projects are waiting to connect to the grid than are currently connected.

Reforms by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aim to shorten these wait times and reduce costs, but regional approaches have shown that much more can be done in the effort to connect clean energy projects as quickly as possible. For example, Texas uses an approach to interconnection that avoids lengthy studies and costly upgrades across the transmission grid any time a project wants to connect.

This has reduced Texas' timeline to connect projects compared to other regions by 2.5 or more years, and shows why the state is predicted to add 35% of all solar projects and 44% of all battery projects this year, despite only producing 13% of the nation's electricity.

Further improvements to transmission planning, bolstered by recent FERC action, are also expected to prepare the grid to handle more clean energy, faster, but short-term actions like upgrading existing infrastructure to carry more electricity on the transmission pathways we already have can help meet our current needs.

A Clean Power Future

The investment approach of the IRA is not enough to bring electricity sector emissions down to zero - it was never expected to do so. However, it has created tailwinds, bringing industry forward and creating momentum far into the future. Now, it's time to focus on the next piece of the puzzle and make sure the momentum translates into clean power."

Cybersecurity Risks: When AI Becomes A Tool For Evil,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2024/10/08/cybersecurity-risks-when-ai-becomes-a-tool-for-evil/,2024-10-08T11:22:05Z,"October marks Cybersecurity Awareness Month, a perfect moment to explore one of the most pressing challenges facing our digital world today: artificial intelligence being used as a weapon. The staggering power of AI and Large Language Models like GPT-4 has the potential to transform industries. But as with any powerful tool, it can be misused, and in the wrong hands, AI can become a cybercriminal's greatest asset. From deepfakes to phishing attacks and election interference, malicious actors are leveraging AI to wreak havoc on organizations and individuals alike.

This is the new frontier of cybersecurity -- an arms race where we're not just battling hackers, but also battling AI-powered machines that can think, adapt, and innovate faster than ever before.

Let's not mince words: AI is being weaponized. While the world marvels at how AI can write essays, code, and even compose music, hackers are using these very capabilities for far more sinister purposes. Election tampering, phishing schemes, and sophisticated man-in-the-middle attacks are just the beginning of how AI is being misused.

One of the most frightening examples is the rise of deepfakes -- hyper-realistic video and audio forgeries that can make it look and sound like anyone is saying anything. Deepfakes have already been weaponized to discredit political figures and spread disinformation. Recently, deepfakes of former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris went viral, spreading false messages that could have had real-world consequences. These AI-generated fabrications are blurring the line between reality and fiction, undermining trust and destabilizing our information ecosystem.

But it's not just deepfakes. AI is also being used to generate convincing phishing schemes. Remember when phishing emails used to be easy to spot with their broken English and suspicious links? That's no longer the case. With LLMs, hackers can create phishing emails so sophisticated they look like they were penned by your CEO. One notable case involved an LLM-generated email that impersonated a company's C-suite, successfully convincing an employee to transfer millions to a fraudulent account. By the time the scam was uncovered, the money had vanished, and the company was left reeling from the financial and reputational blow.

Perhaps even more concerning is how AI is being used to automate and scale attacks. AI tools can scan codebases and infrastructure setups at lightning speed, identifying vulnerabilities faster than any human ever could. In ransomware attacks, for instance, AI-driven automation allows hackers to deploy encryption faster than traditional security teams can react. This speed makes it nearly impossible to prevent the damage once an attack is in motion, leaving businesses locked out of their systems with no choice but to pay up or face the consequences.

It's easy to feel like we're losing the battle, but the good news is that AI is also our greatest defense. Just as hackers are using AI to attack, we can use it to help us defend against AI generated threats.

The most advanced AI-enhanced threat detection systems are learning to identify threats in real-time. These tools can process vast amounts of data in seconds, identifying patterns and anomalies that signal an impending attack. Unlike traditional security measures that rely on predefined rules, AI-powered systems learn and adapt, making them far more effective at catching new, never-before-seen threats.

AI-powered cybersecurity systems and automated monitoring agents are increasingly leveraging machine learning to detect subtle shifts in network behavior, flagging suspicious activity before it escalates into a full-blown attack. In a world where split-second delays can lead to devastating consequences, these AI-driven systems provide the speed necessary to respond swiftly and effectively, preventing hackers from inflicting serious damage.

Another powerful defensive use of AI is in endpoint protection, where AI analyzes device behavior rather than relying solely on predefined attack signatures. This approach enables AI to identify brand-new, previously unseen attacks based on abnormal patterns of behavior, stopping threats before they can do harm. These tools are particularly critical for defending against zero-day exploits, which target vulnerabilities that have yet to be discovered by traditional security systems.

AI is not going away. In fact, its influence will only grow. As cybersecurity professionals, we must accept that AI is here to stay -- and so too are the evolving threats. But there's a silver lining: By leveraging AI for defense, we can stay ahead of the hackers who use it for harm. However, success will not come from AI alone. It requires the collaboration of trained cybersecurity professionals working in tandem with AI. Human expertise combined with AI's speed and precision forms a powerful defense capable of adapting to new, sophisticated attacks. The key is constant vigilance, innovation, and an unwavering commitment to ethical standards.

This October, as we celebrate Cybersecurity Awareness Month, let's remind ourselves of the stakes. Cybersecurity has always been a battle of minds, but now it's also a battle of machines. As long as AI continues to evolve, the arms race will only intensify. Our challenge is to stay one step ahead -- combining the power of AI with human expertise -- before AI becomes a tool for evil."
"Trump, Republicans venture to blue areas in Wisconsin to boost GOP turnout",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-republicans-venture-blue-areas-wisconsin-boost-gop-turnout,2024-10-08T11:17:24Z,"Wisconsin Republican Party Executive Director Andrew Iverson emphasized the ground game strategy in the battleground that includes turning out Republican voters in deep blue areas.

Former President Trump and Republicans across the swing state of Wisconsin are ramping up campaign efforts everywhere, including deep blue areas, to close the margins.

""In a state this tight, we have to get votes in every single corner of the state,"" Wisconsin Republican Party Executive Director Andrew Iverson told Fox News Digital.

""Closing the margins just a little bit makes a huge difference,"" he said.

HERE'S WHAT 2 UNDECIDED WISCONSIN VOTERS ARE HOLDING OUT FOR IN 2024 ELECTION

This is paired with ""running up the score in red counties.""

The reason such an approach is necessary, he said, is ""this election will likely come down to 20,000-30,000 votes.""

In 2016, Trump defeated Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin by one point and less than 30,000 votes. When President Biden beat Trump in the state during the next election in 2020, it was similarly by about 20,000 votes.

Now, Wisconsin is once again expected to be a deciding factor in the presidential election.

SENATE REPUBLICANS MARK OCT 7 ATTACK 1 YEAR OUT AS ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR CONTINUES

""I would highlight that the Republican Party of Wisconsin and the Republican National Committee (RNC) - we have over 100 staff on the ground in Wisconsin, and we have 40 field offices,"" Iverson explained.

""So we have a great presence across the entire state.""

According to him, the path to victory for Republicans relies on pulling ""votes in every single corner of the state.""

He pointed to Trump's decision to hold a rally in Dane County, home to the state capital of Madison, Wisconsin. ""Republicans are going where we traditionally may not always go,"" he said.

SOROS-LINKED DARK MONEY GROUP PROPS UP NEBRASKA INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE IN KEY SENATE RACE

Iverson described Dane as ""the most liberal county in the state of Wisconsin,"" and said Trump's trip there is ""because he has to get votes in every single county and turn out Republicans in every part of the state.""

Former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, a Republican, told reporters earlier this month at a press conference in Milwaukee, ""Donald Trump called me and asked me, how do I carry Wisconsin?""

The longest-serving Wisconsin governor, who was in office from 1987 to 2001, said he told Trump to follow his lead, ""You got to go into southwestern Wisconsin.""

""I said to the president, you've got to come into Dane County. There hasn't been a presidential candidate in Dane County since 1996, when Bob Dole ran for president. Republicans stay away. I said, we have to go.""

TOP 5 MOMENTS FROM ONLY VP DEBATE BETWEEN VANCE, WALZ BEFORE ELECTION

Trump's visit to the blue stronghold that same day drew massive crowds, despite the county's reputation. Thompson remarked that there was a ""huge crowd all the way from the airport to the factory,"" where the event was held.

This attention to heavily Democratic-voting areas of the state is a departure from previous Republicans' strategy, as the former governor noted.

Iverson told Fox News Digital that while the election cycle is quite polarized and many people are decided on their candidate, ""there's a rather decent segment of voters who are still undecided, and they'll be making up their decision until the moment they vote.""

""That's why it's so important that we are out there talking to as many voters as possible, because each conversation that we could have could be the last conversation they have with voters before they go and vote,"" he said.

Wisconsin was rated a ""Toss up"" by Fox News Power rankings, as of late last month."

Steele dossier author remains convinced that there is more dirt on Trump in advance of 2024 election: Report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/steele-dossier-author-remains-convinced-more-dirt-trump-advance-2024-election-report,2024-10-08T11:12:08Z,"'Outnumbered' co-hosts discuss former President Trump's return to Butler, Pennsylvania less than three months after nearly being assassinated during a July rally.

Christopher Steele, the author of the 2016 Steele dossier that featured discredited claims about then-candidate Donald Trump, claims he has uncovered new information about the former president during an interview with The Washington Post.

Steele became a key political figure after the dossier made unsubstantiated allegations that Trump committed sex acts with prostitutes in Moscow and helped underscore years of accusations of illicit Russia collusion. The dossier, which was funded through a law firm hired by the Hillary Clinton campaign at the time, was ultimately revealed to be largely uncorroborated and salacious rumors.

When asked if he would still go ahead and release explosive claims about Trump if he wrote the report today, Steele answered in the affirmative.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS AND FORMER ROBERT MUELLER LAWYERS DISCUSS RUSSIA COLLUSION CLAIMS: 'IT WASN'T A HOAX'

""Call me a stick in the mud,"" he told The Post, ""but probably, yes.""

""We know it happens. Anyone who knows Russia and Russian counterintelligence knows about honey traps and about the filming of things in hotel rooms and hookers, and all the rest of it is just part of -- part of the scene in Russia,"" Steele said. ""And so the actual thing itself is entirely credible. The truth of it would have to be built up through ... careful investigation, which is difficult now. It was slightly easier back then. And, as I say, we didn't just take one source's word for it. We interviewed other people that we felt might have knowledge of it.""

Steele chose to stand behind his dossier after its multiple unproven claims came to dominate the news cycle. Some allies of Steele, like former White House National Security Council official Mark Medish, advised Steele to defend only certain parts of his report, instead of all claims.

POLITICO WRITER KNOCKS WAPO FOR SCRUBBING STEELE DOSSIER ERRORS: 'IS THIS HOW JOURNALISM DIES... IN DARKNESS?'

""His instinct is to do the latter,"" Medish said in an interview. ""I chalk it up to him being a fighter.""

""Any new information by this foreign agent who peddled the debunked Steele dossier should be wholly dismissed, and any media outlet that entertains anything he has to say is just the continuation of election interference intended to meddle in the campaign,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told The Post when reached for comment.

Steele, who is releasing a book about Trump and American democracy, said that he has not given up on the existence of the alleged sex tape.

""I think it's just not really been properly bottomed out,"" Steele told The Post. ""Excuse the pun.""

LGBTQ+ women face disproportionate rates of mental health issues and barriers to care,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5131619/lgbtq-women-mental-health-care,2024-10-08T11:07:09Z,"LGTBQ+ women face high rates of trauma and other mental health problems, a new report finds. SDI Productions/E+/Getty Images hide caption

A leading national survey finds that 22% of LGBTQ+ women respondents have attempted suicide, and 66% reported seeking treatment for trauma.

""The trauma burden in this community is enormous,"" said Jaime Grant, one of the researchers who conducted the survey.

These findings are included in a report released Tuesday from the Urvashi Vaid National LGBTQ+ Women's Community Survey, named after the late lesbian activist. The report comes from analysis of a national survey of 5,000 LGBTQ+ respondents who previously or currently identify as a woman, conducted between June 2021 and June 2022.

The analysis finds that LGBTQ+ women experience substantial health disparities, mental illness and barriers to care.

These findings come more than a decade after Grant's earlier research found that transgender people had attempted suicide at a rate nine times higher than the national average. Grant, who also led the National Transgender Discrimination Survey in 2011, said those data helped improve medical treatment for transgender people. She hopes this report will do the same for LGBTQ+ women.

The survey found that respondents experience higher rates of mental illness than the general population. Nearly half of respondents live with anxiety (44%) or depression (51%). The National Association on Mental Illness reports 19% of U.S. adults have an anxiety disorder and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports 18% of U.S. adults have depression. The survey also found differences among race -- Black and indigenous women of color reported higher rates of disability and attempted suicide.

""It's distressing to see such high trauma rates, but it's consistent with what we've seen in the past,"" says Christina Dyar, an assistant professor at the Ohio State University who studies health disparities in LGBTQ+ communities and wasn't involved in this report.

The survey also sought to identify barriers to health care for LGBTQ+ women. Research shows that 77% of the U.S. population has a primary care physician, but just over half of LGBTQ+ women in the survey reported being under the care of one. Black and indigenous women of color were twice as likely to say they lacked access to quality health care.

Respondents cited cost and discrimination as the leading reasons for why they put off or didn't seek out medical care when they were sick or in need. Dyar says there's been limited research done to determine what exactly limits access to care for LGBTQ+ women. ""These numbers are great to have.""

""Historically, medical spaces have not been safe for us,"" says Savy Elahian, who led the data analysis for this report and serves as a program coordinator with the National LGBTQ Institute of Intimate Partner Violence.

""There's been experimentation [on people], there's been medical racism. It's important to understand the historical impacts, especially for LGBTQ+ people of color.""

Elahian says the medical field is behind on understanding how to fully serve LGBTQ+ people, which can leave patients feeling unaffirmed and uncomfortable. This discomfort can impact how likely it is they'll return to a provider when they're in need, which can be especially dangerous when thinking about preventative care.

According to the survey, 14% of respondents had never had a pap smear and all respondents were nearly twice as likely to have cervical cancer than women in the general U.S. population. A 2022 study found that nearly 1 in 3 lesbian, gay, and bisexual women were overdue on cervical cancer screenings.

""LGBTQ+ women and gender-diverse people are really missing out on preventative care and holistic wellness,"" says Elahian. While community-oriented care can help address certain health disparities, community centers and organizations can sometimes lack sufficient resources.

""[LGBTQ+ people] still need to operate in these larger health systems,"" they add. ""It's a bit inevitable.""

Report authors Grant and Elahian say they hope the medical field will learn from these findings.

""This is powerful data that people need to listen to,"" Elahian said, ""from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to doctor's offices to medical universities.""

Grant noted how the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey and follow-up surveys helped to put numbers to suffering, reshape medical school curricula, and served as a model and resource for other researchers. She hopes the same thing will happen here.

While the Urvashi Vaid National LGBTQ+ Women's Community Survey has been led by community activists and researchers, it's moving to a more prominent organization in an effort to boost its reach and impact. The survey will now be housed at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the group announced on Tuesday.

""This is enormous for us,"" says Imani Rupert-Gordon, the organization's president. ""We aren't able to fully advocate for our community if we don't know what's happening in our community.""

The Center, which serves as a litigation organization, will look to include the survey's findings in their policy recommendations.

Grant and her team want these findings to go beyond just the doctor's office and courtroom, though. ""This data needs to go to our own people, so they can know the current state of our health,"" says Elahian. To do that, they've made the findings free and accessible to all and hope to disseminate the research through LGBTQ+ community groups.

Dyar emphasizes community-led surveys are often more accessible and tend to reach more respondents. Academic health disparity research ""often ends up behind a paywall,"" she says. ""It can be really frustrating when our findings don't get out there.""

Elahian hopes that community education will foster people's ability to self-advocate in medical settings -- yet another example of how community support helps strengthen this resilient group."
VeriSign Stock Vs. Gen Digital,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/08/verisign-stock-vs-gen-digital/,2024-10-08T11:02:27Z,"Given its better prospects, we believe VeriSign stock (NASDAQ: VRSN), which provides domain name registry services and internet infrastructure, is a better pick than its industry peer, Gen Digital stock (NASDAQ: GEN), best known for its cyber safety products, including Norton, Avast, and AVG. Investors have assigned a higher valuation multiple of 12x revenues for VeriSign compared to 4.5x revenues for Gen Digital due to VeriSign's superior profitability and solid financial position. We think this gap in valuation will remain in favor of VeriSign in the coming years. There is more to the comparison, and in the sections below, we discuss why we think VeriSign will outperform Gen Digital in the next three years.

1. GEN Stock Has Fared Much Better Than VRSN

VRSN stock has seen a decline of 15% from levels of $215 in early January 2021 to around $185 now, vs. an increase of about 25% for GEN stock from $20 to $25 over the same period. In comparison, the S&P 500 has seen a 50% rise over this roughly four-year period. However, the changes in these stocks have been far from consistent. Returns for VRSN stock were 17% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 0% in 2023, while that for GEN were 28%, -16%, and 9%, respectively. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 -- indicating that VRSN underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2023 and GEN underperformed the S&P in 2023

In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 -- in good times and bad -- has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including AMZN and AAPL, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

VeriSign has benefited from increased demand for domain names during the pandemic as more businesses expanded their presence online. Price increases have also bolstered the company's top-line growth, and this trend is expected to continue in the near term.

For Gen, the strong revenue growth was driven by the Avast acquisition in 2023. The company's ARPU has declined from $9.01 in 2021 to $7.25 in 2024, primarily due to the impact of the Avast acquisition. The company has been doing well particularly in EMEA, with the region's sales rising 2.2x between 2021 and 2024.

Looking forward, we forecast VeriSign's sales to rise slightly from $1.5 billion in the last twelve months to $1.7 billion in the next three years. We expect Gen's sales growth to be similar, with its top-line expanding from $3.8 billion to $4.3 billion over the same period.

Looking at financial risk, VeriSign has an edge over Gen. Its 10% debt as a percentage of equity is lower than 50% for Gen. Also, its 46% cash as a percentage of assets is much higher than 4% for the latter. This implies that VeriSign has a better debt position and more cash cushion.

5. The Net of It All

We see that VeriSign is more profitable and offers lower financial risk than Gen. Now, looking at the prospects, we still believe VRSN is the better choice of the two. At its current levels, VRSN stock is trading at 12x revenues, versus its average P/S ratio of 16x seen over the last five years. In comparison, at its current levels of around $25, Gen stock trades at 4.5x revenues, versus its average P/S ratio of 4.6x over the last five years. This implies that VRSN stock has some room to grow, while GEN stock looks fully priced, in our view.

While VRSN may outperform GEN in the next three years, it is helpful to see how VeriSign's Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons."
"Coinbase's Base Leads The Race To Become The ""Broadband"" Of Web3",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/08/coinbases-base-leads-the-race-to-become-the-broadband-of-web3/,2024-10-08T11:02:21Z,"For the casual observer, the unstoppable rise of blockchain and associated Web3 technologies seems serene, but like a swan there's always a lot going on under the surface - and I can't remember a time of more momentous movement than right now. Today, blockchain faces its ""broadband moment"", as increased adoption and use cases drive the demand for speed and capacity that's an order of magnitude higher than what came before.

This isn't a gradual, gentle evolution, and it's not the result of pan-industry collaboration, either. When you get up close and personal, it's a fierce and sometimes bitter rivalry between a range of Layer-2 (L2) networks. These L2s are designed to overcome the technical and performance limitations of underlying L1s like Solana and Ethereum. Whether they admit it or not, they are all competing to become the de facto standard; the ""broadband for the decentralized web"".

The battle to become the ""L2 that rules them all"" is yet to be decided, but we have a new contender for the crown - Coinbase, a company that combines an impeccable pedigree in blockchain with superb technical expertise. With its new solution, Base, Coinbase has thrust itself into the vanguard to become the broadband of Web3. And into the money. Per Yahoo Finance, Coinbase achieved a significant milestone in its diversification strategy last quarter, with its Base blockchain generating $56 million in revenue.

Like its competitors, Base is designed to solve issues surrounding scalability and security, but it also promises to tap into a massive sum of liquidity that stands to change the nature of the crypto markets forever. Alongside some other powerful developments, and with the support of the memecoin community, Base may just be the player that' overhauls the entire decentralized landscape and brings Web3 to a worldwide audience.

As the biggest crypto exchange in the US, Coinbase needs little by way of introduction, but market dominance in one area does not necessarily translate into L2 leadership. So what is Base, and sets it apart in a crowded - some might say far-too crowded - landscape? Well, to quote Jennifer Aniston: here comes the science bit.

Base is an Ethereum L2 blockchain that specifically focuses on security, stability, and scalability for the benefit of ecosystem builders. With Base, developers can launch literally any EVM codebase and proceed to onramp liquidity and users directly from the entirety of the Ethereum ecosystem.

$130 billion worth of assets from Coinbase and associated, interoperable chains. What makes Base so flexible is the fact that it is built out of the OP (Optimism) Stack. The OP Stack is designed to make Optimism (and now Base) as close and equivalent as possible to Ethereum itself, unlocking maximum compatibility for existing Ethereum developers. This manifests as a series of modules across various consensus, execution and settlement layers that all work together to form a massive, interoperable, and secure blockchain ecosystem.

That might all sound like Base is mostly relevant to those unsung backroom guys and gals of the blockchain industry, but it's actually incredibly significant for all of us, the ultimate end users of Web3. Sure, every L2 talks about interoperability - it's what Layer-2s are for, after all - but Base takes this to the next level, making it simple for developers to deploy services, access a massive well of liquidity, and ensure seamless interoperability with most of the major services already trusted in the Web3 space.

Jesse Pollak, the creator of Base and a key figure at Coinbase, has been quite vocal recently about the future of Base and its broader impact on the blockchain ecosystem. In one of his recent remarks, Pollak highlighted that Base is about building ""an open global economy,"" where the goal is to bring millions of people and decentralized applications (dApps) into the on-chain world. He believes that integrating Coinbase on-chain is essential to realizing this vision, which will help increase economic freedom globally. Pollak also mentioned that despite the challenges ahead, Base has already seen significant community engagement with users creating Twitter accounts, memes, and launching new projects on the platform, underscoring the excitement surrounding this new ecosystem.

If Base competed solely on integrations and interoperability, it would be a strong challenger in the L2 ecosystem. But these alone don't explain its incredibly rapid adoption, which has seen

Base hitting (and smashing) milestones at breakneck speed.Base has repeatedly hit new highs for daily transactions, most recently setting the record with more than 5 million transactions on a single day. There's also the fact that Base has a whopping TVL of $1.92 billion worth of assets, placing it as the #6 biggest chain overall, and well ahead of major competitors like Polygon and even Optimism (which, of course, uses the same base-layer technology).

Size isn't everything, of course. For the ordinary end user, whether they be an institution or individual, speed is every bit as important. Here again, Base boasts impressive credentials for the title of ""broadband of Web3"". As Brian Armstrong himself has championed, Base has gotten its transactions to under one second for finality along with just $0.01 for fees. Considering that Base is also truly global and has no regional restrictions, he claims that this transcends the capabilities of all existing international payment rails.

Meanwhile, in a further leap for Web3 innovation, Armstrong announced recently that, for the first time in history, Artificial Intelligence had used the Base blockchain to send a cryptocurrency transaction. ""AI agents cannot get bank accounts, but they can get crypto wallets,"" said Armstrong ""They can now use USDC on Base to transact with humans, merchants, or other AIs. Those transactions are instant, global, and free."" What this signals is a new space in the cryptocurrency industry that facilitates AI-powered automated trading, a development that stands to revolutionize how these markets are managed.

This is precisely why there are multiple, promising ventures specifically building on Base to leverage its cutting edge benefits. Projects like PropyKeys, which offers users an unprecedented opportunity for anyone to mint an NFT representing a digital address that corresponds to a tangible, real-world property. Speaking to PropyKeys CEO, Nina Fabbri, she said that ""Propykeys is built on Base because of their excellent leadership and commitment to bringing the world onchain. Their innovative approach and dedication to decentralization make them the perfect partner for our mission to revolutionize the real estate industry.""

In addition to multiple enterprise focused projects and revolutions in AI trading, Base has also established itself as a haven for cutting edge memecoin activity.

Jesse Pollak, head of Base and Coinbase wallet, envisions meme coins playing a significant role in onboarding new users to Base, suggesting that these culturally-driven projects will be a major driver of growth for the protocol.

Already, we have seen multiple projects launch and thrive in this ecosystem. Take for example the current leader in Base memecoins, BRETT, a project inspired by a character from Matt Furie's ""Boy's Club"" comic series and depicted as a laid-back, video game-loving figure. After its launch in February of 2024 BRETT quickly rose to prominence and has become one of the largest memecoins by capitalization in the entire market.

There's also Basenji (BENJI), themed after the popular dog breed. The BENJI token aims to follow in the footsteps of other, previously successful dog-themed memecoins, all while bringing its own utility through this domain partnership. Beyond examples like these, the Base blockchain is host to a wide array of other memecoin projects, with names like Mumu, Base God, and Toshi. This is because Base's near-instant transactions and extremely low fees make trading these assets - which have evolved from in-jokes to become crucial entry points to the world of Web3 - more attractive than on virtually any other network.

Ultimately, it's the collision of interoperability, technical innovation, speed and Coinbase's huge clout and connections that are positioning Base as the leader in the race to become the broadband of Web3. And that's to say nothing of the huge community of users and developers that Coinbase brings to the table, which makes it such a powerful player in this hyper-competitive spaceThe battle for Layer-2 hegemony is far from over, but the speed with which Base has established itself as the clear leader puts it firmly among the favorites to emerge the winner."
UFC 308: Early Betting Odds For Topuria Vs. Holloway Fight Card,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2024/10/08/ufc-308-early-betting-odds-for-topuria-vs-holloway-fight-card/,2024-10-08T11:02:05Z,"The next UFC pay-per-view card takes place on October 26. That fight card, UFC 308, goes down at Etihad Arena in Abu Dhabi. In the headlining scrap, UFC featherweight champion Ilia Topuria faces former 145-pound champion Max Holloway.

In the evening's co-main event, former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker is scheduled to meet Khamzat Chimaev.

Also on the UFC 308 pay-per-view card is a potential UFC light heavyweight title eliminator. Magomed Ankalaev faces Aleksandar Rakic in that scrap.

Topuria(15-0), a former Cage Warriors champion, joined the UFC in 2020 with a 9-0 record. It did not take him long to make a name for himself. He was ranked No. 14 in the featherweight division after three UFC bouts at 145 pounds and one contest in the 155-pound division. Three of those scraps ended with Topuria winning via knockout.

In his first fight as a ranked featherweight, Topuria dispatched Bryce Mitchell via submission in the second round, earning his first ""Performance of the Night"" bonus and moving to No. 9 in the rankings.

A matchup with No. 5 ranked Josh Emmett followed the Mitchell win. Topuria picked up a decision in a ""Fight of the Night"" scrap. Topuria's next fight, saw him face Alexander Volkanovski for the UFC featherweight title at UFC 298. Topuria entered that bout as the No. 3 ranked featherweight. He left as the champion after knocking out Volkanovski in the second stanza. Topuria claimed another ""Performance of the Night"" bonus for that win.

Holloway (26-7) has been with the UFC since 2012. If there's a stat that the UFC tracks, chances are Holloway is among the leaders. He holds the UFC featherweight record for wins (20), finishes (11), knockouts (nine), win streak (13 straight), fight night bonuses (10), total fight time (6:47:23), significant strikes landed (2,892), and total strikes landed (3,096).

Holloway's run as UFC featherweight champ began in June 2017 when he knocked out Jose Aldo. Holloway entered that contest as the interim champ, a belt he won by knocking out Anthony Pettis in December 2016. He defended his title against Aldo (TKO), Brian Ortega (TKO), and Frankie Edgar (decision). He also attempted to win the interim UFC lightweight belt during that run, but he fell short, dropping a decision to Dustin Poirier.

Holloway's championship run ended in December 2019 when Alexander Volkanovski beat him by decision. Volkanovski retained the title in an immediate rematch.

Wins over Calvin Kattar and Yair Rodriguez earned Holloway another shot at Volkanovski and his title in July 2022, but the champ retained his belt with a decision win.

Since that setback, Holloway has wins over Arnold Allen, the Korean Zombie, and Justin Gaethje. The Gaethje victory, a fight in the running for ""Fight of the Year"" and ""Knockout of the Year,"" earned Holloway the BMF title. That fight took place at 155 pounds in April. Holloway has not competed since he picked up that memorable victory.

Holloway is the No. 2 fighter in the official UFC featherweight rankings, where he trails Volkanovski.

Whittaker (26-7) is the No. 3 fighter in the official UFC middleweight rankings, while Chimaev (13-0) is the No. 12 fighter in the UFC's 185-pound division.

With Alex Pereira's successful title defense over Khalil Rountree Jr. at UFC 307, the winner of the Ankalaev vs. Rakic fight could be next in line for a shot at Pereira's belt. Ankalaev (18-1-1-1) is the No. 2 ranked UFC light heavyweight, while Rakic (14-4) is ranked at No. 5.

Below we look at the early odds for the entire UFC 308 fight card.

"CD Rates Today: October 8, 2024 -- Earn 5% Or More",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/cds/cd-rates-today-10-08-24/,2024-10-08T10:58:55Z,"CD ladders let you leverage high rates without locking up all of your money long-term.

As of today, the best interest rates on CDs -- certificates of deposit -- pay up to 5.37%, based on certificate term lengths. Here's an overview of how CD rates are changing, followed by a guide to the current top CD rates across different terms.

Related: Compare the Best CD Rates

A CD is a savings account with a fixed interest rate and a maturity period, which is what makes them time deposit accounts. When you open a CD, you agree to lock up your deposit without touching it until the CD's term is up, whether that's in six months or five years. Your patience is rewarded with interest that's usually better than what you'd earn from a regular savings account.

Withdraw money from a CD before ""maturity"" -- when it reaches the end of its term -- and you can be slapped with stiff penalties. For example, you can lose up to six months' worth of interest if you make an early withdrawal from a one-year CD.

The longer the term, the harsher the early withdrawal penalty. It's not unusual to lose one full year's worth of interest or more if you break open a five-year CD too soon. Be absolutely certain you understand the penalty before you make your investment.

For short-term savings goals, three-month CDs might make sense. The current average rate on a three-month CD sits at 1.32%, but the highest rate is 5.30%. Last week, three-month CDs were earning 1.33% on average.

If you're interested in a shorter-term CD, today's best six-month CD rate is 5.25%. That compares with 5.25% a week ago. The current average APY for a six-month CD is 1.86%, compared to 1.84% last week at this time.

APY provides a more accurate view of the annual interest you'll earn with a CD because it takes into account compound interest. That's the interest you earn not only on your deposit (or principal) but also on the interest in the account.

The highest interest rate currently being offered on a 12-month CD -- one of the most popular CD terms -- is 5.37%. If you find a 12-month CD with a rate in that vicinity, you're getting a good deal. One week ago, the best rate was the same.

The average APY, or annual percentage yield, on a one-year CD is now 1.88%, down from 1.90% a week ago.

If you can hold out for two years, 24-month CDs today are being offered at interest rates as high as 4.76%. The top rate last week at this time was a similar 4.76%. Two-year CDs now have an average APY of 1.65%. That's a fall from 1.66% last week at this time.

CDs with longer terms tend to have some of the most attractive interest rates and APYs -- if you're willing to keep your money locked up for years.

Today's highest rate on a three-year CD is 4.65%, so you'll want to shop around for that rate or something near it. Last week at this time, the best rate on a three-year CD was also 4.65%.

On a five-year CD, the highest rate today is 4.31%, the same as one week ago. APYs are averaging 1.58%, down from 1.59% at this time last week.

The longer the term, the harsher the early withdrawal penalty. It's not unusual to lose one full year's worth of interest or more if you break open a five-year CD too soon. Be absolutely certain you understand the penalty before you make your investment.

The best rate on today's jumbo CDs is 5.26% for a 6-month term. The average APY for this category of CD is currently 1.91%, compared to 1.79% last week.

Most jumbo CDs require a minimum deposit of $100,000 -- and some even require $250,000. However, there's no universally agreed-upon definition regarding what qualifies as a ""jumbo"" CD. Some banks and credit unions slap the label ""jumbo"" on CDs you can open with $50,000, $25,000 or even less.

CDs typically pay higher interest than other savings vehicles, even the best high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts. And while they may not offer the kind of enviable returns that are possible with stocks, CDs beat the more attention-getting investments in one regard: They're one of the safest places to put your money.

Investors lost millions in the 2022 crypto crash, and putting your money into the stock market, real estate or gold and other commodities can be risky, too. But when you buy a certificate of deposit or credit union share certificate from a federally insured financial institution, you can sleep easily with the knowledge that your investment is protected.

The FDIC provides you with up to $250,000 in coverage in the event the bank issuing your CD ever fails. For share certificates purchased from federal credit unions and most state-chartered credit unions, the NCUA insures your money up to the same limit.

Related: CD Interest Rates Forecast: How Good Will They Get?

CD rates are rarely the exact same between any two banks, so you should comparison shop when looking for a new account. You may decide to stick with your current bank because it's convenient or join a new bank to take advantage of higher rates. To find the right CD, look at the specific term you're interested in with a few different banks.

Traditional, brick-and-mortar banks tend to offer lower CD rates, in general, than online banks without any branches. For example, Chase Bank CD rates currently range from 0.01% to 4.75% while Discover Bank CD Rates currently range from 2.00% to 4.10%, Bank of America CD Rates currently range from 0.03% to 4.00% and Marcus By Goldman Sachs CD Rates currently range from 3.75% to 4.30%.

Other top CD rates by banks include:

Curinos determines the average rates for certificates of deposit (CDs) by focusing on specific CDs and excluding others. Certain types, such as promotional offers, relationship-based rates, private, youth, senior, student/minor, affinity, bump-up, no-penalty, callable, variable, step-up, auto transfer, club, gifts, grandfathered, internet-only and IRA CDs are not considered in the calculation."
"Mortgage Rates Today: October 8, 2024 -- Rates Move Up",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-10-08-24/,2024-10-08T10:58:49Z,"Currently, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.94%, compared to 6.65% a week ago, according to Curinos.

For borrowers who want to pay off their home faster, the average rate on a 15-year fixed mortgage is 6.07%, up 0.35 percentage point from the previous week.

If you're thinking about refinancing to lock in a lower rate, compare your existing mortgage rate with current market rates to make sure it's worth the cost to refinance.

Borrowers paid an average rate of 6.94% on a 30-year mortgage. This was up from the previous week's rate of 6.65%.

Currently, the average annual percentage rate (APR) on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.96%. This is higher than last week when the APR was 6.67%. The APR contains both mortgage interest and the lender fees to help give a more complete picture of loan costs.

To get an idea of how much you'll pay: a $100,000 mortgage with a 30-year fixed-rate loan at the current average interest rate of 6.94% will cost you about $662 including principal and interest (taxes and fees not included) each month, the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. That's around $138,156 in total interest over the life of the loan.

Today, the 15-year mortgage rate sits at 6.07%, higher than it was yesterday. Last week, it was 5.72%.

The APR on a 15-year fixed is 6.10%. It was 5.75% this time last week.

With an interest rate of 6.07%, you would pay $848 per month in principal and interest for every $100,000 borrowed. Over the life of the loan, you would pay $52,556 in total interest.

The current average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage is 6.98% -- 0.29 percentage point up from last week. The 30-year jumbo mortgage rate had a 52-week APR low of 5.50% and a 52-week high of 10.50%.

A 30-year jumbo mortgage at today's fixed interest rate of 6.98% will cost you $664 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. On a $750,000 jumbo mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment would be approximately $4,982.

Get to know your budget before you look for a house. This will give you an idea of the type of house you can afford. A good place to start is by using a mortgage calculator to get a rough estimate.

Simply input the following information:

APR, or annual percentage rate, is a calculation that includes both a loan's interest rate and a loan's finance charges, expressed as an annual cost over the life of the loan. In other words, it's the total cost of credit. APR accounts for interest, fees and time.

Since APRs include both the interest rate and certain fees associated with a home loan, the APR can help you understand the total cost of a mortgage if you keep it for the entire term. The APR will usually be higher than the interest rate, but there are exceptions.

Mortgage interest rates are determined by several factors, including some that borrowers can't control:

While the above factors set the base interest rate for new mortgages, there are several areas that borrowers can focus on to get a lower rate:

As you compare lenders, consider getting rate quotes for several loan programs. In addition to comparing rates and fees, these programs can have flexible down payment and credit requirements that make qualifying easier.

Conventional mortgages are likely to offer competitive rates when you have a credit score between 670 and 850, although it's possible to qualify with a minimum score of 620. This home loan type also doesn't require annual fees when you have at least 20% equity and waive PMI.

Several government-backed programs are better when you want to make little or no down payment:"

The current 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage refinance rate is averaging 7.12%, according to Curinos, while 15-year, fixed-rate refinance mortgages average of 6.11%. For 20-year mortgage refinances, the average rate is 6.97%.

Today, the average rate for the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage refinance rose to 7.12% from yesterday. At this time last week, the 30-year fixed was 6.80%.

The 30-year fixed mortgage refi APR (annual percentage rate) is 7.14%. At this time last week, it was 6.82%. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

At the current interest rate of 7.12%, homebuyers with a 30-year fixed-rate refinance mortgage of $100,000 will pay $673 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included), the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. In total interest, you'd pay $142,417 over the life of the loan.

The average interest rate on the 20-year fixed refinance mortgage is 6.97%. Last week, the 20-year fixed-rate mortgage was at 6.61%.

The APR on a 20-year fixed is 7.00%. One week ago, it was 6.63%.

A 20-year fixed-rate mortgage refinance of $100,000 with today's interest rate of 6.97% will cost $774 per month in principal and interest. Taxes and fees are not included. Over the life of the loan, you would pay around $85,683 in total interest.

The average interest rate on the 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage refinance is 6.98%. Last week, the average rate was 6.73%.

Borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage refinance with today's interest rate of 6.98% will pay $664 per month in principal and interest per $100,000.

A 15-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage refinance has an average interest rate of 6.30%, compared to an average of 6.31% last week.

At today's rate of 6.30%, a borrower would pay $860 per month in principal and interest per $100,000 for a 15-year, fixed-rate jumbo refi. Over the life of the loan, that borrower would pay around $411,203 in total interest.

Refinance rates are different from mortgage rates and tend to be slightly higher. The rate difference can vary by program and is something to consider as you compare the best mortgage refinance lenders.

In addition to having different refinance rates for conventional, FHA, VA and jumbo applications, cash-out refinance rates are higher as you're borrowing from your available equity.

Rates for government-backed loan programs such as FHA and VA mortgage refinances can be lower than a conventional or jumbo refinance, as there is less risk for lenders. Still, you should compare your estimated loan's annual percentage rate (APR), which includes all additional fees and determines the interest charges.

Refinancing your mortgage can be a wise move for many reasons, most notably lowering your interest rate or your monthly payments. It can also help you pay down your mortgage sooner, access your home's equity or get rid of private mortgage insurance (PMI).

But there are closing costs associated with refinancing, so it probably makes more sense to refinance if you know you'll be keeping your home for some time. You can determine the ""break-even point"" for a potential refinance, or how long it will take for savings from a new mortgage to surpass any closing costs. Find out what those costs will be and divide them by the monthly savings you'll realize with the new mortgage.

The Forbes Advisor mortgage refinance calculator can help you run the numbers to see if it's a good time for you to refinance.

Consider refinancing your mortgage when you need a more affordable monthly payment, want to stop paying annual FHA or USDA loan fees or would prefer a fixed interest rate. You may also consider a cash-out refinance to borrow from your home equity.

However, as refinance rates have increased by several percentage points from near-term lows in late 2021, it can be harder to replace your existing interest rate with a lower one, unless you refinance to a 15-year mortgage. As a result, extending your loan term is the one way to reduce your payment, but you can end up paying more total interest.

The application process is similar to buying a home. Plus, home appraisal fees and closing costs from 2% to 6% of the loan amount apply and add to your lifetime borrowing costs.

Refinancing a mortgage isn't that different than taking out a mortgage in the first place, and it's always smart to have a strategy for finding the lowest rate possible. Here are some suggested approaches to get the best rate:

Having a strong credit score is one of the best things you can do to get approved and get a lower rate. You're also likely to look better to lenders if you don't have too much debt relative to your income. You should keep a regular watch on mortgage rates, which fluctuate often. Also see if you can manage a mortgage payment for a shorter loan term since they usually have lower interest rates."
"Today's Top Money Market Account Rates For October 8, 2024  --  Rates Move Downward",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/money-market-account/money-market-rates-today-10-08-24/,2024-10-08T10:58:39Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Right now, the average money market rate sits at 0.59%, but the best rate today is 5.07%.

Here are today's money market account rates:

Source: Curinos. Data accurate as of October 7, 2024. Rates are based on a $10,000 minimum deposit amount.

Interest rates for money market savings accounts are often called money market rates. These earnings are typically credited as a percentage of your savings balance on a daily or monthly basis. Money market rates change every day. Banks and credit unions that pay tiered rates often reserve the best rates for the largest balances.

An interest rate represents the earnings made solely on your account balance. A yearly rate of return that factors in compound interest is called your annual percentage yield (APY). Compound interest is interest that accrues on the interest as you earn it.

A money market account (MMA) is a type of interest-bearing deposit account offered by banks and credit unions. MMAs at banks are insured by the FDIC, while MMAs at credit unions are insured by the NCUA. In both cases, depositors are covered for up to $250,000 per account type, protecting your money in the event of bank failure. Money market accounts work like other savings accounts in that you deposit money freely and earn interest on your balance. You can take out funds whenever you need to, but you may be restricted to six transactions per statement period.

Money market accounts typically pay higher interest rates than other deposit accounts, including traditional savings accounts. And unlike typical savings accounts, they usually offer debit cards, check-writing capabilities or both, providing convenient access to cash. Money market accounts often have higher deposit and balance requirements than many bank accounts.

To open a money market account, start by researching accounts to choose the option with the best rates for the amount you plan to save. Make sure you can meet opening and ongoing balance requirements to earn interest and avoid fees. In addition to rates and minimums, consider account fees, withdrawal limits and other features to find the best fit.

When you're ready to open an account, you can submit an application online or at a bank branch. The application will ask for personal information, including your name, address, Social Security number, employment status and income. You'll also need to provide a government-issued ID. Once your application is approved, you can make your first deposit. Be sure to transfer at least the minimum opening deposit required.

Money market accounts resemble checking accounts in some ways but are most similar to savings accounts. Like savings accounts, you earn interest on your balance and can add or remove funds at any time. Your balance is insured and easily accessible in either type of account. Both savings and money market accounts may have monthly fees, balance requirements and transaction limits, but money market accounts tend to have higher fees and minimums.

Money market accounts are usually more flexible than savings accounts because they may offer debit cards and check-writing capabilities. This makes them a little like checking accounts, but unlike checking accounts, money market accounts often limit monthly transactions.

A money market account is worth it if you're looking for a safe place to keep some cash while earning interest. These are FDIC- or NCUA-insured accounts that provide convenient options for accessing your money and higher interest rates than many other deposit accounts offer. If you can meet the initial deposit requirements to open an account and maintain balance requirements to earn the best rates, a money market account may make sense for you.

But a money market account may not be worth it if you will end up paying more in fees than you earn in interest or if minimum balance requirements and transaction restrictions cause you unnecessary stress. If you need an account for everyday use, consider an interest checking account. For lower minimums, you might have better luck with a savings account."

Last week, rates on personal loans moved lower. This means if you're in the market for a personal loan, whether to finance a project or major purchase, you can grab a worthwhile interest rate, so long as you're a qualified borrower.

For borrowers with a credit score of 720 or higher who prequalified on Credible.com's personal loan marketplace, the average interest rate on a three-year personal loan was 15.22% from September 30 to October 5. According to Credible.com, that's a 0.72% drop from the previous week. The average rate on a five-year personal loan fell 0.20% last week to 22.06% from 22.26%.

The most qualified borrowers generally receive the best rates. In fact, well-qualified borrowers may receive a rate that's significantly lower than average. The rate you receive depends on a number of factors, including your creditworthiness and the loans available through your chosen lender.

Two quick ways to help you receive more favorable rates include paying down existing debt to help lower your DTI and improving your credit score. The interest rate your receive on a personal loan is based on a number of factors. This includes your overall creditworthiness, credit score, income and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.

While qualification requirements differ across lenders, a minimum credit score of 720 will typically yield you the best terms. If your score falls below this marker, and you're on a quest for the lowest rate possible, you can take action to improve your score. Try strategies like lowering your credit utilization ratio, removing errors from your credit report and paying your bills early or on time.

You can find a personal loan either online or in-person, depending on the institution. With varying lenders offering personal loans, you can find one that works best for you. Lenders offering personal loans include:"

Rates on 10-year fixed-rate private student loans rose last week. Despite the rise, if you're interested in getting a private student loan, you can still get a relatively low rate.

For borrowers with a credit score of 720 or higher who prequalified on Credible.com's student loan marketplace from September 30 to October 5, the average fixed interest rate on a 10-year private student loan was 8.43%. On a five-year variable-rate loan, the rate was 11.91%, according to Credible.com.

The average fixed rate on 10-year loans last week climbed by 0.24% to 8.43%. The week prior, the average stood at 8.19%.

Borrowers currently in the market for a private student loan will receive a higher rate than they would have at this time last year. At this time last year, the average fixed rate on a 10-year loan was 7.96%, 0.47% lower than today's rate.

If you were to finance $20,000 in student loans at today's average fixed rate, you'd pay around $247 per month and approximately $9,667 in total interest over 10 years, according to Forbes Advisor's student loan calculator.

In contrast to fixed rates, variable interest rates fluctuate over the course of a loan term. Variable rates may start lower than fixed rates, especially during periods when rates are low overall, but they can rise over time.

Private lenders often offer borrowers the option to choose between fixed and variable interest rates. Fixed rates may be the safer bet for the average student, but if your income is stable and you plan to pay off your loan quickly, it could be beneficial to choose a variable loan.

Financing a $20,000 five-year private loan at 11.91% would yield a monthly payment of approximately $444. A borrower would pay $6,639 in total interest over the life of the loan. Keep in mind that since the interest rate is variable, it could change monthly.

Rates on savings accounts are decreasing. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can put some money aside? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are known for paying teensy interest rates. But it's easy to find rates 10x higher if you know where to look. For instance, online banks and credit unions often pay much higher rates than brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you spot a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.23%, Curinos says. APY, or annual percentage yield, reflects the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts typically pay substantially higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the catch is you may have to jump through some hoops for the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.89%. You'll be in good shape if you can get an account offering a rate close to 4.89%. Last week at this time, the best rate was 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's about the same as last week's APY.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
"Opinion | Biden pledged to restore order as president. In the Middle East, he's failing.",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-iran-war-biden-hezbollah-election-rcna174262,2024-10-08T10:47:49Z,"The president's poor leadership has brought us closer to a regional war that could cause enormous suffering and hurt his own party.

One of Joe Biden's promises in his 2020 presidential campaign was that he would restore strong U.S. leadership abroad and rein in the chaos that Donald Trump had unleashed in the international order.

But if you take a look at the Middle East right now, Biden hasn't done a very good job of fulfilling that pledge.

Under Biden's watch, the Middle East is growing less stable. In the past few weeks, Israel has begun a new war with its invasion of Lebanon, against the public wishes of the Biden administration. Iran has fired around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, the second time it has ever launched such a direct assault on Israel from its own land. Israel has since promised it will retaliate against Iran -- and that if the tit-for-tat continues for an additional round, strikes on Iran's nuclear sites are on the table. Meanwhile Israel's war in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks continues to rage with no end in sight. As a result of the instability, the price of oil is rising, and attacks on oil production in the region could cause it to surge more.

In other words, the Middle East is slowly inching toward breaking out into a full-scale regional war that could shake up the global economy, create a gigantic crisis in U.S. foreign policy and result in the deaths of countless civilians.

This is not good news for the Democrats as Election Day approaches: Just the rumblings of an imminent crisis or potentially surging gas prices could hurt the electoral appeal of Democrats, who are already suffering from their association with inflation.

The growing specter of wide-scale war in the Middle East is not some kind of approaching weather event or natural disaster. It is the product of choices. And our president has made some terrible ones that helped us get to this point. After Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, it was inevitable that Israel was going to retaliate. What was not inevitable was that the Biden administration would give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a far-right leader with neocolonial extremists in his Cabinet, carte blanche to retaliate against the entire population of the Gaza Strip however he wished to.

The Biden administration has appeared to use leaks and statements to suggest that it believes Netanyahu has gone too far in his brutality toward the civilians of Gaza, but in practice it has greenlighted all of Israel's actions. The Biden administration has been a staunch defender of Israel at the United Nations, shielding it from legally binding Security Council resolutions. It has given Israel billions in military aid. Aside from a brief, temporary and ultimately symbolic pause in arms transfers, Biden has not threatened to cut off aid, or even condition aid on Israel's compliance with international or U.S. law. The Biden administration, to keep weapons shipments intact under U.S. law, has reportedly ignored findings from the State Department and USAID that Israel had blocked U.S. humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Netanyahu's takeaway from Biden's support is that he can take U.S. backing as unconditional and do whatever he wants not only toward Palestinian civilians, but in the region more broadly. Netanyahu has embraced a ""shoot first, notify Biden later"" attitude toward many high-stakes and escalatory actions against adversaries in the Middle East, such as when Israel struck the Syrian headquarters of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, or when Israel leveled several buildings in Beirut in a bombing that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's operations in Lebanon -- against Biden's public wishes -- have already displaced close to a quarter of Lebanon's population and killed hundreds of civilians, according to PBS' NewsHour. And Netanyahu has demonstrated he feels no obligation to listen to U.S. calls to wind down the bloody military operation in Gaza, which is why Israel and Hezbollah have locked horns in the last year.

As Atlantic Council fellow Nicholas Blanford explained to me, Israel's escalation with its adversaries in the region increases the likelihood of a regional war. If, for example, Israel decides to entrench itself in a more wide-scale war in Lebanon, it could nudge Hezbollah to unleash its most destructive firepower, such as its precision-guided missiles that it has so far refrained from using. And if Iran were to fear that Israel is about to wipe out Hezbollah at some point, it could ""activate all [its] proxies across the region"" against Israel, dragging several other countries directly into the conflict.

We don't know exactly how Netanyahu would act if Biden were to condition or cut off aid to Israel. But given that U.S. military support is vital to Israel's national security and military operations, Netanyahu would be far more likely to behave conservatively in his military campaigns and targeted strikes across the region.

Netanyahu is aware that the timing of his more aggressive maneuvering comes at an acutely sensitive time for Biden politically. Biden is likely in the weeks before Election Day to be particularly hesitant to initiate an upheaval in U.S.-Israeli relations by cutting off weapons shipments or demanding that Netanyahu act like more of a cooperative U.S. ally. But at the same time Biden looks rudderless and weak by not doing anything.

When asked at a press conference Friday if he believed Netanyahu was trying to influence the U.S. election, Biden said, ""I don't know."" And when asked by another reporter, ""How long are you OK with Israel bombing Lebanon? What is acceptable to you?"" he smiled and walked away from the podium.

Biden has gotten himself into this bind through his record of unconditional support for Israel, no matter how badly it deviates from basic morality in warfare, international law or U.S. interests. One can't help but wonder if Biden's poor leadership in the Middle East might just mark a historic first: a president inadvertently springing an October surprise on his own party."
DeSantis administration warns local TV stations to remove ads about abortion ballot measure,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/desantis-abortion-rights-florida-amendment-4-caroline-ad-rcna174387,2024-10-08T10:47:32Z,"The Republican administration is pressuring Florida stations to take down an ad that promotes a ""yes"" vote on Amendment 4, which would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration had already tried to put its thumb on the scale against Amendment 4, a statewide measure that could enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. And now the admin has added to that disturbing trend.

Florida's six-week abortion ban is one of the strictest in the country. The DeSantis administration recently had its election police unit investigate people who had signed a petition to get Amendment 4 on the ballot. Then the administration used taxpayer money to launch an anti-abortion website. The administration also used state money to air Orwellian television ads proclaiming that ""Florida cares about women and families.""

Now the DeSantis administration appears to be trying to intimidate people who have run an ad that promotes a ""yes"" vote on Amendment 4.

""The doctors knew if I did not end my pregnancy, I would lose my baby, I would lose my life, and my daughter would lose her mom,"" a woman says in the ad, titled ""Caroline.""

""Florida has now banned abortion even in cases like mine,"" she says.

Investigative journalist Jason Garcia published a letter from the Florida Department of Health's general counsel to the general manager of WFLA-TV, the NBC affiliate in the Tampa Bay area. The letter, dated Oct. 3, argues that the ad contains a ""categorically false"" claim about abortion in Florida -- and warns that the ad is in violation of state law.

""The advertisement is not only false; it is dangerous,"" the letter reads. ""Women faced with pregnancy complications posing a serious risk of death or substantial or irreversible physical impairment may and should seek medical treatment in Florida.""

In practice, Florida's law hasn't been so clear. Even though the law includes exceptions for rape and incest in certain cases, the law has confused doctors and caused a chilling effect among providers. The problem has been so glaring that the DeSantis administration has threatened doctors who don't provide emergency care in these confusing scenarios, which are only occurring because of the law Republicans put in place.

In another letter Garcia posted online, lawyers for the group sponsoring Amendment 4 defended the ad as true and urged a Florida TV station to continue carrying it.

The Florida Department of Health's letter ""is a flagrant abuse of power and must be rejected,"" the lawyers wrote.

The DeSantis administration sure seems like it's attempting to hide the dangerous impacts of Florida's abortion laws from public view."
The Supreme Court approved deadly bump stocks. Now it's considering 'ghost guns.',MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ghost-guns-arguments-bump-stocks-rcna174315,2024-10-08T10:47:28Z,"On Tuesday, the justices will hear arguments about whether federal law regulating firearms can apply to kits for making untraceable weapons at home.

Supreme Court justices will consider on Tuesday whether the government can regulate so-called ghost gun kits for making untraceable weapons at home. Perhaps surprisingly, the dispute could be understood through an analogy to Ikea furniture.

That might sound strange if you aren't familiar with the case, called Garland v. VanDerStok. But here's how it arises in the dispute being argued during the first week of the court's new term.

The appeal stems from a challenge to a 2022 rule from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Through that rule, the government defends regulating the kits and parts as ""firearms"" by telling the justices in a brief: ""If a State placed a tax on the sale of tables, chairs, couches, and bookshelves, IKEA could not avoid paying by insisting that it does not sell any of those items and instead sells 'furniture parts kits' that must be assembled by the purchaser.""

The same goes for guns, the government filing went on: ""A company in the business of selling kits that can be assembled into working firearms in minutes -- and that are designed, marketed, and used for that express purpose -- is in the business of selling firearms."" The brief noted that federal law's firearm definition includes not only an already functioning weapon but also one that ""may readily be converted"" to function.

Taking issue with the furniture analogy, the challengers argued in their brief that a better comparison would be to ""a box containing shelves and, instead of a frame to hold them, planks of wood that had to be cut to length and drilled to do so.""

To be clear, the ATF rule doesn't ban ghost guns. It requires traceable serial numbers, licensed dealers and background checks -- just as the law does for regular guns. Among the parties backing the government's regulation are cities, states, prosecutors, gun safety groups and the American Medical Association. On the other side are the National Rifle Association and other pro-gun groups and companies.

And though it's gun-related, this isn't a Second Amendment case. It's more like last term's appeal in Garland v. Cargill, in which the court struck down the bump stock ban. The 6-3 majority said there that the ATF went too far in trying to regulate the deadly devices -- which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire at almost the same frequency as automatic ones -- under federal law. The same dynamic is at play here, with gun proponents arguing that the agency sought to wield power that Congress never gave it.

But despite the seeming similarity between the two disputes, the ghost gun appeal won't necessarily end the same way.

In addition to the ghost gun regulation's not being a ban, the high court has already split 5-4 during earlier litigation in favor of the government. Last year, the justices temporarily reinstated the rule, which had been blocked in the lower court. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh dissented, leaving Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the majority alongside the court's three Democratic appointees.

To be sure, the justices' temporary votes don't bind their final ruling. The court could still ultimately decide against the government. To get a sense of whether that will happen, Roberts and Barrett could be two key justices worth listening to at Tuesday's hearing. Of course, that's true in many cases these days, given that they (along with Kavanaugh) can sit in the relative middle of the court, holding deciding votes, depending on the case.

The court livestreams audio (not video) of its hearings, with this one set to start at 10 a.m. ET. In a sign of the case's importance to the government, it will be argued by its top Supreme Court lawyer, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar.

The justices usually issue the term's decisions by late June. If the court is still as divided as it was during the earlier litigation -- and Tuesday's hearing may provide some insight into whether it is -- then we might not learn the result until closer to then."
Opinion | The GOP is feeling the stress of Trump's anti-early voting stance,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-early-voting-election-day-rcna174284,2024-10-08T10:47:23Z,"Between disparaging early voting and cutting get-out-the-vote efforts, Donald Trump is making it harder to pull out a win in November.

The polls still show Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in a close race both nationally and in most swing states. With the results likely falling on a knife's edge, the deciding factor may well be which side is best able to drive voters to the polls. But if that's the case, Republicans are acting at a disadvantage that can only be ascribed to Trump himself.

Modern elections are more of an ""election month"" in many states, with early voting and mail-in ballots offering opportunities to cast votes long before Election Day. This was previously a nonpartisan issue, but things have been thrown into disarray for Republicans since Trump's 2020 re-election campaign. Democratic-led states in particular had moved to set up more ballot drop boxes, pre-emptively send out mail-in ballot request forms and otherwise help people vote safely in the middle of a pandemic.

Naturally, Trump quickly began falsely claiming that mail-in voting leads to mass voter fraud, a claim that formed the backbone of his attempts to overturn his loss that year and soured many of his supporters on early voting. No such mass fraud has ever been discovered, but that hasn't stopped Trump from periodically returning to the matter. There are times when he's managed to stop promoting conspiracy theories long enough to praise early voting -- but he always returns to old habits soon enough. Just two weeks ago, he told a crowd in Pennsylvania, a state he needs to win, that early voting is ""stupid.""

Republicans have begun to realize how much Trump's rhetoric is impeding their efforts to stockpile votes before polls open next month. ""The whole idea behind absentee voting is you're banking that vote, you've got that person, you know they're going to vote for you, you get them off the list,"" Republican strategist Mark Graul recently told Politico. ""This is how you get the extra 5,000, 10,000 votes that may decide the election.""

Rather than heed that advice, the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have focused on Election Day. An increased reliance on day-of turnout would be a risk any year, but especially given how Trump has bound the RNC's hands ahead of this election. Upon becoming the nominee this year, Trump decreed that the GOP should invest less in traditional get-out-the-vote efforts in favor of more ""election integrity"" programs.

The resulting cuts have led to outsourcing most turnout programs to outside groups, taking advantage of newly revised Federal Election Commission rules that allow increased cooperation between campaigns and super PACs. Those outside groups haven't exactly been impressive in their efforts, leading some battleground Republicans to question how effective they'll actually prove at getting people to the polls. For example, Turning Point USA, the group run by conservative activist Charlie Kirk, has told Semafor that its lofty goals for voter outreach had been narrowed to mostly focus on Arizona and Wisconsin.

The Elon Musk-backed group America PAC has shown the most promise so far, hiring veteran GOP operatives and spending more than $50 million on voter engagement this cycle. That money has gone into hiring hundreds of canvassers in swing states like Michigan and North Carolina. America PAC also on Monday put even more of Musk's money on the table, promising $47 for each registered voter recruited to sign a petition pledging support for the First and Second amendments, building out the group's engagement lists.

The Trump campaign, for its part, points to the unpaid ""Trump 47 Captains"" it's recruiting to prove it isn't fully giving up the GOTV game. ""Each volunteer initially receives a list of 10 neighbors to mobilize,"" The Guardian's Hugo Lowell wrote about the program, which offers campaign merchandise to those who hit their goals. ""If they meet that target, the next tier involves canvassing 24 out of 50 likely Trump voters, followed by canvassing 45 out of 100 voters, with new perks at each tier."" (If that sounds like the same framework as a multilevel marketing scam to you, don't worry, I'm right there with you.)

It's an idea also being pushed on a website called 10xVotes, which encourages conservatives to ""find 10 friends who don't vote."" The site, which is available in a few swing states, including Michigan and Arizona, appears to draw from voting records to allow users to search for registered Republicans nearby to ""claim"" for contact. It's unclear who exactly owns 10xVotes, which has been pushed by the likes of former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's ""War Room"" podcast.

The Trump campaign appears to be working off a theory wherein if it can't win over the swing voters that Harris is also courting, it can draw out the sort of ""low propensity voters"" who propelled him to office in 2016 -- for example, the cringeworthy push to court young, white males, the kind who feel disaffected but love the hypermasculinity offered on right-wing podcasts and in the MMA ring. One major issue with that strategy: These are also exactly the voters who can't be counted on to turn out on Election Day without frequent contact.

Taken together, Republican operatives aren't feeling especially confident about the ground game that's in place in key states. As National Review's Noah Rothman has noted, the efforts are looking more like 2012 GOP candidate Mitt Romney's doomed initiative than President Barack Obama's dominant GOTV program that year. Other candidates might be thinking about shifting where their funds are going to offset those worries.

Not Trump, though, not when he's ready to blame a failure to win enough votes on what Axios described as a ""detailed catalog of excuses for rejecting the results of the 2024 election -- if he loses."" The guarantee that this will be his response to a loss helps explain his overall nonchalance about getting people to their polling places. After all, it's much easier (and cheaper) to try to throw out Democratic votes than bother paying people to knock on doors."
Michael Moore mocks Democrats panicked by tight 2024 race: 'Shocking to me' they believe Trump is going to win,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-moore-mocks-democrats-panicked-tight-2024-race-shocking-me-believe-trump-going-win,2024-10-08T10:44:31Z,"Liberal filmmaker and activist Michael Moore mocked Democrats worrying about the tight 2024 race, saying he found it hard to believe former President Trump could win election.

Liberal filmmaker and activist Michael Moore knocked Democrats who are panicking over the tight 2024 presidential race, admitting he's stunned that people on the left believe former President Trump could win the election.

""Democrats, they're such a frightened group of people,"" Moore said during a Monday interview on CNN. ""I mean, they still think that Trump is going to win.""

""This is kind of shocking to me. Like, don't you live with people? Are you not aware that there's going to be a tsunami of women voting between now and Election Day?"" he said, referring to backlash over the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.

""Anybody who thinks women are going to stay home, that women are going to stay home -- Do you not know any women? Do you not live with a woman?"" Moore continued.

MICHAEL MOORE WARNS KAMALA HARRIS TO NOT GO 'CENTRIST'

CNN anchor Brianna Keilar asked Moore if he believed polling which shows the race is close.

According to the latest national Fox News poll from September, Harris currently holds a two-point edge over Trump with voters.

""I don't think it's a dead heat,"" Moore responded. He clarified that while he wasn't outright dismissing polling, he had more faith in surveys that questioned voters on the issues, rather than the candidates.

He pointed to polling misses from the 2016 campaign, such as when The New York Times predicted on Election Day, 2016, that Hillary Clinton had an 85% chance at winning the presidential election.

""No, I don't think people should be running their lives based on these polls,"" he said.

BLUE PHILLY WORKING-CLASS VOTERS START LEANING TOWARD TRUMP AHEAD OF THE ELECTION: 'PEOPLE ACTUALLY LOVE HIM'

Moore ripped Democrats pushing Harris to the center because of these concerns, arguing that the VP's progressive policy positions on abortion, the environment, guns and jobs are actually in the mainstream.

""You mentioned Democrats who want [Harris] to 'tone it down,'"" Moore continued. ""That's something women have been told for decades.""

""The reason she's so progressive -- because she believes in a woman's right to choose, she believes a 14-year-old shouldn't take an assault rifle to school....you go down all her positions and they line up exactly with where the majority of Americans are at,"" he continued.

""The majority of Americans believe climate change is real. The majority of Americans believe the minimum wage is too low. Just go down the list,"" Moore argued.

""The majority of Americans want regulation. They want people to be making sure that, when you have a hurricane and only 1% of the people have flood insurance -- That's not the country I live in. That's not the country I'm going to live in, where people now are suffering because of this,"" he said, referring to devastation from Hurricane Helene.

Last week, Moore warned Harris to not ""move to the center"" or it could backfire for Democrats.

""If Harris is advised by her wealthy donors to shun the left and drop her more progressive positions in favor of a 'move to the center,'"" Moore warned in a post on Substack, that could ""reduce or depress the vote."""

Buyer Beware: These Yield-Gushing Oil Bonds Could Derail Your Retirement,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2024/10/08/buyer-beware-these-yield-gushing-oil-bonds-could-derail-your-retirement/,2024-10-08T10:40:24Z,"Thanks to the JOBS Act, an opportunistic Long Island brokerage firm and a barrage of enticing webinars, Denver's Phoenix Capital has sold $700 million of bonds yielding as much as 13%.

f Warren Buffett and half of the sharp guys on Wall Street invested over $300 billion last year into domestic oil and gas, suffice to say, it ain't going anywhere."" The speaker is Matt Willer, head of Capital Markets for Phoenix Capital Group, and he is leading a webinar entitled ""Investing In Domestic Energy"" being broadcast to some 300 investors from his office in Denver, Colorado. Behind him, through the window, you can see the Denver Tech Center sprawling across the mile high city's far flung Hampden South neighborhood. Willer is assuring his audience that the unsecured, private placement bonds he is selling, with yields from 9% to 13% and backed by mineral rights to oil wells in places like Wyoming's Powder River Basin and Uintah, Utah, are money good. ""Mailbox money,"" says Willer.

Willer works for an enterprising petroleum engineer turned financier named Adam Ferrari who founded his Phoenix Capital Group in 2019. Phoenix says it's an oil and gas company, specializing in acquiring mineral rights and drilling independently, but its core competency seems to be raising funds from yield hungry investors. Mostly through advertising run on conservative radio shows like Hannity and webinars which it holds daily, Ferrari reports that Phoenix has so far raised $700 million of a planned $750 million private high yield bond offering. Some 95% of its sales, Willer says, are to people above the age of 55, with half of the funds coming from 401(k)s and IRAs.

""Most companies would hire Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley to raise them $500 million or $1 billion,"" says Willer, who claims his widowed mother invested $500,000 in the bonds, ""we don't need their help and we certainly don't need their fees.""

Phoenix is one of a growing number of little known financial firms taking advantage of Congress's Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, signed into law by President Obama in 2012 which enabled companies to more easily sell unregistered securities, otherwise known as private placements, directly to individual investors. Because the legislation exempts these deals from the traditional disclosures required of publicly traded companies, few realize how large an impact the JOBS Act has had. From 2009 through 2020, $15 trillion of so-called Reg D offerings were sold, according to a 2023 study by SLCG Economic Consulting. During the same time period, fully SEC registered offerings, of stocks, bonds and ETFs trading on exchanges, tallied $16.4 trillion in sales.

For operators in the oil and gas business, The JOBS Act has been a godsend. As the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) movement gained traction, many banks and large institutional investors began withdrawing from fossil fuels, citing environmental concerns. This opened a window for sellers of unregistered securities, especially those with enticing offerings like Phoenix and its 13% oil bonds.

Webinar pro Willer, explaining the virtues of his bonds, whose prices you will never see on a Bloomberg terminal, says ""this is just the same concept as a CD. You know what you have, you know what you're getting and you know how long your commitment is without any fluctuations.""

dam Ferrari says the name he gave to his Denver-based oil and gas company, Phoenix Capital Group, was inspired by his father, Daniel Ferrari. A former sheriff, pipe fitter, and welder in Illinois, Daniel was paralyzed in 2016 from transverse myelitis, an affliction the family believes was triggered by the flu vaccine. Phoenix is ""symbolic of a second birth, something that never dies and continues to persevere,"" says Adam Ferrari.

The younger Ferrari, now 41 years old, grew up in the suburbs of Chicago and graduated from the University of Illinois in 2005 with a degree in Chemical Engineering. Due to a shortage of petroleum engineers, oil giants like BP and Shell were open to hiring chemical engineers. He started his career at BP, spending two years working in the oil giant's offshore division. In 2007, Ferrari left BP for BHP, an Australian metals and mining company.

Around 2009, Ferrari enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's business school, aiming to shift his career toward investment banking. However, he left the program prematurely to accept a job offer as an energy analyst from Macquarie Capital in Denver. His tenure at Macquarie Capital was short-lived. Ferrari says he didn't much like the work and he feared he was going to have to move to New York to keep his job, so he went back to engineering, joining Newfield Exploration, where he was involved in drilling, completion, and some production work. From there he moved to Halcon Resources, a start-up oil producer founded by Floyd Wilson, a legendary wildcatter who, in 2011 sold Petrohawk Energy Corp. to BHP for $12 billion.

In 2014, Ferrari struck out on his own, forming Ferrari Energy which bought and sold mineral rights and royalties. In 2016, along with partners and private equity backing, he created another entity called, Wolfhawk Energy, where he served as CEO. From 2016 to 2019 Ferrari's energy companies spent $150 million to acquire more than 2,500 properties in Colorado, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Utah.

Ferrari says it was also at this time that he first had the idea for what would become Phoenix, based on the realization that oil and gas had the potential to generate high yields, for which investors have an insatiable appetite. His edge would come from using the JOBS act, as well as a novel strategy designed to cut out the costs and friction that comes from hiring investment bankers and brokers.

The concept might have remained just an idea if not for a run-in with the law.

In 2019, Adam Ferrari pleaded guilty to felony theft in Colorado. He was charged with cheating a mineral rights holder and Anadarko Petroleum out of $300,000, accrued royalties kept in a account for a piece of land in Weld County. Ferrari allegedly forged a deed to reroute the money held in escrow to him instead of the rightful owner. Two months after his arrest, Ferrari Energy changed its name to Petram Group and severed ties with its namesake. He received a deferred sentence that included three years of unsupervised probation, with his plea to be withdrawn and record to be expunged at the end of it, as reported by the Greeley Tribune. His record was sealed in May 2022.

Ferrari maintains he didn't do anything wrong. He says the episode was the result of a ""corporate hit job"" brought on by a competitor who was, and he says still is, out to get him. In explaining why he took the plea, Ferrari asserts that accepting the guilty deal was the fastest way to put the entire episode behind him. ""I had a deal in writing from the Denver DA that the plea could be withdrawn and there would never be a conviction entered,"" he says. ""It is unequivocally clear in Colorado criminal law that Adam Ferrari has never been convicted of a crime. Period.""

Phoenix was born amid Ferrari Energy's implosion, but on paper founder Ferrari wasn't listed as its CEO. According to securities attorneys, disclosure of his criminal record may have been required though Ferrari and his lawyers refute this. Regardless, from 2019 until 2023, Ferrari officially worked at Phoenix in an advisory role. His official bio says he founded Phoenix Capital in 2019 with $2.5 to $3 million in seed money from an entity called Lion of Judah LLC, which holds about 60% of the company's equity. Lion of Judah's voting interest was held equally by his two parents, Daniel and Charlene Ferrari, but a 2023 offering document for the 9% Reg A bonds says that Adam was the ""owner"" of the company, but had ""no voting or managerial interest."" By the end of 2022 Ferrari's felony record was legally expunged. In November 2023, Ferrari was officially listed as the CEO of Phoenix.

Over the last eight years or so Ferrari and his companies have been involved in numerous lawsuits. He has gone to great lengths to clear his name, including hiring a reputation management firm, which has created dozens of websites, blogs and social media posts on his behalf in an attempt to bury bad news related to his past.

Ferrari assures Forbes that the lawsuits he has faced have never interfered with his skill in picking high return energy investments for his companies. Furthermore, he says given the ""complex nature"" of the mineral rights business, litigation is an ""unfortunate, but common occurrence.""

Says Ferrari, ""Nobody has ever lost a dollar in a business deal with me or my family.""

mong small businesses taking advantage of 2012's JOBs Act to raise capital, few have been as aggressive as Phoenix, especially in the area of bonds.

""When we talk to people in the institutional finance world, the first thing they say, universally, when they look at us, they're like wow, that's different,"" says Ferrari from his Irvine, California office, referring to the fact that his oil and gas business is 100% debt financed.

While banks would likely shun such high leverage, the investors Ferrari prospects for with his webinars, are less likely to scrutinize his balance sheet so long as they can lock in the yields he is advertising - from 9% to 13%. Phoenix also advertises that its bonds have no fees. In fact, companies offering private placement securities generally aren't allowed to even take a commission directly from investors, though brokers selling their oil bonds can. Phoenix gets around this with the help of a broker-dealer named Dalmore Group, which is run out of a house on Long Island.

Dalmore's specialty is offering small firms raising capital, mostly via the JOBS Act provisions, a DIY way to legally sell their own securities as an SEC registered broker. Hence, salesmen on Willer's Denver-based webinar team are technically licensed as brokers through Long Island's Dalmore Group. This way Phoenix's own people get to charge commission under Dalmore's Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) license. Acting as the official brokerage agent on Phoenix's $750 million in bonds, Dalmore takes a 5% commission but the Long Island firm only keeps 1% of it, kicking back 4%, or some $30 million, to Phoenix and its salesmen.

They're ""W-2 employees,"" but for financial compliance purposes they are registered with FINRA as if they worked for Dalmore, says Ferrari.

In 2023, Phoenix had total revenues of $118.1 million and losses of $48.3 million. Outside of interest costs on its bonds, marketing and advertising, which amounted to $36.7 million, was the firm's biggest expense. In the first six months of 2024, revenue soared to $120.5 million, up 143% from the same period last year as mineral and royalty revenues went from $49.2 million to $85.6 million. Still, company losses amounted to $20.6 million during the period.

Ferrari points out that about 50% of the bonds sold to retail investors feature payment-in-kind provisions, where interest payments are made with additional bonds instead of cash. This arrangement means Phoenix records the full interest expense on its income statement, but in reality, it pays out only about half of that each year. This cash flow savings is critically important when it comes to analyzing the bonds ability to cover interest.

According to FactSet the average energy company in the S&P 1500 has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2x. Phoenix's debt-to-EBITDA stood at 19x at the end of 2023. Ferrari says Phoenix's EBITDA for the full year is expected to be between $125 and $135 million, which could bring the ratio down to between six and ten times by the end of the year, depending on how much additional debt they raise.

Thomas Watters, a managing director at S&P Global Ratings, says that for industrial firms anything over 3x is typically considered speculative. ""Over eight or nine times gets into triple C land, which predicts very, very risky credit,"" he says.

""Going out and buying royalties or buying into shale plays where the wells only pay off at two to three-times is not a sustainable strategy,"" says Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at the University of Houston. Hirs also cautions that Phoenix's unsecured bonds are relying on so-called probable reserves for their payout. In fact, during Willer's webinar one slide shows Phoenix has $1.8 billion in estimated reserves but the fine print reveals that $1.22 billion, or nearly 70%, came in the form of probable reserves at the time.

""Bankers won't give you a loan on probable reserves,"" says Hirs. ""They won't even give you a loan on proved undeveloped reserves. Aubrey McClendon (the disgraced former CEO of Chesapeake Energy who Forbes once called ""America's Most Reckless Billionaire"") tried that and, of course, it didn't work.""

And what if the price of crude oil drops from the current $73?

Willer and Ferrari assure investors that Phoenix can be profitable even if oil falls to $30 per barrel, despite the fact that a March 2024 survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas shows that, on average, oil companies need at least $64 per barrel to profitably drill.

on't expect Phoenix to ease up on selling its risky oil bonds to retirement minded investors anytime soon. On October 2nd, Phoenix announced a new confidential draft submission to the SEC to register its bonds. This will allow them to bypass the annual $75 million issuance limit on Reg A offerings, which are open to non-accredited investors.

Phoenix also recently secured a $135 million loan from $48 billion (assets) Fortress Investment Group, a New York-based alternative asset manager known for high yield and distressed lending. Roughly $100 million of the loan was received immediately, while $35 million can be withdrawn at a later date. The Fortress money allowed Phoenix to pay down a $30 million line of credit from Amarillo National Bank, which had an 11.5% rate.

The Fortress loan is priced at 7% above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate Data (SOFR), which brings its current cost to 12% annually over its three-year term. On the surface this seems like Fortress is lending to Phoenix at a rate similar to the one retail bond buyers are getting. However, the Fortress loan is far superior to the debt being sold to retail investors. It is floating rate, and it is secured, backed by the assets and equity of Ferrari's entire operation. This not only protects the NYC lender's downside from interest rate movements, but also places its loan far above retail investors in Phoenix's capital structure. The deal also requires Ferrari's firm to take out additional hedges against oil price movements. Another fine print detail: the Fortress loan only counts proved developed reserves in its asset coverage ratio, which make up a fraction of the headline $1.8 billion in reserves that Willer's webinar touts.

While offering institutional investors better terms is not unheard of, it is important to note that the debt Fortress holds was issued with what is known as an original issue discount, so Phoenix is effectively paying Fortress' secured debt a rate of interest that is more than 2 percentage points higher than retail investors are getting on their unsecured paper with a similar duration. Normally riskier bonds, like those Phoenix webinar investors are buying, would receive a higher rate.

Fortress, Ferrari notes, is enthusiastic about Phoenix's fundraising abilities. It's hardly a shock -- there's nothing stopping Phoenix from using the funds collected from retail investors to meet its obligations to the Wall Street behemoth. Fortress, he says, loves ""the fact that we raise money"" and ""they want us to go raise more.""

Through a spokesperson, Fortress declined to comment.

Furthermore, as part of the agreement with Fortress, Phoenix had to attest to having no knowledge of any investigations by a governmental authority. Three people familiar with Ferrari's oil bond operation have told Forbes that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating Phoenix for potentially misleading statements in its offerings.

Ferrari doesn't deny the existence of an investigation. He says Phoenix has had ""regular communication with the SEC for three years as a normal part of our business,"" but that he's ""not going to speak about things"" that he's ""not privileged to speak about."" A SEC spokesperson says the agency doesn't comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation."
'Otaku No Video' Blu-Ray Review: One For The Oldtaku,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2024/10/08/otaku-no-video-blu-ray-review-one-for-the-oldtaku/,2024-10-08T10:40:17Z,"The ultimate fan anime and partly biographical tale of how Gainax was formed, Otaku no Video is one of the classics and is now readily available again on Blu-ray.

I reviewed the prior limited Blu-ray release from AnimEigo around 8 years ago now and that review still holds true for this version. Although, this is more of a stripped down variant, but with some fun extras.

The story has Kubo give up his normal life and enter the wondrous halls of otaku culture, with his old friend Tanaka. With various bumps along the way they end up forming a company called GX, which is meant to reference Gainax, and they corner the market with garage model kits, but not without a great deal of betrayal and heartbreak along the way.

Having watched Otaku no Video when I started out as an anime fan nearly three decades ago now, it's now clearer in terms of what it shows about how much of the anime industry and surrounding merchandising companies operate.

While GX is a stand-in for Gainax, which is now sadly no longer with us, much of the kinship that Kubo and Tanaka build along the way with all their hyper-nerdy friends has mirrored much of the lives of the various creative people I have interviewed in Japan, not mention my own career.

Most of the major figures in anime we know today started out as fans in one way or another. Helping each other out on various projects, they eventually ended up as leaders within the various media that they worked in.

From the likes of Mamoru Nagano hanging out with his buddies making Macross to the founders of Studio Nue wanting to make their own way with their varied and fascinating contributions to science fiction.

Much of what Otaku no Video shows goes far beyond how Gainax came about and is a broader tale of how nerdy passions shape the groups of people that make anime, games, model kits, toys, and manga in Japan.

So to have it widely available again feels very culturally relevant somehow.

This release still retains the pristine visual and audio quality of the prior Blu-ray version, and also comes with some nice extras. From lineart and color galleries to trailers and even an essay on the background of the anime. You even have the option to switch off the hilarious live-action segments, although I have no idea why anyone would want to do that.

However, the only real omission here is the old school liner notes from the DVD and previous Blu-ray releases. This is not included in the box or on the disc, but it is thankfully available online. These liner notes help explain all the various references and in-jokes that newer anime fans will find utterly mystifying.

So for all the ""oldtaku"" out there, you know the drill. This one is for you. As for the newbies, a joyous world of nerdy enthusiasm awaits. You have been warned.

Otaku no Video is available on Blu-ray and can be purchased from Amazon for $14.89."

Nobel Prize in physics awarded to 2 scientists for discoveries in machine learning,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/g-s1-26848/nobel-prize-in-physics-awarded-to-scientists-machine-learning,2024-10-08T10:38:22Z,"STOCKHOLM -- John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for discoveries and inventions that formed the building blocks of machine learning.

""This year's two Nobel Laureates in physics have used tools from physics to develop methods that are the foundation of today's powerful machine learning,"" the Nobel committee said in a press release.

Hopfield's research is carried out at Princeton University and Hinton works at the University of Toronto.

Ellen Moons, a member of the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the two laureates ""used fundamental concepts from statistical physics to design artificial neural networks that function as associative memories and find patterns in large data sets.""

She said that such networks have been used to advance research in physics and ""have also become part of our daily lives, for instance in facial recognition and language translation.""

The Nobel Prize in physics was awarded a day after two American scientists won the medicine prize for their discovery of microRNA.

Three scientists won last year's physics Nobel for providing the first split-second glimpse into the superfast world of spinning electrons, a field that could one day lead to better electronics or disease diagnoses.

The 2023 award went to French-Swedish physicist Anne L'Huillier, French scientist Pierre Agostini and Hungarian-born Ferenc Krausz for their work with the tiny part of each atom that races around the center and is fundamental to virtually everything: chemistry, physics, our bodies and our gadgets.

Six days of Nobel announcements opened Monday with Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize for their discovery of tiny bits of genetic material that serve as on and off switches inside cells that help control what the cells do and when they do it.

If scientists can better understand how they work and how to manipulate them, it could one day lead to powerful treatments for diseases like cancer.

The physics prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the award's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. It has been awarded 117 times. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.

Nobel announcements continue with the chemistry physics prize on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14."
Americans are using AI at fairly high rates. What does this mean for the economy?,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2024/10/07/g-s1-26429/americans-using-ai-fairly-high-rates-what-does-this-mean-for-economy,2024-10-08T10:33:21Z,"Before conducting a recent survey of Americans to figure out how much they're using generative AI, Harvard University economist David Deming says he was solidly in the ""AI skeptic"" camp. That is, he was skeptical that the explosion of generative AI would offer sizable benefits for the U.S. economy anytime soon. Now, however, he says he's more optimistic.

""I was very surprised at the numbers in our survey,"" Deming says. ""And it sort of made me think that AI is gonna be a bigger deal than I would've thought.""

The study, Deming says, was motivated by questions over whether and how much Americans are using generative artificial intelligence. Doing what economists tend to do, he and his colleagues, Alexander Bick and Adam Blandin, wanted to get some good data.

They modeled their survey after the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Conducted monthly, the CPS is sort of the gold standard for surveys. It's how we know things like the unemployment rate and the state of the labor market.

In short, the survey that Deming, Bick and Blandin conducted is high-quality. It has a large sample size. It's nationally representative. And they even included some of the same questions that the CPS asks, so they could cross-reference their survey with the CPS and make sure their numbers were good. They conducted their survey twice, in June and August 2024.

Deming says he was shocked by the results. He and his colleagues found that almost 40% of Americans, ages 18 to 64, have used generative AI. And a sizable percentage seems to use it regularly. In their August survey, the economists found that more than 24% of American workers had used it ""at least once in the week prior to being surveyed, and nearly one in nine used it every workday.""

Even more surprising, Deming says, usage of AI seems to be pretty much across the board. He expected that younger and more-educated Americans would be the biggest users. They confirmed that's the case. ""But we even found that 22% of blue-collar workers say they use AI, and usage rates were above 20% in every major occupation category except personal services, where it was like 15%,"" he says.

This rapid rate of adoption, the authors point out, is much faster than the speed at which Americans adopted personal computers and the internet. That may not be very surprising though, considering that personal computers cost thousands of dollars in the 1980s and 1990s and you had to get physical hardware, hook it up, figure out how to use it, etc. Even with the internet, people had to buy modems, get subscriptions, figure out how to ""surf the web"" and so on. Generative AI is more plug and play, often free or has a low-monthly subscription cost, and has a user interface that is familiar to anyone who has ever used Google.

In a recent two-part series on The Indicator, Darian Woods and I debated whether AI is overrated. Given the tremendous uncertainty about the impact that AI will have on the economy -- as well as our reluctance to make predictions that might get us laughed at in a few years -- we decided to obscure our personal feelings on the matter. We flipped an AI-generated coin. I got ""AI is overrated"" and wrote an episode and a newsletter making that argumentative case.

In the course of my research, I discovered a study conducted by the Census Bureau this year that found that only about 5% of American businesses said they had used AI in the previous couple of weeks. I used this as evidence that use of generative AI was pretty pathetic, especially considering all the hype around it.

How does Deming square his results with that finding?

For one, Deming says, he and his colleagues found that actually Americans report they're using AI more during their personal time at home than at work.

Hmmm. OK. Putting my ""AI is overrated"" hat back on, this makes me think that much of AI use is for pleasure rather than for productive work purposes -- which would suggest that AI's impact on the economy will be limited.

The sort of economic dream for AI would be that it would rescue the U.S. economy from its long period of slow productivity growth. Productivity growth -- meaning workers being able to produce more in less time -- is the magic sauce of rising living standards. And recent technologies have been pretty disappointing on that front.

I mean, look at the smartphone. If I told you back in 2006, the year before the iPhone was released, that we'd soon all have supercomputers in our pockets, able to search the internet, give us precise directions to anywhere, send emails to and do video calls with co-workers and clients, order basically any product or service, translate languages and on and on -- you might think we'd see an explosion in productivity. But smartphones seem to be more a tool for pleasure and distraction than an incredibly impactful work tool. We haven't seen a huge boost in productivity growth since its mass adoption well over a decade ago.

Deming, however, stresses that people are using generative AI for work. He says their survey shows ""about 1 in 4 people used it at least once in the last week at work"" (versus ""about 1 in 3"" who used it in their off time). When it comes to how people use AI to help their work, respondents indicated that writing, interpreting and administrative support were the most helpful (although a significant share also said they were using it for other tasks, including coding and support when dealing with customers and co-workers).

Squaring his study with the one from the Census Bureau, Deming says he thinks there's a ""big gap between a company's formal policy on AI use and workers. I think quite a lot of the use is under the radar, like you've gotta write an email to your boss and you just use it to write the email more quickly and you just use ChatGPT to do it. But you don't tell anyone."" Deming says many of his students use generative AI this way.

We reached out to Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Daron Acemoglu -- whom, these days, you might call the AI skeptic in chief -- about Deming and his colleagues' study. Does the fact that they find that a large percentage of Americans are using generative AI change his perspective at all?

""My concern with their numbers is that it does not distinguish fundamentally productive uses of generative AI from occasional/frivolous uses,"" Acemoglu said in an email. ""If you are curious about what ChatGPT would say to introduce one of your guests and use it to get a sense of that, you are a user, but this is not fundamentally integrated into the NPR production process. Worse, if you asked me whether I'm using generative AI, and if I'm being honest, I will have to say yes, because when I do searches, now I see generative AI-generated output. But this has zero impact on me. The productivity improvements would require fundamental integration and reorganization of production processes, together with complementary investments in organizational capacity and worker skills -- not gimmicky, frivolous uses. We know ChatGPT has about 200 million unique monthly users, but the question is how many of them are using it in a way that will lead to significant productivity improvements/cost reductions. I don't really know the answer to that question, and I don't think we find the answer to that question from this paper.""

To try to predict how much AI will boost productivity growth, Deming and his colleagues did some rough calculations. They looked at five randomized studies that analyzed how much use of generative AI increases productivity in various work settings. They picked the productivity-boost number in the middle of those studies, which is about 25%. They then multiplied that, Deming says, by ""our estimate of the number of work hours that are currently being assisted by generative AI"" (which, they calculate, is somewhere between 0.5% and 3.5% of all work hours in the U.S.).

They ended up estimating that generative AI will result in an ""increase in labor productivity of between 0.125 and 0.875 percentage points at current levels of usage."" That may not sound like very much. But, Deming says, consider that productivity growth over the last couple of decades has ""been about one and a half percent per year. So if you take that 1.5% and you add this, that's actually a pretty big increase.""

Interestingly, Acemoglu has also done some rough calculations of the potential impact of generative AI on the economy in the near future. And despite using a different method to calculate the potential productivity boost from AI, his estimates are actually pretty similar to this recent work from Deming and colleagues.

Yet, Acemoglu and Deming put different spins on the results. Acemoglu seems to be reacting more to all the media and industry hype around generative AI -- and, he's like, we're not witnessing an economic revolution by any means. Deming looks at the potential productivity increase and emphasizes more that it looks like generative AI could make a meaningful impact on the U.S. economy.

""Is it gonna lead to 7% productivity growth? No, probably not,"" Deming says. ""Not the way it's currently being used, but it could add a little bit, and every little bit counts. Like that's millions and millions of dollars of extra GDP growth and rising living standards. That really counts.""

Deming and his colleagues have plans to continue conducting their survey in the future. It's worth noting that they conducted their last survey before Apple released an iPhone that has ChatGPT integrated into it.

Pretty soon, he says, ""because AI is gonna be embedded in so many things, like the iPhone, it's gonna be hard to even ask people, ""Do you use AI?"""
Harris To Propose New Medicare Benefit To Cover Home Care Costs For Seniors,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2024/10/08/harris-to-propose-new-medicare-benefit-to-cover-home-care-costs-for-seniors/,2024-10-08T10:28:09Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris will outline a new Medicare benefit proposal Tuesday aiming to help families caring for seniors at home, in what is the Democratic candidate's latest policy pitch targeted at middle-aged voters who have to grapple with the costs of caring for both their children and elderly parents.

This is a developing story.

Harris' appearance on ""The View"" is part of a big media blitz by the Vice President this week. The morning show appearance will be followed by interviews on The Howard Stern Show and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert later on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Harris is set to take part in a town hall in Las Vegas hosted by Univision. Earlier this week CBS' 60 Minutes aired an interview with the vice president and she also appeared on the ""Call Her Daddy"" over the weekend."
Vulnerable Dem Jon Tester turns on Biden admin over DEI after Montana universities stripped of federal funds,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vulnerable-dem-jon-tester-turns-biden-admin-over-dei-after-montana-universities-stripped-federal-funds,2024-10-08T10:23:57Z,"FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., is calling on President Biden and his administration's Department of Education to promptly reverse a grant rejection for Montana universities because of a failure to meet certain diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) hiring standards.

In a statement exclusively to Fox News Digital, the senator said, ""The Biden Administration's decision to strip critical funding from local schools is just another example of one-size-fits-all policies from Washington bureaucrats who don't understand Montana.""

""I'm calling on the Biden Administration and the Department of Education to immediately reverse this decision, because Montana's students are more important than [made-up] D.C. hiring practices.""

SENATE REPUBLICANS MARK OCT 7 ATTACK 1 YEAR OUT AS ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR CONTINUES

Tester, who is fighting for his political life in a competitive re-election match in a traditionally Republican state, first voiced his concerns about the grant rejection due to insufficiently diverse hiring practices in a letter to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona last month.

""I am deeply troubled by indications that the Department rejected Montana's application based primarily on an unfair scoring decision related to subjective diversity hiring requirements that failed to recognize the work already being done on this front,"" he wrote.

HERE'S WHAT 2 UNDECIDED WISCONSIN VOTERS ARE HOLDING OUT FOR IN 2024 ELECTION

The senator's office revealed that after 25 years of receiving the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) grant, Biden's DOE rejected the Montana university systems' federal funding because Montana supposedly did not include sufficient details about its hiring practices for ""a diverse group of individuals.""

According to Tester, the denial was ""embarrassing"" for the DOE.

The DOE told Fox News Digital it had received the letter and was in the process of reviewing it. Tester's office confirmed that it had yet to receive a response despite reaching out on Sept. 9.

The pointed criticism of the Biden administration's implementation of DEI standards sets him apart from his party, which has been generally supportive of the initiatives. On the other hand, Republicans have criticized the continued efforts to prioritize diversity over merit in hiring.

In less than a month, the Montana Democrat will face off in one of the most competitive races in the country against Republican candidate Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Recently, several political handicappers have indicated Sheehy has the advantage going into the election.

SOROS-LINKED DARK MONEY GROUP PROPS UP NEBRASKA INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE IN KEY SENATE RACE

A spokesperson for Sheehy's campaign criticized Tester's stance against the Biden administration on DEI, telling Fox News Digital, ""Jon Tester loved the radical Left's Woke agenda when he voted to exclude white farmers from getting assistance just because they were white, supported AOC's Green New Deal moving forward, and blamed Biden's border crisis on Climate Change.""

""After voting 95% of the time with Biden and Harris, Two-Faced Tester is doing the Tester Two-Step just ahead of an election because he's a desperate career politician making an all-out effort to save his political career that made him rich in Washington.""

TOP 5 MOMENTS FROM ONLY VP DEBATE BETWEEN VANCE, WALZ BEFORE ELECTION

Tester voted in line with Biden 90% of the time in the last Congress, according to FiveThirtyEight. In the first half of the 118th Congress, he voted with the president roughly 95%.

The three-term senator has held off explicitly endorsing Vice President Harris in the presidential election, repeatedly telling reporters he is focused on Montana and his own race.

However, critics have pushed back at this, pointing to reports that the senator was responsible for recruiting Harris to run for Senate in 2015 when he served as chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

In an interview on ""CNN News Central,"" Mills was asked to respond to a comment made earlier in the day by Trump, who remarked that the U.S. has ""a lot of bad genes in our country right now"" during a discussion about crime perpetrated by illegal immigrants.

Mills began by claiming that Trump ""revered the Nazis... revered Hitler.""

""And I say this with all the sternness that you hear in my voice because it is serious. And Americans should recognize that.""

Republican strategist Lahnee Chen, who joined the CNN segment, pushed back against Mills' assertion, calling it ""a little over-torqued, quite frankly.""

DONALD TRUMP JR. TELLS CNN THE 'MEDIA HAS RADICALIZED' PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ASSASSINATE HIS FATHER

Democrats and left-leaning pundits have repeatedly compared Trump to the Nazi leader. MSNBC host Joy Reid said earlier this year that, like Hitler, the former president was ""also viewed as a clown, a goon who could be kept in line."" MSNBC political analyst Claire McCaskill suggested during a media appearance in 2023 that Trump was ""more dangerous"" than Hitler and Mussolini. More recently, Hillary Clinton marked the 80th anniversary of the D-Day operation with a social media post that appeared to cast Trump as a threat to democracy on par with the Nazi dictator.

Mills' comment comes after Trump blamed the ""rhetoric"" from Democrats for causing him to be ""shot at"" in two separate assassination attempts, telling Fox News Digital last month that the suspected gunman in the second attempt on his life ""acted"" on ""highly inflammatory language"" from the left.

His son Donald Trump Jr. echoed the sentiment in a tense interview on CNN last week, blaming the media for being partly responsible for the assassination attempts against his father by pushing false narratives that radicalize his critics.

""The media did that, they created so much of that environment,"" Trump Jr. said. ""The media has radicalized the people that are trying to kill my father. I've had to deal with that twice now in the last two months,"" he continued. ""When someone allows someone to have a platform to call someone 'literally Hitler,' every day for nine years, it creates it. Whether you want to believe it or not, that's a fact."""
The high-speed clay technique shaking up home construction,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/high-speed-clay-technique-shaking-up-home-construction,2024-10-08T10:18:06Z,"Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses how Clay's impact printing technology enables fast, sustainable construction.

Remember those ancient clay structures from history class? Well, clay is making a grand re-entrance into the world of construction, and it's undergone a high-tech makeover. Thanks to a cutting-edge process called impact printing, clay might just be the building material of the future.

By now, you've probably heard about 3D-printed concrete houses. They're quick, cheap and produce less waste than traditional building methods. But let's face it, concrete has its downsides. It needs time to harden, and the cement industry is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Enter clay, stage left.

LEGO-LIKE CONSTRUCTION BLOCKS MADE FROM PLASTIC WASTE CAN STAND UP TO NATURE'S FURY

A team of clever scientists at ETH Zurich, led by Dr. Lauren Vasey, has developed a new way to build with clay. They've created a special mix of clay, silt and a secret ingredient (a ""common waste product"" from their industry partner). But here's where it gets exciting: instead of slowly extruding the material, they shoot it at high speeds using a machine that could one day be brought right to the construction site.

Picture this: Blobs of clay mixture flying through the air at speeds up to 32.8 feet per second. When these blobs hit their target, they stick together, gradually forming walls, columns or whatever structure you fancy. It's like watching a high-speed game of clay Tetris.

If you're not into the ""bunch-of-blobs"" aesthetic (though it could be the next big thing in interior design), don't worry. The researchers have thought of that, too. A robotic arm with a rotary tool can smooth out the surfaces, giving you that sleek, modern look.

The team at ETH Zurich isn't stopping at simple structures. They're working on ways to integrate supportive elements into the clay as it's being deposited and developing fancy software to guide the construction of more complex buildings. They're even thinking about mounting the printing rig on an autonomous excavator. Imagine a robot building your house while you sip lemonade and watch.

Impact printing with clay is still in its early stages, but it's showing incredible promise. It's fast, doesn't require cement and uses readily available materials. Plus, it's a sustainable alternative to concrete construction. As we face increasing pressure to reduce our carbon footprint, technologies like this could play a crucial role in the future of construction. Who knows?

"Trump addresses criticism he's politicizing Hurricane Helene: 'Anything I do, they'll say, oh, it's political'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-addresses-criticism-hes-politicizing-helene-anything-i-do-theyll-say-oh-its-political,2024-10-08T10:15:09Z,"Former President Trump slams the Biden administration's response to Hurricane Helene and reacts to cases against him on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Former President Trump continued to hit the Biden-Harris administration for its response to Hurricane Helene amid criticism that he's attempting to politicize the disaster.

Trump spoke with Fox News host Laura Ingraham Saturday at his Butler, Pa., rally, which marked a return to the place where would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks attempted to end the GOP presidential nominee's life in July.

Ingraham asked the former president how he would have responded to the devastation wrought by Helene.

""I'd have a tremendous team of people here. They don't have any people here, the people who, look, I was in North Carolina yesterday. I was in Georgia -- and Georgia's different. You have a good governor. He's doing a very good job. But North Carolina is a disaster. And it was also hit very hard. But they don't have the people and they're complaining there's no people around to help,"" Trump said.

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell hit back at some claims that agency personnel haven't been seen on the ground in the aftermath of the storm, telling ""Special Report"" on Monday such insinuations are ""false.""

""We have been on the ground since before Hurricane Helene in Florida and before it crossed over [to] North Carolina. And what I would say is just because somebody doesn't see a person in a shirt doesn't mean that we're not in the area. We have a team located with the state side-by-side to help them understand their needs and move resources where they're needed,"" Criswell said.

FOX CORPORATION LAUNCHES DONATION DRIVE FOR AMERICAN RED CROSS HURRICANE HELENE RELIEF EFFORTS

""We've moved food and water, and much of what you're seeing delivered by the amazing National Guardsmen across North Carolina are the supplies that we've brought in. The entire federal family is there to support this response. We've been there. We will continue to be there as long as it's needed to make sure we're meeting everybody's needs.""

The White House announced over the weekend that President Biden ordered 500 active-duty troops to western North Carolina to assist in relief efforts, bringing the total number of troops to 1,500.

More than 6,100 National Guardsmen and more than 7,000 federal personnel have been mobilized to help residents and affected counties.

TRUMP LAUNCHES GOFUNDME TO HELP HURRICANE HELENE VICTIMS, RAISES MORE THAN $1M

The White House took aim at Trump and others for allegedly spreading false information about how disaster relief funds were being used, specifically a claim that FEMA money was used on migrants in the United States.

""No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. None. FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,"" a memo from the White House read in part.

""You know, anything I do, they'll say, oh, it's political. If I do anything good, no matter what I do, they'll say, oh, he did it for politics. I mean, they could have gotten there way before me,"" Trump said on ""The Ingraham Angle.""

Trump, Biden and Kamala Harris have all visited states impacted by Helene.

Ingraham asked the GOP nominee how he's working to ensure voters can cast their ballots amid the devastation.

""Republican areas got hit very hard. You know that. They got hit very, very hard. I believe - and many people are dead. You know, many people are dead. They don't even know what it's going to be in terms of the number. You know, they have hundreds are missing and I can't really speak to it. I can only say that I believe they're going to go out and vote, if they have to, crawl to a voting booth,"" Trump said.

He added Republican National Committee co-chair and daughter-in-law Lara Trump is working to address the issue.

""Other people are working on it and we're trying to make it convenient for them, too. But they just lost their house. We're trying to make it convenient for them to go out and vote, but we are doing very well in certain areas that we weren't expected to do. Virginia. We're doing well. We're doing well all over. I think we're going to do great in North Carolina because the response has been so bad to the hurricane. They have - this response has been horrific,"" Trump continued."
First on Fox: Top outside group backing House Republicans sets fundraising record,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-outside-group-backing-house-republicans-showcases-fundraising-prowess,2024-10-08T10:14:56Z,"EXCLUSIVE: The leading outside group that supports House Republicans is reporting its highest fundraising quarter ever.

The Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF), which is closely aligned with House Speaker Mike Johnson, is announcing that it hauled in $81.4 million during the July-September third quarter of 2024 fundraising.

With four weeks left until Election Day in November and the GOP aiming to hold onto and expand its fragile House majority, the CLF is also announcing that it is dishing out another $11 million in new ad reservations. Word of both developments was shared first on Tuesday with Fox News.

""We continue to raise at levels that will allow us to be incredibly impactful this cycle. We're invested deeply and continuing to add more strategically in the must-win races that will determine the Majority,"" CLF President Dan Conston said in a statement.

TRUMP UPS THE ANTE WITH HIS SEPTEMBER FUNDRAISING HAUL

The money raised over the past three months by the CLF tops its previous record of $77.4 million in the third quarter of 2020. The group said it is on track with what it raked in during the 2022 midterms, when Republicans flipped the House, and are out-pacing what they raised at this point in 2020, the last presidential cycle.

The CLF also highlighted that it had $152.8 million cash on hand as of the end of September and touted that it slightly outpaced its Democratic rival in total money raised so far this election cycle.

House Majority PAC, the main super PAC supporting House Democrats, announced last week that it and its aligned non-profit organization hauled in $69 million in September, part of a $150 million third quarter. However, according to a report, the House Majority PAC alone brought in roughly $100 million in fundraising during the past three months.

After then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy - who was long known for his fundraising prowess - was ousted a year ago in a very messy intra-party battle, expectations for a strong fundraising cycle for House Republicans were lowered. However, the CLF's fundraising appears to have defied those low expectations.

The group said Johnson had done well with fundraising and picked up where McCarthy left off. CLF officials also said that they are continuing to haul in ""big money"" in the week since the end of the third quarter.

The CLF said the new ad reservations - with the money being spent on top GOP offensive and defensive House races - brings the group's total reservations this cycle to $190 million. They note that they will likely add more spending ahead of Election Day.

The group is directing some of the new spending to beef up existing ad buys in three Democrat-held districts the GOP's aiming to flip: Colorado's 8th Congressional District, New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District and Maine's 2nd Congressional District.

Additionally, the CLF says it will also use some of the new reservations to ""lay down aircover to combat Democrats' spending"" in districts where it's playing defense, including New York 19, Wisconsin 03, and Arizona 06.

The GOP currently controls the 435-member House by a narrow 220-212 majority. Two Democrat-held and one Republican-held seats are vacant."
Chiefs refuse to lose with Taylor Swift watching in 2024,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-refuse-lose-taylor-swift-watching-2024,2024-10-08T10:12:52Z,"As long as Taylor Swift is in attendance, the Kansas City Chiefs may not lose a game.

The Chiefs topped the New Orleans Saints on Monday, 26-13, to remain undefeated to start the season. Kansas City has rattled off five straight wins even though they have not looked like the best team in the league.

Travis Kelce may not have had a touchdown, but he had one of the best games of his 2024 season so far. He had nine catches for 70 yards coming off of a game against the Los Angeles Chargers in which he had seven catches for 89 yards.

Swift returned to Arrowhead Stadium and everything appeared to be right in the world. The Chiefs won, and she, Kelce and the Chiefs faithful went home happy.

Since the calendar turned to 2024, Swift may have been the good luck charm.

She was at the ice-cold AFC Wild Card victory against the Miami Dolphins. She then traveled to Buffalo and saw the Chiefs top the Bills in the AFC Divisional Round, while Jason Kelce lost his top. Then, she was in Baltimore to see the Chiefs win another AFC Championship.

BROWNS ARE IN 'THE WORST SITUATION IN PRO SPORTS,' EX-NFL QUARTERBACK SAYS

Swift had to jet off to Asia to continue her ""Eras Tour."" She made it back just in time for kickoff at Super Bowl LVIII, in which she saw the Chiefs come back to defeat the San Francisco 49ers and win a second straight Super Bowl.

The pop superstar was back at Arrowhead Stadium when the Chiefs took on the Ravens to start the season, and she was there when they held off the Bengals.

Not every game has been a win while she was in attendance. The last time Kansas City lost a game with her in the suite was on Christmas Day, when the Las Vegas Raiders defeated the Chiefs. It was also the last time Kansas City lost a game in general.

Swift may not be in every home game going forward as the tour is getting started again. Fans can be sure that as long as she is in the suite, Kansas City has an even better chance of winning."
Spain Introduces Draft Royal Decree To Regulate Medical Cannabis,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2024/10/08/spain-introduces-draft-royal-decree-to-regulate-medical-cannabis/,2024-10-08T10:09:51Z,"Spanish patients could soon have access to medical cannabis as regulators push forward with a new bill. However, its use is expected to be strictly limited to specific medical conditions, highlighting the cautious approach being taken.

After the request of the subcommittee for the Health and Consumer Affairs Commission in 2021, the Ministry of Health of Spain introduced last week a draft royal decree for a public hearing that seeks to regulate medical cannabis. With this decree, the government aims to provide patients who do not respond to authorized treatments with a supply of standardized cannabis medicines.

This development marks progress in Spain's cannabis policy, where medical cannabis remains unregulated. Currently, the cultivation of cannabis or its derivatives is legally permitted only for export to firms licensed in their countries of origin. As for recreational cannabis, its production, import, and sale are prohibited, while consumption and personal cultivation by adults in private spaces are decriminalized. Since the 1990s, hundreds of cannabis social clubs and user associations have emerged across Spain, with the majority concentrated in Barcelona, Catalonia.

The proposed royal decree on medical cannabis sets guidelines for the prescription, preparation, and dispensing of standardized cannabis formulations. As cannabis is classified as a narcotic under international treaties, its use is restricted to medical and scientific purposes. The decree relies on scientific evidence demonstrating cannabis's benefits for conditions such as multiple sclerosis-related spasticity, severe refractory epilepsy, chemotherapy-induced nausea, and chronic refractory pain.

Key points of the draft include the use of standardized cannabis preparations, meaning only THC and/or CBD extracts registered with Spain's Medicines and Health Products Agency are allowed. These formulations are standardized for consistent dosage and quality.

Only specialists can prescribe cannabis-based treatments when authorized medications fail, and this must be recorded in the patient's medical history, and patients must be informed of the medical cannabis's benefits and risks.

The pathologies listed in the decree that can be treated with medical cannabis preparations include spasticity in multiple sclerosis, severe refractory epilepsy (unresponsive to conventional treatments), chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and refractory chronic pain (persistent pain not relieved by standard treatments).

The draft royal decree also states that the National Formulary will outline the legally approved uses for cannabis-based drugs, allowing for future adjustments based on scientific evidence and regulatory decisions.

Formulations are prepared and dispensed exclusively by hospital pharmacies under strict quality control regulations, which also monitor treatment outcomes and side effects.

A national registry tracks cannabis products with over 0.2% THC, subjecting them to stricter psychotropic substance laws.

Manufacturers must follow EU Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and audit suppliers.

Healthcare providers must report adverse reactions to regional pharmacovigilance centers.

Similarly to a bill introduced in 2022, the proposed royal decree seems to limit the medical conditions for which patients can access medical cannabis despite other conditions having scientific evidence supporting treatment with the substance.

Also, the measure excludes family doctors and other physicians from prescribing medical cannabis preparations for the treatment of the above-listed medical conditions.

Furthermore, as the draft regulates the prescription, preparation, dispensing, and use of standardized cannabis formulations, establishing a specific registry to ensure their quality and traceability, it appears that the preparations will be in oil or similar forms containing active cannabis ingredients, excluding the direct use of cannabis flowers, as is done in other European countries like Germany and Italy.

Currently, two cannabis-based medicines are approved for sale in Spain: Sativex, an oral spray with dronabinol and cannabidiol that can be prescribed by specialists to over-18 patients who need relief from spasticity, and Epidiolex, an oral solution with cannabidiol to be used against epilepsy in adults, adolescents, and children from two years of age. Apart from these, the import of nabilone and dronabinol has been allowed in particular cases, as well as for severe multiple sclerosis, and when it is necessary to use them as antiemetics during the treatment of tumors."
"Legislators Are Shifting Tactics To Censor Higher Ed, Claims Report",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2024/10/08/legislative-censorship-of-higher-ed--is-shifting-tactics-finds-report/,2024-10-08T10:09:50Z,"Legislative attempts to limit academic freedom and censure campus speech are continuing, but they are becoming more subtle and disguised, according to a new report from PEN America.

America's Censored Classrooms 2024: Refining the Art of Censorship warns that lawmakers' censorship efforts are evolving from the blatant gag orders of recent years to ""stealth tactics"" that pose new threats to higher education across the nation.

Along with the report, PEN America also released an up-to-date Index of Educational Gag Orders, featuring all the restrictions introduced and passed in state legislatures over the past four years.

The report is the latest PEN analysis of educational gag orders and other laws restricting what can be taught on college campuses and in classrooms about race, gender, LGBTQ+ issues, and other so-called ""divisive concepts.""

Focused on the 2024 state legislative sessions, the report finds that educational censorship is taking a different form than in past years. Rather than trying to pass outright bans on controversial topics, legislators try to obscure their real intent by linking bills with popular causes such as ""viewpoint diversity.""

According to the report's authors, Jeffrey Adam Sachs and Jeremy C. Young. ""this strategy has allowed censorship to fly under the radar, even as its harmful effects on academic freedom and campus free speech intensify.""

""This is censorship by another name,"" said Young, PEN America's Freedom to Learn program director, in a news release.""What's occurring in our universities is a coordinated assault on free expression, now obscured by claims of fairness and neutrality, making it harder to combat."" He added that in 2024, lawmakers also successfully bullied and threatened university presidents into new campus restrictions in some cases without ever passing a law.

The report found that:

The report contends that, in repose to legal challenges and public concerns about straightforward bans on certain kinds of expression, proponents of censorship are increasingly trying to camouflage their tactics. For example, the former rhetoric of ""anti-wokeness"" is giving way to calls for mandates of ""institutional neutrality"" or requirements for curricular changes.

The authors single out three of these tactics.

Disguising censorship. Attaching gag orders to some other worthy-sounding cause like ""viewpoint diversity"" thereby attempting to make censorship and limits on academic freedom appear more palatable. Indiana's SB 202 is a prime example.

Undermining academic structures. New bills that focus on dismantling the systems that protect academic freedom, like tenure and shared governance.

""Jawboning"" - Informal Bullying and Pressure. This strategy involves lawmakers trying to coerce universities into imposing restrictions without the need for legislation. Citing incidents in Wisconsin, Kentucky, Texas, North Dakota, North Carolina, and Virginia as examples, the report notes that this type of ""informal"" censorship is ""attractive to lawmakers who are unable to pass a censorship law or would prefer not to act in the open.""

The report also found that pushback against educational censorship has picked up some steam recently. Legal challenges to educational gag orders have intensified and have proven successful in a few cases. Public opposition has occasionally forced legislators to backtrack on censorial bills they had been considering. And some proposed legislation has gone down to defeat, either in the legislature itself or through a governor's veto.

The report predicts that educational censorship will continue escalating into 2025, suggesting that ""lawmakers will increasingly shy away from legislation that censors educational speech directly, and will instead seek to disguise censorship in bills ostensibly promoting some laudable goal, enact it indirectly by exerting ideological control over university governance, or engage in jawboning to bring about censorship informally.""

""With lawmakers honing their strategies, the future of academic freedom hangs in the balance,"" warned Young. The report recommends continued vigilance, activism, and legal action to combat these rising threats, and it concludes that ""only when leaders prove willing to prioritize defending their institutions against ideological control by the government will there be a truly effective counterweight to these pressures."""
The Best Prime Day Monitor Deals: Save Up To $900 On Top Models,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2024/10/08/best-prime-day-monitor-deals/,2024-10-08T10:09:50Z,"We independently select all products and services.

If you're shopping Amazon's October Prime Day for a new monitor for your WFH workstation, to level up your gaming or to update your travel setup, I found a number of top brands on sale during the retailer's fall event. The best Prime Day monitor deals include saving $500 on the ultrawide 49-inch Samsung Odyssey G9, snagging 42% off this LG Ultragear OLED Curved Gaming Monitor and scoring this Arzopa Portable Monitor for just $60.

The retailer's Prime Big Deal Days fall sale runs Oct. 8 and 9, and includes big savings across myriad categories, but as the consumer tech editor at Forbes Vetted, frequent traveler and gamer, I'm particularly interested in these Prime Day monitor deals. Keep in mind that the sale just kicked off, and the most popular Prime Day deals sell out quickly, so if you see something you like, we suggest checking out right away. I don't expect prices like this to return until Black Friday, so happy shopping.

And if you're shopping for something besides a Prime Day monitor deal, our deals team is pulling together the best October Prime Day savings on MacBooks, TVs and more.

Yes, they do. Amazon puts countless electronics products on sale during its annual Prime Day sales event. You can usually find significant discounts on electronics including computer monitors, TVs, laptops, smartphones and more, and many products are still go on sale before the shopping event starts.

We are particularly excited, for example, about the Samsung 55-Inch Odyssey Ark (2nd Gen) 4K UHD 1000R Curved Gaming Monitor -- it's Samsung's massive 55-inch curved monitor and it's dropped to $1,800, down from its usual $3,000 (that's 40% off).

October Prime Day 2024 runs for two days this year, running from Oct. 8 at 12:01 a.m. PDT through 11:59 p.m. PDT on Oct. 9. Most of the deals tend to end promptly at the end of the advertised sale. You can still find a handful of deals after the event, but it's in your best interest to pick up anything you see now in case it runs out of stock.

It's probably no surprise that the best monitor overall -- for you -- depends on what you need to display on the monitor and how you plan to use it. If you're in the market for a monitor for work or productivity, we believe the best monitor overall is the Samsung 32-Inch Odyssey G8 OLED Gaming Monitor. We also think the best portable monitor overall is the SideTrak Solo, should you need to take your work or gaming on the go."
What You Need To Know About The Current State Of The White-Collar Job Market,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/10/08/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-current-state-of-the-white-collar-job-market/,2024-10-08T10:09:45Z,"The United States white-collar job market is experiencing a significant squeeze, creating a challenging landscape for professionals seeking new opportunities. Despite the addition of 254,000 new jobs in September, the average monthly job growth has been steadily declining over the past few years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The current 12-month average of 203,000 new jobs per month represents a significant drop from previous years, with 251,000 in 2023, 377,000 in 2022 and a much higher 604,000 in 2021.

Additionally, job openings are growing at a sluggish pace (7%) compared to the recent surge in applications (31%), dramatically intensifying competition, Workday's latest Global Workforce Report revealed.

This imbalance has left many qualified candidates struggling to secure positions, marking a stark shift in the employment dynamics for white-collar professionals, while jobs in food services and drinking establishments, healthcare, government, social assistance and construction trend upward.

With fewer job openings available, the balance of power has tipped in the favor of employers in the labor market, encouraging companies to become more selective by raising their expectations and requirements for potential candidates.

The rigorous selection process has turned finding a new job into a lengthy process. The average duration of a job search for Americans in September was 22.6 weeks, which is over five months. Adding to the difficulty, employers have implemented more complex hiring processes, frequently involving multiple rounds of interviews and rigorous assessments.

The healthcare sector continues to demonstrate strong employment growth and high demand for workers. In September alone, the industry added 45,000 new positions, maintaining its pattern of significant monthly increases. Various healthcare subsectors contributed to this growth, with home healthcare services adding 13,000 jobs, hospitals creating 12,000 positions and nursing and residential care facilities expanding by 9,000 roles, BLS data showed.

Government employment also maintained its positive trajectory last month, adding 31,000 jobs. This sector has seen consistent growth, with an average monthly increase of 45,000 positions over the past year. The expansion was particularly noticeable at the local and state levels, with local governments adding 16,000 jobs and state governments increasing their workforce by 13,000.

Despite layoffs in the broader tech industry, specialized tech roles remain in high demand, particularly those related to artificial intelligence. With the ongoing advancement of generative AI, employers are seeking professionals with expertise in cutting-edge fields like machine learning, natural language processing and large language models. In fact, companies are now placing a higher value on AI-related skills compared to traditional technology competencies when making hiring decisions.

The communications, media and technology sectors are experiencing particularly intense competition, with an average of 30 candidates vying for each available position. This represents a 36% increase in applicants compared to 2023, Workday's data found. These industries have been hit hard by recent layoffs, resulting in a flood of experienced professionals seeking new opportunities in an already crowded job market.

The tech industry, particularly, has seen significant job cuts, with nearly 140,000 workers terminated in 2024 so far, according to Layoffs.fyi.

The popularity of remote work has been declining since its peak in 2022. According to Axios, citing data from Indeed, job postings offering remote or hybrid options reached a high of over 10% in May 2022. However, by the end of July 2024, this figure had fallen to 7.6%, indicating a significant reduction in remote work opportunities.

This trend is exemplified by Amazon's recent mandate for employees to return to the office full-time, a move that could potentially trigger a domino effect across industries. Given Big Tech's influential role in shaping workplace norms, this pivot away from remote work may signal a broader return to traditional office-based employment, marking a notable reversal of the work-from-home revolution sparked by the pandemic.

The U.S. job market has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with September's hiring figures surpassing economists' forecasts. This robust performance, coupled with the Federal Reserve's expected interest rate cut on November 7, sets the stage for potential continued employment growth.

As the central bank prepares to ease monetary policy further, the combination of a strong labor market and lower borrowing costs could create a favorable environment for businesses to expand and hire, potentially fueling additional job creation in the coming months."
Starbucks Stock: Path To $190,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/08/starbucks-stock-path-to-190/,2024-10-08T10:09:38Z,"Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is adding a new beverage The Pecan Crunch Oatmilk latte to its lineup, and it has been garnering good reviews. What makes this drink different from other seasonal favorites? This beverage boasts a pecan pie-inspired flavor, evoking the nostalgia of Thanksgiving. It aims to bridge the gap between the everyday routines of the fall season and the festive indulgences of the upcoming holiday season. This beverage has the potential to become a landmark product for the company, illustrating the impact a single, game-changing offering can have on a brand's trajectory. As exemplified by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), whose iconic products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, etc, have cultivated a devoted following and solidified the company's market position. Starbucks can also replicate this success, establishing a signature offering that resonates with consumers, fosters brand loyalty, and drives business growth.

Could Starbucks stock grow 2x in the next few years from the roughly $97 level it is at currently? Does this sound a bit ridiculous? Consider this - Starbucks' stock was trading at around $126 per share, almost 1.3x the current value in July 2021. We examine a scenario in this note where SBUX stock doubles from current levels, considering three key metrics: revenues, net margins, and price-to-earnings multiple.

Does SBUX stock look attractive now?

Overall, the performance of SBUX stock with respect to the index over the last 3-year period has been lackluster. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -13% in 2022, and -1% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could SBUX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? We have revised our Starbucks' Valuation to $97 per share, based on a $3.58 expected EPS and a 27.1x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2024 - almost in line with the current market price.

Snapshot of Current Scenario

Starbucks' Revenues grew from $29 billion in 2021 to $36 billion in 2023 as the company's strength in digital orders helped it rebound quickly from the pandemic setback. The company saw strength in both U.S. business and growth in the International segment during this period. However, the company's sales have been taking a hit in FY 2024 so far. The company's total sales, inclusive of new stores, were down 1% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $9.1 billion in the third quarter (ended June 30), while its global comparable sales declined 3%. Starbucks faced significant external pressures, including eroding consumer confidence, elevated inflation, and disappointing growth in China, which comprises almost one-fifth of the company's business.

How Can An Iconic Product Improve Sales?

A flagship product can potentially boost foot traffic, enhancing comparable sales opportunities. During the recent third quarter ended June, Starbucks' global comparable store sales declined by 3%, primarily driven by a 2% decline in the U.S. and a 7% decline internationally. However, when compared to a similar period before the pandemic (Q3 2019) - when Starbucks was thriving thanks to exponential growth in China, innovation in products, and global coffee alliances with the likes of Nestlé - the company's comparable sales grew 6%, driven by a 7% growth in the Americas and 5% growth in China and Asia Pacific.

An uptick in foot traffic can revitalize customer loyalty for Starbucks, bolstered by its successful rewards program. Starbucks Rewards launched over a decade and a half ago - reported 33.8 million 90-day active rewards members in the U.S. as of June 30, an increase of 7% year-over-year (also up 2% quarter-over-quarter from Q2 2024). Nonetheless, comparative analysis reveals an opportunity for further growth. For perspective, SBUX's peer Chipotle (NYSE: CMG) rewards program, introduced in Q1 2019, has surpassed Starbucks' membership numbers, with 40 million members as of Q2 2024.

Starbucks is the world's largest coffee chain. It boasts an extensive network of nearly 39,500 global stores, with over 18,000 located in North America. The company's growth momentum remains strong, with 526 net new store openings in Q3 (of which 141 were in North America). For FY 2024, the company has planned a total of 580 new stores added, with renovations planned in more than 800 stores in North America. This strategic expansion is poised to fuel revenue growth, solidifying Starbucks' market position and driving future profitability.

Margins Could Improve Going Forward

Starbucks' net margins (net income, or profits after expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) fell from levels of over 14% in 2021 to about 10% in 2022 amid increasing operating costs and increased promotional activities. Nevertheless, the company's net margins grew to about 11.5% in 2023 due to sales growth and in-store operational efficiencies. At present, the coffee king's Q3 2024 net margins came in at 11.6% (down 90 basis points y-o-y), and earnings per share dropped 6% y-o-y to $0.93. Despite near-term challenges, we remain upbeat on Starbucks' prospects, anticipating a margin rebound to historical levels driven by the company's transformative turnaround strategy. CEO Brian Niccol outlined a US-focused turnaround plan centered on four key areas: barista empowerment for consistent quality, timely delivery of high-quality offerings, revitalizing the community coffee house experience, and highlighting Starbucks' unique story, including its Costa Rican coffee farm and innovation hub.

Consumers are also willing to pay for the products they deem premium, based on Starbucks' high gross margin (~67%) which gives the business room to absorb higher input costs while still being profitable. Starbucks has consistently been able to raise prices throughout the inflationary environment in the U.S. - and most loyal customers still come in despite higher pricing and inflationary pressures - demonstrating the strength of its business.

Impact on Starbucks' Valuation?

The Pecan Crunch latte's financial impact will be directly tied to its availability. While seasonal releases yield quarterly gains, a permanent menu addition would likely foster sustained revenue growth.

If we assume revenue growth of roughly 1.26x between 2023 and 2027 with margins growing from 11.5% in 2023 to about 21% in 2026, a roughly 2x increase, this would mean that its net income could grow from about $4.1 billion in 2023 ($3.58 per share) to about $9.5 billion (about $8.29 per share). Good times make it easier to imagine even better times - and when that happens, investors could begin to see Starbucks in a more favorable light, re-assessing the company's recovery path. For example, if Starbucks' investors assign a multiple of 23x following its stronger growth trajectory, this could translate into a stock price of about $190 per share by the end of 2027, assuming earnings of $8.29 per share. What about the time horizon for this positive-return scenario? While our example illustrates this for a 2027 timeline, in practice, it won't make much difference whether it takes three years or four. If the turnaround takes hold, with Starbucks improving its revenues and margins, we could see meaningful gains in the stock. This is a huge business and Starbucks has valuable know-how in a competitive market. Our analysis suggests that a win will be at hand - it just may not be quick and may require patience.

It is helpful to see how its peers stack up. SBUX Peers shows how Starbucks' stock compares against peers on metrics that matter. You will find other useful comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

How To Craft Compelling Slides For Online Presentations,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamarruda/2024/10/08/how-to-create-slides-for-online-presentations/,2024-10-08T10:09:28Z,"Since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic, we've all spent a lot more time delivering presentations on Zoom and other online platforms, but many of us are still using the same slide decks they prepared for in-person events. The problem is that online presentations require a different approach -- one that accounts for the unique experience of viewing on a small screen. To keep your audience engaged and prevent them from multitasking, design your slides from their perspective.

In a physical presentation, the speaker is usually the main focus, but in a virtual environment, it's your slides that dominate the screen. You, the speaker, are often relegated to a small box in the upper right corner. This shift means that your slides need to do more of the heavy lifting to keep the audience's attention.

Tools like Prezi or mmhmm allow you to put yourself into the presentation, making the presentation feel more cohesive and immersive and keeping the focus on you. By integrating yourself into the visual content, you create a stronger, more emotional connection with your audience.

Bullet points remain core to many presentations, but they don't work well in virtual formats, and they are probably past their use-date date for in-person presentations too. In fact, bullets make your slides feel dull, dated, and deadly. Bullets encourage the use of text, which can be hard to read on smaller screens and can cause your audience members' eyes to glaze over.

Replace bullet points with visual storytelling. Use images, infographics, and videos to communicate your message. By minimizing text and amping up visual elements, you'll keep your audience focused on what matters most.

Wordy slides are another common pitfall in online presentations. No one wants to squint at a screen full of text, especially on a smaller device like a laptop, tablet, or phone. Too many words can overwhelm your audience, and instead of absorbing your message, they might disengage.

Be concise with your slide content by limiting the amount of text. Instead of being verbose, aim for punchy headlines or phrases that capture the essence of your point. Supplement these brief statements with vibrant visuals to magnify your message.

Rich media -- like images, videos, and animated GIFs -- are powerful tools for enhancing your online presentations. According to Forrester Research, a one-minute video is worth 1.8 million words. With such a high impact, incorporating rich media into your slides boosts engagement.

After drafting the outline of your presentation, think about how you can incorporate dynamic content. Whether it's a video clip that illustrates a key point, a provocative infographic, or a relevant animated GIF, use these elements break up the monotony and keep your audience engaged.

Interactive slides are a great way to pull your audience into the presentation. Engagement tools like polls, quizzes, and live Q&A encourage participation and keep viewers focused. You can also create slides that prompt your audience to reflect or respond to a specific question, helping them stay mentally engaged.

For example, include a slide with a question and ask attendees to type their responses in the chat or use a polling feature to gather input in real time. By involving your audience, you create a more connective experience.

Your biggest challenge in delivering online presentations is combating the temptation for your audience to multitask. After all, the same device that hosts your presentation also gives them access to email, social media, and countless other distractions. To dissuade multitasking, make your presentation riveting so they won't look away.

Use visually dynamic slides, interactive elements, and storytelling to keep them glued throughout. If your slides are flat or text-heavy, you risk losing them to the distractions of their inbox or an online shopping tab. And once you've lost them, they're gone.

Online presentations require a different approach than traditional, in-person ones. Take a look at the last few slide decks you created for presentations that you're delivering online. Do they seem right for the small screen? It's time to adopt a new approach so your virtual presentations are captivating. With the right approach, your online presentations will not only capture attention but also leave a lasting impact."
Uber Makes Travel Greener With New Sustainability Features,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/shivanivora/2024/10/08/uber-makes-travel-greener-with-new-sustainability-features/,2024-10-08T10:09:25Z,"Many of us -- me included -- rely on Uber to get around wherever we are in the world. I use it in New York where I live but also during my travels, including recently in Cancun, where I hailed rides at least twice a day, the Hamptons, where I spent many weekends this summer, and Mumbai, my home city, which I visit every year.

But as a frequent traveler who experiences the impact of climate change firsthand (hello, unbearable heat in the summer that keeps getting worse every year), I'm constantly trying to find ways to lower my environmental footprint and be as green as possible.

Uber is now making that much easier: Starting today, the rideshare app introduced a lineup of new sustainable features.

Users can indicate that they prefer to ride in electric vehicles to start. According to the release about the initiatives, ""1 in 4 people got their first electric vehicle ride on Uber and now, we're making it even easier to go green! With our new EV preference feature, you can set your app to automatically match you with an electric vehicle whenever one's close by. If the wait's short, you're cruising in an EV. If not, we'll send a regular ride your way.""

A spokesperson for the company says that the feature will launch early next year in NYC, London, Lisbon, Amsterdam, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Denver, Sacramento, Phoenix, Las Vegas and Philadelphia.

I personally love the Emission Savings Refresh, which is rolling out globally. You can see your emission savings in the app and can track their progress. This applies to bikes, scooters, UberX Share, Uber Greens, Uber Comfort Electrics, or any other green product -- you can see the savings on the lock screen.

But there's more. Uber is debuting a Climate Collection where you can browse, buy and get climate-conscious products on-demand with Uber Eats. Uber has collaborated with popular lifestyle brands for the collection, including Credo Beauty, Cuyana, L'Occitane, Trashie, Avaline, Allbirds and Stasher.

Uber is also teaming up with vendors at local markets in New York Los Angeles such Union Square Grassman and Gone Bananas Bread to deliver farm fresh produce and other local products to you. Yes, you can now eat green through Uber, too.

To show its commitment to being as green as possible, Uber has teamed up with Prince William's The Earthshot Prize as a founding partner. The brand will fund ENSO Tyre's pollution-reducing tires and supply them to Uber drivers in the UK.

In an email to Forbes, Uber's Chief Product Officer, Sundeep Jain, said, ""We believe there is a tremendous opportunity to make travel more sustainable globally, and our riders want just that. That's why we're working to make green options more available across the globe and making electric rides more ubiquitous.""

I say ""kudos"" to that. I know I'll turn to Uber's new green initiatives and encourage others to join me in the effort to do our bit for the environment."
Inside Brooklyn's Widow Jane Distillery And Its Newest Rare Whiskey,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelking/2024/10/08/inside-brooklyns-widow-jane-distillery-and-its-newest-rare-whiskey/,2024-10-08T10:09:21Z,"The combination of aged whiskey and the qualities of the Amburana wood cask results in a whiskey that pushes the boundaries of what American whiskey can be.

Widow Jane, a craft distillery based in Brooklyn's Red Hook waterfront warehouse district, is preparing for the upcoming release of its latest expression in an ongoing series of limited-edition whiskeys.

The Vaults, first launched in 2019, is touted for its exploration of unique wood finishes, and this year's release takes that focus even further by using Amburana wood casks. The Vaults 2024 is a 15-year-old blend of carefully selected barrels from Widow Jane's rare whiskey collection.

Sienna Jevremov, head distiller and blender at Widow Jane, leads the team in selecting the casks and overseeing the meticulous blending process.

""When selecting the barrels for this year's edition of The Vaults, I was looking for whiskeys with great texture,"" Jevremov said in an interview from the distillery. ""The tannins from older whiskey help provide a mouthfeel I would describe as chewy, like sticky dark caramel.""

The blend consists of whiskeys from both 20-year-old and 16-year-old stock, chosen for their complementary flavor profiles. Jevremov highlighted the combination of deep notes, listing off flavors such as dark chocolate ganache and burnt orange caramel, paired with sweet smoke, spiced heat and savory herbs.

""I wanted to heighten the earthier spiced notes of the Amburana over the more classical 'cinnamon bun' appeal,"" Jevremov said.

Widow Jane's production process includes mashing, fermentation, distillation, barreling, aging, blending, warehousing and bottling. And it's all done in-house at its Brooklyn facility.

The decision to finish the whiskey in Amburana wood casks, also known as Brazilian oak, adds a unique layer of complexity to the final product. Amburana wood is known for its heady, tropical aromatics and is sourced from Brazil and northern Argentina, where the trees grow in challenging environments with limited nutrients and irregular rainfall.

""Amburana is a bombastic wood full of heady rich aromatics,"" explains Jevremov. ""My first task was to create a blend highlighting the earthy and texturally robust qualities of 15- and 20-year-old whiskeys. Then, I wanted to introduce the Amburana in delicate harmony with those flavors.""

The Vaults 2024 is bottled at 49.5% ABV (99-proof) and will be released in an extremely limited quantity of just 4,000 cases. As with all Widow Jane products, the whiskey is non-chill filtered and proofed with pure limestone mineral water from the Rosendale Mines in upstate New York, a practice that contributes to its signature round mouthfeel and long finish.

Priced at $250 per 750-milliliter bottle, Widow Jane is firmly positioning this new release in the premium whiskey category. But it could be an interesting time for such a release. Much like the global spirits industry at large, craft spirits are also having a rough time of it lately. The American Craft Spirits Association just reported in September that the U.S. craft spirits market saw its first decline in volume since its report's inception in 2016, dropping 3.6% to 13.5 million cases in 2023, compared to 14 million in 2022. In terms of value, the market reached $7.8 billion in sales, reflecting a -1.1% growth rate. A small sliver of a silver lining is that craft spirits producers saw an increase in sales within their home states last year, raising their market share from 48.1% in 2022 to a slightly higher level in 2023.

Jevremov acknowledges that working with older whiskeys can be both rewarding and challenging, remarking that each cask brings its own intense flavors that must be carefully balanced in the final blend.

""I chose the Amburana because I enjoy a lot of the tropical aromatics like fig leaf and cinnamon bark that it brings, but also because I wanted to challenge myself to blending those notes in judiciously so as not to overpower the story I was trying to tell with the base whiskey blend,"" Jevremov said. ""So finding the right marriage of each is both the joy and challenge of working with them. Seeing the potential in one barrel to sway a whole blend the right way without overpowering it."""

Soundpeats Launches Snapdragon Air5 And Breezy Open-Style Earbuds,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marksparrow/2024/10/08/soundpeats-launches-snapdragon-air5-and-breezy-open-style-earbuds/,2024-10-08T10:09:16Z,"It's been a busy time for wireless earbud brand Soundpeats recently.

Whether you are listening to music, watching a movie or playing a game, the Soundpeats Air5 have AI adaptive noise cancellation.

This feature automatically alters the noise reduction levels by conforming to the user's ear shape and how the earbuds are worn, as well as sampling the surrounding noise. The earbuds also include 3MIC AI call noise reduction and AI wind noise resistance to ensure phone calls are clear in a variety of conditions.

When it comes to battery life, the Soundpeats Air5 can play for you to 6 hours on a single charge and there is an overall available playtime of 30 hours with the backup charge in the earbud storage case.

Each of the Air5 earbuds weigh just 3.8g and Soundpeats claims the earpieces are designed for comfort with a sleek, tapered shape that's also elegant to look at. The Air5 are available in black, white, beige and purple colorways.

Launching alongside the Soundpeats Air5 are the brand's Breezy open-style earbuds for sporty types. The affordable Breezy earbuds have a freely adjustable wearing angle of up to 90°. A 12mm dual-magnet dynamic driver provides plenty of volume while Bluetooth 5.4 delivers a stable connection.

There is a total available playtime of 40 in total and the Breezy are compatible with the new PeatsAudio app.

"Port Worker Deal Offers Relief, Yet Supply Chain Disruption Looms",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleykohan/2024/10/08/port-worker-deal-extends-relief-but-future-supply-chain-disruption-looms/,2024-10-08T10:09:09Z,"The port strike which shut down thirty-six East Coast and Gulf Coast ports as 45,000 union workers walked off the job, was settled in record time, minimizing the impact on holiday retail sales. However, the temporary contract extension only goes through mid-January, and if the parties do not come to an agreement, the strike could be back on. The negotiations are centered around wages, benefits, preventing outsourcing of some jobs to non-union workers, and the real sticking point: Strong protections against automation of port worker jobs.

The International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) successfully negotiated and won from the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) a historic 61.5% wage increase spread over six years. With this commitment, the port workers went back to work in three days, limiting what could have been a disastrous holiday season for retailers. The ports that run from Maine to Texas handle a significant share of holiday categories including apparel, toys, games, sports equipment, beauty and fragrance, and electronics. A strike lasting a week or longer could have resulted in shortages of products for the holiday selling period which in recent years has started as early as October.

The strike came at a time shortly after Hurricane Helene left temporary port closures in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The port closures could have led to higher prices on goods. The already strapped consumer is spending more on essential items for the 12 months ending August 2024, including food which is up 2.5%, energy which is up 4.0%, and shelter up nearly 5%. While gasoline prices are down 10.1%, conflict in the Middle East may drive up fuel costs over the next few months. Higher prices for holiday products would have dampened consumer spending, impacting retailers' profits. With a swift contract extension, goods started flowing again, leaving less product shortages, fewer spoiled perishable goods, and better product availability for the consumer.

The retail industry has been adopting automation throughout the business including inventory management, robotics in warehousing and order fulfillment, automated guided vehicles to streamline fulfillment, IoT sensors and blockchain technology throughout supply chain, chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants, and the list goes on. However, the ILA is hoping for protections in a future contract against the loss of port worker jobs to automation initiatives. The ILA letter to the union workers states: ""The fight against automation is not just about job preservation; it is about ensuring that ILA members continue to play an essential role in port operations. By extending negotiations, we aim to establish strong protections against the introduction of remote-controlled or fully automated machinery that threatens our work jurisdiction.""

The protection against automation seems to be the most difficult point for USMX to agree to since many other industries have turned to automation to increase productivity and streamline processes. Automation has been proven across many industries, including retail, to increase profits by reducing costs and driving up productivity. Automation helps drive revenue creation.

One outcome of the COVID pandemic was an acceleration of the business imperative to use automation to more effectively respond to supply chain disruptions, market volatility and external world events. The negative aspects of automation, such as the impact on employment, customer experience, and community well-being, may suggest a methodical transition to some level of automation is prudent. Balancing automation with social responsibility and a commitment to human workers may be a compromise that the ILA and USMX will need to consider.

As the new year approaches, the impact of additional port strikes looms large over both retailers and consumers. If the ILA cannot come to an agreement with the USMX, especially with automation enhancements for the industry, the workers may end up on strike again. With the potential for product shortages, delayed shipments, and increased prices, the stakes are high. While some larger retailers may have the resources to mitigate these challenges, smaller businesses and budget-conscious consumers could bear the brunt of the disruption going into the new year if contract terms are not ratified by the workers. Both retailers and shoppers will need to stay agile and prepared for the potential hurdles ahead."
25 Dark Sky Places Where You'll See Comet A3 At Its Brightest And Best,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/10/08/25-dark-sky-places-where-youll-see-comet-a3-at-its-brightest-and-best/,2024-10-08T10:09:04Z,"All celestial objects look better when viewed in a dark sky. For comet A3 -- also called C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) -- that goes double. It may be brighter than most comets, yet it's diffuse, and properly appreciating its brightness and magnificent tail requires a dark sky.

Its movement across the sky makes it more complex. From around Oct. 12, when it will reach its closest to Earth, it should peak in brightness, but that advantage is likely to be lost because of its position close to the western horizon in twilight.

However, with each passing day, comet A3 will quickly speed away from the sun, getting higher up in the sky -- and staying in the sky until it gets dark -- though also likely decreasing in brightness. The brightening moon will also likely complicate things, but that will be on the opposite side of the sky.

The conclusion is this: if you want to see Comet A3, avoid light pollution. Being in an official International Dark Sky Place won't be crucially important -- because of the moon's phase -- but getting away from the city to a good, dark view down to the horizon will be.

Here are some Dark Sky Places with big horizons across the U.S. That should offer good viewing opportunities for Comet A3, but remember to take binoculars and/or a telescope to maximize your chances.

Comet A3 will get closest to Earth on Oct. 12, when it will pass about 44 million miles (71 million km) from Earth. That's arguably the best time to see it, but the observing window will be short because the comet will set only about 15 minutes after sunset.

However, the comet will set about 20 minutes later each night for the first week, making it far easier to see on Oct. 13-18. At the end of that period it will be in the night sky for about two hours after sunset.

During this time its dusty tail will reflect sunlight precisely because of its favorable position between the sun and Earth. It's known as ""forward scattering"" to astronomers because it scatters sunlight in the direction of Earth -- and into the eyes of observers."
Why You Must Not Update Your Browser -- 3 Billion Windows Users Warned,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/10/08/web-browser-security-update-windows-backdoor-warning-for-chromeedgefirefox/,2024-10-08T09:49:11Z,"Article after article, expert after expert, has drilled home the security message that you should always ensure your web browser is updated as soon as a security patch is made available. That message has not changed, but a nuance needs to be observed: how your browser update is applied. The warning not to update your browser comes following the discovery of a new threat campaign installing a Windows security backdoor disguised as updates of popular web browsers, including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox. Here's what you need to know.

Security researchers at Gen Threat Labs have warned users of the most popular web browser applications to be beware of an ongoing attack campaign targeting them by way of fake updates. A posting on X has warned that the attackers are distributing the WarmCookie Windows backdoor malware via compromised websites.

It would appear that the campaign is being run by a known group of criminal hackers going by the name of SocGolish, which is behind the sites that are either created or compromised to show fake browser update prompts when visitors land.

WarmCookie as a threat itself is not new, it can be dated back to late 2022 when threat intelligence researchers at eSentire spotted it being distributed by fake job sites. The switch to fake web browser security updates as a method to spread the malware is a facinorous one, to say the least. Not least because, along with most every other security professional and journalist covering the cybersecurity realm, I have been shouting the ""update now"" mantra for decades when it comes to patching security vulnerabilities in your browser.

That message, as such, hasn't actually changed. You should ensure that your web browser, whichever brand you choose to use, is updated as soon as possible following the release of a security patch. What you shouldn't do, and what this warning is ultimately all about, is update it by any means other than using the built-in tools. Most certainly avoid any pop-up or notification from a website asking you to download an update, no matter how realistic, genuine and pressing it might seem.

OK, first things first: you don't have to do anything. It's true. If you just leave things alone, your browser will automatically update itself to the latest version. Mostly. The problem of not updating is actually one of not activating the update, and this applies especially to those who keep dozens of tabs open and never close and restart the browser itself. This last step is required to activate the installed security update, which is why I always suggest people kickstart the process manually and as soon as possible after learning of the patch availability.

So, with this in mind, I recommend you still manually update your browser, even with the automatic updates feature in place. To do this for Chrome users and other browsers that will be similar, head to the Help|About option in the menu. If the update is available, it will automatically start downloading.

Then close all your tabs and hit the relaunch button, which will restart the browser and activate the patch."

A Missile Could Not Erase Russian Drone's Embarrassing Stealth Secret,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2024/10/08/russian-drones-embarrassing-stealth-secret-not-erased-by-a-missile/,2024-10-08T09:33:30Z,"Shooting down their own brand new drone on video when it went out of control over Ukraine may be one of the biggest embarrassments ever suffered by the Russian Air Force. But there may be worse to come.

The Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B (""Hunter-B"") was a prototype stealth combat drone, a 'loyal wingman' designed to operate alongside with the new Sukhoi Su-57 ""Felon"" fighter. After it was shot down by its accompanying Su-57, the Russians fired an Iskander missile at the crash suite to destroy the S-70 wreckage. Pictures show that well before the missile strike took place, the Ukrainians had already taken away key components for analysis.

That analysis is likely to be very embarrassing for the Russians - but maybe not for the reasons you might expect.

The technology of reducing how easily an aircraft can be seen on radar is technically known as 'signature reduction' and commonly known as stealth. While the general approach have been known since WWII, the idea of specifically designing an aircraft which would be effectively invisible to radar was revolutionary and highly classified.

Prototypes of the stealthy F-117 Nighthawk flew in the 70s but it was not until 1980 that Secretary of Defense Harold Brown officially announced the existence the new 'stealth technology.'

Nobody knew what the new stealth aircraft looked like and for years rumors swirled around about the appearance of a mysterious 'F-19 Stealth Fighter.' Several models were released supposedly based on insider information; none of looked like the F-117, suggesting an active misinformation campaign.

In July 1986 an F-117 piloted by Major Ross Mulhare of the 4450th Tactical Group, crashed into a hillside just inside the Sequoia National Forest, killing Mulhare instantly. There was considerable media interest in the mystery aircraft which was suspected to be a secret prototype.

The F-117 had been completely destroyed and a massive clean-up operation was instituted. An area a thousand feet around the crash site was cordoned off and every trace of wreckage was removed. Even the soil was sifted for buried fragments.

Once every trace had been removed , the Air Force brought in a crashed F-101 Voodoo held in storage for 20 years, broke it up and distributed the pieces around the crash site. The media, including a team from Bakersfield's KERO-TV were then given access and permitted to take pictures of the fake wreckage.

The F-117 was not publicly acknowledged until 1988, and its appearance not revealed until 1990.

Thirteen years after Mulhare's crash, when an F-117 was shot down by Serbian forces, many commentators expected the USAF to bomb the wreckage to preserve its secrets. However, by this time the F-117s stealth technology, developed some twenty years earlier, was considered outdated and no effort was made to destroy it. Parts of the aircraft with once-secret radar absorbing material are on display in the Museum of Aviation in Belgrade.

Stealth is achieved mainly by careful shaping of the airframe, avoiding straight lines and sharp corners which reflect radar. However, ensuring that the surface minimized radar reflection is also crucial.

One of the original stealth coatings or Radar Absorbing Materials (RAM) was a special paint known as 'Iron Ball,' which contained metallic particles. The right size and shape of particle of the right metal can absorb radio waves and dissipate them as heat rather than reflecting them.

Stealth aircraft may also incorporate radar absorbent structures, honeycombs of material which trap and disperse radar waves.

Finding an effective combination of materials and structures to minimize visibility to particular wavelengths of radar from particular directions is a tricky and complex discipline with many tradeoffs. New metamaterials - which can in principle be used to make an 'invisibility cloak' - are used extensively in current stealth research.

Russia initially paid little attention to stealth technology, but in recent years they have claimed advances in this area and the new Su-57 is described as a stealth fighter with a far smaller radar signature than previous generations. According to Russian officials, the S-70 drone is ""made with the use of special materials and coatings that make it practically invisible to radars.""

After the S-70 was shot down, the Russians hit the crash site with an Iskander ballistic missile. These missiles are scarce and expensive, and diverting one from the campaign against Ukraine's cities suggests this was a high priority target. There are several reasons why the Russians would want to stop the West from recovering the drone wreckage.

The least likely is that NATO would gain technology it could reverse-engineer and use in its own aircraft. Nobody seriously thinks Russia is ahead in this field, and even Russia's optimistic claims for the Su-57 indicate it is far less stealthy than Western aircraft.

More significant is the risk that Western engineers could discover what wavelengths the S-70 has been designed to counter from what angles, and which ones it will still be visible to. This information could go some wat to nullifying the S-70's stealth capability. Given that is a relatively big, slow and expensive drone, if its stealth is compromised it will become far less useful.

Even more serious is that the S-70 was designed alongside the Su-57, Russia's showpiece next -generation combat aircraft, and likely uses the same stealth materials and techniques. If the West can see how S-70 stealth works, they could get a pretty good insight in to how to defeat the Su-57 too.

But there is a more likely explanation of what the Russians are really trying to hide. And that is that the Emperor has no clothes, that their stealth technology is non-existent.

We have already seen some indications that Russian stealth is not up to scratch. In 2023, Ukrainian engineers were able to analyze the remains of a Russian Kh-101/ X-101 long-range cruise missile which supposedly has an anti-radar coating. According to Ukrainian news site Defense Express, this is not the case.

""The results of research show that despite Russian claims, Kh-101 is not covered with a special paint that reduces reflection of radiation,"" says Defense News. ""All the Russian stories about RAM coating on the Kh-101 body turned out to be nothing but propaganda.""

Similarly, when the Russians recently published images of the new Su-57, Western analysts were horrified by its crude finish. Stealth aircraft need to have a perfectly smooth surface, as even slight projections can significantly affect radar return. The B-2 bomber is notorious for its demanding stealth maintenance requirements with the need to apply radar-absorbing tape to specific surfaces and thousandth-of-an-inch tolerances. The Su-57 has bare screw heads and rivets all over the wing and fuselage, suggesting poor stealth qualities.

Given Russia's culture, it is quite possible that even senior commanders are not aware of these shortcomings in their stealth technology. Nobody ever wants to report bad news, and Russian defense contractors know how to pay off procurement officials all the way to the top.

The Russian leadership may be about to find out that their expensive, much-hyped invisible drone is not in fact stealthy at all. And they will find out by reading it in the public media."
"Real Madrid Star Considers Future After Ancelotti Fall Out, Reports OK Diario",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomsanderson/2024/10/08/real-madrid-star-considers-future-after-ancelotti-fall-out-reports-ok-diario/,2024-10-08T09:33:23Z,"Real Madrid star Arda Guler is unhappy with head coach Carlo Ancelotti and is considering his future according to OK Diario director Eduardo Inda, who reported this news while citing anonymous sources on the popular Spanish football television show El Chiringuito.

The Turkish international famously turned down FC Barcelona and a string of other clubs to join Madrid in 2023, but has been used sparingly in two seasons thus far.

This term is only 10 La Liga games deep, yet injuries piling up at the Bernabeu should have meant that the youngster, able to play in midfield or on the front line, enjoyed more protagonism in recent weeks.

With Kylian Mbappe sidelined, Arda expected to have some involvement in the recent derby against crosstown rivals Atletico Madrid but was reportedly left angry by Ancelotti not handing him a single minute.

Rather than starting Arda on the right hand side of a trio also containing Vinicius Jr. and Rodrygo, Ancelotti instead reshifted back to the 4-4-2 of the treble-winning 2023/2024 campaign which has the Brazilian wingers acting as a pair of strikers up front.

When it came time to add some attacking impetus in the fiery, physically and emotionally draining 1-1 tie at the Metropolitano, the manager instead Endrick while the other two of a possible five substitutions were full backs Lucas Vazquez and Franc Garcia.

The 19-year-old wasn't left happy with the snub, with Inda reporting how ""they tell me that there is trouble with Arda Güler, that he is quite angry about his situation, that he plays rather little"".

""He has started two games out of 13, he has played 290 minutes of 1,170 that Real Madrid has played. There is trouble with him,"" Inda added.

Inda also explained how he has been told that Ancelotti doesn't like Arda ""very much"" because he says ""lacks spirit and physicality.""

While OK Diario further writes that Arda respects Ancelotti's decision and ""will continue to work with humility to earn more minutes"", SPORT reports that his circumstances ""may lead the player to consider his future"".

""He has five years left on his contract, but he could ask to leave either on loan or even [be] transferred,"" adds the daily newspaper."
"Bowmore Upgrades To Stand Out In Travel Retail Stores, Moves Into D2C",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinrozario/2024/10/08/bowmore-upgrades-to-stand-out-in-travel-retail-stores-moves-into-d2c/,2024-10-08T09:29:31Z,"A major comms campaign comes to life in travel retail and domestic markets this fall as Suntory Global Spirits looks to further elevate one of its prized Scotch whisky assets: the Islay-based Bowmore. The aim is to make it more relevant to traveling shoppers and raise its profile among domestic buyers.

The permanent portfolio of Bowmore single malt whiskies is also getting a refresh, with a new bottle shape and a new livery rolling out in early 2025 featuring the revival of an old symbol of Islay; the sea dragon Kranadu. The house has been in existence for almost 250 years (since 1779) and it is investing now to retain and enhance its luxury position in the market.

Premiumisation is a continuing feature of the travel retail channel, though it has lost some momentum in local markets according to drinks analyst IWSR. Its robustness in duty-free was amply demonstrated in several spirits segments at the Tax Free World Association ((TFWA) exhibition in Cannes, France.

The show -- the annual meeting place for the global duty-free industry -- celebrated its 40 anniversary and saw big liquor groups like Bacardi, Campari, Diageo, and Edrington showcasing their latest products, with elevation strategies very much to the fore.

In the case of Bowmore, two new ranges have been revealed: a sherry cask collection for domestic markets, and a four-strong range exclusive to travel markets like airports. ""Travel retail is such an important channel for us, and this collection reflects that,"" said Bowmore's marketing manager Ekaterina Kolesnik.

To boost Bowmore's desirability and collectability within the crowded single malt market, the two new collections reflect the spectrum of what the house can offer in terms of flavor profiles, with wider choice and variety than in the past.

The travel-retail-exclusive series is called Bowmore Appellations and takes a terroir-based approach, collaborating with producers from some of the world's greatest wine-producing regions for their distinctive finishes. They include Burgundy, Bordeaux, and Portugal's Douro Valley.

To differentiate from typical age statements, Bowmore is running with 14-, 16-, 19-, and 22-year-old products, all of them matured in American oak ex-bourbon casks. Approximate pricing increases with age; respectively $66, $108, $200, and $500. Historically, Bowmore's expressions and bottlings have utilized some of the regional wine casks mentioned.

Travelers have the pick of a 14yo Bowmore finished in Bordeaux barriques; a 16-year-old matured in European oak sherry casks as well as American oak ex-bourbon casks and finished in Douro ruby port casks; a 19-year-old finished in Pinot Noir casks from Burgundy; and the 22-year old finished in Sauternes casks for a sweeter, fruitier character.

""The new travel retail range sings in comparison to what we've had before,"" said Suntory Global Spirits senior marketing manager for prestige brands, Kshama Alu, referring to the more vibrant packaging. ""It's striking. One of the things we'll do is really bring the individual variants alive and talk through their diversity.""

From October, the collection will start its retail rollout in global hubs airports starting with London Heathrow and Singapore Changi airports with pop-ups. Manuel Gonzalez, Suntory Global Spirits' brand marketing director for global travel retail, commented: ""Travel retail is a key showroom for our global brands. Traveling consumers expect high-quality product innovation and authenticity to elevate their airport shopping experience.""

Not to be outdone, domestic will also get a four-strong Bowmore sherry oak collection showcasing how European oak sherry casks can also create depth and flavor. The age statements here are more familiar with the collection comprising a 12-, 15-, 18-, and 21-year-old with respective pricing at approximately $78, $152, $262, and topping out at $535.

This range started its rollout in September into whisky specialists like The Whisky Exchange, and luxury retail outlets like Harrods in global cities like London, Paris, New York, Toronto, and Munich from 2024.

In terms of the brand transformation, Kirsteen Beeston, Bowmore's marketing director, commented: ""We have a duty of care as custodians of this incredible distillery to capture its true essence. As such, we decided to evolve the world that surrounds the brand."" This spans the creative expression, experience, and level of innovation.

The new brand livery adds a touch of modernity but retains the distillery's character using subtle organic line work in the design with a dominant use of the color black, a signature of the brand that also pays homage to one its most iconic whiskies -- Black Bowmore distilled in 1964.

The Bowmore.com website has also just been relaunched with direct-to-consumer shopping coming soon for the first time."
These Upstart French Hotels Are Making Provence More Enticing Than Ever,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/annabel/2024/10/08/these-upstart-french-hotels-are-making-provence-more-enticing-than-ever/,2024-10-08T09:18:42Z,"The boutique Capelongue hotel is the epitome of modern, relaxed French hospitality. Its renovation and expansion earlier this year cements Beaumier's status as a luxury hotel brand to know.

The news from Capelongue was big. The tiny boutique hotel -- with a devoted following among lovers of a certain stripe of modern French hospitality -- opened for its summer season this year nearly four times its original size. This could have made it feel like a brand-new arrival on the luxury travel scene. Instead, it landed with an appealing timelessness and a compelling invitation to slow down, settle in and soak up the dreaminess of Provence.

It's no fluke that the marketing for the hotel -- and the whole brand it's part of -- strikes a soft-focus, retro tone. Beaumier is a French group with ten small hotels away from well-trodden cities, mostly in the French Alps and Provence, plus outposts in the Côte d'Azur, Switzerland and Ibiza. Since its founding in 2011 (as Les Hôtels d'en Haut), the group has remained committed to stunning natural settings, collaborations with residential (not hospitality) designers, and a distinctly French sort of storytelling.

The photos are overexposed, the typefaces are old-fashioned, and many of the colors would have looked at home in a 1970s kitchen. Classic travel posters come to mind. Looking at the images, it's not immediately clear whether they're vintage family photos, archival brochures, or some canny 2024 branding. In any case, it has an effortlessness and an agelessness that beguile.

The same is true of the new Capelongue itself. The hotel is laid out like a miniature village overlooking the living village of Bonnieux in the sun-bleached Petit Luberon. It is the embodiment of Provençal slow living. The hotel's original 16 rooms occupy one corner of the grounds, while across the road, 41 new accommodations are spread through several stone structures. Each room opens directly to the outdoors, like a private cottage of so many travel fantasies, and they all look over the gardens, swimming pools or old stone structures on the grounds.

The heart of the hotel is still a central fountain square. Café tables fill one corner, offering a place to sip or snack on fare from the café inside. A handful of rooms are in the building beside the square, as well as the Michelin-star restaurant, La Bastide. There, chef Noël Bérard turns out tasting menus using products from the on-site gardens and nearby, such as crunchy celery with black truffle from Méthamis and creamy vegetable blanquette sauce, and grilled Sisteron lamb with lavender honey and carrots with poutargue (fish roe).

Apart from a property tour, I never went here. Nor, I suspect, did many of the other guests. The lure of French country living was too strong in the new part of the hotel -- reading in the lounge chairs on the terrace of each room, lazing in the sun beside the long swimming pool, walking through the lavender-fragrant gardens, giggling at pétanque, or eating simply but well in the hotel's casual restaurant.

Le Bergerie (""the sheepfold""), which was also redesigned and expanded, is centered on a fireplace and hearth. It's a showplace for Mathieu Guivarch's straightforward Provençal cooking. The proteins have pedigree: Sault charcuterie, Sisteron lamb shank, Mont Ventoux pork belly.

The local and the simple also shine in the decoration. This was the vision of the French design duo Jaune, who worked with the branding and architecture studio A.S.L. Paris to distill the region's charms. The rooms and suites are tricked out in a palette of white and ochre, with benches and chairs woven with straw. In the corridors and restaurants, vintage pieces share space with those from emerging artists, creating a look that's both rural and contemporary. The Librairie du Palais in Arles curated the collection on the floor-to-ceiling shelves of the Capelongue library.

As Beaumier's CEO, Éric Darde, says, ""Nothing is missing, nothing is forced. Everything is there, available, to fully recharge your batteries.""

While the designers of Capelongue intended for it to work as a fancified Provençal village, the real thing is a short walk away. Bonnieux is a hilly little hamlet with steep streets and limited parking, both of which keep big crowds away. It's prettily kept, but with authenticity and understatement.

There's more going on in nearby Loumarin, one of the most beautiful villages in the region. A 12th-century castle stands above the houses; lively restaurants, cafés, galleries and boutiques line its cobblestone streets. The village squares fill with people sipping rosé. And its Friday market is said to be one of the best in the region.

Loumarin is home to two more Beaumier hotels. Le Galinier occupies an 18th-century bastide -- a typical country house in Provence -- and operates as a bed-and-breakfast. And Le Moulin is a full-service hotel in an old oil mill in the heart of the village.

The 25 rooms at Le Moulin -- also the work of Jaune -- are decorated with off-white and mustard yellow, raw wood and handcrafted earthenware. On the top floor, a handful of rooms open onto a terrace and overlook the village's russet-colored tile rooftops. Their beauty is subtle and functional; it's the sort of place where you appreciate the lines of the hinges on the window shutters.

A highlight is the restaurant, Bacheto, which occupies the old press room. Antique machinery is still subtly on display, tucked into alcoves along one of the walls. Its name comes from a word in the local language that relates to sharing meals, and its plates follow the same format.

As at any self-respecting restaurant, especially in this part of the world, the menu changes with the seasons, but the idea is Provençal classics revisited with spices and influences from afar -- heirloom tomatoes with black olive crumble, hay-smoked stracciatella with figs and duck breast, chickpea salad with pickles and sweet spices.

Their aim, they say, is a cuisine that's ""the definition of traditional modernity."" Which turns out to be a good tagline for the Beaumier brand as a whole. Even its big additions have an instant sense of belonging."

NASA has released the clearest view of Mars to date, with blue rocks observed across the planet's landscape.

The images were captured by the Perseverance rover as it explores the planet.

Dark blue, jagged rocks of volcanic basalt were found on top of the dried remains of an ancient lakebed, according to the Daily Mail.

10 FUN FACTS ABOUT MARS, ALSO KNOWN AS THE RED PLANET

NASA found the boulders on what has been dubbed ""Mount Washburn,"" a rocky field on the Jezero crater, where an ancient lake is believed to have been located billions of years ago.

The name ""Mount Washburn"" was given to the field of rocks in honor of a mountain in Yellowstone National Park.

The rover came upon a white-striped rock within the field of blue boulders. The Perseverance science team nicknamed the light-toned boulder with dark speckles ""Atoko Point.""

While the blue rocks are primarily volcanic basalt, which is typical of Martian terrain, NASA concluded that ""Atoko Point"" is made of anorthosite-a silica-rich volcanic rock, which has never been documented on Mars.

UFC star assisting in Helene rescue efforts says FEMA abandoned North Carolina: 'Still woefully absent',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ufc-star-assisting-helene-rescue-efforts-says-fema-abandoned-north-carolina-still-woefully-absent,2024-10-08T09:16:17Z,"Save Our Allies co-founder Tim Kennedy said FEMA has 'every priority wrong' when it comes to Hurricane Helene recovery efforts and called out the North Carolina governor's response as his organization works to help provide aid and support.

Tim Kennedy, former UFC star and Save Our Allies founder, scolded FEMA for being ""woefully absent"" in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene as his group and other private organizations continue to play a critical role in the recovery effort.

In an appearance on ""America's Newsroom"" Monday, Kennedy described the scene on the ground in hurricane-ravaged North Carolina, revealing that he pleaded with FEMA to hand over control of the recovery efforts to the U.S. military after seeing first hand the alleged lack of preparedness from the state and federal government.

FEMA ACCUSED OF PLAYING THE VICTIM AFTER INSISTING CRITICISM OF HELENE HANDLING IS 'DANGEROUS'

""What was clearly absent was the state and federal response. The men and women that showed up from FEMA, that is still woefully absent, there was no command and control. We were begging and pleading for the state to hand over command to the United States military... I wanted real leaders to understand a warlike scenario, this is what it is like to take control. It was absolutely broken,"" Kennedy, a former Green Beret, said.

""The men and women on the ground were doing the best they can. But FEMA has every priority wrong,"" he continued. ""They didn't know what to do or where to do it or how to access these mountains. They were turning people away trying to deliver funds. They're telling helicopters to land, the president's coming in and creating a no-fly zone while we're doing airborne evacuations. None of it made sense...for FEMA to come and start impeding the efforts of organizations like ours trying to get into deliver goods. It is unconscionable.""

FEMA has come under fire for a purportedly inadequate response to the devastation left by Helene. As of last Friday, the death toll in southeastern states hit the hardest by the storm has risen past 224, with more than 100 dead in western North Carolina alone.

Former President Trump, Republican elected officials, Elon Musk and volunteers have spoken out against the government's response to the hurricane, as crews continue searching for missing people and bodies across the affected region.

NORTH CAROLINA SENS. TILLIS, BUDD CALL FOR MILITARY LEADER TO OVERSEE HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson slammed the agency's relief efforts as an ""abject failure"" while Republican Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, both of North Carolina, urged the Biden administration to appoint a military leader to lead the recovery effort, sounding the alarm about the inadequate local response to the catastrophic flooding.

FEMA defended its response to Helene in a statement to FOX Business, stating that ""FEMA is continuing to work with our federal family and state and local partners in the impacted areas to effectively bring in life-saving resources to the people and communities who need it most.

""As of Oct. 3. FEMA has deployed more than 11.5 million Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), over 12.6 million liters of water, more than 400,000 tarps and 150 generators to areas impacted by Helene,"" FEMA's Director of Public Affairs Jaclyn Rothenberg said.

The agency also said it created a rumor response page to combat misinformation or online narratives about their handling of the hurricane.

After repeated calls for military intervention, 1,000 active-duty soldiers with the 101st and 82nd airborne divisions were dispatched to North Carolina Sunday to support the ongoing search-and rescue efforts.

""Nobody does it better than the men and women in the American military,"" Kennedy said.

Kennedy also credited nonprofit organizations like Save Our Allies, Samaritans Purse and others for stepping up to fill the void of an inadequate government response.

""While nobody could get through roads ...we are taking four-wheelers and getting in there...,"" he said.

""We're doing health and welfare checks and we're flying into deliver stuff...we have made multiple runs into Charlotte to pick up more body bags because the number just keeps rising and rising and rising. But once you get to that door, you don't know if somebody will answer the door or hug you and just be so grateful, which happened time and time again, or you start smelling what clearly is going to be a recovery operation instead of a rescue operation,"" he told host Dana Perino.

""I've never been more proud of the response from private citizens.""

Kennedy praised Helene victims in North Carolina for their resilience, revealing that many people have turned down items or assistance for fear of taking it from someone who may need it more than they do.

""It just breaks your heart,"" he said. ""These people are so tough they don't want to take it from somebody that might need it even though it's clear that they desperately need it."""
"Next presidential administration has to 'get serious' about immigration, say voters in key battleground state",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/next-presidential-administration-get-serious-about-immigration-say-voters-key-battleground-state,2024-10-08T09:15:40Z,"MARICOPA COUNTY, Ariz. - Immigration and border security are top concerns among Arizona residents, but voters Fox News Digital spoke with were split on whether former President Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris is better suited to tackle the issue.

""We have to have swifter incarceration at the border,"" Mary from Phoenix said. ""And if there's a suspicion that they're going to commit a crime, lock them up.""

More than 425,000 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions are currently out of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, according to data provided to lawmakers late last month. That includes more than 13,000 people convicted of homicide and nearly 16,000 convicted of sexual assault, according to ICE.

IMMIGRANT MURDER CONVICTIONS 'TENS OF THOUSANDS' HIGHER THAN ICE'S BOMBSHELL FIGURES: DATA EXPERT

""That is pretty tragic,"" Bob from Tempe said when asked about the data. ""The whole immigration needs to be reformed, and they need to get serious about it.""

Mary and Bob both thought Harris would do a better job of addressing immigration. Mary said Harris and Biden had a ""strong immigration bill before the Senate"" this past spring before Trump rallied his allies to block the legislation.

""That was infuriating,"" she said. ""And they all marched in step. So I know that if Kamala gets in, she will get it signed.""

But Nick from Sun City West said Harris' immigration policy has been ""dismal at best.""

""Control the border,"" he said. ""At least keep the border safe. Keep people from being able to get in that aren't supposed to be able to come in unless they come in through the regular normal channels.""

BATTLEGROUND SENATE CANDIDATE UNLOADS ON 'RADICAL' DEM OPPONENT FOR DISPARAGING TRUMP VOTERS

Trump narrowly leads Harris in the presidential contest in Arizona, according to a recent Fox News poll. Biden won the state in 2020 by less than half a percentage point, making him the first Democrat to capture the state since Bill Clinton in 1996.

In the Fox News poll, 56% of Arizona voters surveyed said they trust Trump to do a better job on the border, compared to 41% who preferred Harris.

""It sucks. Excuse my language,"" Greg from Phoenix said of Harris' handling of the immigration crisis. ""It's just bad. They need to keep track of people.""

Brian, also from Phoenix, said immigration is his top voting priority this year because it impacts ""almost every issue, one way or the other."" He's hoping the Grand Canyon State swings back to Trump this time around.

""He's been consistent [on the border],"" Brian said, adding that Harris, who visited the southern border last month for the first time since 2021, has been ""hypocritical.""

Brian said, ""She wasn't around, and now she is. That's politicians."""
"Early voting kicks off in Indiana, New Mexico, Ohio, Wyoming",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/early-voting-indiana-new-mexico-ohio-wyoming,2024-10-08T09:15:20Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Four more states began their early voting processes on Tuesday: Indiana, New Mexico, Wyoming and the major swing state of Ohio.

Here is everything you need to know about casting a ballot in each of the states.

Ohio is home to one of the most competitive Senate races on the map.

Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown has won the Midwestern state three times, but with Trump pushing White working-class voters toward the GOP and record spending from both parties, this is set to be a tight race. Brown faces Republican businessman Bernie Moreno.

Republicans have made inroads in the northeastern and heavily industrial areas bordering Pennsylvania. Trumbull County flipped to the GOP in 2016, and Trump increased his margin to 10 points in 2020; Mahoning County flipped in 2020 by almost two points. These counties played a key role in Trump's statewide wins.

Democrats are performing better than ever in the ""three C's"": Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. These areas have the highest percentages of college-educated voters. President Biden won the counties home to these cities by double-digit margins in 2020, with roughly 30-point wins in Franklin (Columbus) and Cuyahoga (Cleveland).

Unlike in other competitive states, Republicans still hold up in Ohio's suburban and exurban areas, particularly those surrounding Cincinnati.

Ohio's Senate race is a toss-up and the presidential race is ranked Likely R on the Fox News Power Rankings.

Meanwhile, New Mexico is also in the ""likely"" column, both at the presidential and senate level. The state delivered Biden an 11-point win in 2020, but Latino or Hispanic voters made up 35% of the state's electorate in the 2020 election, and those voters' support for the Democrat ticket has wavered in recent polls.

Republicans would need to run up their margins with these voters all across the state and keep Harris at bay in places like Doña Ana County, home to Albuquerque and which last voted for Biden by 18 points, to pull off a victory.

Voting also begins today in four House districts ranked Lean or Toss Up on the Fox News Power Rankings. For a full list of competitive races, see the latest Senate and House rankings.

"Kamala Harris set for extremely friendly interview blitz with 'The View,' Stephen Colbert and Howard Stern",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-set-extremely-friendly-interview-blitz-the-view-stephen-colbert-howard-stern,2024-10-08T09:14:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris will sit for a trio of interviews Tuesday, but don't expect a thorough grilling at any of them from some of the media's most fervent Democratic Party supporters.

Harris will make appearances with ABC's ""The View,"" radio star Howard Stern and CBS late-night comic Stephen Colbert, all hosts of extremely friendly venues for the Democratic candidate who have repeatedly railed against her opponent.

The co-hosts of ""The View,"" a talk-show under ABC's news division, have repeatedly expressed support for Harris and devote segments on an almost daily basis to attacking former President Trump as a threat to democracy.

The co-hosts quickly got behind the vice president in September in their season premiere after President Biden dropped out of the race and praised her ""flawless"" campaign.

ABC'S 'THE VIEW' WAS 100% NEGATIVE ABOUT TRUMP FOLLOWING ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: STUDY

Harris did an about-face on multiple far-left policies she openly supported when she ran for president in 2020, including on fracking, the Green New Deal, and on getting rid of private health insurance. Liberal co-host Sunny Hostin argued in early September that the vice president had always been ""moderate.""

""People evolve and grow,"" Whoopi Goldberg said, dismissing Harris' flip-flops during the discussion. ""The difference, perhaps now, is that someone has actually admitted it.""

Co-host Joy Behar even recently demanded Republicans vote Democrat to ""save the country.""

The show's two Republican hosts, former Trump aide Alyssa Farah Griffin and Ana Navarro, join the liberal hosts in criticizing the former president as an existential threat to the nation. Navarro even hosted night two of the Democratic National Convention in August.

""For me to have the chance to stand on that stage and help my girl, Kamala, make history, and become the Democratic nominee, it's just such a mind-blowing moment,"" Navarro said.

Griffin has not emphatically endorsed the vice president, but plans to headline an anti-Trump event in Pennsylvania alongside other anti-Trump Republicans such as Liz Cheney, who has endorsed Harris.

Navarro touted the Harris interview on ""The View"" and said her Tuesday media blitz was evidence the vice president was facing tough questions. CNN's Brian Stelter also suggested on Monday that the co-hosts of ""The View"" would have ""sharp"" questions for Harris on Tuesday.

Late-night comedy has become a hotbed for Democratic Party support in recent years, but Colbert has taken it to another level with his fawning monologues and interviews in recent years.

Colbert hosted a fundraiser alongside Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and President Biden in March, prior to Biden dropping out of the race. The star-studded Democratic fundraiser brought in over $25 million for Biden's campaign. In 2020, he popped champagne on the air over Biden and Harris winning the election.

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

Colbert's political and media guests have almost solely consisted of Democrats and liberal media figures. Colbert has hosted Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, CNN's Abby Phillip, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, MSNBC's Alex Wagner, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, Hillary Clinton, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Mark Kelly, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, CNN's Anderson Cooper, Bill Gates, MSNBC's Chris Hayes, and more.

Stern, who had the rare chance to sit down with Biden before he dropped out, has said he ""hates"" anyone who supports Donald Trump.

""I don't agree with Trump politically, I don't think he should be anywhere near the White House. I don't hate the guy. I hate the people who vote for him. I think they're stupid. I do. I'll be honest with you, I have no respect for you,"" Stern said during one of his shows in September.

The blitz this week follows a ""60 Minutes"" appearance and an interview on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast. Media analysts said Harris' approach of doing more softball interviews made sense given some of her shortcomings.

""Harris tends not to communicate effectively, whether it's her long-winded, non-answer answers or her demeanor, so for her it does make more sense to appear in friendly venues,"" said communications expert Tobe Berkovitz, a Professor Emeritus at Boston University.

Even Harris' other interviews before Tuesday have skewed toward being friendly, such as with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle. Lesley Lopez, a public affairs professional and assistant professor at George Washington University, dismissed the idea that Harris was erring by avoiding difficult interviews.

""One man's so-called bubble campaign is another's strategic earned media plan. I think her campaign is being really targeted in the final days of an election where the margins are slim,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who is now a Fox News host, said the trio of friendly interviews is a ""great idea"" but questioned the timing as Hurricane Milton has strengthened into a Category 5 monster storm heading towards Florida.

""I would have her, if I was on her team, in FEMA headquarters in the mornings, then you can go out and do a campaign stop, and then back to FEMA headquarters,"" McEnany said Monday on ""Outnumbered."""
Kirk Cameron urges Americans of faith to 'be brave' and 'vote their values' this election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kirk-cameron-urges-americans-faith-be-brave-vote-values-election,2024-10-08T09:14:40Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Kirk Cameron is urging people of faith to be more politically active, saying America's freedom and future depends on it.

""[If] the family of faith does not show up and vote their values, well, that just leaves a great big vacuum and others will gladly rush in to fill the void, and then you end up burning the whole thing down from the inside,"" he warned.

The actor, author and Christian activist is releasing a new nonfiction novel on Tuesday called ""Born to be Brave: How to be a Part of America's Spiritual Comeback."" Cameron sees the current political and cultural strife as an opportunity for Americans of faith to reclaim their ""birthright of courage"" and lead the nation in a ""spiritual comeback.""

""I believe with all my heart that it is and that God did not create us and rescue us through the Gospel to be cowards,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""And that we have a birthright of courage, and if we will lean into that courage as people of faith and live out our values and put feet to our faith in love, we can and will realign the nation with Heaven's values.""

SCROLLING TOWARD SALVATION: CHRISTIAN TIKTOKERS INSPIRE FAITH IN INCREASINGLY SECULAR YOUNG AMERICANS

With the presidential election just a few weeks away, that message is especially timely. Cameron explains in his new book how voters should understand how Christianity shaped America's founding and how the freedoms and values Americans enjoy are dependent on preserving that faith foundation.

""I'm amazed at how many people don't understand the fundamental principles of how nations and governments are run,"" Cameron told Fox News Digital. ""Every nation is built on some set of presuppositions; a worldview, a philosophy of life, a value set, a religion.""

""In the words of Noah Webster, who was one of our founding fathers ... he said every civil government is based on some religion or philosophy of life, and the education of that nation will propagate the religion of that nation,"" Cameron continued. ""He said in America that foundational religion was Christianity, and it was sown into their hearts for two centuries through the home and school, public and private.""

Webster, a famous American educator who published the Blue-Back Speller in 1783, believed that America's prosperity relied on preserving the nation's Christian values for future generations, Cameron explained.

""So the whole thing -- from the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence -- only works if you understand that the foundation needs to be the biblical, moral, spiritual values that the founders were standing on when they wrote it. And if that goes away, the whole thing crumbles.""

KIRK CAMERON ANNOUNCES NEW NONFICTION BOOK, 'BORN TO BE BRAVE,' ABOUT A 'SPIRITUAL COMEBACK' IN AMERICA

""And so if the family of faith does not show up and vote their values, well, that just leaves a great big vacuum and others will gladly rush in to fill the void, and then you end up burning the whole thing down from the inside,"" he warned.

Suggestions that people of faith want ""a theocracy"" or are ""Christian nationalists"" are just slurs ""thrown onto people who love God, family and their country"" by people ""who would love to see America crumble because of the values it was built on and its sovereignty as a nation,"" he said.

Cameron says he's seen the ""rumblings of revival"" already in his travels across the nation through his interactions with families at his patriotic book readings at public libraries across America with Brave Books. This year's ""See You at the Library"" event in August drew 30,000 people at libraries across the nation, he said.

""I feel the rumblings of revival. People are waking up and parents are saying, you know, our forefathers and foremothers didn't spill their blood in vain. They didn't suffer and sacrifice and go through all the things that they did to give us the freest, strongest, most blessed and generous nation in the world for us to just hand it away on our watch,"" Cameron told Fox News Digital.

""They want to get involved, and they want to know how to overcome their worry, stress, anxiety and fear because the opposition look so big. And that's what I want to give them in my book is the antidote to fear. And that courage is not the absence of fear. It's the overcoming of it. It's feeling afraid and doing the right thing anyway. And there's reasons why we can do that. And it has to do with history. It has to do with the promises of God in his word and real life stories of people today who are acting bravely and making a massive difference out of their love for God and their love for people,"" he continued.

Cameron is working on other projects offering alternative entertainment and educational materials for families.

He finished shooting the second season for a new children's television show called, ""Adventures with Iggy and Mr. Kirk,"" which he describes as a ""modernized Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.""

""It's live action, it's animation, it's pro-God, pro-America, it's biblical values. And kids get to FaceTime and send videos in, and we answer their questions about the topic, whether it's gender reality, whether it's about humility versus pride, or it's about kindness and compassion. Or maybe it's about capitalism versus socialism. These are all topics that, whether we want to believe it or not, as parents, Disney and Nickelodeon are already teaching our children,"" he said."
Trump vs. Harris: The 'October surprise' is already here,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-vs-harris-october-surprise-already-here,2024-10-08T09:13:18Z,"The infamous ""October surprise"" - the black swan event that could bend the arc of the 2024 presidential election -- has arrived.

Hurricane Helene, which clobbered the Southeast recently, is not the surprise; after all, October is hurricane season, and we expect big storms. Rather, it is the disgraceful aftermath - the shockingly poor and tone-deaf response from Vice President Kamala Harris and the White House, the administration lying about FEMA spending hundreds of millions of dollars on illegal immigrants and then warning that emergency funds for hurricane victims may run short. The frantic warnings from liberal news organizations that complaints about the government's relief efforts are ""misinformation"" and speculation that the tardy recovery effort might prevent Trump voters from participating in the upcoming election.

For Harris' campaign, it was the perfect storm. And, it could get even worse as monster Hurricane Milton barrels into Florida, creating even more challenges for the incapable White House.

KJP SLAMMED AFTER HURRICANE HELENE OVER MIXED MESSAGES ON WHETHER FEMA RESOURCES USED FOR MIGRANTS

As early rescue efforts began, Homeland Security head Alejandro Mayorkas announced the federal government was close to running out of funds to help hurricane relief efforts. He said FEMA was ""meeting immediate needs"" but that ""FEMA does not have the funds, to make it through the season."" That, despite President Biden recently signing a stopgap funding bill that included an extra $20 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. And, despite Mayorkas three months ago assuring the nation that FEMA was ""tremendously prepared"" for hurricane season. Now that Milton threatens even more damage, where will Mayorkas find the funds necessary for the recovery of yet another blockbuster storm?

Soon after, Mayorkas issued that ominous warning about federal fund running low, as bodies were still being discovered in the western towns of North Carolina and thousands were without power or water, Harris posted this on X: ""I am concerned about the security and well-being of civilians suffering in Lebanon and will continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians there. To that end, the United States will provide nearly $157 million in additional assistance to the people of Lebanon for essential needs such as food, shelter, water, protection, and sanitation...""

Talk about tone deaf!

The idea...the idea, as an irate Joe Biden might say, that suffering Americans might take second chair to war victims in the Middle East is repugnant and ignited a firestorm on social media. Yes, the federal government budget is vast - too vast- and agencies that send aid overseas are separate from those that help with emergencies at home. But the impression given those trying to dig out from Helene is that their needs were not Kamala's priority.

That impression was reinforced by Harris and President Biden taking five days to finally visit the storm-damaged Southeast. That's the same number of days it took President George W. Bush to travel to Texas in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Voters read Bush's delay as a sign of indifference; his popularity never recovered.

When Kamala Harris finally arrived at the scene, she announced that FEMA would be giving out $750 checks for immediate aid. Families whose homes and lives had been swallowed by a tsunami of mud were incredulous; $750 does not go very far. FEMA was further mocked for putting out a statement encouraging people, who had no power or cell service, to apply for assistance online or by phone.

Critics were outraged by the paltry sum. Donald Trump Jr. posted on X: ""$750 for Americans in desperate need... $250 BILLION spent in Ukraine with a population of +\- 38 million equals a bit more than $6500 per person in F$&?ing UKRAINE!!! For what? Enough of this madness!""

To be fair, Harris also announced that the feds would in the future provide ""tens of thousands more dollars for folks to help them be able to deal with home repair"" and other needs. In the future.

Our government is not only spending billions on the people of Lebanon and the war in Ukraine; it is also supporting the millions of migrants that Border Czar Harris allowed to enter our country illegally. The Biden-Harris White House and sanctuary cities rolled out the welcome mat, encouraging illegal immigration with free housing, free food, cell phones and other goodies. FEMA has helped fund that effort, leading critics to charge that the Biden-Harris White House is putting people in the country illegally ahead of our own citizens.

White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre has adamantly denied that FEMA money has been spent on illegal immigrants. But there is video of her saying on September 16, 2022, that funding was available ""through FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter Program.... to support humanitarian relief for migrants."" In fact, the agency's Shelter and Services Program (SSP) spent $650 million in fiscal 2023 to assist migrants.

Unhappily, it is not just money that has been in short supply. Help has come too slowly, and some blame the federal government. Reports have circulated of hundreds of GIs arriving in North Carolina but remaining idle awaiting FEMA orders. Some, including Elon Musk's team, have complained that FEMA officials have barred them from delivering critical goods to stranded towns without water or food. The tiny town of Bat Cave, which was almost entirely demolished, was told by FEMA they were on their own because rescue workers could not drive around a ""road closed"" sign, though many helpers managed to do so.

As complaints have rolled in, panicky members of the legacy media have rushed to defend the White House, accusing critics of spreading ""misinformation."" Amazingly, they are even blaming ""misinformation"" for impeding the relief work!

None of this is surprising. The Biden-Harris White House contains few individuals with private sector managerial experience; stories about $8 billion spent to build one charging station or Harris being allocated $42.5 billion to deliver broadband to rural communities but not managing to break ground on a single project, are instructive. The Biden-Harris White House is, at its core, incompetent.

As Milton crashes ashore in Florida, will the Biden-Harris response improve? Or will this be, for Harris campaign, another perfect storm?"
Morning Glory: Trump stands with Israel,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-trump-stands-israel,2024-10-08T09:13:17Z,"Former President Donald Trump agreed to an interview on the first anniversary of the horrific massacre and mass kidnapping in Israel on October 7, 2023. The focus was primarily on Israel of course, but also on the explosion of antisemitism in the United States.

HH: Now Mr. President, when we spoke in April, you said to me that Israel needed to win and win quickly. They are winning, but they're still fighting, and they're now fighting in Lebanon. Do you think Biden and Harris have been holding back Israel from winning?

DT: I do. I think everything they do is the opposite. In particular, him. Now she's a dumber person than him, but he has the worst foreign policy of anybody in history, probably. You know what you do with him? I realized it the other day. You could be one of the greatest foreign policy presidents. All you do is listen to what he says and do the opposite. If you've done the opposite for 30 years with this poor guy, this poor, pathetic guy, if you've done the opposite for 30 years, you would have been successful. But he's never gotten it right. And you know, I don't have to go back into the old secretaries of state and all the people that talk about it.

HH: If Israel hits [Iran's] nuclear sites, will you applaud?

DT: Yeah. I dealt with Kim Jong-un. And he has nuclear weapons. And you tend to speak a little bit differently when they have nuclear weapons.

HH: Yes.

DT: Does that make sense to you?

HH: Yes, it does. Well, Nixon met with Mao, who was the greatest murderer of the 20th Century, because they had nukes. He met with Brezhnev.

DT: Right.

HH: I noticed you didn't meet with Khamenei, and he did not have nukes. Can they be allowed to have nukes?

DT: No, they can't have nukes. No, they can't have nukes. Nukes, if you would see the power of these weapons that I renovated and rebuilt at great cost, I rebuilt the whole military. And then, you know, they gave $85 billion of it away to the Taliban and to Afghanistan. Can you imagine? They gave $85 billion dollars away. They gave everything. This is the worst group of people, these are the worst negotiators in history.

Exchange three:

HH: Let me turn to antisemitism in the United States. Your daughter is Jewish. Some of your grandchildren are Jewish. Your son-in-law is Jewish. Jewish students are not safe on many American campuses. Your alma mater, my alma mater, Biden and Harris have ignored this. I mean, they really have ignored it. If you're president, will you send the DOJ to those campuses, the office of Civil Rights from the Department of Education to enforce the law?

DT: 100%. I mean, the law is being broken. 100%. You wouldn't think you'd even have this. Did you ever think two years ago, three years ago, that you'd ever have this discussion?

HH: No, I didn't.

DT: I'm unbelievable what's happening. And when you see these riots, and you see a lot of people, too. But you know, a lot of the people in that, a lot of those people are Jewish people. You know that. They're Jewish kids.

HH: Oh, yeah. There are some outliers, but most Jewish students are afraid to be overt on places like Harvard and Penn.

DT: Yeah, but then you have other Jewish students that are afraid. Yeah, that's true, and they should be afraid. I never thought I would see this in my life with the campus riots and what they're saying and what they're doing. And they have to put them down quickly. They really have to put them down quickly.

Some pro-Israel Americans would prefer that zero attention be given to the outliers, but as the excellent Commentary Magazine podcast occasionally mentions the insidiousness of Jewish Americans attacking Israel and defending, implicitly or even explicitly, Hamas, then it should not be shocking when the former president notices it too.

I highlight these three exchanges because the result in November's election will reverberate around the world but most especially in Israel.

US ON ALERT FOR POSSIBLE 'VIOLENT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY' ON AMERICANS ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7

It seems clear to me that a President Kamala Harris will be the least supportive American president of the Jewish State in Israel's 76-year history.

By contrast, the argument is solid that Trump in his first term was at least the equal of any previous president when it comes to a record of support for Israel in peacetime. (Richard Nixon ordering the Pentagon to ""send everything that can fly"" to Israel in an arms resupply during the 1973 Yom Kippur War is the sole example of when an American president stepped up at a moment of existential peril to Israel and does everything to help it short of sending American forces. Trump did not face such a choice in his first term, but might very well in a second if Iran crosses the nuclear threshold.)

The choice should be clear for any American who supports Israel and for whom the continued existence and vibrancy of the Jewish State and the Middle East writ large is a priority: They should vote for Trump.

France Unhappy With Mbappe And Real Madrid: 'He Does What He Wants',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomsanderson/2024/10/08/france-unhappy-with-mbappe-and-real-madrid-he-does-what-he-wants/,2024-10-08T09:03:23Z,"The French public ""is starting to complain about"" Real Madrid star Kylian Mbappe according to former France national team star Eric De Meco, who also claimed that there are ""strategic errors"" between the player, his club and country as the international break takes over the footballing calendar.

Elsewhere on Jeremy Rothen's popular RMC program, journalist Daniel Riolo said that Mbappe ""does what he wants"", ""doesn't care what people say"" and ""does what is important to him"".

There is currently confusion in France as to why Mbappe hasn't been called up by Les Bleus head coach Didier Deschamps for UEFA Nations League matches against Israel and Belgium yet was fit enough to return prematurely from injury last week to star against Lille and Villarreal in the Champions League and La Liga respectively.

Discussing the matter, Di Meco said that he was a ""little perplexed"" with their being a ""a real unknown in this story"".

""There are players who don't come to the French national team, it's always existed. There are some who did it because they thought about their body, their physical condition, their club... it has always existed, but there is a way to do it and that is with all the communication,"" he stressed.

Di Meco noted how Deschamps explained on Thursday that Mbappe would stay in Spain to rest because he was recovering from an injury and that everything was done by mutual agreement.

He must have then been ""amazed"" to see Mbappe play against Villarreal, which surprised everyone and is a ""great discomfort"".

""I think there is a big problem. There is a strategic error between Mbappé, Real Madrid and the French national team (...) Watch out for his image, because the public is starting to complain about Mbappe,"" Di Meco claimed.

Riolo was harsher on the Madrid number 9. ""Today we can say something that has been clear about Mbappe for a long time: he does what he wants, he doesn't care what people say and he does what is important to him,"" the journalist stated.

Given he won't play for France, Mbappe is expected to return to the field when Madrid travels to Celta Vigo on October 19."
Hyatt Hotels: Further Upside Potential After 15% YTD Growth?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/08/hyatt-hotels-further-upside-potential-after-15-ytd-growth/,2024-10-08T09:03:00Z,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation stock (NYSE: H) has gained close to 15% since the beginning of 2024 while its rival Hilton stock is up about 27% over the same period. There are a couple of trends driving the recent price appreciation. Travel demand has remained robust, despite concerns about the global economy. Over Q2 2024, Hyatt saw its comparable system-wide revenue per available room increase by 4.7% year-over-year (down from 5.5% y-o-y growth in Q1 2024), driven by higher occupancy levels and average room rates. The company's operations in Asia remain the biggest drivers of growth, as greater outbound travel from Greater China to markets including Japan, Thailand, and South Korea drives growth. Moreover, the U.S. business also increased from group and business travel. Looking ahead, the hotel operator expects system-wide revenue per available room of 3.0% to 4.0% y-o-y in FY 2024. It also anticipates a 5.5% to 6.0% increase in net room growth. In addition, the company's adjusted EBITDA is expected to land in a range of $1.10 billion to 1.14 billion in FY 2024 compared to $1.03 billion in FY 2023.

Admirably, H stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 29% in 2021, -6% in 2022, and 45% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could H see a strong jump?

Hyatt primarily makes money from fee-based revenue, licensing, and other services, allowing third-party owners and franchisees to use Hyatt's brand and intellectual property. In Q2 2024, the company added 18 new hotels and 3,251 rooms to its portfolio. The company has seen its pipeline grow 9% y-o-y to a record 130K rooms. Hyatt had previously estimated that it would derive over 80% of its earnings via fees by 2025. For this year, the company is guiding for fee-based revenues of $1.1 billion to $1.13 billion.

Hyatt has also been increasingly focused on deal-making activity, with deals in recent years including the Mr & Mrs Smith booking platform, offering direct booking access to a select collection of boutique and luxury properties, and its 2021 deal for Apple Leisure Group, a luxury resort-management services, travel, and hospitality company. Recently, Hyatt completed the sale of its 1,641-room Hyatt Regency Orlando and adjacent 45 acres of land to affiliates of RIDA Development Corporation and an Ares Management Real Estate fund for approximately $1.07 billion, while retaining a long-term management agreement under the Hyatt Regency brand. Hyatt also entered into an agreement to pay $150 million for 21 Standard International properties, and another $185 million to acquire an additional 30 new projects in the Standard International pipeline over time for a total value of $335 million. This acquisition along with the sale of the Hyatt Regency Orlando is part of the company's capital allocation strategy to sell owned hotels and reinvest in asset-light platforms to accelerate growth.

While the increasing pivot to fee-based businesses, a focus on more premium properties, and a strong and growing travel market should help Hyatt in the long run, we think the stock is fairly priced at current levels. At the current market price of about $150 per share, Hyatt trades at roughly 33x projected 2024 earnings, which aligns compared to peers. We value H stock at about $144 per share, which is almost in line with the current market price.

Focal's New Lensys Professional Headphones For Sound Engineers,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marksparrow/2024/10/08/focals-new-lensys-professional-headphones-for-sound-engineers/,2024-10-08T09:02:55Z,"The latest headphones from French speaker maker Focal are launching today with a brand-new model designed specifically for producers, sound engineers, musicians and composers. The Lensys Professional are made in the French audio brand's workshops for high-resolution in-studio use or when creating music on the move.

The Lensys Professional have a closed-back design, combined with exclusive drivers and top-notch ergonomics for people who must wear headphones for much of their working day. The Lensys Professional join the Clear Mg Professional and Listen Professional in the Focal headphones collection.

Developed to be a reliable and versatile tool for any work environment -- whether in a recording studio or on the road -- the Lensys Professional are ideal for binaural audio applications in a three-dimensional environment. The robust design of the headphones uses sturdy materials, including an aluminum yoke, while the carrying case provided protects the headphones which also come with two sets of cables.

The R&D team at Focal says they have allocated a great deal of time and effort to create a pair of headphones with a high degree of accuracy as well as comfort, without compromising the monitoring experience. Focal's engineers chose a 40mm aluminum/magnesium electrodynamic driver with an 'M'-shaped dome for precise sound reproduction.

Aluminum is used to increase the dome's rigidity and greatly reduce distortion, while magnesium helps to ensure excellent damping. Thanks to the combination of materials, Focal says the driver delivers deep bass, accurate high frequencies and ""crystal-clear midrange."" Meanwhile, the 'M' shape of the dome offers exceptional rigidity for a linear frequency response and improved sound dispersion.

The drivers are angled within the earcups to boost stereo imaging, while the acoustic load is optimized to deliver performance like a bass-reflex loudspeaker, for low-end extension. Controlling and ensuring proper sound propagation in headphones is a challenge. With the Lensys Professional, the cushion depth, thickness and type of materials enveloping the drivers have been optimized to contribute to the overall performance.

Because comfort is essential for professional headphones designed for lengthy listening sessions, Focal says it has paid close attention to the fit. The Lensys Professional weigh just 10.8oz or 306g and offer memory foam earpads for a comfortable fit and good sound isolation from external noise.

The headband of the Lensys Professional is solid and covered with a breathable fabric and has a smooth curve, ideal for over-the-head wear. By incorporating high-quality, and long-lasting materials, the headphones should be tough enough to resist most working environments.

Pricing & Availability: The Focal Lensys Professional headphones are available now and priced at $699 / £599 / €699."
Los Angeles Dodgers Await A Return On Their Yamamoto Investment,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/berniepleskoff/2024/10/08/los-angeles-dodgers-await-a-return-on-their-yamamoto-investment/,2024-10-08T09:02:50Z,"Over the years, Los Angeles Dodgers fans have been treated to some of the best starting pitching in modern Major League Baseball history.

Consider this list of consequential, iconic starters who have pitched for the Dodgers in the modern era:

After his tough first year, the Dodgers are hoping right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto will be become a consequential Dodgers starter.

The Dodgers await a return on their investment in Yamamoto.

On December 27, 2023, the Dodgers signed Yamamoto, 26, to a massive, 12-year, $325 million international free agent contract.

When he signed, Yamamoto was pitching for the Orix Buffaloes of Japan's Pacific League.

The Dodger had to pay the Buffaloes a $50,625,000 posting fee, giving the Dodgers the right to negotiate with Yamamoto.

The Dodgers have over $375 million invested in Yamamoto.

His contract stipulates Yamamoto has two opportunities to ""opt out"" of his deal with the Dodgers.

As described by apnews.com, Yamamoto can opt out of his contract if he has Tommy John surgery or is on the injury list for right elbow injury for 134 consecutive services days from 2024-2029. He could vacate the contract following the 2031, and 2033 World Series.

If he does not have Tommy John surgery, and doesn't miss that much time with an elbow issue during the same timeframe, Yamamoto can exit the contract after the 2029 and 2023 World Series.

Yamamoto made his first start for the Dodgers on March 21, 2024, against the San Diego Padres. He went one inning, and yielded four hits, and five runs in the loss.

Yamamoto was improving during the season, until he was sidelined with right triceps soreness.

Yamamoto went on the Dodgers injured list June 16, and was transferred to the 60-day injured list July 13.

At the time he was disabled, Yamamoto had a 6-2 record, with a fine 2.92 ERA in 14 starts.

Yamamoto returned to the Dodgers mound September 10, at home against the Chicago Cubs. He threw four innings, and did not receive a decision.

Yamamoto then made three additional starts to end the season.,

Yamamoto threw four innings against the Atlanta Braves in Atlanta, September 16, and three innings against the Colorado Rockies at home September 22. He did not receive a decision in either game.

His final regular season start was in Colorado, September 28. Yamamoto went five innings in the game, and was credited with the win, in a 7-2 Dodgers victory.

Yamamoto finished the regular season with a 7-2 record, a 3.00 ERA, and a 1.11 WHIP in 90 innings, covering 18 starts.

Yamamoto struck out an average of 10.5 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.2 per nine.

He throws his four-seam fastball at 95 miles per hour, which he uses 41.67% of the time.

He uses his split, a form of fastball, 21.67 & of the time, throwing it at 92 miles per hour.

Yamamoto's curve ball is used 20% of the time, and it comes in at 79 miles per hour.

Yamamoto throws a slider at 87 miles per hour. He uses the pitch 10% of the time.

Yamamoto throws a cutter on 6.66% of his pitches. He throws that pitch at 92 miles per hour.

In this old scout's observations, it is his very deceptive split-finger pitch that changes the eye level of the hitters and alters the hitter's balance.

Disciplined hitters can avoid swinging at the split, but Yamamoto is a master of mixing in that pitch among other offerings in his repertoire. His split is a very nasty pitch that helps dispatch hitters with swings and misses.

Yamamoto started Game 1 of the National League Division Series against the San Diego Padres, October 5 at Dodgers Stadium.

Yamamoto went three innings, yielding five hits, and five earned runs. He walked two, and struck out one. He yielded a two-run home run to the Padres Manny Machado in the first inning.

The Dodgers came back to win the game, 7-5, with Shohei Ohtani hitting a first inning homer off the Padres Dylan Cease.

Yamamoto is not scheduled to pitch again in the Division Series. The series is tied at one game each, following a Padres 10-2 victory October 6.

Should the Dodgers advance to the National League Championship Series, they will likely slot Yamamoto in their series rotation.

Time will tell if Yoshinobu Yamamoto becomes an iconic Dodgers starter."
Harris proposes help for the 'sandwich generation': a Medicare benefit for home care,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5144747/kamala-harris-sandwich-generation-home-care,2024-10-08T09:02:46Z,"Vice President Harris walks to board Air Force Two as she departs for New York at Joint Base Andrews, Md., on Oct. 7 Evelyn Hockstein/Pool/AFP hide caption

Vice President Harris on Tuesday will lay out a new proposal to expand Medicare coverage to help cover the costs of home health care aides for seniors.

Her campaign said Harris plans to discuss the measure on ABC's The View, a daytime television talk show popular with middle-aged and older women.

The proposal is squarely aimed at ""sandwich generation"" women who take care of aging parents as well as their own kids.

Internal campaign data shows this demographic, comprising nearly a quarter of Americans, has a relatively large percentage of undecided voters, a senior campaign official told reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of the public release of the plan.

In its current form, Medicare doesn't widely cover assistance like home health aides for seniors, which can be costly. And nursing home facilities are also expensive.

Harris' plan to expand Medicare to cover at-home care for seniors would be paid for in part by expanding Medicare drug price negotiations, her campaign said."
Harris is trying to reach new voters with a media blitz both traditional  --  and not,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5144874/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-alex-cooper-howard-stern-60-minutes-colbert-the-view,2024-10-08T09:02:42Z,"Vice President Harris is making a number of high-profile media appearances this week on some of the most popular news and entertainment programs in the country.

On Tuesday, she's slated to appear on The View on ABC, The Howard Stern Show and The Late Show With Stephen Colbert on CBS. On Thursday, she will take part in a Univision Town Hall in Nevada.

Harris also spoke with CBS News's Bill Whitaker for an interview that aired Monday on 60 Minutes and sat down with podcast host Alex Cooper for her show Call Her Daddy, which aired on Sunday.

It's a string of media appearances that the vice president's campaign says is purposefully geared at reaching a wide variety of audiences on different platforms, especially as voting begins in many states around the country and Election Day inches closer.

""Vice President Harris is seizing this opportunity to reach voters where they are,"" a Harris campaign official said in a statement ahead of the vice president's interview with Cooper, adding that the appearance ""underscores the importance of connecting with younger audiences, especially those who will play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the election.""

Major party candidates have sat down with 60 Minutes dating back to 1968. The show has a traditionally older audience and a massive reach, remaining the highest-ranked news program for decades.

But with her interview with Cooper, who is a millennial, Harris became the first presidential candidate to ever appear on Call Her Daddy, one of the most popular podcasts in the country, especially among women, where nearly 8 in 10 of the show's listeners are under 35, according to metrics from Edison Research.

It's a podcast known for celebrity interviews and frank discussions, tailored to women, about topics like sex and relationships -- not politics. But that didn't stop Harris, who is banking on support from young voters this fall.

""I think you and your listeners have really got this thing right, which is, one of the best ways to communicate with people is to be real,"" Harris told Cooper after being asked why she wanted to come on the show.

""I think, especially now, this is a moment in the country and in life where people really want to know they're seen and heard,"" she added. ""And that they're part of a community. That they're not out there alone.""

Harris spoke with Cooper for about 40 minutes, spending the most time on the topic of protecting abortion access. The interview was an opportunity for Harris to try to reach a key voting bloc -- Gen Z and millennial voters, who have turned out at lower numbers than older generations.

Cooper has also built a massive fan base online, with more than 11 million followers across her show and personal accounts on Instagram and TikTok. Plus, Call Her Daddy has a politically and geographically diverse following, according to Edison.

Nearly half of the audience identifies as Democrats, compared to a quarter who are Republicans and 20% who are Independents. Plus, the largest portion of Cooper's listeners -- a third -- live in the South, an area with key swing states like Georgia and North Carolina.

It isn't the first time Harris has veered outside of mainstream news media to appeal to voting blocs key to her potential victory. Last month, she went on the sports podcast All the Smoke, a show geared towards Black men, hosted by former NBA players Stephen Jackson and Matt Barnes.

These moves are not unique to the Harris campaign. Former President Trump has also put an emphasis on reaching voters outside of traditional news outlets and on social media -- a strategy that has been central to the campaign's youth outreach.

While Trump has largely done interviews with news outlets that are friendly to conservatives, over the past few months, he and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have also appeared with a number of popular influencers and sat down for podcast interviews that have largely younger, male-dominated audiences.

That's included conversations with influencers who also have some of the top-ranked podcasts in the country, like Logan Paul -- who has a combined following of 46 million across TikTok and Instagram -- and Theo Von, who has collectively 14 million followers on the same platforms."
This mountain hamlet hit by Helene flooding preps for a winter without power,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5140629/this-mountain-hamlet-hit-by-helene-flooding-preps-for-a-winter-without-power,2024-10-08T09:02:40Z,"POPLAR, N.C. - Fewer than 300 people live in this tiny mountain hamlet, but their ties to this place are deep.

""I'm a fifth-generation settler child,"" says Misty Hughes. ""My great grandfather was the first white settler amongst the Indians here.""

The community sits along the beautiful Nolichucky River, popular for its whitewater rafting. When it rose up violently, Hughes' home survived but her aunt and uncle's place did not. ""They ran out with the clothes on their back, and they're both in their late 70s,"" she says.

Tropical Storm Helene tore up much of the infrastructure that supplies western North Carolina with water and electricity. Restoring it has been slow going -- especially in the most isolated areas like Poplar, which sits atop a winding, forested road.

Hughes is coordinating much of the relief effort in Poplar, juggling nonstop questions and -- thanks to a Starlink satellite set up in the yard -- texts and calls. Cars, ATVs and helicopters cycle in and out of the community center with drop-offs and deliveries.

She says most people here are seniors, and she's worried about them. ""They're sticking with it. It's not the first time they sit in the dark. That's a quote!"" she laughs. ""So, they're going to rough it.""

The last estimate Hughes got was that the hamlet may face up to five months without electricity, phone lines or internet.

Given that stark possibility, she's now scouting for propane and kerosene heaters to see people through the cold, dark winter ahead. ""These elderly that once used wood stoves have aged to the point that they're unable to supply that need for themselves,"" she says.

Another priority is making sure people can get the medication and care they need. Rick Hughes, who is 70 and says he's no ""close"" relation to Misty, has a 94-year-old mother with high blood pressure.

He and his wife are ""not even staying in our house anymore,"" he says. ""We're staying in her house, trying to keep a generator going. And she has to go to the hospital a lot so we're just trying to keep her calm.""

He's working to switch her care to another hospital, because the one she had been going to half an hour away in Erwin, Tenn., was flooded out.

One major source of help for Poplar has been the community of paddlers and kayakers who live nearby and have long simply passed through the hamlet to raft the rapids of the Nolichucky River.

Helene's flooding put river educator Trey Moore out of work for now, so he's been devoting all his time to rounding up donations, supplies and volunteers from across the country. Every morning at 9 o'clock, Moore gathers with a few neighbors on his front porch in nearby Erwin to discuss needs and logistics for Poplar.

At a recent gathering, one of Moore's neighbors said she'd been in Poplar the day before and used a portable internet connection to help people there sign up for FEMA disaster aid - especially seniors not comfortable with computers.

Another neighbor said she was checking whether a new supply of generators could be borrowed or donated. Moore suggested looking into solar generators to cut down on noise and fumes at people's homes and save fuel for other uses.

For Moore, this new focus is a way to process his grief over the destruction of a beloved river community that most paddlers simply bypassed. He said this was an opportunity to ""build goodwill between paddlers and the people of Poplar.""

""What I hope for,"" he says, ""is that now my neighbors know me, and that we're friends, and that some of us are going to become family through this.""

After the porch meetings, Moore usually drives up to Poplar to help out at the community center, which is just down the road from where he would put boats into the river.

That road runs along damaged railroad tracks, which a loader and other machinery are working to clear and restore. Then, around a corner, the entire area becomes a wasteland of deep, brown muck. On one side is the river. On the other, Moore's friend and fellow paddler Patrick Toups is trying to dig out his property.

""What you're looking at is, for some places, five feet of river silt,"" Toup says. ""This entire area became a standing water river eddy. All of the trees and garbage were kind of floating around in here.""

Until Helene hit, Toups lived on this spot in a house that was built in 1910. He says the previous owner had told him about a big flood in 1977 when water reached the front porch steps. So Toups was in disbelief as Helene's floodwaters just didn't stop, eventually reaching the home's gutters.

Retreating up a hill behind the house, he watched what happened next, distraught but also amazed. ""That house picked up in one beautiful piece. It floated out upstream into the eddy, completely majestic like a ballerina,"" he says.

Toups is thankful he had just built a workshop up top of the hill. He's now staying there, not ready to imagine giving up on this place he loves.

It took days to clear out some driveways and roads in Poplar, and some elderly residents are still not able to get around. Misty Hughes says even some who drove themselves before are now afraid to go out on the torn-up roads. She's sending out volunteers on ATVs to do wellness checks and see what people need.

Down one road and up a long driveway, two volunteers stop to check on an older couple. Jarrell Peterson greets them in the yard and says he could use more gasoline for the generator. The couple is lucky to have a water well, he says, but he sure does miss hot showers.

Inside the house his wife, Jewel, dissolves into tears when she starts talking about what happened. ""I'm just devastated for everybody,"" she says, her voice catching. But she immediately counts her blessings, saying she's thankful her loved ones are safe and that her home - in which her husband grew up - was spared.

She is also finding ways to make do. ""We have a grill that we heated water on to do dishes and bathe,"" she says. ""You know, when you live in the mountains, you kind of do things different.""

Peterson says that includes being prepared. She's happy her husband had just dug up their potatoes before the flooding. She's also canned food, and as long as the generator holds out, they've got a full freezer."
Here's how to turn climate change anxiety into action,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5057430/stress-anxiety-climate-change-action-positive,2024-10-08T09:02:32Z,"Imagine something you love. Then imagine it's threatened.

That's what Jada Alexander experienced when she was studying coral reefs in French Polynesia. During her first trip, as a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, she was captivated. ""The coral reef was vibrant. It was beautiful,"" she recalls. It was teeming with life, full of crabs and fish.

But on a return trip one year later, much of the reef appeared dead. ""It was dull and gray,"" she says, which left her feeling hopeless.

Alexander is not alone. Survey data has shown that more than half of young adults have felt anxious, angry, powerless or helpless about human-driven climate change.

""If our young people can't have hope and engage in climate action, then we're going to have that much harder of a time bending the curve back,"" says Elissa Epel, a renowned stress researcher at UC San Francisco.

So, she and a group of her colleagues developed a new course, called Climate Resilience, which they offered for the first time at several UC campuses last spring. The goal is to turn students' distress about the climate into collective action. Alexander signed up for the class and became a teaching assistant.

The course offers inspiring lectures from scientists and leaders in the climate movement to introduce a counternarrative to the doom and gloom. Many of us are living in an ""information bubble"" that can be devastating, Epel says. We're inundated with negative stories about record heat, hurricanes, floods and wildfires. The challenge is real, but so too are the potential solutions.

And, crucially, the course teaches resilience and coping skills, including mindfulness meditation, to empower students.

""There's an arc -- or a process -- for leading people out of these dark inner worlds where they feel alone and separate,"" Epel says.

People who feel negative and hopeless are more likely to disengage or walk away.

""The great Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh says the way out is in,"" she says. To transcend fear and anger, people need to practice compassion, not only for themselves but for others.

""Students do come in very skeptical,"" says Jyoti Mishra, a neuroscientist at UC San Diego and co-director of the course. But by the end of the class, there's a shift in mindset among many, she says. Once a person feels more positive, it can be easier for them to imagine being part of the solution.

End-of-class surveys were very positive, and the course will be offered at 10 UC campuses next spring.

Students reported an increased sense of belonging and a belief that they could ""work with others"" on climate change, says Philippe Goldin, a clinical neuroscientist at UC Davis who co-leads the Climate Resilience course.

Students in the course took action: They worked in community gardens dedicated to sustainable agriculture, a waste reduction workshop and a recycling project focused on clothing. Jada Alexander, who has graduated, is now starting an initiative that integrates surfing with environmental stewardship.

Alexander knows the solutions are complex, and she still fears for the planet, but ""I think that the class increased my ability to be a part of the solution,"" she says.

Epel says the techniques and exercises taught in the class are ""universal skills"" that can help people manage stress from all sorts of situations. If you want to try, here are some strategies adapted from the course.

If you want to stay engaged with the world's problems, you have to start with your own well-being.

When you pause to be present and let go of worries, it's a chance for a quick reset.

In daily life, you can look for prompts or create new rituals to help you slow down. For instance, if there's a church, town hall or campus bell that chimes, you can use that as a moment to pause. Or you can set a reminder on your phone to take pauses throughout your day.

""There's all sorts of cues and signals that can remind us to stop and take a breath,"" says Diana Hill, a clinical psychologist who teaches the course at UC Santa Barbara. When we focus on breath we can activate the parasympathetic nervous system -- so our body feels more at ease.

If you want to try a longer self-care pause, here's a nature meditation used in the course from meditation teacher Mark Coleman.

In the class, people are asked to pick a partner, typically someone they don't know. Then, they're asked to look into each other's eyes as they're led through a guided meditation. ""This can be uncomfortable,"" Hill says, so it's OK to close your eyes.

You can use this recording by Jack Kornfield as a guide.

""This person was once a small child just like me. This person has had happy times, just like me,"" it begins.

The exercise is intended to help people see how much they have in common with every human, even strangers or people who see the world differently.

""This person has been hurt, just like me. This person has experienced physical pain, just like me. This person wants to be loved, just like me.""

The meditation ends by asking you to picture your partner's happy moments and to send them this message: ""I know you want to be happy, just like me.""

This practice of seeing that common humanity is pretty powerful, Hill says.

You can also use the Just Like Me exercise with someone you have a difficult relationship with. Even if they're not sitting opposite you, you can imagine looking at them.

""To be activists for any cause, we need to work together, and that starts by expressing our grief, "" Epel says. The course adapted a practice from Joanna Macy and Molly Brown, called Honoring our Pain, which takes about 15 minutes.

And here's an important takeaway: Listening is a gift. ""The quality with which we really listen and offer our attention to others is an act of compassion,"" Goldin says.

During these conversations, ""you begin to experience a sense of trust in experiencing your own emotions, sitting with your own emotions and the emotions of others,"" he says.

Start by imagining yourself at some date in the future, be it one year from now or even 20 years down the road. What is it that you hope for yourself? Where do you want to be? What kind of hurdles have you overcome?

Maybe you can see a future where the climate crisis is being solved, where you're working with others on solutions to specific problems. Once you have that kind of future in mind, you could start thinking about some specific goals -- and steps to take -- to get there. ""It can be quite motivating,"" Hill says.

Another option is to write a letter to your future self about what happens if you don't engage in helping solve the problem. ""If you bring awareness to the pain or the discomfort of what could happen if you didn't do anything, that can be a motivating force too,"" Hill says."
Can ghost guns be regulated as firearms? The Supreme Court will decide,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5106803/supreme-court-ghost-guns,2024-10-08T09:02:27Z,"The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday on the the regulation of ""ghost guns"" -- firearms made from kits. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images hide caption

Guns are back to haunt the Supreme Court on Tuesday in a case that fittingly tests the legality of so-called ""ghost guns.""

They're called ghost guns because unlike guns bought from a licensed dealer, these build-it-yourself gun kits have no serial numbers stamped on the assembled firearm, so the guns can't be traced if found at a crime scene. And there are no background checks done on people who purchase the kits. The kits can be bought online without any background check, and without presenting identification. In fact, according to regulators, the kits can be bought anonymously with cryptocurrency, using a pre-paid debit card.

In 2022, as gun kits became more and more of a problem for law enforcement, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives issued a rule classifying the kits as firearms under the 1968 Gun Control Act. The statute defines a firearm as ""any weapon...which will or is designed to or may readily be converted"" into a functional firearm.

The government contends that these ghost guns kits, which can be readily converted into a firearm ""in a matter 30 minutes or less,"" count as a firearm under the 1968 law.

Pete Patterson, representing kit sellers and buyers who are challenging the regulation, counters that ""a kit of parts is not a weapon.""

He will tell the Supreme Court that the frame of a pistol or the receiver of a rifle, both of which house the mechanisms that fire the bullets, are not parts as defined in the Gun Control Act.

""The statute doesn't say that,"" he contends, adding that Congress could amend the existing law ""but until it does so, the ATF doesn't have the authority to take that upon itself.""

""In seeking to regulate these ""non-firearm objects"" the ATF's Final Rule directly contradicted Congress' definition of ""firearm"" set forth in the Gun Control Act of 1968, according to the Second Amendment Foundation, which has been involved in challenging the ""ghost guns"" rule.

Southern Methodist University law Professor Eric Ruben counters that the Gun Control Act was meant to be ""broad, and flexible.""

The 1968 law ""was passed in part to stop the problem of that day, which was the mail order shipment of firearms across state lines like the one that was used by Lee Harvey Oswald to assassinate JFK,"" he says. ""These kits present the modern-day version of the mail order firearms that were a problem back in 1968.""

The conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals based in Louisiana didn't buy that argument, and struck down the ATF ghost gun rule. But the Supreme Court temporarily paused that decision and hears arguments in the government's appeal on Tuesday.

The Biden administration argues that the ghost gun rule doesn't ban the sale or use of gun kits. It merely requires that the manufacturers and sellers of these kits abide by the same conditions and qualifications required in other commercial firearms sales. Specifically, sellers must mark their products with serial numbers and conduct background checks on those who buy the gun kits.

In its Supreme Court briefs, the government asserts that gun kits are analogous to IKEA furniture. ""If a state placed a tax on the sale of furniture, IKEA couldn't avoid paying that tax"" just because the furniture comes in parts ""to be assembled by the purchaser.""

""That is not a good analogy,"" replies Patterson, the kit defender. ""The issue here is that there is no item that has been machined to the point where it is a frame or receiver.""

In other words, he says, you need tools, sometimes expensive tools, and it can sometimes take hours to convert the gun parts into the primary structural component of a gun -- the frame or receiver.

It is on the frame of a gun or the receiver of a rifle that the serial number would normally go. But ghost guns have no such serial numbers on them. Indeed, gun violence prevention groups point to an ad for a ghost gun kit that features the image of a hand giving the finger to the viewer where a serial number would normally appear.

The government claims that if gun kit manufacturers are permitted to continue selling their unmarked products, it would transform the central definition of the Gun Control Act into an invitation for evasion.

Law enforcement groups have expressed alarm, too, pointing to a proliferation of untraceable ghost guns found at crime scenes in the last few years. In briefs filed in this case, police chiefs in 70 major cities, prosecutors, national security officers, and leading intelligence officials from Republican and Democratic administrations assert that bad actors are drawn to ghost guns ""for the very reasons that the government wants to regulate them: they are untraceable and they are readily available to those who would not otherwise pass background checks.""

Even if the Supreme Court upholds the ghost gun rule, though, the battle over unmarked and untraceable guns will continue. 3-D printed guns, made mainly with cheap home-use printers, are the next frontier. The ATF and Justice Department are already pouring resources into developing strategies and training law enforcement officers on how to detect and seize these untraceable 3-D printed weapons. Importantly, the ATF is also setting its sights on those who sell or use 3-D printers to convert legal firearms like Glock pistols into illegal machineguns by adding a 3D-printed conversion device, commonly known as a ""switch.""

Of course, all of that may well be challenged by gun groups in the Supreme Court, too."
'Fresh Kill' imagined a contaminated city. 30 years later it feels spot-on,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5132641/fresh-kill-staten-island-shu-lea-cheang-film,2024-10-08T09:02:14Z,"Filmmaker Shu Lea Cheang, 70, had been on the road for about two weeks of a month-long road trip across the United States when she met a reporter in Ann Arbor before a screening of her 1994 experimental film Fresh Kill.

""When the film first came out, many people didn't quite get it,"" Cheang said. She wore bright orange trousers and her white hair was cropped close to her scalp.

Fresh Kill is neither a horror movie nor a documentary. It's an experimental film, taking its name from the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island that, at its peak, took in about 29,000 tons of garbage every day. The ginormous landfill is now a park.

The film has aged well. Its surreal, sci-fi inflected story of pollution and environmental inequality feels prescient, and the film's vision of a contaminated city is scathing, funny and surreal. Characters include concerned lesbian moms, eco-terrorists and wealthy business bros who snack on sushi that turns their skin glowing green.

Shu Lea Cheang is a leading new media and multimedia artist, who's exhibited at museums all over the country, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. She was the first to create a web-based artwork for the Guggenheim Museum and won this year's LG Guggenheim Award.

Cheang joined New York's vibrant downtown theater scene in the 1980s after moving there from Taiwan. Fresh Kill is filled with many of its faces, including George C. Wolfe (former artistic director of the Public Theater), and National Book Award finalist Jessica Hagedorn, who also wrote Fresh Kill's screenplay. The soundtrack is by Vernon Reid, who founded the band Living Colour. New York rents have priced out Cheang, who now lives in Paris though she has been for decades an American citizen.

New York University, which holds Cheang's archives, recently restored the original 35mm film.

That's when Cheang decided to take her film on a road trip, to be screened across the country. ""I wrote to every cinema that had 35mm projection capacity,"" she said. ""So romantic, right?""

Jazz Jones, who is one of two young filmmakers traveling with Cheang, met her last year at a Florida film festival where he first saw her one of her movies.

""I was just like, this is freaking insane. I have to talk to this woman,"" he recalled. ""And she starts talking about this trip and I'm like, 'Can I be your driver?'""

Jean-Paul Jones, who is also accompanying Cheang, is a projectionist in addition to being a filmmaker, a useful skill on a trip when the film print is handed off and inspected at 21 theaters in 33 days. The theaters that have the capacity to screen the film tend to be among the most beautiful and eclectic in the country, including Chicago's Music Box Theatre, the Harris Theater in Pittsburgh and Cine Athens in Georgia.

As they travel, Jones and Franklin are filming their own documentary about the experience, which so far has included stops in Flint, Mich., to discuss the water crisis with people who live there, and a detour for lunch at a Haitian restaurant in Springfield, Ohio."
Mortgage Rates 8 October 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-08-10-24/,2024-10-08T08:59:49Z,"Bank Rate was held at 5% in September by the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steadying interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Good news on inflation and interest rates has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy. We will know more in its Autumn Budget on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.44%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.34% and 4.19% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 3.39%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 3.79% and 3.68% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.57%, with the best in this category priced at 5.29%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stands at 7.23%, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 October there were 6,645 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,460 on 1 September. The number has been steadily growing as the market improves. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

Halifax's latest house price report (published 7 October) reported that the value of the average home was 4.7% higher in September than the previous year, while Nationwide building society's latest report (published 30 September) put annual house price inflation at 3.7%. Both lenders say it's the strongest annual growth they have seen since November 2022.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, also reported five consecutive months of rises. It found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before, although on a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."
"Gmail Hackers Have Control Of 2FA, Email & Number? Here's What To Do",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/10/08/gmail-hackers-take-control-of-2fa-email--number-heres-what-to-do/,2024-10-08T08:55:50Z,"Davey Winder is a veteran cybersecurity writer, hacker and analyst.

Update, Oct. 08, 2024: This story, originally published Oct. 07, includes new advice regarding how attackers bypass 2FA protections and how best to mitigate these dangers before a hacker can exploit your Gmail account.

Search any of the Gmail support forums online, from social media platforms such as the Gmail subreddit or the official Gmail community help from Google itself, and one question comes up time and time again: my Gmail account has been hacked, how can I recover it?

Disregarding the inevitable dodgy attempts at uncovering some magic way to hack into someone else's account, the majority are still likely to be genuine requests for help. Take this example, published to the Gmail subreddit Oct. 06, which is analogous to many: ""A friend of mine's Google account got stolen. The hacker changed the recovery phone number and email address."" The poster explains that the friend in question had enabled two-factor authentication and asks if anything can be done to recover the account now, ""or is he cooked?""

The good news is that it's still entirely possible to recover a Google account even if, as in this case, the hacker has managed to evade or change most, if not all, the security and recovery protections that were in place. Even if, as the poster replied to one suggested solution, ""whoever stole the account changed the recovery email and phone number to their own and disabled all other recovery methods.""

How To Recover A Stolen Gmail Account After A Hacker Changes Everything

Google does, despite the negative opinions of many people seemingly frustrated by the process, offer lots of help in recovering your Google account, even in the case of it being stolen by someone who has then changed your recovery details. Indeed, there's a whole section of Google support devoted to securing a ""hacked or compromised"" account. I suspect that most people who say these steps don't work haven't followed the instructions provided by Google precisely and waited the allotted time for the process to complete.

It is advised to use a device that you have used before to access your Google account or check your Gmail or another Google service. The same tip applies to a familiar location from where you have previously accessed your Google account. Google recommends using the same browser, such as Chrome or Safari, on a laptop or tablet if your smartphone has been stolen and doing so from your home or work location. This can speed up the recovery process by aiding Google in verifying your identity.

You should also answer the questions about passwords as precisely as possible. This applies even if the hacker has changed your current password to lock you out of your account. ""If you're asked for the last password you remember,"" Google said, ""enter the most recent one you recall."" The more recent, the better, so use the one the hackers changed from. ""If you can't confidently recall any previous passwords: Take your best guess,"" Google said.

You may see a message telling you your account is on a security hold. A delay is often put in place between making the recovery request and processing that recovery claim. While some people get annoyed by this, it's a proactive measure so you should be patient. ""Account recovery requests can be delayed for a few hours or a number of days,"" Google said, ""depending on a variety of risk factors.""

Google has also advised me that when it comes to users whose accounts have already been hacked and whose second-factor and recovery factors have changed, it's possible to use the original information in certain cases. ""Our automated account recovery process allows a user to use their original recovery factors for up to 7 days after it changes,"" the spokesperson said, ""provided they set them up before the incident.""

And finally, if all else fails and the account holder has a YouTube account up and running, many users have found that contacting YouTube support, including the by way of social media, has often resulted in them being given direct help to recover the account where all has appeared lost.

Here's How Hackers Bypass Gmail 2FA Protections In The First Place

One of the problems highlighted by Gmail users seeking support in online forums is that the two-factor authentication protections that they have in place have been changed by the person who has hacked their Google account. This raises several questions, but perhaps the most pertinent is how that 2FA process was bypassed in the first place.

I recently reported that the developers of notorious info-stealer malware, including Lumar, Lumma, Meduza, Rhadamanthys, StealC, Vidar and Whitesnake, have all been releasing updates that claim to have bypassed Google's cookie-stealing protections. Some stated that they could crack account 2FA in less than 10 minutes. This is despite Google having upgraded the protections found in Chrome 127 to include application-bound encryption, which, similarly to macOS and Keychain, encrypts data tied to app identity, introduced to combat just this kind of attack.

This theft of cookies from your browser, specifically session cookies, enables hackers to bypass your 2FA protections effectively. Owning a cookie that validates a user session after the 2FA step has already been completed gives the attacker complete control over that session -- complete control to go and change your Gmail recovery options, 2FA, the lot. So, what can you do to mitigate this type of attack?

How Google Mitigates The Session-Cookie Infostealer Threat

A Google spokesperson said: ""This type of attack is well known and we have built-in defenses, such as high frequency cookie rotation, device-bound session credentials, and risk-based re-authentication, that keep users safe. Additionally, the first line of defense against attacks like this is to use an operating system like ChromeOS that is secure by default, without known vulnerabilities for this type of malware.""

It is also wise to consider using passkeys, which Google is helping to drive the adoption of across online services, as these are ""resistant to phishing and other online attacks,"" Google said, ""making them more secure than SMS, app-based one-time passwords and other forms of multi-factor authentication."""
Country singer Tucker Wetmore has 'never doubted' God's path for him but admits it's 'tough',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/country-singer-tucker-wetmore-never-doubted-gods-path-him-admits-its-tough,2024-10-08T08:55:47Z,"Country singer Tucker Wetmore reflected on how his faith guides him through the ups and downs of life.

The 24-year-old musician, who released his debut album ""Waves on a Sunset"" and launched his first headlining tour on Friday, is a rising star in the country music scene. During an interview with Fox News Digital, Wetmore explained how staying committed to his faith helps him stay on the path that he believes God has planned for him.

""I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for faith,"" Wetmore said.

'AMERICAN IDOL' CONTESTANT AND LUKE BRYAN HAVE AWKWARD TIFF, MOCKS JUDGE'S COUNTRY TWANG

""Spiritually and musically and my faith that I have within my work and in the music and stuff,"" Wetmore continued. ""I pray every single day for just like random stuff.""

""It's hard in the line of work that I do to not slip up and not kind of fall off a little bit,"" Wetmore added. ""And I catch myself and I do that, and then I lean on my people and like, 'Hey, I'm struggling really bad right now,' and stuff like that.' But then He always keeps me centered. He always brings me right back and be like, 'No, this is the path that I have for you.' And I've never doubted that.""

""But it is tough. It is tough at times. And I would be lying if I said it wasn't. But then I sit back, and I'm like, 'No, this is it. This is His path for me.' And I just got to sit back and trust and listen.""

Wetmore's plan for his life took a turn in college when his dreams of an NFL career were shattered after he broke his leg while playing football at Montana Tech in Butte, Montana.

""Football was my only goal for as long as I can remember,"" Wetmore recalled. ""My goal was just to try to make it in the draft and do what I could in college and hopefully make it to the league someday.""

""He always keeps me centered. He always brings me right back and be like, 'No, this is the path that I have for you.' And I've never doubted that.""

-- Tucker Wetmore

""I had terrible grades,"" he added with a laugh. ""So, that was a struggle. But my main focus was football, and getting injured for the third time really made me sit back and be like, 'I need to leave.' And so I dropped out of college, and then I was super lost.""

Wetmore returned to his hometown of Kalama, Washington, and began working at a coffee shop to make money. He told Fox News Digital that he had a conversation with his mother about feeling aimless during which she reminded him of his love for music and how it had helped him through a tough time in his childhood.

""I sat my mom down, and I was like, 'Mom, I'm so lost right now. I don't know what I'm doing with my life,'"" he recalled.

Wetmore continued, ""I was like, 'I had so much purpose, and now I'm doing nothing.' She was like, 'Go sit in front of your piano, go play guitar.' And she was like, 'That was your therapy. You know, when you were 11, you were going through a bunch of stuff family-wise.'""

In a 2021 interview with Music Update Central, Wetmore said he started playing piano and guitar at age 11 when his father left their family.

""I was young, but I wasn't naive,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""I wasn't stupid. I knew what was going on in my family. That bothered me. So, I just emotionally flowed that all into the piano or whatever it was. She's like, 'Just go do that.' And then I wrote my first song that night and I didn't look back. I was like, 'I can't believe I put down music this long.' You know, I needed to realize - to come to a realization. That's what I wanted to do. But I didn't look back. I started writing every day. And then eight, nine months down the road, I was like, 'Mom, I want to do this.' She was like, 'Go do it. Go do it.' I was like, 'I'm moving to Nashville then.' So, that's why I'm here.""

Wetmore moved to Nashville in 2020 and independently released the singles ""Kiss My A$$,"" ""Another Shot"" and ""She's Trouble"" in 2021. In a March 2024 interview with Billboard, he said that he began uploading videos of himself performing covers and his original songs to social media, where he caught the eye of Back Blocks Music founder Rakiyah Marshall. Wetmore signed with Back Blocks and later entered a partnership with UMG Nashville.

In February, Wetmore released his first commercial single, ""Wine Into Whiskey,"" which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Hot Country charts. He followed up with ""Wind Up Missin' You,'"" which peaked at No. 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 11 on the Billboard Hot Country chart.

WATCH: COUNTRY SINGER TUCKER WETMORE SAYS 'SMALL TOWN LIVING IS THE ONLY WAY OF LIVING'

Though Wetmore found success by moving to country music's biggest city, he told Fox News Digital that growing up in the small town of Kalama was the ""best thing ever.""

""Small town living is the only way of living, in my opinion,"" he said. ""I grew up in a town with 2,500 people, and probably 1,500 of those people were retired. So it was like an older community and it was right on the river. So it was just a lot of fishing, hunting every once in a while.""

Wetmore continued, ""I grew up fishing and stuff like that. And then having just the support group that I have out there -- I was super blessed with just really good, beautiful people on the inside and out, being surrounded by them. And you know, you can't really get that in a big city.""

""Well, you can, but not in the sense where it's like, 'We ain't got no one else but each other, man.' And you know that's all small town living is. We just love each other, and we know everything about each other, even if you don't want people to know it. And that's just how it is. But I mean, I'm a huge fan of small towns.""

Wetmore told Fox News Digital that he was raised in a home next door to the Highway Tabernacle Church of God, where his grandfather was a pastor. He recalled that much of his childhood was spent at the church, where he routinely attended Sunday services, played basketball and hide and seek and had sleepovers with his cousins and family members on the altar.

The hitmaker said he was inspired by watching his grandfather lead services every week.

""I grew up in the church and I grew up seeing him preach,"" Wetmore said. ""I always say like I would give - with all the success and all the things that are going on, it's really cool and it's my dream. But I would honestly some days just give it all up just to see him preach one more time.""

""I can't really put words into seeing your grandpa there,"" he added. ""Doing something that's bigger than himself, and I miss it.""

During his interview with Fox News Digital, Wetmore recalled growing up listening to multiple genres of music, including heavy metal, reggae and country. The music of Jerry Lee Lewis inspired him to learn piano and Wetmore said he counts Alan Jackson and David Allan Coe among his influences.

However, Wetmore explained that he aspires to create a musical style that is all his own.

""I make different music than I enjoy listening to, if that makes sense, he said. ""I make what I love to make, and I make what makes the most sense for me in that sense.""

Wetmore continued, ""I don't really let my influences persuade my writing or persuade the production sound. It's kind of just I'm trying to build my own lane and my whole thought behind it is -- and especially with this EP coming out -- my whole thought behind it was: Let's make something that sounds new, that sounds fresh, but it makes you feel like you're familiar with it at the same time.""

""That's that's my whole process and that's my whole thought behind, you know, the creative aspect of everything.""

Ahead of the release of his EP ""Waves on a Sunset,"" Wetmore made his debut at Nashville's famed Grand Ole Opry. The singer took the stage on Sept. 20, where he performed a three-song set and received a standing ovation from the audience.

Following his performance, UMG Nashville Chair & CEO Cindy Mabe and Mitchell surprised Wetmore by presenting him with two RIAA Gold plaques, certifying his hits ""Wine Into Whiskey"" and ""Wind Up Missin' You.""

Though Wetmore is setting out on his first solo tour, the musician is no stranger to the road. This year, he opened for Luke Bryan on the country star's Farm Tour, and he will hit the road with Thomas Rhett next year on the five-time Grammy Award nominee's Better Than Boots tour.

Wetmore told Fox News Digital that he's a ""huge fan"" of both Bryan and Rhett.

""Getting these opportunities to meet these people and being able to play with them is cool because I do look up to them, and they run their ship the way I want to run my ship,"" he said. ""It's just being a sponge out on the road, and it's really cool.""

""There's so many things to look forward to,"" he said. ""Just being on the road is a blessing within itself, you know? And then what makes the headline so cool is that it is sold out.""

Wetmore continued, ""Almost sold out -- I think it's like 97% right now, but that's my first one. So, it's like all of these people not just coming to the shows because I'm opening up for someone.""

""All just going to be my fans and the people that want to come watch me perform and sing these songs and sing them with me. I think that's what I'm most excited about is really getting to connect with my fans and getting the opportunity to do so.""

Wetmore also shared his reaction to being billed as one of country music's 2024 breakout stars.

""I'm just here, man,"" he said. I'm just happy to be here, you know?""

""That is very flattering, and I'm very blessed to be in the positions and the opportunities that I am,"" Wetmore added. ""But at the end of the day, I'm doing what I love. And that's more than anything money can buy.""

""And my mom always told me, she was like, 'You do something.' And this is super cliché, but she's like, 'You do something you love, you'll never work a day in your life,'"" he added. ""And I live by that. I wake up every morning, I get to do stuff like this where I get to talk to someone new and about cool things that are going on. Or I get to go on stage and I get to open for Luke Bryan or Thomas Rhett.""

""I get to do these cool things where it's like, I never thought it would be possible, but it's all a blessing. And I'll never take it for granted."""
Woman with muscular dystrophy completes 12 marathons in wheelchair for charity: 'Won't let it define me',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/woman-muscular-dystrophy-completes-marathons-wheelchair-charity-wont-let-define,2024-10-08T08:46:59Z,"Born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy, Peri Finkelstein has never let her disorder define her.

Instead, the 24-year-old New Yorker has used her challenges as a springboard to make the world a better place, completing 12 marathons to raise funds for charity.

In January 2024, Finkelstein's nonprofit organization -- the Team Peri Foundation -- exceeded the $1 million fundraising milestone for its Chai Lifeline project, which offers support to families following an illness diagnosis or trauma.

FATHER CREATED A DRUG TO SAVE HIS SON FROM A RARE DISEASE, NOW OTHER FAMILIES ARE DESPERATE TO GET IT

Muscular dystrophy is a group of more than 30 genetic conditions that affect the functioning of the muscles, according to Cleveland Clinic.

Finkelstein's form of the condition, called nemaline rod myopathy, causes severe muscle weakness and affects her speech and mobility.

Despite her physical limitations, she was inspired to start doing marathons in 2010 when her mother and brother began running them for charity.

""After watching everybody do the marathon and cheering from the sidelines, I knew that I wanted to make more of an impact,"" she said during an interview with Fox News Digital.

MOTHER FRANTIC TO SAVE CLINICAL TRIAL THAT COULD CURE HER DAUGHTER: 'THE TREATMENT IS SITTING IN A FRIDGE'

For the first few years, Finkelstein's mother pushed her in a jogging stroller with all the necessary medical equipment secured to the bottom.

Then, in 2016, Finkelstein decided it was time to stand up and walk a few steps over the finish line, with the help of her physical therapist and her parents.

""At that moment, it felt as if I could do anything that I put my mind to,"" she said.

""It was a defining moment, when I realized the only person who could get in my way was myself -- and that it was up to me to change my life.""

'LIQUID GOLD' COULD BRING NEW HOPE TO MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS, STUDY SUGGESTS: 'PROFOUND BENEFIT'

In subsequent marathons, those initial steps turned into walking more than 1,000 steps, then a mile, and then a mile and a half, forwards and backwards across the finish line.

After several years of pushing that ""extra mile,"" Finkelstein experienced medical challenges in 2022 that made her unable to compete.

""It never dawned on me that part of my life would be over,"" she said.

""You have to push yourself to the limit for each mile marker, as nothing will ever come easily.""

""Once I officially lost that part of myself, I realized that I couldn't allow this setback to get to me -- I knew that I had to keep moving.""

Instead of competing physically, Finkelstein now funnels her energy into her foundation's fundraising efforts.

""Since I was 8 years old, my dream was to launch a nonprofit organization of my own,"" she said.

""The same mindset that I used to prepare both physically and mentally for a marathon is what I carry into my daily life as an entrepreneur.""

STIFF PERSON SYNDROME PATIENTS SHARE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE WITH THE RARE DISEASE

The Team Peri Foundation strives to make the world a ""more connected and inclusive place for all,"" Finkelstein said, with the mission to ""educate others on the power of inclusion and to disrupt the stereotypical views revolving around disability.""

While Finkelstein strives to stay positive and focus on her goals, she acknowledges that her day-to-day life isn't always easy.

""Not every day is all rainbows and sunshine -- some days are harder than others, to the point where severe migraines, fatigue and pain keep me from doing what I have to do,"" she said.

THE GIRL WHO CAN'T SMILE: HOW A RARE DISORDER BECAME A YOUNG WOMAN'S 'GREATEST GIFT'

Finkelstein undergoes different forms of therapy multiple times a week, has frequent doctor's appointments and is ""always in pain,"" she shared.

Her social media posts highlight the highs and lows.

""My hope is that by sharing bits and pieces of my world -- portraying all the different sides of me, whether it's rather dark or filled with light -- I can portray that people with disabilities can live a full life and step out of line in ways that can change the course of their future,"" she said.

To other people living with a disabling condition, Finkelstein advises them, ""Use your rareness to your advantage.""

""My time is precious and I still have a lot more to accomplish.""

""Growing up, I would give anything to blend in and become invisible, as being 'different' put a lot of labels on me that caused me to be bullied severely by students and teachers alike,"" she said.

""But as I've gotten older, I've realized it's OK to be rare.""

Life itself can be compared to the dozen marathons she has competed in, according to Finkelstein.

""You have to push yourself to the limit for each mile marker, as nothing will ever come easily,"" she said.

""All the pain, traumas and setbacks are what enable you to keep going and keep hustling.""

""You have to power through the pain, because there is no other option.""

Since hitting the $1 million milestone, Finkelstein and her foundation have launched new projects, including a scholarship fund in partnership with Adelphi University, where she earned her MBA in marketing.

She also works to boost awareness and education through speaking engagements, social media and podcasting, and hosts various fundraising events throughout the year.

Finkelstein plans to write and publish a memoir to share her life's journey with the world.

""While I used to be an athlete, I am still just as competitive and am somewhat of an overachiever in the real world,"" Finkelstein said.

The entrepreneur is also acutely aware that life is short.

Hurricane Milton poses an 'extremely serious threat' as it barrels toward Florida,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5145557/hurricane-milton-florida,2024-10-08T08:45:42Z,"Heavy traffic flows northbound on Interstate 75 as people evacuate the Tampa Bay area ahead of Hurricane Milton's arrival late Monday, Oct. 7, 2024, in Ocala, Fla. Julio Cortez/AP hide caption

Communities in Florida are bracing for the impact of Hurricane Milton, which quickly went intensified from a tropical storm to a powerful, life-threatening hurricane much faster than predicted.

By early Tuesday morning, the National Hurricane Center downgraded Milton to a Category 4 storm, but officials at the agency warned of the storm's power. ""Milton poses an extremely serious threat to Florida and residents are urged to follow the order of local officials,"" the NHC said.

As of 2 a.m. ET on Tuesday, Milton was about 585 miles southwest of Tampa, Florida. Milton is expected to make landfall off the western coast of Florida late Wednesday or Thursday morning. But the forecasters at the NHC also said that weather conditions in Florida may deteriorate much earlier on Wednesday.

""Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area on the west coast of Florida as early as Wednesday afternoon, with tropical storm conditions beginning early Wednesday,"" the agency said.

A slew of advisories are in effect in the area, where storm surges could get as high as 15 feet and wind speeds could reach 155 miles per hour.

School districts and government facilities in the area announced they would be closed for several days. Counties have enforced mandatory evacuation zones, and state and local officials have profusely warned residents to follow those orders.

""You don't have to evacuate hundreds of miles,"" Gov. Ron DeSantis has said. ""Every county has places within them that you can go to. Maybe it's a friend's house, maybe it's a hotel, maybe it's a shelter.""

Air travel into and around Florida is already being disrupted by Milton. The Tampa International Airport said it was pausing flights beginning Tuesday morning. The Federal Aviation Administration said on X, formerly Twitter, that it was ""closely monitoring"" the path of the hurricane and advised travelers to check the agency's flight travel dashboard and their airlines."
Unit Of Li Ka-Shing's CK Life Sciences To Merge With Nasdaq-Listed Biotech Company In $100 Million Deal,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2024/10/08/unit-of-li-ka-shings-ck-life-sciences-to-merge-with-nasdaq-listed-biotech-company-in-100-million-deal/,2024-10-08T08:39:14Z,"CK Life Sciences' WEX Pharmaceuticals is combining with Virios Therapeutics to tap into the U.S. capital market.

CK Life Sciences, the biotech arm of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, has agreed to merge a Canadian drug development unit, WEX Pharmaceuticals, with Nasdaq-listed Virios Therapeutics.

CK Life Sciences said on Monday that Sealbond, a wholly-owned subsidiary, is selling its 100% stake in Pharmagesic, the parent company of WEX Pharmaceuticals, to Virios Therapeutics for $100 million in an all-stock deal. Following the transaction, WEX Pharmaceuticals will merge with Virios Therapeutics, which will be renamed Dogwood Therapeutics, according to CK Life Sciences' filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The combination will be effective on Wednesday.

""The merger enables WEX to tap into the U.S. capital markets, and strengthen the R&D team, accelerating the development of WEX,"" said Alan Yu, deputy chairman of CK Life Sciences, in a statement.

Vancouver-based WEX Pharmaceuticals is developing a treatment for moderate-to-severe pain conditions caused by cancer and chemotherapy. Called Halneuron, the drug has entered clinical human trials. The company was taken over by CK Life Sciences' Pharmagesic in 2011.

Georgia-headquartered Virios Therapeutics, meanwhile, is developing therapies for long-Covid and fibromyalgia, an illness that causes chronic muscle pain and fatigue.

On Monday, CK Life Sciences also said it will provide a loan of up to $19.5 million through another wholly-owned subsidiary, Conjoint, to finance WEX Pharmaceuticals' clinical and research and development activities for its Halneuron drug.

CK Life Sciences, chaired by Li's eldest son Victor, focuses on developing therapies for cancer as well as treatment for cancer-induced pain and cancer diagnostics. The Hong Kong-listed company also has business in health supplements and in agriculture, including ownership of vineyards and salt production.

CK Life Sciences has in recent years jumped on the artificial intelligence bandwagon, partnering with Shenzhen-based AI drug discovery company Xtalpi to discover and design tumor vaccines and diagnostic tools. Known formally as QuantumPharm, Xtalpi went public in a $127 million Hong Kong initial public offering in June.

Li, who serves as the senior advisor of his two flagship companies, CK Hutchison and CK Asset, has been devoted to healthcare causes. Through his Li Ka Shing Foundation, the 96-year-old has made numerous donations in the field, including gifting two cutting-edge devices that can destroy cancerous tissue using non-invasive ultrasound waves to the University of Hong Kong's Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine in August.

Last year, Li was named as one of Forbes Asia's Heroes of Philanthropy list for his HK$60 million donation to two universities to support the use of AI in medical education. The nonagenarian started his foundation in 1980 and has since given away more than HK$30 billion, with the bulk of the funds going to education and healthcare."
"Microsoft Will Buy OpenAI Within Three Years, Analyst Predicts",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2024/10/08/microsoft-will-buy-openai-within-three-years-analyst-predicts/,2024-10-08T08:32:11Z,"Within three years OpenAI will find it so difficult to raise funds it will need to sell to Microsoft, an analyst firm has predicted.

CCS Insight claims dwindling interest in AI will force firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic into the arms of investors with deeper pockets, with Microsoft and Amazon the most likely suitors for the two AI companies.

""We think there's going to be a bit of a correction in the AI space because the hype starts to blow out of it,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight.

The AI companies ""are going to start questioning whether it makes sense for them to carry on, but they're also going to need a lot of money, because investors focus might shift away from that [AI], and the startups will just find it difficult to keep funding for the innovation that they want to do,"" Wood added.

While Wood concedes that OpenAI's latest funding round shows it's ""having no trouble raising cash at the moment,"" he believes the situation could change over the next few years. ""We're talking about this [takeover] in 2027, so this is quite a long way down the road,"" he said.

OpenAI is pivotal to Microsoft, because its Copilot AI services are largely based on OpenAI's GPT technology. ""It might be that Microsoft sees that there's a strategic importance in owning OpenAI outright and keeping complete control of how the business shapes up in the future,"" Wood said.

Microsoft has been linked with a takeover of OpenAI in the past, not least in November 2023 when boardroom turmoil resulted in CEO Sam Altman temporarily leaving the firm and joining Microsoft for a very brief period.

That situation was quickly resolved, with Altman rejoining OpenAI following protests by the company's staff. But with Microsoft's AI business hugely reliant on OpenAI, Microsoft may decide to make its move when the investor hype surrounding AI dies down, according to CCS Insight.

""The vast amounts of money that's required to keep these AI services going, and the fact that you need to keep a competitive edge at a time when it's getting more and more competitive, we think that may well encourage the leading stakeholders to get more actively involved,"" said Wood.

Nvidia has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, seeing its share price shoot up nine-fold since the beginning of 2023. However, CCS Insight predicts that Nvidia's time in the sun may be coming to an end.

Wood said the company's CUDA framework, which powers many of the leading AI services, is ""very much the only game in town"" at the moment, and that the company is still struggling to meet demand for its chips. ""But there will come a point where that will start to come into better balance,"" he said. ""I think that Nvidia's position will weaken, and also we'll see the competitive landscape changing.""

He thinks open-source alternatives to CUDA and the ""general slowdown"" in AI investment ""will mean that Nvidia's position won't be quite as enviable as it is right now.""

Wood cites Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, as saying that he would rather risk building AI capacity before it's needed than after it's too late. But he predicts that when ""you're just building, building, building, all of a sudden you're like, 'wow, we've got as much capacity as we need,' and that's a dangerous moment for Nvidia."""
Gabby Petito describes Utah fight with Brian Laundrie in conversation with female park ranger: bodycam,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/gabby-petito-describes-utah-fight-brian-laundrie-conversation-female-park-ranger-bodycam,2024-10-08T08:16:27Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The National Park Service has publicly shared bodycam video showing U.S. Rangers on scene during the ominous traffic stop outside Arches National Park in August 2021 involving Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie, just weeks before her murder.

The videos were provided to Fox News Digital as part of a public records request and provide a glimpse of a female ranger's efforts calming Petito down and urging her to distance herself from Laundrie's abusive behavior.

In parts, the audio is hard to make out, but Petito appears to vent her frustrations with Laundrie, who witnesses said struck her in public, then tried to drive off without her outside the Moonflower Co-op, a grocery store in the heart of town. Throughout the encounter, however, she downplays Laundrie's behavior.

The NPS said it would release transcripts at some point.

GABBY PETITO BODYCAM SHOWS BRIAN LAUNDRIE'S PARENTS REFUSE TO HELP POLICE AFTER MISSING PERSON REPORT

Petito claims to have hit him first, taking the blame for his collision with the curb.

""He's a lot stronger than me,"" she adds, denying that she could have hurt him.

However, they shed new light on the incident as Petito spoke candidly with a female Park Ranger from the National Park Service, who was on scene at the same time as Moab police officers.

""The NPS videos will certainly be part of the relevant evidence in the case,"" said Brian Stewart, an attorney from Parker & McConkie, which is representing Petito's parents in their Utah lawsuit. ""While the videos provide an additional perspective that may be helpful, they do not appear to contain substantively different information.""

Moab police officers initiated the stop in the entrance way to Arches National Park, just outside the city. Park Rangers arrived to support but played a secondary role in the interaction.

Previously released video shows Petito in hysterics as officers confront her and Laundrie following reports of a domestic violence incident on Main Street in Moab, in which Laundrie allegedly hit her. However, she downplayed the incident to police, who began to treat her as the ""aggressor.""

The Park Ranger's bodycam shows previously unseen statements from Petito.

""Look im gonna speak to you...I'm looking at you not so much like a suspect, but also kind of a victim, in the sense that you're dealing with the struggles, emotionally and mentally at your age, probably that work themselves out as you get older,"" a male officer tells Petito.

The ranger, in a prior interview, said she had urged Petito to distance herself from a ""toxic"" relationship with Laundrie.

Ranger Melissa Hulls stepped aside to speak with Petito in private, believing she would be more open to speaking one-on-one with a female officer alone, according to Salt Lake City's Deseret News.

""I can still hear her voice,"" she said days after Petito's remains were discovered in Wyoming, a few weeks after the stop. ""She wasn't just a face on the milk carton. She was real to me.""

Moab police pulled over Laundrie and Petito on the road leading into Arches National Park around 4:45 p.m. MT on Aug. 12, 2021, in response to a 911 caller who said he witnessed a male ""slapping"" a female before the couple got into the van and headed north out of town.

Laundrie was behind the wheel, driving 45 mph in a 15 mph zone, before slamming into the curb.

While the Moab officers treated Petito like the aggressor, the Ranger took a different approach.

""Take a deep breath,"" she said, handing her a bottle of water.

""It sounds like you guys might need to work on your communication,"" she added later. ""Have you told him how it affects you when he makes these sarcastic comments?""

Although Utah law requires police to issue a citation or make an arrest in response to domestic violence, Moab police debated whether to classify the encounter as a domestic call or a mental health incident. Ultimately, officers declined to press charges but booked Laundrie a motel room in town through a nonprofit for domestic abuse survivors.

Motel management was unable to confirm whether he'd actually stayed for the night.

According to the FBI, he killed her and left her body at a campsite in the nearby Bridger-Teton National Forest, then drove her van to his parents' house in Florida. He went camping with his family and refused to cooperate with police before sneaking out and taking his own life -- leaving behind a handwritten confession.

Petito's parents sued Laundrie's family, and the sides settled out of court earlier this year. They are also suing the Moab Police Department in a case that has not yet gone to trial."

In a matter of moments, a North Carolina man's life was turned upside down when heavy flooding from Hurricane Helene claimed the life of his wife, leaving him and their four children behind.

""All of a sudden, I heard something. Sounded like an explosion. And me and my wife went running through the house and the back door was shattered,"" Jamie Guinn described to Fox News Digital in a phone interview. ""So I ran to go to the garage to get something to block the garage off and our garage was gone.""

On Friday, Sept. 27, Guinn was inside his Minneapolis, North Carolina, home with his wife, Melissa, and their 8-year-old son, River, sheltering in place when chaos broke out. Guinn said their home overlooked the river, and they had been monitoring it all morning when everything came tumbling down.

""It sounded like a cannon going off. I just remember being crushed by the house falling all around me,"" Guinn continued. ""And I can remember screaming for my little boy, and I could hear him screaming. And somehow, we dug through the house where it collapsed almost down into the river and I found him.""

Guinn said he was able to rescue his son and looked to see his wife sitting on top of where their home was, and that was the last time he saw her alive.

""And my wife was still up on the top where the house was. And she screamed at me, 'Babe, watch out!' And so I tried to grab my little boy and threw him on my back because I figured it was another slide, and by the time I turned back around to try to make myself alert ... she was gone,"" Guinn said, choking back tears.

""So I went to scream and was screaming for her, and I couldn't find my little boy. He turned around, and he just told me, 'Daddy, I think mommy's gone,'"" Guinn described. ""So we kept screaming and hollering for her and no one ever could find her. And at that time, I can't even remember if there was any part of the house left or if it was gone. It was all a blur.""

Guinn and his son were able to seek shelter at a nearby neighbor's home. Guinn said he suffered a fractured spine and a laceration to his head that got infected but that no pain was worse to endure than losing Melissa.

""She was my absolute best friend. I really don't know how I'm going to make it without her. We spent every day together. Everything I've done, she was involved in the same way as every other,"" Guinn. ""Just going from having that person in your life every day to literally gone in the blink of an eye, it just shows how often you might take for granted being with someone.""

Guinn said he and Melissa had been together for 17 years and were just weeks away from celebrating their 10-year wedding anniversary. He said he proposed around Halloween, and they had always exchanged small gifts each year.

""We always say I love you during the day, which we've done constantly, honestly. And every time I would always write back, 'Love you more,' so this year, I got her a little plaque, and it just gives a whole lot of reasons of what that really means,"" Guinn said. ""She was the absolute greatest mother and wife we could have all even asked for.""

Guinn said he is still in disbelief his community was struck so hard by Helene, something no one ever saw coming.

""How much the river water rose was just unfathomable. It's hard to put into words what that was like. It's stuff that's not supposed to happen here. It doesn't happen here,"" Guinn said. ""We don't know where, I don't even know where we begin to start picking up pieces from after this.""

Despite all the heartache and devastation, Guinn said it's been amazing to see his community come together for each other through this tragedy.

Everybody's always been here for each other, but this level of it, it's absolutely blown my mind how much everyone has stepped in to help us and everybody else around them is just ... the outpouring is just, I don't even know how to explain it,"" Guinn said.

Eddie Gallagher knows how it feels to have a target on your back, both on and off the battlefield.

The decorated Navy SEAL, now retired, served his country for more than two decades in combat zones overseas, fighting terrorists who were determined to kill him and harm America. Then, after returning home from his eighth and final deployment in 2017, Gallagher was accused of war crimes, put in the crosshairs of both prosecutors and the media and imprisoned for nearly eight months before his name was cleared.

Now, as co-founder of the Pipe Hitter Foundation, a nonprofit that gives financial and legal support to ""veterans, police officers and their families,"" Gallagher is raising money to help others fighting similar battles.

Pipe Hitter has gone to bat for other controversial figures like Marine Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller, whose 17-year career ended in court-martial in 2021 after he went viral for questioning senior military leadership amid the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. Another is Cmdr. Erik Ramey, a Navy physician who was serving as the senior medical officer at Basic Training Command (BUDs) when Seaman Kyle Mullen died after completing ""Hell Week"" training in California.

NAVY SEAL EDWARD GALLAGHER FOUND NOT GUILTY ON MURDER AND ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGES

""What we do is we support active-duty military, law enforcement and first responders. If they're being unjustly accused for doing their job, we step in,"" Gallagher told Fox News Digital. ""We provide emergency relief aid to their families while they're going through that stressful time.""

On Oct. 12, the Pipe Hitter Foundation will host its first fundraiser, an event called ""Operator For a Day"" at Stronghold SOF Solutions in Defuniak Springs, Florida. Gallagher is teaming up with former New York Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik and other highly trained military special operators to give civilians hands-on firearms training, show how to fight from vehicles and put on a special operator close-quarter combat live demonstration.

""What we're going to do is have all retired special operators coming in to help instruct, and we're going to be doing some basic pistol, rifle carving course, some vehicle stuff. We're really going to make it a lot of fun,"" Gallagher said. ""For the people that do come, it's just going to give them a taste of what some of these individuals that they are supporting go through on a daily basis.""

The retired SEAL said he hopes the event will give attendees more appreciation for what Navy SEALS and Green Berets go through when they risk their lives for their country.

Tickets are $3,000 per individual with ammo provided, though there are group discounts. While that is by no means cheap, Gallagher says the money will serve those who first served the American people.

""The big thing which I like that we do is we help mentor those people through that process. We're able to share our experiences of what we went through, and that does a lot for them, because when you're put in a situation like that, there's very few people who know exactly what that feels like and the amount of pressure that's put upon you and your family when the government is targeting you,"" Gallagher said.

It's personal for Gallagher. In 2017, he was found not guilty of murdering an Islamic State fighter but was convicted of posing with the dead prisoner's corpse. The Navy reduced his rank from chief petty officer to petty officer first class and considered revoking his SEAL trident insignia.

Former President Trump took notice of Gallagher's story after it garnered national media attention and intervened on his behalf to restore his previous rank in 2019. He also stopped the Navy from seeking further disciplinary action against him and fired Navy Secretary Richard Spencer for his handling of the case.

After his acquittal, Gallagher sued his former attorneys for allegedly delaying his case to run up his legal bills. He also accused the prosecutors of acting illegally and unethically.

The prosecutors from the case were awarded a Navy Achievement medal just eight days after Gallagher was acquitted on most of the charges. Trump had the medals promptly rescinded and described the attorneys' actions as ""incompetent.""

EX-NAVY SEAL EDDIE GALLAGHER, ACQUITTED IN WAR CRIMES CASE, SPEAKS OUT: NEW BOOK 'GETS THE TRUTH OUT THERE'

Gallagher retired in 2020 to found the Pipe Hitter Foundation alongside his wife, Andrea. The 501(c)(3) organization has since aided a number of military and law enforcement personnel accused of wrongdoing, those like Ben Darby, an Alabama police officer accused of murder after he shot and killed a man threatening suicide.

Darby shot and killed Jeff Parker on April 3, 2018, after Parker called 911 and threatened suicide. The incident was caught on video and a review board deemed Darby's actions were justified. However, the Madison County district attorney pursued murder charges against the officer and Darby was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

The Pipe Hitter Foundation assisted Darby as he appealed his case. After serving about 20 months in prison, an appeals court overturned the conviction and Darby was released. The officer later pleaded guilty to manslaughter and a judge sentenced him to three years of probation in 2023, AL.com reported.

""He was able to go back to his family,"" Gallagher said of Darby. ""You know, the frights are never over there either. He has to overcome all of the fake news and just the way he was demonized in the media.""

TRUMP DECLARES NAVY WILL NOT TAKE AWAY EDDIE GALLAGHER'S SEAL TRIDENT AS ATTORNEY BLASTS ADMIRAL

Pipe Hitter recently became involved in Ramey's case as the Navy physician now faces an inquiry related to Mullen's death.

A Navy autopsy said Mullen was suffering from acute pneumonia and had an enlarged heart. An investigation released last year found there were widespread failures in medical care, poor oversight and the use of performance-enhancing drugs in the BUDs training program, the Associated Press reported. Ramey and the commander of Naval Special Warfare Training Command, Capt. Brad Geary, were among those officers identified as responsible after the BUDs student died.

The Pipe Hitter Foundation says the Bureau of Naval Medicine had already investigated and determined that Ramey met the standard of care and exonerated him.

""They're trying to hang those two out to dry,"" Gallagher said. ""When we saw this happening, we knew exactly what it was. And so we're supporting Dr. Ramey and hopefully pressuring the Navy to do the right thing and drop these charges against him because he is in jeopardy of losing his medical license.""

These cases are hard, but Gallagher argues that everyone is innocent until proven guilty and no one deserves to be vilified before they have their day in court, especially those who volunteer to serve the country. If service members are demonized, Gallagher said, fewer people will want to serve.

""I think it's a bigger problem than people know about,"" he said. ""I met people when I was locked up. I met young kids that did not deserve to be in there. They made a mistake in life, you know, and the overpunishment in the military is ridiculous. You had these kids serving five to six years for showing up late to a formation or failing a drug test.""

He noted that if some of those teens had gone to college instead of volunteering for military service, they would be free.

""The military has a nasty epidemic of overpunishing people to keep their prosecution rates up. So, it's a major problem. I think the UCMJ, which is the Uniform Code of Military Justice, is an outdated and archaic system, and it's very corrupt the way it's run.""

Gallagher said military justice reform is one of the pillars of the Pipe Hitter Foundation's mission. His hope is that their work, supported by Saturday's fundraiser, will encourage young men and women to volunteer to serve.

""We have a huge recruiting crisis going on. And I think it's due to the fact that these young men and women, who are coming up out of high school or in college, are seeing the way people in the military were treated, especially over the whole COVID vaccine mandate and all the individuals they kicked out illegally and then invited back years later without an apology.

""Young men and women are paying attention. So, if they can see that there are groups out there who support these people that are getting falsely accused or are grossly mistreated, hopefully that will give them some hope to stand up, raise your right hand and want to serve the country.""

Eye of the Storm: Back-to-back hurricanes threaten to upend Harris-Trump presidential showdown,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/eye-storm-hurricanes-theaten-upend-harris-trump-presidential-showdown,2024-10-08T08:10:52Z,"Fox News' Chad Pergram reports on the politics of disaster relief as FEMA pushes back on the 'dangerous' criticism of their Hurricane Helene response.

As the death toll rises and roughly a quarter of a million people remain without power or running water a week and a half after Hurricane Helen tore a path of destruction through the southeast United States, another powerful storm is bearing down on the region.

Hurricane Milton, now an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm, is on course to slam into Florida Wednesday evening.

With four weeks to go until Election Day in November and Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump locked in a bitter margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed President Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene -- North Carolina and Georgia -- among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election - the politics of federal disaster relief are once again front and center on the campaign trail.

Trump has been attacking the vice president and her boss over the federal response to Hurricane Helene for well over a week. Harris, on Monday, fired back, accusing Trump of pushing ""a lot of mis and disinformation.""

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS WEATHER UPDATES ON HURRICANE MILTON

The former president has repeatedly charged that Biden and Harris have been incompetant in their handling of rescue and recovery efforts.

""It is going down as the WORST & MOST INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED 'STORM,' AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, EVER SEEN BEFORE,"" Trump claimed last week.

On Monday, he argued in a social media post that the administration's storm response was ""the WORST rescue operation in the history of the U.S.""

And Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, charged Monday in a ""Fox and Friends"" interview that the administration's efforts were ""incompetence of the highest order.""

The Trump campaign, in announcing Vance would hold a town hall Thursday in Greensboro, North Carolina, argued that Harris ""completely left North Carolina behind in the wake of devastation post-Hurricane Helene.""

And in a blatant pitch for votes, the former president claimed that ""NORTH CAROLINA HAS BEEN VIRTUALLY ABANDONED BY KAMALA!!! DROP HER LIKE SHE DROPPED YOU - VOTE FOR PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP. MAGA2024!""

Trump's repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims as he's targeted Biden and Harris - among them that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia had been unable to reach Biden when Helene first tore through the Peach State. Kemp later confirmed that he had already been in contact with the president.

Despite the untruths from the former president, he did beat Biden and Harris to the scene, surveying the storm-damaged region two days before they did last week.

The optics put the president and vice president on defense, and they've been forced to repeatedly correct the record.

The White House has publicized FEMA's [Federal Emergency Management Agency] efforts in assisting the hard-hit states. Biden made back-to-back trips to the southeast last Wednesday and Thursday, as he stopped in the four hardest hit states, and Harris also made two trips to survey damage.

Huddled with Democratic and Republican politicians from the region last week, Biden emphasized that ""in a moment like this, we put politics aside, at least we should put it all aside. We have here -- there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans -- our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and as thoroughly as we can.""

Trump - along with his allies - has repeatedly aimed to tie the storm response to the combustible issue of border security, as he claimed that FEMA funds for the rescue and relief efforts in North Carolina were being diverted to support undocumented migrants.

The Harris campaign, firing back, said that Trump and Vance and their allies have been ""pushing debunked lies about Hurricane Helene response.""

A top North Carolina Republican - Sen. Thom Tillis - asked about the charges, said on the Sunday talk shows that ""I believe that we have to stay focused on rescue operations, recovery operations, clearing operations, and we don't need any of these distractions on the ground.""

Harris, on Monday, called Trump's actions ""extraordinarily irresponsible.""

""It's about him. It's not about you. And the reality is that FEMA has so many resources that are available to folks who desperately need them now, and resources that are about helping people get back on their feet and rebuild and have places to go,"" Harris emphasized.

But longtime Republican strategist David Kochel noted that Trump had been ""very aggressive"" with his initial quick trip to the storm-damaged region.

""I think he put a lot of pressure on them to try to do something,"" Kochel, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, told Fox News. ""He's out there pushing a line that they don't care, they're not doing anything, and I think they're reacting to it.""

Now, with Hurricane Milton bearing down on Florida, the Biden administration highlighted their efforts in a release headlined ""Federal Assistance for Hurricane Helene Exceeds $210 Million, FEMA Prepares for Dual Response with Hurricane Milton Strengthening as it Moves Toward Gulf Coast of Florida.""

As Biden declared a state of emergency in Florida on Monday, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said during a news conference that 5,000 National Guardsmen had been mobilized in his state, with another 3,000 on the way.

""We have gotten what we need from the feds,"" DeSantis said. ""The president has approved what we asked for....I'm thankful for that.. Everything we've asked for from President Biden, he's approved.""

This is far from the first time that a tropical storm has impacted a presidential race.

Then-President George H.W. Bush took a political hit over FEMA's disorganized efforts to provide relief in Florida from Hurricane Andrew, which pounded the then-key battleground state weeks before Election Day.

Fast-forward a decade and his son - then-President George W. Bush - likely enjoyed a political bounce in Florida during his 2004 re-election thanks to his aggressive response to Hurricane Charley, which hit in August of that year.

Bush was narrowly re-elected, thanks in large part to carrying the Sunshine State, but his administration's image in handling storms took a major hit the next year, over the botched response in Louisiana to Hurricane Katrina.

As he ran for re-election in 2012, then-President Barack Obama's aggressive response in dealing with Superstorm Sandy -which slammed into the Eastern Seaboard days before the election - likely boosted him to victory.

Trump, in his first year in office, faced criticism as Puerto Rico struggled to recover from a powerful storm. The president was pilloried for throwing paper towels to the crowd as he stopped by a relief center during a storm-related visit to the island.

But the incident - which took place three years before his re-election effort - was vastly overshadowed by his response to the COVID crisis, the worst pandemic to hit the globe in a century."
"1 year after Hezbollah strikes, Israel reinforces troops and questions mount over 'limited' operation",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/one-year-after-hezbollah-strikes-israel-reinforces-troops-questions-mount-over-limited-operation,2024-10-08T08:10:46Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

One week after Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon and one year after Hezbollah fired rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in support of Hamas, Jerusalem reinforced its troops fighting inside Lebanon with a third division, prompting immediate questions over the extent of its ""limited"" operations in Lebanon.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Sunday sent troops from its 91st Division, also known as the Galilee Formation, to join forces already in Lebanon hunting down Hezbollah strongholds.

The 91st Division, traditionally responsible for overseeing security for the entirety of the border with Lebanon, will reinforce efforts already being carried out by two other divisions.

AMERICAN FATHER OF HAMAS HOSTAGE ITAY CHEN PUSHES US, ISRAEL ON 'PLAN B' AS NEGOTIATIONS FALTER

Israel's initial advance into Lebanon was led by soldiers from the 98th Division on Oct. 1, which encompassed paratroopers, elite commandos and the 7th Armored Brigade, who were transferred to northern Israel from the border with Gaza in early September for training, reported the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) Long War Journal on Sunday ahead of the IDF announcement.

""Forces from the Commando Brigade, including soldiers from the Egoz Unit, located and destroyed a Hezbollah attack infrastructure, which included a rocket launcher, explosive stockpiles, and additional military equipment,"" the IDF said of the initial operation.

Though Hezbollah's response was fairly muted as many were believed to have retreated ahead of the incursion, at least nine IDF soldiers were killed between Oct. 1-2 during one of the opening battles in Lebanon, confirmed the Long War Journal.

Reinforcements from the IDF's 36th Division, including the Golani infantry, 188th Armored Brigade and the 6th Reserve Infantry Brigade were then sent in, according to reports last week.

Following the Israeli incursion - a security measure that the U.S. and other international allies warned Jerusalem against - IDF spokesperson Rear. Adm. Daniel Hagari said Israel would not push its ground forces north toward Beirut and would instead focus on securing the villages near the border.

Jerusalem has said the operation in Lebanon is necessary to secure the area so some 60,000 Israelis from northern Israel could return home, though data collected by the FDD shows that some 150,000 Israelis have evacuated from the northern border areas.

IDF MEETS LITTLE RESISTANCE FROM HEZBOLLAH AFTER WEEKS OF HITTING TERROR TARGETS, OFFICIALS SAY

Hagari said the incursion would be ""limited"" and take ""days"" to ""weeks"" to complete.

But the renewed support of additional troops on Monday prompted questions over the scope of Israel's plans in southern Lebanon, including from the U.S. State Department on Monday.

In response to questions from reporters regarding Israel's operations in Lebanon, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, ""We're watching this very closely.""

""We support their ability to target militants, to degrade Hezbollah's infrastructure, to degrade Hezbollah's capability. But we are very cognizant of the many times in the past where Israel has gone in on what looked like limited operations and has stayed for months or for years,"" he added. ""And ultimately, that's not the outcome that we want to see.""

Israel has not announced any additional plans for its ground forces and said the IDF Divisions have engaged in ""targeted, limited, and localized operations"" in southern Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah's infrastructure.

But one security expert with the FDD pointed out that Israel could be taking precautionary steps to build up its force in the region should Israel decide it needs to bolster its ability to go after Hezbollah even further.

""What the Israelis have been doing is gradually ratcheting up pressure on Hezbollah to make the price of continuing to attack in support of Gaza too costly for the organization,"" David Daoud, senior fellow at FDD specializing in Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital.

Daoud explained that in the wake of the Oct. 8 attacks, Israel and Hezbollah engaged in ""mutual attrition,"" continuing to strike one another but rarely taking the level of attack beyond aerial bombardments, unlike the attacks carried out by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023.

ISRAEL'S GROUND INVASION INTO LEBANON IMMINENT AS CABINET APPROVES NEXT PHASE OF THE WAR

This level of engagement shifted after Israel's telecommunication device operation in which it allegedly detonated some 5,000 pagers previously distributed to Hezbollah operatives, killing more than three dozen and wounding nearly 3,000 others in a coordinated attack in late September.

Israel has not taken credit for the attacks, but according to open-source data compiled by the FDD in its latest interactive report dubbed ""Road to the Third Lebanon War, Mapping the War of Attrition,"" the event was a clear launching point in which Jerusalem drastically changed its modus operandi when it came to countering Hezbollah.

On Sept. 22, Israel carried out its most significant bombardment against the terrorist group than at any other point since the Oct. 8, 2023,attacks, firing some 1,182 strikes, nearly five times the number of attacks it fired during its second-heaviest strike campaign on Feb. 11, 2024, when 239 strikes were fired, the FDD found.

""I would call it a kind of proactive attrition,"" said Daoud, who co-authored the FDD report. ""The Israelis are no longer keeping a balance of attrition, they're really weighing heavily on Hezbollah without going to a full ground invasion.""

The expert explained that the IDF is ""ratcheting up pressure"" on Hezbollah in an attempt to get it to back off its support for Hamas, a similar strategy it has taken in Gaza in an attempt to persuade Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to hand over the hostages.

The merits of this approach are debatable as hostages remain in Hamas captivity despite the immense pains the IDF has caused in the Gaza Strip, and Daoud questioned whether this tactic would be effective against Hezbollah, an organization that is more sophisticated, better armed, better financed and more entwined in Lebanese society.

""I don't see Hezbollah backing down, even at this level of pain that the Israelis are inflicting upon them,"" Daoud said. ""So a ground invasion may become necessary, and you want to make sure that your forces are in place for that to move into effect immediately, if that becomes the case.""

The expert highlighted that Israel may once again be considering the establishment of a ""security zone"" in Lebanon in order to create a buffer between Hezbollah strongholds and the Israeli border, a move that would replicate steps Israel took between 1985 and 2000 and one that would require a prolonged IDF stay in Lebanon.

It is unclear if Israel could be considering another buffer-zone scenario, though it would likely prove unpopular not only with the Lebanese government but with the international community, which has increasingly urged Israel to reduce its footprint in the region by embracing a two-state solution with the Palestinians in the south and along Israel's eastern border.

But Daoud argued that the threat Hezbollah poses isn't going away and that creating a buffer zone combined with continued air strikes could be the solution that appeases the international community best by avoiding an all-out ground invasion across Lebanon.

""There are ways to avoid a ground invasion,"" Daoud argued. ""It will take much longer, but given where international opinion is, this is probably a better option for Israel now than a full ground invasion up to Beirut.""

Though Israel has not announced any plans to engage in a ground operation to oust Hezbollah forces from strongholds like Beirut, it has ramped up the number of strikes on suburban areas outside the capital city, and since late September the U.S. has organized the departure of some 700 Americans from Lebanon."
'Social cost of greenhouse gases': House GOP targets progressive Biden policy for rising energy prices,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/social-cost-greenhouse-gases-house-gop-targets-progressive-biden-policy-rising-energy-prices,2024-10-08T08:10:43Z,"FIRST ON FOX: House Republicans are moving to roll back a progressive Obama-era regulatory metric for greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that it's sandbagging the U.S. energy sector by using ""nonscientific"" standards.

""North Carolinians are struggling to fill up their tanks and pay their electricity bills. The last thing they are worried about is the 'social cost' of energy,"" Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., told Fox News Digital.

""We need to be unleashing American energy to lower prices, not crippling production with burdensome, costly regulations.""

Hudson, who also chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, is leading 12 fellow GOP lawmakers in introducing a bill to stop federal agencies using the ""social cost of carbon"" when creating new regulations for the U.S. energy sector.

HOUSE PASSES BILL BLOCKING BIDEN ADMIN ATTEMPT TO REQUIRE TWO-THIRDS OF NEW CARS TO BE ELECTRIC WITHIN YEARS

Models calculating the ""social cost"" of greenhouse gases use several factors, including population health, sea level changes, economic impacts and other human-felt costs.

Because of the vastly different indicators, ""social cost"" emissions projections can vary widely, according to the Brookings Institute.

It was first used as a federal regulatory tool under the Obama administration but was rolled back by former President Trump.

President Biden made it part of his clean energy plan when he took office, directing a task force to study where federal agencies should consider the ""social cost of greenhouse gases"" as part of an executive order titled ""Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis.""

BIDEN-HARRIS EV MANDATES WILL HURT WORKERS IN STATES LIKE MICHIGAN: TUDOR DIXON

Democrats have held it up as a necessary tool that presents a more holistic picture for the long-term harms of carbon pollution.

Republicans, however, have criticized the metric as a nonscientific tool that's responsible for burdensome regulations.

Republican Study Committee Chair Kevin Hern, R-Okla., a co-sponsor of the bill, said the ""social cost"" metric and the Biden administration's green energy push overall was pushing gas prices up.

Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, another co-sponsor of the bill, said, ""The Biden-Harris White House has proven their willingness to hide behind biased and flawed research to advance their war against American energy producers.""

Meghan Markle's daring plan to win over Hollywood amid royal drama: expert,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markles-daring-plan-win-over-hollywood-royal-drama-expert,2024-10-08T08:07:08Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Meghan Markle displayed a bold new look for a surprise appearance, a move that some royal watchers claim was part of a master plan to win over Hollywood.

On Saturday, the Duchess of Sussex was a glamorous guest at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles 2024 gala. The 43-year-old walked the red carpet solo as Prince Harry was absent at the event. The Duke of Sussex was in the African Kingdom of Lesotho this week.

The mother of two recycled her plunging red Carolina Herrera gown, which she originally wore in 2021 when she and Harry attended the Salute to Freedom gala honoring veterans in New York City.

PRINCE HARRY'S NYC TRIP WITHOUT MEGHAN MARKLE CAN HELP HIM BOOST REPUTATION AFTER ROYAL DRAMA: EXPERTS

""Meghan's ultimate aim seems to be to make herself relevant and to transform herself into American royalty who is admired and powerful, independent of her husband,"" psychotherapist Dr. Robi Ludwig told Fox News Digital. ""Whether this will be successful remains to be seen, as the public has not always been receptive to many aspects of her character and personality.""

""Wearing red is a powerful, boss lady color,"" she shared. ""It says, 'I'm here, I'm not hiding, and I'm ready to assume my position of power.' Wearing red often symbolizes attraction, confidence and empowerment.

""The 'red dress effect' studies found that red enhances the male gaze and encourages men to find women wearing red more appealing. In fashion, red is also considered a power color that represents strength and determination. The hair is a throwback to her Hollywood actress days. It's all in sync with Meghan taking control of her life and doing things her way again.""

Meghan's appearance came shortly after a friend told People magazine that a ""twin-track approach is evolving for Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they take on individual projects.""

While Harry has been supporting his philanthropic passions both in New York City and in Africa, Meghan is gearing up to launch a new Netflix show and lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard.

""The Duke and Duchess have now hit their stride as individuals, not just as a couple,"" an insider told the outlet. ""The duke appears focused on his patronage work and the duchess focused on her entrepreneurial track.""

Several royal experts told Fox News Digital that the couple is now working individually to boost their brands. British royals expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital the duchess in particular has been unpopular with the U.K. press since she and Harry decided to step back as senior royals in 2020.

""Sadly, she has squandered both the support of the British public, which greeted her with open arms and adoration, as well as the celebrity status she originally garnered in the U.S.,"" Fordwich said.

Ludwig claimed that Meghan is looking to revamp her image, especially in Hollywood where she's looking to expand her business empire.

""Meghan Markle seems to be constantly strategizing to achieve more -- more fame, more power, more popularity, and more wealth,"" Ludwig explained. ""Her goal appears to be establishing herself as a global brand, aiming to be the most famous and influential woman in the room. However, she may have realized that being high-profile comes with its challenges. Fame can be a double-edged sword; while it can attract admiration, it can also invite criticism and disdain. The unconditional adoration she may have hoped for is not a given.""

""She may be considering ways to re-imagine her public persona,"" she said. ""Meghan might be... curious to explore what happens when she steps out on her own.""

Kinsey Schofield, host of the To Di For Daily podcast, pointed out to Fox News Digital that the mother of two has a long way to go before she wins over the public on both sides of the Atlantic.

An unnamed source recently spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's staff, labeling Meghan a ""dictator in high heels"" who has reduced ""grown men to tears.""

Fox News Digital reached out to a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. It is understood that Josh Kettler, the couple's former chief of staff who left the position after three months in August, was hired on a trial basis. The decision to part ways was described as ""mutual,"" with both sides agreeing it wasn't the right fit.

Several former and current staff members have since come forward to Us Weekly, defending the couple and their work ethic.

""I think Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seem incredibly lost when it comes to their purpose, but Harry comes off far more confident,"" Schofield claimed. ""There are a significant number of people that question Harry and Meghan's sincerity when they flipped a switch almost overnight from selling family secrets to showing up at charity events. It does not seem authentic... This strategy looks like a desperate attempt to get back into everyone's good graces. For a lot of royalists, it would be too little, too late.""

""I agree with the theories that Prince Harry is doing more solo events because the public responds better to him alone,"" Schofield claimed. ""Perhaps if Harry's team nurtures that love for Harry... it will organically and inevitably seep over to his wife. And I think the theory that this is his way of expressing that Meghan is not his boss is also a fair observation.""

Royal expert Shannon Felton Spence told Fox News Digital that we can expect to see Meghan doing more solo engagements as she attempts to win back the public and earn positive press.

""She looked great, better than she has in years,"" said Felton Spence about Meghan's latest appearance.

""The hair and makeup were very USA Network Meghan, which I think is interesting,"" she noted about Meghan's ""Suits"" years.

""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex seem to be embracing a new PR strategy that focuses on their strengths, and it's a smart move.

""Prince Harry looked like his old self at the UN General Assembly, where his passion for global causes shone through -- a return to the grounded, purpose-driven image many admire. Meanwhile, Meghan's recent appearance on the red carpet in LA was a clear nod to her roots, showcasing the same style and charisma that made her a popular cable TV actress.""

""This approach allows them to capitalize on the very qualities that first made them popular -- Harry's dedication to statesmanship and philanthropy and Meghan's TV glamour and activism,"" Felton Spence explained. ""By leaning into their individual interests, they're not only redefining their public personas but also bringing renewed authenticity to their respective platforms.""

""I just think they haven't had a lot of success reinventing themselves over the past four years,"" she continued. ""And so, they are going back to the elements which initially made them likable. And so, yes, in that regard, the red color [Meghan chose] is bold and confident. Even her hair and makeup - everything about it was more USA Network Meghan than 'quiet luxury' Meghan. People like 'Suits' and Tig Meghan.""

As Meghan and Harry take on solo projects, their work together will continue behind the scenes, insiders claimed. According to People magazine, they launched The Parents Network, an initiative to support families impacted by online harm. They've also participated in local engagements, like the opening of Godmothers, a bookstore near their home in Montecito.

""An entrepreneurial and enterprise focus is going to be more the duchess's priority, and the duke will continue to champion his not-for-profit patronages,"" the friend told the outlet. ""But there will be joint efforts around those cause-driven areas of work.""

Diddy sex trafficking probe puts Justin Bieber relationship under microscope as fans dig for clues,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/diddy-sex-trafficking-probe-puts-justin-bieber-relationship-under-microscope-fans-dig-clues,2024-10-08T08:07:05Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Justin Bieber skyrocketed to fame at a young age after mega-manager Scooter Braun stumbled upon YouTube clips of the Canadian crooner in 2008 and insisted he fly out to Atlanta to meet and collaborate with Usher.

Following the 2010 release of his debut studio album, ""My World 2.0,"" when he was just 16 years old, Bieber instantly became one of the most in-demand artists alive, with the album earning an abundance of accolades on and off the charts.

Of the myriad industry connections, Bieber began an elusive friendship with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, a relationship that has only recently been picked on with a fine-toothed comb as fan speculation piques about Diddy's interest in the ""Baby"" singer weeks after the disgraced music mogul was arrested and charged.

While Bieber has largely remained out of the spotlight since Diddy's homes were raided in March followed by the subsequent indictment in September, clips of the pair have still resurfaced online by fans.

Multiple videos of Diddy with the ""Never Say Never"" singer have gone viral since allegations against the Bad Boy Records founder were unsealed in a monthslong federal investigation, which resulted in his Sept. 16 arrest and charges for racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution.

""Bieber's silence about Diddy might be a sign that he is focusing on taking care of his mental health,"" Dr. Jenn Mann, author of ""The A to Z Guide to Raising Happy Confident Kids,"" told Fox News Digital. ""It also may be a sign that his attorneys have recommended that he not comment about the case, especially given the magnitude and severity of the allegations.""

She added, ""In addition, he is a new father and is probably very focused on his baby son. Either way, this must be incredibly stressful for him.""

Justin and wife Hailey Bieber welcomed a son named Jack into the world in August. They celebrated their sixth wedding anniversary in September.

In one clip shared on Bieber's YouTube channel in November 2009, Diddy showed the youngster a Lamborghini he planned to bestow on the ""Sorry"" singer once he turned 16.

""He's having 48 hours with Diddy, him and his boy,"" Combs said. ""They're having the times of their lives, like where we hanging out and what we're doing we can't really disclose. But it's definitely a 15-year-old's dream.""

Diddy added, ""I have been given custody of him. You know, he's signed to Usher and I had legal guardianship of Usher when he did his first album. I did Usher's first album.""

WATCH ON FOX NATION: WHAT DIDDY DO?

""Let's go get some girls,"" Bieber told Combs when asked what he wanted to do. ""Man after my heart,"" the rapper responded. ""That's what I'm talking about.""

The ""Last Night"" rapper told Jimmy Kimmel that he and Bieber had ""become friends in a strange way"" during a 2011 joint appearance on the late-night talk show. ""I mean, to a lot of us, he's like a little brother. You know what I'm saying? He's not afraid to call and ask for advice. He's somebody that, industry-wise, the record industry is a strong family,"" Combs said.

""He's somebody that we definitely have our arms around, and we want to protect him because he's genuinely such a nice person besides his talents. He's one of the greatest kids you could ever know.""

When Kimmel asked about the status of the Lamborghini, Combs was quick to respond, ""Yeah, he had the Lamborghini for a day or two, and he had access to the house. And he knows better than to be talking about the things that he does with big brother Puff on national television.""

Fans also began listening to old Bieber songs in the wake of Diddy's arrest. His 2020 hit, ""Lonely,"" is picking up steam once again and sold nearly 1,500 copies last week, according to Luminate. The track sold fewer than 100 copies the week before.

As for how Bieber should handle all the attention from fans?

""The strategy will entirely depend on what are the real facts with Diddy and is there this secret chamber of challenges he needs to deal with because of it,"" brand expert Eric Schiffer says.

""If nothing occurred, that can be messaged through his proxies to the media ... that all of the stories are overblown, and there's no truth to it,"" Schiffer said.

Schiffer added, ""If there are facts that suggest or facts that he's concerned about, he's not going to want to talk. He will want to be quiet because he may end up being a material witness, or be forced to be, and he may also have fears about his personal well-being in dealing with a serious individual like Diddy."""
Airplane passengers go viral for mid-flight beauty routines: Dermatologists weigh in,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/airplane-passengers-go-viral-mid-flight-beauty-routines-dermatologists-weigh,2024-10-08T08:05:14Z,"Beauty content creator Sarah Palmyra of Los Angeles has gone viral for her in-flight skin care and hair care videos on TikTok, using numerous tools and serums to keep the skin hydrated while flying.

A recent travel trend taking over social media shows airline passengers recreating their skin and hair care routines while in flight.

From serums to face masks to even red light therapy, social media influencers and even some dermatologists are taking time during their flight to make sure they are refreshed by the time they exit the plane.

This trend takes self-care to new heights, literally, but there is rising debate over the benefits of doing your skin care while in the middle of a flight.

FLIGHT PASSENGER ATTEMPTS TO STEAL UPGRADED SEAT AS PLANE BOARDS, SPARKING REACTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA

It can be as simple as a hydrating mist and sunscreen to red light gadgets with various serums and heartless curl tools.

Sarah Palmyra, beauty content creator in Los Angeles, told Fox News Digital that she's an ""anxious flyer,"" so taking care of her skin on long flights helps her ""unwind.""

""I'm not sure what they put in that airplane air but after going through a long customs line I feel like I look crusty and sleep deprived,"" Palmyra said. ""I noticed when I did my skincare routine on longer flights (anything over 4 hours) I could really avoid this and would land feeling like my skin looked refreshed and awake.""

MOM'S VIRAL AIRPLANE SEATING HACK STIRS DEBATE; SOLO FLYERS 'CAN'T STAND' IT

Palmyra said she first makes sure her skin is clean before using a serum and a moisturizer. Sometimes she uses sheet masks, and has received compliments from flight attendants who notice the glowing results, she said.

Ava Lee, CEO and founder of byAVA in New York, shares Korean beauty skin care secrets on social media and has spent many hours trying out viral skin care routines on flights.

""First, airplane cabins have low humidity and the recycled air can dehydrate the skin. That's why I focus on hydration, hydration, hydration with my sheet masks and mists and sleeping masks,"" Lee told Fox News Digital via email.

Lee uses an assortment of hydrating products before locking in the moisture with a sheet mask and sleeping in it, she said.

""I still hold this excitement so whenever I get on a plane, it's a form of self care for me to indulge in the experience and make the most out of a somewhat stressful experience.""

AIRLINE PASSENGERS COULD BE REMOVED FROM FLIGHTS FOR GOING BAREFOOT: ETIQUETTE EXPERT WEIGHS IN

Lindsey Zubritskey, a doctor in Mississippi known as @dermguru on social media, has done skin care on her flights long before it went viral on social media.

""Flights, especially if they're long, can cause issues with your skin. The air on a plane is significantly drier, and thus can lead to irritation, redness and dryness for your skin,"" Zubritskey said.

AIRLINE PASSENGER GOES VIRAL FOR RECORDING NEIGHBOR'S MIDFLIGHT PHOTO ATTEMPTS

""The UV exposure can be more intense at higher altitudes as well, which is more obviously seen in those who are in the airline profession (think flight attendants and pilots). Keeping my sunscreen with me at all times and reapplying is crucial to me, especially as someone who suffers with melasma.""

Zubritskey's regular routine consists of moisturizer, lip balm and sunscreen reapplication.

When she hops on longer flights, she will also use a hydrating facial mask ""to really try and counteract the dryness and keep my skin clean/prevent breakouts,"" she said.

AIRLINE PASSENGER'S 'AWKWARD' SEATING ARRANGEMENT GOES VIRAL: 'NEVER GOING TO RECOVER'

There is a debate surrounding in-flight skin care as some people fear it may not be hygenic to continuously touch your face while in a public space like an airplane.

The overwhelming amount of dryness in the cabin has also led some to believe that adding more hydration to the face will only result in the dry air pulling more moisture out of the skin.

""When it comes to skincare during flights, one key factor to consider is the airplane's cabin environment. The humidity levels inside an aircraft can drop below 10%, which is significantly lower than the typical indoor environment (around 30-50%). This extremely low humidity can have a pronounced drying effect on the skin,"" Meri-Liina Kainonen, a Copenhagen-based licensed cosmetologist, told Fox News Digital.

""While it might seem intuitive to apply skincare products mid-flight to counteract this, it can actually backfire. Most skincare products are formulated to work best in environments where there's some level of humidity to help the skin absorb and retain moisture.""

FLIGHT ATTENDANT ON TIKTOK REVEALS LUGGAGE TAG SAFETY TIP SHE WISHES MORE FLYERS KNEW ABOUT

Kainonen recommends hydrating the skin with a nourishing mask and serum the night before the flight and finalizing the routine the day of the flight with a rich moisturizer and barrier cream.

""This will help your skin better withstand the drying effects of the cabin environment without needing further intervention while airborne,"" she added.

Dr. Brendan Camp, a licensed dermatologist, said lengthy skin routines as seen on TikTok are not always necessary, but he does encourage travelers to focus on hydration and skin protection.

""Because higher altitudes expose your skin to higher levels of UV radiation, it is important to wear sunscreen and pull the window screen down if sitting next to it,"" Camp, who is based in New York City, told Fox News Digital.

To fight against a dry environment like an airplane cabin, Camp recommends drinking lots of water and moisturizing the skin to fight against transepidermal water loss.

Zubritskey said she has seen what a bit of skin care while flying can do for the skin and recognizes the difference additional hydration can make.

""I notice a huge difference in my skin when traveling. It tends to get drier, more irritated, and inflamed, which makes fine lines and discoloration more apparent. In-flight skincare routines help to mitigate these issues,"" Zubritskey said.

For Lee, the benefits of hydration takes out any negatives, she said.

""There are people who claim that it's not hygienic to do in flight skincare but for me, the benefits of walking off a plane with hydrated, plump skin outweighs everything,"" Lee said,"
"FC Barcelona Decides Transfer Target For 2025, Reports SPORT",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomsanderson/2024/10/08/fc-barcelona-decides-transfer-target-for-2025-reports-sport/,2024-10-08T07:57:33Z,"FC Barcelona has decided an area of the pitch which its head coach Hansi Flick believes must be strengthened next season according to SPORT, which cited anonymous sources.

It is no secret that Flick wanted a winger this summer when taking over the reins from fired club legend Xavi Hernandez.

He sort of got his wish with the club agreeing to pay Red Bull Leipzig more than $60 million for Euro 2024 winner Dani Olmo, who perhaps performs better and has been used as a central attacking midfielder yet is able to operate on either flank.

But elsewhere on the pitch, Flick would have also liked to have seen Sporting Director Deco and President Joan Laporta reinforce the right back decision where he currently has only one natural option at present.

That is of course Hector Fort, who was given the starting nod on Sunday for a 3-0 win over Deportivo Alaves which re-extended Barca's lead to three points over bitter rivals Real Madrid at the La Liga summit.

Fort was of course allowed such a privilege because of a disciplinary issue with Jules Kounde.

As explained by SPORT, the Frenchman was punished for arriving late to a prematch talk, but he has been Flick's first choice as right full back until know while doing a sterling job with the role.

Kounde is of course a center back at heart, though, and if there isn't ample cover at right back, he is also prevented from playing in the heart of the defensive line where there are often shortages.

Pau Cubarsi and Inigo Martinez are Flick's primary choices at center back, but Ronald Araujo and Andreas Christensen are once more on the sick list leaving Flick with a dilemma were there to be any more injuries.

According to SPORT, Flick is ""delighted"" with Kounde but also wants a right back. This has led Barca to narrrow its search down to Lille's Tiago Santos, who had an oustanding game last week as the League 1 outfit ended Real Madrid's 36-game unbeaten run through a 1-0 defeat inflicted on Carlo Ancelotti's men in the Champions League.

As Santos is represented by Jorge Mendes, who Deco and Laporta both know well, negotiating a potential transfer could be pretty straightforward.

At the same time, Barca doesn't rule out also attempting to land a left back to keep Alejandro Balde on his toes."
FC Barcelona Icon Lionel Messi Bids Farewell To Fellow Legend Iniesta,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomsanderson/2024/10/08/fc-barcelona-icon-lionel-messi-bids-farewell-to-fellow-legend-iniesta/,2024-10-08T07:31:05Z,"FC Barcelona icon has bid farewell to his former teammate Andres Iniesta, who announced his retirement from football on Monday.

Iniesta did so through an emotive video published on social media, and has received an outpouring of well wishes from teammates and some of the greatest to ever play the game which is a privileged category he falls into himself.

So does Messi, who shared a locker room with 'Don Andres' at Camp Nou as soon as he graduated from La Masia in 2004 until Iniesta fled for Vissel Kobe in Japan in 2018 after 22 years with the Catalans.

Responding to Iniesta's news, Messi called him ""one of the teammates with the most magic and one of those I enjoyed playing together with the most"".

""Andres Iniesta, the ball will miss you and so will we! I wish you the best, always. You are a phenomenon,"" Messi added.

Together in Blaugrana, Messi and Iniesta lifted an impressive four Champions League titles and an equally eyebrow-raising 10 La Liga crowns.

They were also on the podium together for the Ballon d'Or in 2010, which was scooped by eight-time winner Messi as Iniesta and his midfield partner Xavi Hernandez completed a 1-2-3 of La Masia graduates dominating the polls to elect the holder of football's highest individual honor.

After half a decade in the Far East, Iniesta continued his career with Emirates Club in the UAE Pro League for the 2023/2024 season.

Amid Messi, Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba all joining the MLS outfit in recent times, there were rumors that Iniesta could follow their lead by crossing the Atlantic and plying his trade with Inter Miami.

That never came to light, however, with Iniesta finally deciding to hang his boots up at the age of 40.

Boasting one of the sharpest minds seen in the sport, Iniesta will take his expertise to coaching and has previously been linked to a director's role overseeing the La Masia academy he came through.

Before Xavi was shown the exit door by President Joan Laporta, it was also said that Iniesta might become his assistant in the Montjuic Stadium dugout."
DALI Launches Deluxe Wireless Headphones With Audiophile ANC,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marksparrow/2024/10/08/dali-launches-deluxe-wireless-headphones-with-audiophile-anc/,2024-10-08T07:15:32Z,"Building upon the success of the EISA award-winning IO-12, Danish speaker brand DALI has announced its new IO-8 wireless headphones. Designed by the same team responsible for DALI'\'s flagship KORE loudspeakers, the new headphones have many of the technologies used in DALI's IO-12, including the same electronics.

DALI has been making speakers for more than four decades. The new IO-8, headphones can be used both wirelessly and in wired mode for true Hi-Fi quality sound. The addition of the latest Audiophile Active Noise Cancellation technology means the IO-8 can be used for immersive listening with ANC turned on but without harming the sound quality.

The IO-8 headphones are designed and engineered using the same sound principles employed when making full-size loudspeakers, such as DALI's recently announced RUBIKORE speakers. The IO-8 are Hi-Fi speakers for the head thanks to custom 50mm drivers, the largest in this category of headphones.

With the IO-8, DALI says its engineers have tried to deliver a pair of headphones that work equally as well whether they are used wired or wirelessly. The IO-8 can be used as conventional, passive, analog headphones, yet they can also be used wirelessly for on-the-go convenience.

Audiophile ANC technology has been used on the IO-8 for a more immersive listening experience. The technology effectively blocks out unwanted sound but it does so without impacting the audio quality. The ANC function can be set at On, Transparent and Off modes.

Thanks to intuitive multifunction buttons on the headphones, the IO-8 can be controlled with one hand and there's no need for a smartphone app. Users simply connect the headphones to the audio source and start listening straight away.

Whether you like your music as the artist intended or prefer a punchier and more bass-heavy sound, the IO-8's Hi-Fi and Bass sound modes let users listen to their music just the way they like it.

The custom speaker driver diaphragms DALI has used are made exclusively from proprietary paper and wood fiber materials. The paper fiber material used in the IO-8 drivers has randomly aligned fibers of variable length that create a light and stiff diaphragm with optimal damping. DALI says the IO-8 disphragms provide a natural and relaxed sound that's full of detail.

The IO-8 ear pads are finished in luxurious, high-quality leather, while the headphones have a radial brushed and anodized finish on the external surfaces of the ear cups.

Pricing & Availability: The DALI IO-8 wireless ANC headphones will be available from October 8, priced at $599 / £599 / €599"

"Kamala 2.0's challenge? Making more news, and not just with ultra-friendly hosts",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-2-0s-challenge-making-more-news-not-just-ultra-friendly-hosts,2024-10-08T07:11:26Z,"For well over a month, Kamala Harris rode a wave of the most positive press any presidential candidate has gotten in two decades, and her own skills, to turn what had been a lost cause for the Democrats into an extremely tight race.

But does she have a second act?

Kamala 2.0, under constant attack by Donald Trump and the Republicans, doesn't have much new to say. She is conducting a play-it-safe campaign, like a basketball team sitting on a lead and running out the clock.

But Harris doesn't have a lead in the three ""blue wall"" midwestern states she needs to win, and the loss of any one of them could hand Trump the presidency once again.

VANCE-WALZ VP DEBATE ENDED IN A 'DRAW': DEMOCRAT REP. DEBBIE DINGELL

For all the focus on Pennsylvania, Harris leads by 0.7 percent in Michigan - a statistical tie, based on the Real Clear Politics average.

On Sunday's ""Media Buzz,"" Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell told me her state could go either way.

""The vice president has a problem with union workers,"" Dingell said. ""Many of the men, as well as, quite frankly, African-American young men who have said to me, I was with a group with them last week. 'You know what, Donald Trump talks to us. Democrats take us for granted.'""

The lawmaker recalls how ""everybody got mad at me"" when she predicted in 2016 that Trump would win Michigan - which he did, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

A major problem for Harris is that she doesn't seem to know how to make news. With less than 30 days to go, with many voters understandably believing they don't know her, or enough about her policies, since she took over for Joe Biden, the VP is stitching together parts of her stump speech and recycling the same anecdotes virtually verbatim.

A presidential candidate has to deliver a few new lines, a new proposal, something to break into the news cycle, which is currently being dominated by Trump.

So what's on this week's agenda? Kamala will sit down with Howard Stern (who is totally against his old pal Donald); ""The View,"" where the ladies despise Trump, and Stephen Colbert, who hosted fundraisers for Joe Biden in 2020 and this year.

For good measure, she's also spoken to Alex Cooper, whose podcast, ""Call Your Daddy,"" is about sex.

WHY VANCE EASILY BEAT WALZ IN DEBATE, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE IN THE PROCESS

I'll go out on a limb here and say these sessions are designed to be friendly - not unlike the conversation with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle, who kept agreeing with Harris and had just pronounced Trump a danger to democracy.

In fairness, Harris also sat for a ""60 Minutes"" interview, an invitation declined by Trump.

Look, there's nothing wrong with candidates showing their softer side with unorthodox outlets in our fragmented media universe. We've come a long way since critics scoffed at candidate Bill Clinton answering the ""boxers or briefs"" question on MTV, calling it unpresidential.

On ""Call Your Daddy,"" Harris was actually quite thoughtful in responding to Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that her kids keep her humble and the VP doesn't have anyone to keep her humble.

Rather than jab at the Arkansas governor, which would have produced a cheap headline, she ruminated that families come in all shapes, bound by blood or love, that she is deeply involved with her stepchildren, and this isn't the 1950s anymore. They also discussed, uh, tampons.

Still, the party is getting nervous. ""Democratic operatives, including some of Kamala Harris' own staffers,"" says Politico, ""are growing increasingly concerned about her relatively light campaign schedule, which has her holding fewer events than Donald Trump and avoiding unscripted interactions with voters and the press almost entirely.""

Since the convention, the veep has spent more than a third of days on meeting and briefings, with no public events.

With early voting under way in more than half the states, Politico describes this ""a do-no-harm, risk-averse approach to the race.""

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan, who fervently doesn't want Trump to win, nonetheless is whacks Harris pretty hard:

""She hasn't fleshed out her political intent -- what she stands for, what she won't abide, what she means to establish, what she won't let happen.

What is her essential mission? Is it national 'repair,' is it to 'stabilize' an uncertain country, is it 'relaunch'?..

""She so far hasn't conveyed a sense of intellectual grasp. Her campaign has placed too many chips on the idea of the mood, the vibe, the picture.""

And vibes can only take you so far.

But the VP has certain duties, and spent two days visiting hurricane victims and relief workers in North Carolina and Georgia-which also happens to be good politics. She also met with Volodomyr Zelenskyy.

Harris attended a fundraiser over the weekend. Why bother? Her campaign has already had $400 million roll in. She's already outspending Trump 2-½ to 1 on ads. She doesn't need any more money. What's more, Harris doesn't make news at these fundraisers, which in any event are off camera. A ground game is great, but it has to be married to a winning message.

Here's one more: Dan Pfeiffer, a former top Obama White House official, says on Message Box, his Substack column, that ""the media -- and Politico Playbook in particular -- are fuming over the Harris-Walz media strategy.""

Kamala ""must be on offense at all times -- say new things, be edgy enough to get attention, and dictate the terms, or the campaign could ""take on water...In this media world, there is a never-ending, insatiable appetite for content. Either serve lunch or become the menu...

""Dominating attention is Trump's political superpower...Even when he doesn't have a big moment, Trump speaks so outrageously that it shifts attention to his issues of choice.""

Now it's easy to snipe from the sidelines. For Harris to be neck and neck in the core battleground states means she's obviously done many things right. She had to overhaul the Biden operation and vet a running mate while the campaign was in full swing, like changing the tires on a speeding hot rod. She could still win.

One positive sign: The Harris camp took off the bubble wrap and allowed Tim Walz to appear on ""Fox News Sunday."" This was an attempt at damage control, since he lost the debate so badly to JD Vance.

While Shannon Bream repeatedly pressed the governor on late-term abortions, his Minnesota record and his history of falsehoods and exaggerations, Walz was far more forceful than he'd been in the CBS debate. He ducked certain questions, but an interview format is much better suited to him than friendly exchanges with his opponent.

Do You Really Want To Get Ahead? Don't Be Afraid To Make Waves,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rodgerdeanduncan/2024/10/08/make-waves-to-succeed-in-your-career/,2024-10-08T07:04:00Z,"Somewhere, sometime, someone may have told you ""don't make waves.""

Maybe you challenged an idea you thought needed closer examination. Maybe you proposed a solution that ran contrary to the thinking of everyone else in the room. In any event, someone may have urged you to simply go along with the status quo.

Patti Johnson suggests a different approach. She explains it in her book Make Waves: Be the One to Start Change at Work and in Life.

Johnson is founder and former CEO of PeopleResults, a change and organizational development consultancy. She was previously a senior executive at Accenture, a global management consulting firm. Her work has been featured in The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, and many other media outlets.

Waves, Johnson says, begin with ""If only we could ..."" She explains how people can gain confidence in adopting that mindset.

""Once we have a dream or a vision, the key is turning that into action. Goals can feel too big to achieve if they're too grand,"" she says. ""This is why New Year's resolutions are often forgotten by February. Wave Makers use strategies like starting small and taking one step at a time. They are incrementalists who start and then learn and adjust but keep going. Wave Makers also get comfortable starting without all the answers because of an 'I can figure it out' mindset -- even if they don't know everything they need to know when they start.""

Johnson explains how ""self-talk"" can sometimes sabotage a person's ability (or even willingness to try) to make a positive wave.

""Our thoughts are very powerful and the hidden domino in starting a wave,"" she says. ""We all have invisible backpacks we carry with us wherever we go based on how we grew up, how we see ourselves, and the messages we have taken in from the world around us. Yet, if we know and anticipate our triggers and vulnerabilities, we can manage through or around them.""

For example, she says, perfectionism is common in high achievers and can even be viewed positively in our culture. ""Yet, perfectionism by design means everything has to be perfect! This desire for perfection can be an underminer. If you are starting a change -- whether it's a new business or a community effort -- it won't be perfect. Since you haven't done it before, there will be setbacks. Perfectionists also can be slower to act because of the fear of not being good enough and not having all the answers.""

What roles do curiosity and effective listening play in a person's ability to make successful waves?

""These are both huge factors in creating a successful wave,"" Johnson says. ""Research tells us our curiosity peaks at about age six and crashes once we are adults. The most common answer for this trend is because 'we are too busy' or 'we think we are supposed to already know all the answers.' Yet, a lack of curiosity directly affects your ability to 'learn your way' through doing something new.""

Johnson says, Wave Makers are voracious learners who quickly assess their knowledge gaps and how to cover them. ""They decide to learn new information themselves or involve others who know what they don't. Without learning and listening to take in new information, there's a big risk in bringing yesterday's answers to today's problems.""

Johnson quotes Steve Jobs as saying, ""People don't know what they want until you show it to them."" How does that perspective apply to a Wave Maker?

""It's a great quote and a reminder that you can't rely solely on past experiences when starting something new,"" she says. ""It's human nature that our views come from what we've seen or done before. For example, it can be more difficult for someone who has worked at only one company their entire career to picture doing their work differently -- just because they haven't experienced it. Also, be prepared that if you're starting a change, you will face resistance just because you are changing 'normal.' The status quo and our individual habits are extremely powerful forces.'

Johnson offers advice to potential Wave Makers whose ""why"" seems to be unclear?

""I'll speak from my own experience,"" she says. ""For years, I said, 'I want to write a book."" When I got more serious about it, a mentor asked me for my 'Why?' I started by saying it was a bucket list item. But, she kept pressing me, 'But why?' until I finally got to 'because I wanted to feel I was sharing what I've learned in case it could help someone else.' I needed to be clear about that because it affected everything. So, if you have an idea or a change you want to make, do the same thing - really press yourself on why it matters to you.

In leading a change initiative, how can a Wave Maker create cascading sponsorship for the change throughout the organization?

""Change is rarely a solo sport,"" Johnson says. ""Involve others early in your ideas and let them put their fingerprints on it. This is how you create a change more about 'we' than 'me'. Gathering ideas and involving others is also how you build champions for your wave. Expect you'll get pushback but be open enough to understand why and consider it.

Logitech Pops Up With Another Fun Wireless Keyboard And Mouse,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marksparrow/2024/10/08/logitech-pops-up-with-another-fun-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse/,2024-10-08T07:03:48Z,"Swiss mouse and keyboard giant Logitech has just announced the launch of its latest version of the POP Icon Keys, a new and eye-catching keyboard that's been designed to inject a pop of color and individuality into anyone's office life and boost productivity at the same time.

The POP Icon Keys blends modern and colorful design with advanced functionality delivered by the Logi Options+ app that lets users make the keyboard their own by creating Smart Actions and programmable shortcuts for Windows, macOS, Android and iOS devices.

Unlike the first generation POP Keys, this new version doesn't have noisy mechanical switches. Instead, it has square keys with rounded corners that are contoured and low-profile. Logitech has chosen a whisper-quiet scissor mechanism with a comfortable typing experience that won't annoy any colleagues in a busy office.

With a choice of four fresh new colorways -- Rose/Off-White, Orange/Off-White, Graphite/Green, Lilac/Off-White and Graphite/Off-White -- there's bound to be a POP Icon Keys to suit even the fussiest of Gen Z workers.

Alongside those new eye-popping colors, the keyboard has a transparent trim and four customizable ""life hack"" Action Keys that can be loaded or programmed with smart actions that can trigger the launch of your favorite apps or almost any other action imaginable.

Using the Logi Options+ software, the POP Icon Keys can be customized to suit your workflow and preferences. The Action Keys are pre-loaded with a suite of Smart Actions that can provide a seamless transition from ""work mode"" to ""break mode"" by accessing a suite of productivity tools.

For example, the Action Keys can be set up to open your favorite social media, music and video apps or launch your favorite AI tools, like the Logi AI Prompt Builder. All this can be done with a single press of an Action Key.

Once you start programming with the easy-to-use Smart Actions, it's addictive and you end up creating your routines. I set up a Start The Day Smart Action which launches Safari, Mail and Microsoft Word, so I'm all ready to get down to work without any delay.

POP Icon Keys also provides a dozen one-touch shortcut keys in Windows and macOS, such as mute, emoji menu, screenshot and volume controls. Those keys can also work as regular Function keys from F1 to F12. Logitech has also included dedicated Screen Brightness keys which were missing from previous versions.

Another handy feature included with the POP Icon Keys is the ability to connect with up to three different Bluetooth devices so it's easy to switch between, say, a Mac, an iPad or a Windows PC. There's no USB port for using the keyboard with a cable and neither is there a port for charging a built-in battery.

This is because the POP Icon Keys is powered by just two AAA batteries which should be good for up to three years of use. The battery life of Logitech's keyboards and mice is legendary and probably the best in the business thanks to some clever and innovative energy-saving technologies.

To accompany the POP Icon Keys there is an optional POP Mouse or you can buy both devices in a Combo Set. The POP Mouse features a SmartWheel for precise navigation and Silent Touch Technology that reduces mouse click sound by 90% on regular mice. The POP Mouse also has two Action Buttons that can be customized using the Logi Options+ app making it easy to toggle between work and leisure modes.

The POP Mouse runs on a single AA battery and can run for up to 24 months before it needs a fresh battery. Like the POP Icon Keys, the mouse can connect and switch between up to three Bluetooth devices. The compact and contoured mouse is available in the same four colorways to match the POP Icon Keys for a coordinated look.

Like all of Logitech's peripherals these days, the POP Icon Keys and POP Mouse are designed with sustainability in mind. The POP Icon Keys and POP Mouse use made with post-consumer recycled plastic ranging from 37% to 70%, depending on the colorway. The idea is to enhance the circularity of the products and lower their carbon footprint.

Both products are packaged using card and paper sourced from FSC-certified forests and other controlled sources. It may seem like a small point but when you realize the millions of products Logitech sells each year, the drive towards more sustainability makes great sense.

Verdict: The Logitech POP Icon Keys is a superb and affordable keyboard. It's super quiet and I love the fact that Logitech has added screen brightness keys that were missing from the first generation of the product. The clever Logi Options+ app is the secret sauce of these two new products. Using the app, it's possible to completely personalize both the mouse and keyboard to ensure the tools you use all day work the way you prefer. Highly Recommended.

Pricing & Availability: Logitech POP Icon Keys will be available from Logitech in Rose/Off-White, Orange/Off-White, Graphite/Green, Lilac/Off-White and Graphite/Off-White colorways. And will ship globally in October 2024 for $49.99. The POP Icon Keys Combo costs $69.99, while the POP Mouse on its own sells for $29.99. To complete the look, there are Logitech Desk Mats in matching colorways for $19.99."

Barry Sonnenfeld broke into the film industry as a director of photography. One of the first films he shot was Blood Simple. It was a bloody, haunting drama about infidelity and murder. It was the first feature film from Joel and Ethan Coen, The Coen Brothers.

Sonnenfeld was fresh out of film school at NYU when he shot that film. And according to Barry, he got the gig because he made fast friends with Coens and owned a camera.

Barry recounts his film career in a new memoir called, Best Possible Place, Worst Possible Time: True Stories from a Career in Hollywood.

He joins us to talk about the book and reflects on his many years in Hollywood. He also shares how he befriended the Coen Brothers and got the chance to work with them on their first feature film."
Thailand's Central Group Teams Up With Saudi Fund PIF On Selfridges,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/phisanuphromchanya/2024/10/08/thailands-central-group-teams-up-with-saudi-fund-pif-on-selfridges/,2024-10-08T06:50:15Z,"Thailand's retail giant Central Group, controlled by the Chirathivat family, and Saudi Arabia's Private Investment Fund (PIF) agreed to form a strategic partnership following the latter's acquisition of a 40% interest in the Selfridges Group, the European luxury department store operator.

PIF has an agreement to buy the Selfridges shares from insolvent Austrian retail operator Signa Group. The sale is subject to regulatory approval.

Selfridges owns and operates 18 premier department stores in three countries, including Selfridges in the U.K., De Bijenkorf in the Netherlands, and Brown Thomas and Arnotts in Ireland. Its flagship locations on London's Oxford Street and Manchester's Exchange Square are city landmarks.

Under the partnership, Central Group will own a 60% stake in Selfridges Group's operating and property companies while PIF holds 40%. The deal includes new investment by both shareholders to strengthen Selfridges' finances and support future development. They did not reveal investment amounts.

""PIF is Central's partner of choice in this distinguished company and we are confident that PIF's proven global track record of investments, combined with our luxury retail industry expertise, brand management skills and innovative approach, will allow Selfridges Group to continue to flourish for the benefit of all its stakeholders,"" Tos Chirathivat, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Central Group said in a statement.

The partnership aims to strengthen Selfridges' position as one of Europe's leading luxury retail destinations, Central Group said in a statement.

""We are pleased to be partnering with Central Group in Selfridges Group, one of Europe's most iconic luxury department stores,"" Turqi Al-Nowaiser, Deputy Governor and Head of International Investments Division at PIF, said in a separate statement. ""This transaction allows Selfridges Group to build on its position as a premier retail destination.""

Since entering Europe more than a decade ago, Central Group has built a sizable presence with a string of acquisitions. Its European luxury department store portfolio comprises 40 stores in 34 major tourist destinations in seven countries including Rinascente in Italy and Illum in Denmark.

Earlier this year, Central took over KaDeWe, the more than century-old luxury department store in Berlin owned by Signa, along with The Oberpollinger in Munich and The Alsterhaus in Hamburg. The group also acquired all nine Globus department stores in Switzerland."
Gov. Kemp suspends Georgia mayor arrested for leaving alcohol in ditch for inmates,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/gov-kemp-suspends-georgia-mayor-arrested-leaving-alcohol-ditch-inmates,2024-10-08T06:49:42Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

The mayor of a small town in Georgia has been suspended by GOP Gov. Brian Kemp after he was charged for stashing a bottle of gin in a ditch for a state prison work crew to access.

Thomson Mayor Benjamin ""Benji"" Cary Cranford, 52, was indicted in August and subsequently arrested by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation on felony charges of furnishing prohibited items to inmates and attempt to commit a felony.

Cranford allegedly drove to a store on June 3 and purchased a bottle of Seagram's Extra Dry Gin before leaving it in a ditch along Cobbham Road in Thomson, Georgia, in the path of a work crew of state prisoners from the Jefferson County Correctional Institution.

GEORGIA MAYOR ARRESTED ON FELONY CHARGES AFTER ALLEGEDLY STORING ALCOHOL IN A DITCH FOR INMATES

Just days later, Thomson Police asked the GBI to conduct an investigation into allegations that Cranford left alcohol to inmates.

Cranford was taken into custody by GBI agents after a city council meeting in August. He was booked into the McDuffie County Jail and was later released on $5,000 bail.

Kemp issued an executive order officially suspending Cranford as mayor on Friday. Cranford had taken office earlier this year after defeating incumbent Kenneth Usry in the election last year.

The governor's office received the indictment on Aug. 20 and on Sept. 9, an executive order was issued, appointing members to a review commission to determine whether the indictment related to or adversely affected the administration of the mayor's duties.

The commission provided a report to the governor on Oct. 1 showing that the indictment is affecting the administration of the mayor's duties and the rights and interests of the public. The commission recommended Cranford be suspended.

Cranford's suspension is effective immediately and will remain in effect until the final disposition of the case or until the mayor's term expires, whichever happens first."
Climate Change Action Can't Wait For Perfect Solutions,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nilsrokke/2024/10/08/climate-change-action-cant-wait-for-perfect-solutions/,2024-10-08T06:44:44Z,"The climate crisis is no longer a future concern; it is a present-day emergency. Multiple reports from leading global bodies such as the IPCC, the World Meteorological Organization, the Copernicus Observatory, NOAA and others consistently warn that we must use every tool at our disposal to combat it.

The IEA and IRENA are among those suggesting solutions using the technologies we have and must develop by providing roadmaps to net zero by 2050, in general there is a plethora of such roadmaps and outlooks.

This isn't bad, of course, but the path forward is far more complicated than identifying solutions. It's about ensuring those solutions are genuinely effective and deployed to reduce or remove emissions.

The complication lies in the fact that the available technologies are often immature and reliant on emerging markets. This creates a significant gap between the solutions we need and their real-world application. However, even if the perfect solutions are not there yet, inaction is not the answer.

One stark issue is the hidden cost of carbon, which impacts health, agricultural productivity, property damage, and ecosystems.

The European quota system, for instance, has seen prices of approximately $100, while recent studies, such as Adrien Bilal and Diego R. Känzig's 2024 paper in the NBER Working Paper Series, suggest the actual social cost of carbon is an astounding $1,065 per ton for a one-degree increase in global temperature. So, who pays the gap of $900? We are far from paying the real cost.

For the average diesel or petrol car, this equates to a social cost of approximately $9 per US gallon. While European fuel prices already include significant taxes, implementing the true social cost would more than double current prices. This would be deeply unpopular, yet it's a sobering reality: fuel taxation is the only area where we're even close to covering the full social cost of carbon emissions.

Even with a wide confidence interval of $690 to 1,799 per ton, the key takeaway is that the social cost is far higher than the cost currently levied on emissions. This gap is paid by everyone, especially those who are most vulnerable and have the least resources and no government can afford to cover the difference.

The results also show that climate change effects have been around for a long time, hidden in our underlying growth numbers. The authors claim that the world GDP would have been 18% larger than it is today had we not experienced one degree of global warming since 1960.

The reality is that paying the full social cost of carbon seems unfeasible, but mounting evidence shows that the costs of inaction are even higher. For instance, former EU Commissioner for Science and Research and later Environment, Janez Potočnik, recently highlighted at a conference that the devastating floods in Slovenia last year cost the country an amount equivalent to 16.9% of its national yearly revenue in 2023. This is just one stark example.

As we look ahead to COP29 in Baku, the question of how to finance this climate burden will take center stage. But while nations scramble to find funding mechanisms, the climate crisis is racing ahead of us.

The situation mirrors the Great Depression in its sheer scale of wealth and productivity loss -- a shock that only climate finance can begin to address.

Meanwhile, we find ourselves caught up in debates over the finer details -- focusing on imperfections in strategies like carbon capture and storage (CCS) or hydrogen production -- while the climate crisis continues on its destructive path.

In Europe, for example, the debate over the cost, maturity, and need for CCS has dragged on for more than two decades. Only now are real projects being deployed.

The European Commission's latest strategy aims for 50 million tons of CO to be captured annually by 2030, scaling up to 450 million tons by 2050. While this is highly commendable, it's hard to see it materializing at the current pace. If it takes another 20 years to scale up CCS, we'll miss the targets of climate neutrality altogether.

A similar story is playing out with hydrogen. Production and use have fallen short of expectations, as highlighted by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in their COP28 stocktake.

While hydrogen is seen as critical to the energy transition, we are not reaching the necessary benchmarks. The disagreement in Europe over the use of natural gas to produce hydrogen is symptomatic of the larger issue: the solutions available are either too expensive or mired in technical and safety concerns.

For instance, the use of natural gas to produce hydrogen via reforming or pyrolysis -- methods that create either concentrated CO for storage or solid carbon -- is under scrutiny. It should be, but why not use footprint assessment to guide the solutions rather than undermining the solutions even though some of them are transitional?

Recent articles, such as one published in The Guardian, have raised concerns about the maturity and safety of these methods. But while the debate continues, the climate crisis marches on unchecked, and with an extremely high price to be paid.

In its progress report on COP28 targets, the IEA starkly reminds us of our commitments. Despite pledges to triple investments in renewable energy by 2030 and double energy efficiency, the world is far from on track.

While emissions growth has slowed compared to 2022, we're still increasing emissions when we should be seeing reductions similar to those that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Take, for example, advancements in electric vehicles (EVs). While one in five cars sold is now electric -- a major improvement from just a few years ago -- this success isn't enough on its own.

China, by responding quickly, has taken the lead in the global EV market, while in the U.S., EVs remain more of a lifestyle or political choice than a mobility necessity. The other extreme is in Norway, where the latest new car sales figures show a 96.4% EV share.

Battery technology is improving, and photovoltaic (PV) systems are becoming more widespread and at prices nobody would have believed just ten years ago. But even these gains are insufficient when juxtaposed against other critical areas like CCS and hydrogen technology.

Energy efficiency, too, remains elusive. Even though there is acceleration in solar and wind power, it barely covers the growth in energy use per annum.

We cannot afford to let short-term issues obscure the bigger picture. We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, from rising sea levels to food shortages and uninhabitable land.

The time to act is now -- before we reach the tipping point where recovery is no longer possible.

COP29 kicks off in November. All eyes will be on this global gathering to see if bold decisions are finally taken. Perfect solutions aren't necessary to take immediate, meaningful action that incorporates the real cost of climate change and nature loss."
"While Royals Enjoy Salvador Perez's Power, Carlos Rodon Laments Rough Yankee Postseason Debut",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryfleisher/2024/10/08/while-royals-enjoy-salvador-perezs-power-carlos-rodon-laments-rough-yankee-postseason-debut/,2024-10-08T06:44:44Z,"Salvador Perez played 31 postseason games in a span of two seasons when the Kansas City Royals reached Game 7 and lost to the San Francisco Giants in the 2014 World Series and beat the New York Mets in five games in the following year's Fall Classic.

Because of various circumstances, it took him nearly a decade to return to the big stage of October baseball.

Among those circumstances were the core of the 2015 title team being traded or not retained in free agency or simply retiring. While the core of Kansas City's second title team was moving in, the Royals were figuring out which young players would form the new group while seeking input from Perez, who went from three straight winning seasons in 2013 through 2015 to a trio of 100-loss seasons in 2018, 2019 and last season.

The Royals were in New York at the trade deadline of their 104-loss season in 2018 when Mike Moustakas was traded to help the Milwaukee Brewers reach the NLCS. Perez was not around much in 2019 due a partial tear in his ulnar collateral ligament that required Tommy John surgery for his right elbow.

""Yes, it's kind of hard, but I think it's part of the process,"" Perez said Monday afternoon. ""When I got called up, it was kind of the same process that we're going through last year and a couple years ago. So you know at some point you're going to make it to the playoffs again. And I thank God too I don't make any decision to leave and I stay in Kansas City.""

Still even as the Royals struggled, Perez was willing to stay, signing a four-year, $82 contract that runs through next season and when Matt Quatraro was hired, he sought the input of someone who has become a Kansas City sports icon.

""I wanted to listen to what he wanted to say, not what I had to say,"" Quatraro said. ""I have the utmost respect for him watching him play for all those years on the other side of the field, heard a lot about him as a competitor. Just the fact that he was a catcher that played basically every single day was so unique.

""My first phone call was to him to just let him know that I wanted to hear what he had to say, and we were going to have the best line of communication we could possibly have.""

About four-plus hours after discussing their initial interaction, Quatraro and the rest of the Royals watched Perez fully extend his arms and meet a slider from Carlos Rodon over the middle of the plate. The destination of the swing was the back of the left field seats and the 402-foot shot was the start of a four-run inning.

""He's built for this,"" said starter Cole Regans, who was 17 when Perez hit his last postseason homer on Oct, 21, 2015 off Marco Estrada in Toronto in the ALCS. ""He's been here before. He knows what it takes.""

It will remain to be seen if the Yankees know what it takes to win this series with an offense that is 3-for-19 with runners in scoring position or the possibility of needing to trust Rodon in a Game 5 start on Saturday.

Before Perez took Rodon deep for the fifth time in 28 at-bats, the left-hander was dominating, popping fastballs anywhere, yelling with excitement after each strikeout and prompting analyst Ron Darling to say he had ""no-hit stuff"" on the TBS telecast. He started with seven straight strikes, threw first-pitch strikes to the first 10 hitters and threw 22 of his 37 fastballs in the first three innings though allowing two hits of his primary pitch and early in counts gave Rodon some pause and perhaps a belief he should change his selections.

Then came the fourth which started with a pair of sliders that were low and missed the strike zone. The third slider hardly missed and then came two more sliders resulting in hits and another hit that scored a run due to another slider.

""I felt he was pounding the strike zone with really good stuff all night. He falls behind him, and from there started making some mistakes with his secondary just in the heart of the plate,"" manager Aaron Boone said.

While the Royals were enjoying Perez's big moment and inning, Rodon was lamenting what went wrong.

""There were points in the fourth where I was trying to do a little more, I wanted to get some swing-and-miss,"" Rodon said. ""Thinking back to it, trust the pitch and go attack is the mindset I wish I had. Obviously I want to be better than that, especially how the first three innings went.""

The themes of Game 2 were laments about pitches gone awry for a No. 2 starter and the appreciation of Perez, who stuck around and was willing to wait through a rebuild for another chance at hitting postseason homers."
"Stop Living Dangerously -- 500 Million Samsung, Pixel, Android Phones 'Vulnerable To Attack'",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/10/08/warning-500-to-750-million-google-pixel-samsung-galaxy-android-phones-now-in-danger/,2024-10-08T06:36:26Z,"Google has now released details of October's Android security update, warning that the most ""severe"" of seven high-severity vulnerabilities ""could lead to remote code execution with no additional execution privileges needed."" There are also a raft of high-severity fixes for third-party components, which leave devices at risk.

As usual, the situation for Pixel owners is more straightforward than other OEMs, and that's especially true for Samsung users, still reeling from the surprise delay to Android 15 suddenly confirmed last week. Samsung has also issued details of its own October security update, which thankfully now includes two critical Qualcomm vulnerabilities delayed from September's Android update.

Not all Pixel and Samsung devices are eligible for updates, of course, and you should check to ensure you know if you are still getting these critical updates. You can do so here for Pixel and Samsung, with the latter also detailing whether those updates are monthly, quarterly or even biannually. Suffice to say, if you're not on monthly updates than there will be significant periods of time when your device is at risk.

The duration of support eligibility has become something of a competitive battle between Google and Samsung, with it now significantly longer than before. Seven years has become the new standard for flagships, which will likely outlast the utility of the device, especially as annual AI performance updates become the norm and some of those features make their way onto low-priced phones.

Samsung is even extending support for budget devices, with the new Galaxy A16 5G, launched to go head-to-head with Chinese low-end devices, comes with six years of support -- unprecedented at that level. ""If you buy the Galaxy A16 5G,"" says Android Authority, ""you can expect updates till October 2030. If you weren't convinced that Samsung is the king of software updates, we hope you are now.""

But elongated support is a new shift for Android, and there remain a staggering number of devices that have fallen off the support roundabout, which when support eligibility was just three or four years was easy to do. Zimperium's Global Mobile Threat Report, published a fortnight ago, warns that a staggering 14% of Android devices used within enterprises ""cannot be upgraded, leaving them susceptible to exploitation."" The number is far lower for iPhones, with just 1% at risk.

That's the enterprise risk, but Zimperium also reports a higher 18% share of Android devices now running versions of the OS that can no longer be upgraded, which is broadly the same for iPhone. Given the much more open nature of Android, the risks are higher -- especially going back several years. And while Google's various services updates will still protect devices to an extent, the risks are very high.

ESET's Jake Moore warns that ""out of date operating systems can be left vulnerable to attack as criminals look for any vulnerabilities that aren't patched and target people's data. When phones and tablets are left without patch management, they miss out on all the latest security updates. They may be safe for the first few weeks or even months after their support has come to an end, but over time, even if the devices seem healthy, they could still easily be targeted by newly located vulnerabilities.""

The stats suggest at least 500 million Android devices are now at risk, with OS versions no longer eligible for support. StatCounter says almost 34% of devices are on Android 14 and 20% on Android 13, but one in five still use Android 11 or 12, and an alarming 4% still lumber away on Android 9, which Google stopped supporting in 2021. Android 10 reached end of life in 2023 and Android 11 in February this year.

In total, this means around 25% of Android devices are running end-of-life OS versions, or up to 750 million of 3 billion phones. Bizarrely, as bad as that situation is, it's an improvement over the billion-plus devices reported to be out of support in 2020, which was an appalling 40% or two out of every five devices in use at the time.

Not only do you need to ensure your device is eligible for support, but that it gets those updates when they're released. ""It is important to make sure devices are set to auto update their operating system,"" Moore says, ""but when these devices are at their end of life, it is worth considering purchasing a newer phone or tablet that offers the latest, most secure updates to stay protected from the latest threats.""

When compared to Apple's everyone all at once approach to iOS updates, the situation for Android is more complex, with updated deployed by OEM, model, region and network, drip-feeding al through the month. Reports are still coming in of Samsung devices just now getting September's updates, which in itself saw critical updates -- per above -- delayed a month.

It has been a dangerous year for Android, with multiple warnings that critical security threats had triggered attacks in the wild and emergency patching. Don't take the risk -- especially in a world when a cheap device with multi-year support is now available."
Former UFC Champion Denounces Daniel Cormier's 'Stupid' Comments,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/10/08/former-ufc-champion-denounces-daniel-cormiers-stupid-comments/,2024-10-08T06:31:56Z,"During a recent interview, former UFC welterweight champion Tyron Woodley revealed his plans to return to MMA in the coming year. He also shared his feelings toward some specific commentary from another former champion and current analyst, Daniel Cormier.

Woodley accomplished a lot during his UFC career. He became the welterweight champion with a KO victory over Robbie Lawler in July 2016. Woodley successfully defended the title four times.

During his last title defense against Darren Till in September 2018, Woodley recalled a mid-fight moment where he could hear some of Cormier's commentary from the announcer's table. Woodley didn't take kindly to what he perceived as a racially stereotypical concept and said it drove him to finish Till-which he did with a D'Arce Choke in the second round, earning his black belt in Jiu Jitsu immediately after the fight.

""Like, there's been times I've been in the cage, and I heard Daniel Cormier be like, 'Oh, Tyron Woodley, you know, got to save something in the tank,'"" Woodley said. ""You know what I mean? 'Don't want to exert his energy.' You're basically alluding to the stereotype of African-American men that are built with muscle composition don't have the cardio or skill set, and you Black, so that's stupid."" So, when I heard him say that, I was fighting Darren Till. I looked over at him, I gave him the ugly look, and I just started punching Darren harder and faster, and more elbows and more damage because you kind of got me f##### up. So, when people are in a situation where they basically got you messed up, sometimes you gotta let them know, and that's okay to let people know here and there.""

Here is a look at that portion of our interview.

I reached out to Cormier on Monday for a comment on this subject, but I didn't get a response.

Woodley's insight during the full interview was interesting as he spoke candidly about his most brutal weight cut, what he's done to prepare for his return, and even fellow St. Louis native Joaquin Buckley-who found himself in beef with Cormier.

That situation is what led to Woodley speaking on Cormier.

As it is, many in the combat sports world are intrigued by Woodley's return to MMA. He lost his last four fights in the UFC and dropped two straight boxing matches against Jake Paul.

Woodley has not competed in combat sports since December 2021 and in MMA since March 2021. His last win came over Till.

Woodley has said he is returning to MMA, but he didn't say it would be with the UFC. Woodley said he couldn't share that information when I asked him for details, but it sounds like details are forthcoming.

There are a few options within the UFC and the Professional Fighters League for Woodley, including a potential matchup with the explosive Cedric Doumbe. Another intriguing possibility could be a third meeting with Paul, but it will be in mixed martial arts this time.

The PFL signed Paul to an MMA contract, but he has yet to debut in the sport. Paul has recently said that his MMA and PFL debut are coming in 2025, but did not share details on his opponent.

Because Paul and Woodley have history, it could make sense for them to clash in the PFL SmartCage. Woodley, 42, is likely done competing at 170 pounds.

He seems more likely to be headed for a middleweight or even a light heavyweight fight in his MMA return. Stay tuned for more information on that aspect of the Woodley story and a potential response from Cormier."
