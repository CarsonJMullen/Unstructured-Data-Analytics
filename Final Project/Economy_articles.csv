I went to a classic Wisconsin supper club to talk politics. This is what I learned,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5138314/wisconsin-supper-club-harris-trump,2024-10-08T15:11:27Z,"The Packing House in Milwaukee caters to diners of all political persuasions. Keren Carrión/NPR hide caption

When we started planning an election reporting trip to swing state Wisconsin, locals told us we had to include a visit to a supper club to experience a unique part of the state's culture. So when I finally met Chris Wiken, whose family opened The Packing House in Milwaukee 50 years ago, my first question was, ""What on earth is a supper club?""

""This is the elusive question,"" he says. ""The whole idea of a supper club is somewhere that you're going to come and spend the evening at.""

Typically, a supper club will include a few things: a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned cocktail at the bar, seafood or prime rib in the dining room and then live music and a boozy ice cream drink to close out the night.

Even though The Packing House was remodeled about a decade ago, it still has a classic old-time aesthetic with dark wood and dim lighting. Walking through the doors feels like going back in time.

Milwaukee's main airport terminal was just across the street when The Packing House opened in 1974. Now, that terminal serves private jets where former President Donald Trump, Vice President Harris or their running mates park every time they come to town.

""The police and Secret Service come over and go, 'Hey, Chris, they have to close down the street again.' And then I go and shake my fist at them,"" he says, joking that he'll vote for whoever shuts down the street in front of his restaurant fewer times.

You won't see a Harris or Trump sign in front of The Packing House. Wiken doesn't want to alienate his customers, who have a wide range of views, as the All Things Considered crew and I discovered when we started chatting people up at the bar.

Janine Collette, having dinner with an old friend, remembers growing up in Wisconsin before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in the state.

""In high school, we used to raise money in the girls' bathrooms to help girls go to the state of New York to get an abortion,"" she says. ""We're not going back."" Collette is excited to cast her vote for the candidate she expects to become the first female U.S. president.

At the other end of the bar, Ron Raasch says that he has voted for Democrats his whole life and that this election may be the first time he doesn't. He's disillusioned with the two-party system and is considering a vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

""It's very hard to see the difference when both of the major parties are going to continue shipping arms all over the world and especially to Gaza,"" he says. Raasch isn't concerned that in 2016 and 2020 the margin of victory in Wisconsin for Trump and Biden, respectively, was less than 1% of the vote. ""People are throwing that as a fear tactic,"" he says. ""And I'm trying to [more so] make a statement that the two-party system is showing its age and its frailties.""

Wearing a Packers hat at the bar, Lee Cielonko is nursing a beer while he waits for his food to arrive. ""I want the economy to be put back together. I want energy. I want to drill, baby, drill, man,"" he says.

He's supporting Trump and is concerned about immigration, saying: ""People come here and they don't have the same culture as us. They don't understand and know a lot of the way our culture works.""

So much about the future, as well as this election, is uncertain; there can be something comforting in the familiar: fish fry Friday, a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned at the bar and live music in a place that has been doing pretty much the same thing since before most Americans were born."
Americans are using AI at fairly high rates. What does this mean for the economy?,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2024/10/07/g-s1-26429/americans-using-ai-fairly-high-rates-what-does-this-mean-for-economy,2024-10-08T10:33:21Z,"Before conducting a recent survey of Americans to figure out how much they're using generative AI, Harvard University economist David Deming says he was solidly in the ""AI skeptic"" camp. That is, he was skeptical that the explosion of generative AI would offer sizable benefits for the U.S. economy anytime soon. Now, however, he says he's more optimistic.

""I was very surprised at the numbers in our survey,"" Deming says. ""And it sort of made me think that AI is gonna be a bigger deal than I would've thought.""

The study, Deming says, was motivated by questions over whether and how much Americans are using generative artificial intelligence. Doing what economists tend to do, he and his colleagues, Alexander Bick and Adam Blandin, wanted to get some good data.

They modeled their survey after the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Conducted monthly, the CPS is sort of the gold standard for surveys. It's how we know things like the unemployment rate and the state of the labor market.

In short, the survey that Deming, Bick and Blandin conducted is high-quality. It has a large sample size. It's nationally representative. And they even included some of the same questions that the CPS asks, so they could cross-reference their survey with the CPS and make sure their numbers were good. They conducted their survey twice, in June and August 2024.

Deming says he was shocked by the results. He and his colleagues found that almost 40% of Americans, ages 18 to 64, have used generative AI. And a sizable percentage seems to use it regularly. In their August survey, the economists found that more than 24% of American workers had used it ""at least once in the week prior to being surveyed, and nearly one in nine used it every workday.""

Even more surprising, Deming says, usage of AI seems to be pretty much across the board. He expected that younger and more-educated Americans would be the biggest users. They confirmed that's the case. ""But we even found that 22% of blue-collar workers say they use AI, and usage rates were above 20% in every major occupation category except personal services, where it was like 15%,"" he says.

This rapid rate of adoption, the authors point out, is much faster than the speed at which Americans adopted personal computers and the internet. That may not be very surprising though, considering that personal computers cost thousands of dollars in the 1980s and 1990s and you had to get physical hardware, hook it up, figure out how to use it, etc. Even with the internet, people had to buy modems, get subscriptions, figure out how to ""surf the web"" and so on. Generative AI is more plug and play, often free or has a low-monthly subscription cost, and has a user interface that is familiar to anyone who has ever used Google.

In a recent two-part series on The Indicator, Darian Woods and I debated whether AI is overrated. Given the tremendous uncertainty about the impact that AI will have on the economy -- as well as our reluctance to make predictions that might get us laughed at in a few years -- we decided to obscure our personal feelings on the matter. We flipped an AI-generated coin. I got ""AI is overrated"" and wrote an episode and a newsletter making that argumentative case.

In the course of my research, I discovered a study conducted by the Census Bureau this year that found that only about 5% of American businesses said they had used AI in the previous couple of weeks. I used this as evidence that use of generative AI was pretty pathetic, especially considering all the hype around it.

How does Deming square his results with that finding?

For one, Deming says, he and his colleagues found that actually Americans report they're using AI more during their personal time at home than at work.

Hmmm. OK. Putting my ""AI is overrated"" hat back on, this makes me think that much of AI use is for pleasure rather than for productive work purposes -- which would suggest that AI's impact on the economy will be limited.

The sort of economic dream for AI would be that it would rescue the U.S. economy from its long period of slow productivity growth. Productivity growth -- meaning workers being able to produce more in less time -- is the magic sauce of rising living standards. And recent technologies have been pretty disappointing on that front.

I mean, look at the smartphone. If I told you back in 2006, the year before the iPhone was released, that we'd soon all have supercomputers in our pockets, able to search the internet, give us precise directions to anywhere, send emails to and do video calls with co-workers and clients, order basically any product or service, translate languages and on and on -- you might think we'd see an explosion in productivity. But smartphones seem to be more a tool for pleasure and distraction than an incredibly impactful work tool. We haven't seen a huge boost in productivity growth since its mass adoption well over a decade ago.

Deming, however, stresses that people are using generative AI for work. He says their survey shows ""about 1 in 4 people used it at least once in the last week at work"" (versus ""about 1 in 3"" who used it in their off time). When it comes to how people use AI to help their work, respondents indicated that writing, interpreting and administrative support were the most helpful (although a significant share also said they were using it for other tasks, including coding and support when dealing with customers and co-workers).

Squaring his study with the one from the Census Bureau, Deming says he thinks there's a ""big gap between a company's formal policy on AI use and workers. I think quite a lot of the use is under the radar, like you've gotta write an email to your boss and you just use it to write the email more quickly and you just use ChatGPT to do it. But you don't tell anyone."" Deming says many of his students use generative AI this way.

We reached out to Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Daron Acemoglu -- whom, these days, you might call the AI skeptic in chief -- about Deming and his colleagues' study. Does the fact that they find that a large percentage of Americans are using generative AI change his perspective at all?

""My concern with their numbers is that it does not distinguish fundamentally productive uses of generative AI from occasional/frivolous uses,"" Acemoglu said in an email. ""If you are curious about what ChatGPT would say to introduce one of your guests and use it to get a sense of that, you are a user, but this is not fundamentally integrated into the NPR production process. Worse, if you asked me whether I'm using generative AI, and if I'm being honest, I will have to say yes, because when I do searches, now I see generative AI-generated output. But this has zero impact on me. The productivity improvements would require fundamental integration and reorganization of production processes, together with complementary investments in organizational capacity and worker skills -- not gimmicky, frivolous uses. We know ChatGPT has about 200 million unique monthly users, but the question is how many of them are using it in a way that will lead to significant productivity improvements/cost reductions. I don't really know the answer to that question, and I don't think we find the answer to that question from this paper.""

To try to predict how much AI will boost productivity growth, Deming and his colleagues did some rough calculations. They looked at five randomized studies that analyzed how much use of generative AI increases productivity in various work settings. They picked the productivity-boost number in the middle of those studies, which is about 25%. They then multiplied that, Deming says, by ""our estimate of the number of work hours that are currently being assisted by generative AI"" (which, they calculate, is somewhere between 0.5% and 3.5% of all work hours in the U.S.).

They ended up estimating that generative AI will result in an ""increase in labor productivity of between 0.125 and 0.875 percentage points at current levels of usage."" That may not sound like very much. But, Deming says, consider that productivity growth over the last couple of decades has ""been about one and a half percent per year. So if you take that 1.5% and you add this, that's actually a pretty big increase.""

Interestingly, Acemoglu has also done some rough calculations of the potential impact of generative AI on the economy in the near future. And despite using a different method to calculate the potential productivity boost from AI, his estimates are actually pretty similar to this recent work from Deming and colleagues.

Yet, Acemoglu and Deming put different spins on the results. Acemoglu seems to be reacting more to all the media and industry hype around generative AI -- and, he's like, we're not witnessing an economic revolution by any means. Deming looks at the potential productivity increase and emphasizes more that it looks like generative AI could make a meaningful impact on the U.S. economy.

""Is it gonna lead to 7% productivity growth? No, probably not,"" Deming says. ""Not the way it's currently being used, but it could add a little bit, and every little bit counts. Like that's millions and millions of dollars of extra GDP growth and rising living standards. That really counts.""

Deming and his colleagues have plans to continue conducting their survey in the future. It's worth noting that they conducted their last survey before Apple released an iPhone that has ChatGPT integrated into it.

Pretty soon, he says, ""because AI is gonna be embedded in so many things, like the iPhone, it's gonna be hard to even ask people, ""Do you use AI?"""
Tunisia's President Saied wins reelection after cracking down on the opposition,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/g-s1-26834/tunisia-kais-saied-election-2024-arab-spring,2024-10-08T05:46:56Z,"TUNIS, Tunisia -- President Kais Saied won a landslide victory in Tunisia's election Monday, keeping his grip on power after a first term in which opponents were imprisoned and the country's institutions overhauled to give him more authority.

The North African country's Independent High Authority for Elections said Saied received 90.7% of the vote, a day after exit polls showed him with an insurmountable lead in the country known as the birthplace of the Arab Spring more than a decade ago.

""We're going to cleanse the country of all the corrupt and schemers,"" the 66-year-old populist said in a speech at campaign headquarters. He pledged to defend Tunisia against threats foreign and domestic.

That raised alarm among the president's critics including University of Tunis law professor Sghayer Zakraoui, who said Tunisian politics were once again about ""the absolute power of a single man who places himself above everyone else and believes himself to be invested with a messianic message.""

Zakraoui said the election results were reminiscent of Tunisia under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who ruled for more than 20 years before becoming the first dictator toppled in the Arab Spring uprisings. Saied received a larger vote share than Ben Ali did in 2009, two years before fleeing the country amid protests.

The closest challenger, businessman Ayachi Zammel, won 7.4% of the vote after sitting in prison for the majority of the campaign while facing multiple sentences for election-related crimes.

Yet Saied's win was marred by low voter turnout. Election officials reported 28.8% of voters participated on Oct. 6 -- a significantly smaller showing than in the first round of the country's two other post-Arab Spring elections and an indication of apathy plaguing the country's 9.7 million eligible voters.

Saied's most prominent challengers -- imprisoned since last year -- were prevented from running, and lesser-known candidates were jailed or kept off the ballot. Opposition parties boycotted the contest, calling it a sham amid Tunisia's deteriorating political climate and authoritarian drift.

Over the weekend, there was little sign of an election underway in Tunisia apart from an anti-Saied protest on Friday and celebrations in the capital on Sunday evening.

""He will re-enter office undermined rather than empowered by these elections,"" Tarek Megerisi, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote on X.

Saied's critics pledged to keep opposing his rule.

""It's possible that after 20 years our kids will protest on Avenue Habib Bourguiba to tell him to get out,"" said Amri Sofien, a freelance filmmaker, referring to the capital's main thoroughfare. ""There is no hope in this country.""

Such despair is a far cry from the Tunisia of 2011, when protesters took to the streets demanding ""bread, freedom and dignity,"" ousted the president and paved the way for the country's transition into a multiparty democracy.

Tunisia in the following years enshrined a new constitution, created a Truth and Dignity Commission to bring justice to citizens tortured under the former regime and saw its leading civil society groups win the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering political compromise.

But its new leaders were unable to buoy the country's flailing economy and quickly became unpopular amid constant political infighting and episodes of terrorism and political violence.

Against that backdrop, Saied -- then a political outsider -- won his first term in 2019 promising to combat corruption. To the satisfaction of his supporters, in 2021 he declared a state of emergency, suspended parliament and rewrote the constitution to consolidate the power of the presidency -- a series of actions his critics likened to a coup.

Tunisians in a referendum approved the president's proposed constitution a year later, although voter turnout plummeted.

Authorities subsequently began to unleash a wave of repression on the once-vibrant civil society. In 2023, some of Saied's most prominent opponents from across the political spectrum were thrown in prison, including right-wing leader Abir Moussi and Islamist Rached Ghannouchi, the co-founder of the party Ennahda and former speaker of Tunisia's parliament.

Dozens of others were imprisoned on charges including inciting disorder, undermining state security and violating a controversial anti-fake news law critics say has been used to stifle dissent.

The pace of the arrests picked up earlier this year, when authorities began targeting additional lawyers, journalists, activists, migrants from sub-Saharan Africa and the former head of the post-Arab Spring Truth and Dignity Commission.

""The authorities seemed to see subversion everywhere,"" said Michael Ayari, senior analyst for Algeria & Tunisia at the International Crisis Group.

Dozens of candidates had expressed interest in challenging the president, and 17 submitted preliminary paperwork to run in Sunday's race. However, members of the election commission approved only three.

The role of the commission and its members, all of them appointed by the president under his new constitution, came under scrutiny. They defied court rulings ordering them to reinstate three candidates they had rejected. The parliament subsequently passed a law stripping power from the administrative courts.

Such moves sparked international concern, including from Europe, which relies on partnership with Tunisia to police the central Mediterranean, where migrants attempt to cross in from North Africa to Europe.

European Commission Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said Monday the EU ""takes note of the position expressed by many Tunisian social and political actors regarding the integrity of the electoral process."""
Harris is pressed for more specifics in a wide-ranging interview with '60 Minutes',NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144749/kamala-harris-60-minutes-cbs,2024-10-08T02:42:24Z,"Vice President Harris speaks to media members before departing for New York at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on Monday.

Vice President Harris sat for a wide-ranging interview that aired on 60 Minutes Monday, during which she was pressed for specifics on how she would pay for her economic plans and how she would bring an end to the war in Ukraine.

The interview with correspondent Bill Whitaker followed weeks of criticism from her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, that Harris has been unwilling to sit for difficult interviews with the press. Her appearance on 60 Minutes was part of a week-long media blitz that will see Harris appear on programs that include The View, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Howard Stern Show.

On the economy, Harris was pressed on how she would pay for economic promises like an expanded child tax credit and tax breaks for first time home buyers and new businesses. A new report from the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that Harris' estimated proposals would cost the government around $3.5 trillion, but Harris said she would offset that by raising taxes on corporations and the highest-earning Americans.

Her answer led interviewer Whitaker to push back, saying, ""We're dealing with the real world here."" Harris responded by saying she believes leaders in Congress are privately ready to listen to her.

""When you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about,"" she said, adding that there are ""plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

On the issue of immigration, Harris was asked why the Biden administration to did not move sooner to crack down on illegal immigration - a recurring criticism on the campaign trail from Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.

""The policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem,"" Harris said. Illegal border crossings have fallen off by half, she said, ""but we need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem.""

Harris was also asked about criticism from her Republican opponents that she has morphed from a relatively liberal candidate during her first run for the White House in 2020 to a more centrist candidate today. She responded by saying that her evolution is result of traveling the nation as vice president ""and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground.""

""I believe in building consensus,"" Harris said. ""We are a diverse people, geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds, and what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus, where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing, as long as you don't compromise your values.""

On foreign policy, Harris said she would not meet unilaterally with President Vladimir Putin of Russia about ending the war in in Ukraine, suggesting Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy would need to be involved. ""Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine,"" Harris said.

The vice president also shared new details about a surprising admission she made during her debate with Trump: that she is a gun owner. -- that she was a gun owner.

She told Oprah Winfrey last month that she had long owned a gun for protection, because of her history in law enforcement. ""If somebody breaks in my house, they're getting shot."" She told Whitaker she owned a Glock and that she'd ""had it for quite some time."" Asked if she had ever fired it, she said, ""Yes, of course I have, at a shooting range.""

Harris' appearance was part of a long tradition of presidential candidates sitting for interviews with 60 Minutes going back to 1968. The show said Trump had been scheduled to appear for an interview as well, but that his campaign canceled last week."

It's a close race for Michigan. These factors could decide it for Harris or Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5130163/michigan-2024-election-harris-trump,2024-10-07T09:06:21Z,"A Trump and Harris sign side-by-side in a neighborhood on Oct. 3, 2024 in Hillsdale, Mich. Sylvia Jarrus for NPR hide caption

Michigan is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House.

The state is part of the ""blue wall,"" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that she and Democrats need to hold to avoid a second Donald Trump presidency.

It's home to some of the key demographics that both parties are courting this election, from white voters without college degrees to the largest Black-majority city, Detroit, and one of the nation's largest Arab American populations.

But the path to victory is not easy this year. Harris and Trump remain in a close battle, as his populist message continues to resonate with white voters and union and blue-collar workers, particularly on the economy.

Dave Dulio, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, says ""in places like Macomb County, with many blue-collar voters and union workers, Trump made inroads by pledging to get the U.S. out of bad trade deals and renegotiate NAFTA, which he did.""

""I think they still give him credit for that,"" he added.

Dulio underscores the state's significance by noting that small shifts could lead to substantial changes for candidates: ""If you take a small shift among the Arab American community and a small shift among union workers, those multiple small shifts could drive a very different result.""

Both candidates have heaped attention recently on the Wolverine State. On Oct 4, Harris visited a Redford Charter Township firehouse near Detroit, meeting union representatives. She met with Arab American and Muslim leaders then appeared with United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain in Flint and vowed support for Michigan's auto industry. Trump held campaign events twice in September and took his presidential campaign to Saginaw Valley State University in Kochville Township on Oct. 3.

Michigan also plays to the strengths of the vice presidential nominees, who hail from the Midwest. Both Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have stumped in the state in the last month.

To better understand the key issues shaping voters' decisions -- from the economy and immigration to abortion and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East -- we are in Michigan this week hearing directly from voters and political observers as part of our ""We, The Voters"" series.

A September poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Michigan voters cared most about the economy, followed by abortion and immigration.

Economy

Michigan's unemployment rate is historically low, according to state data, but it has slowly ticked up in recent months. Meanwhile, inflation has eased, but high costs of living remain a concern.

The state continues to suffer from the decades-long decline of automobile manufacturing, and high interest rates have constricted sales of cars, according to a September study from the University of Michigan.

Both parties are trying to put focus on the economy. GOP attack ads argue that Biden and Harris are responsible for inflation, while the vice president's messaging focuses on plans to uplift the middle class and paint Trump-era tax cuts as benefiting the wealthy.

Meghan Wilson, an expert in public policy and urban development, said Harris could expand the Democratic position on economics by appealing to Black business owners and holders of student debt.

""African Americans in Detroit have a lot of small businesses, and so we're looking for capital for those kinds of small businesses. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job of bringing the small businesses into the conversation,"" Wilson explained.

Organized labor plays a key role in Michigan's economy. Both parties are making a play for Michigan's union members, who accounted for 13% of workers in the state last year. Exit polls in 2020 showed Michigan's union voters favoring President Biden over Trump, and Biden pledged to be ""the most pro-union president"" in U.S. history, which he backed up with a visit to UAW workers striking in Wayne, Mich.

Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said Biden's visit to striking workers helped him bump up his union support, but his policies to advance electric vehicles with tax credits were unpopular with Independent and Republican voters.

""You have Harris leading among union members with 63% which is almost where Biden was in 2020 with 65%, so she's improving her lot among union members, but still, the EVs are a problem,"" he said.

Still, one encouraging sign for the Harris campaign could be Michigan's local Teamsters union backing her candidacy, breaking with the national union that declined to endorse any candidate for U.S. president, after they had supported every Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton.

Abortion

Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a landmark amendment to the state constitution, securing the right to abortion and other reproductive health services.

Democrats won control of all three branches of Michigan's governments since making abortion a central voting issue.

But that success may have made it a less influential issue in the 2024 election. A KFF poll in June found that women in Michigan saw abortion as ""decided"" and they were more concerned about inflation and the rising cost of living.

""The Democrats are putting an awful lot of their eggs in the basket of abortion,"" the pollster Porn said.

Dulio pointed out that Trump's main weakness stems from what has driven Democratic success in every election -- and not necessarily abortion since it's already decided in the state: ""His character remains a key weakness. He's deeply unpopular because of the Jan. 6 spectacle and doubling down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. That just turns off persuadable voters,"" he said.

Michigan is home to one of the largest Black populations in the nation, ahead of Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, and the largest Black-majority city, Detroit.

Harris would herself be the nation's first Black woman president, but some Black voters may not be as motivated to vote as they were in 2020.

""The main challenge is the enthusiasm gap,"" said Ronald Brown, a political scientist at Wayne State University. He said among Black voters in Michigan, those who were in the ""black leadership class"" -- meaning serving in government, churches, Black fraternities and sororities -- were highly likely to vote for Harris. However, those without deep connections to the party, especially working-class and poor Detroit residents, were susceptible to sitting out elections. In particular, he pointed to Detroit's recent voter turnout -- higher in 2020 than it was in 2016 -- as a key factor explaining the state's pick for Biden after it went for Trump four years earlier.

""What could occur is that among working class and poor Black voters, lack of interest could lead to fatigue and this may drive those voters not to vote. And in Michigan, you don't need many. You need enough,"" he said.

Democratic state Sen. Sarah Anthony has a different perspective. She had seen an encouraging gain among young people to help shore up Harris' base.

""The Biden coalition included many working-class white men, a group Vice President Harris has struggled to win over. While there may have been losses there, the data I've seen shows significant gains due to increased enthusiasm among young people and people of color,"" she said.

U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East

The Detroit Metropolitan area has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. Dearborn, often called the Capital of Arab America, is home to a majority of Lebanese residents who maintain strong ties to southern Lebanon.

Arab and Muslim voters here were largely supportive of Biden in 2020. However, many have since been alienated by his handling of Israel's deadly war in Gaza and the administration's ongoing military aid to Israel. Many now are similarly concerned about Israel's continuing bombardment of Beirut and ground invasion along the countries' shared border.

Abbas Alawieh, a Dearborn Democratic strategist and one of the co-founders of the ""uncommitted movement,"" backed Biden in 2020. But earlier this year, he and other organizers successfully secured more than 100,000 ""uncommitted"" votes in the Michigan primary to protest Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.

Alawieh, who had advocated for a Gaza ceasefire, told Morning Edition host Leila Fadel that he feels more despair now as the conflict spreads to his family's homeland, Lebanon.

""This is a grieving community. So, for us to give guidance to vote for Kamala Harris, when she is part of the administration that's actively killing their family members, it's like giving a campaign speech at a funeral.""

Professor Dubio said the uncommitted movement has the potential to ""have a huge impact,"" and while he believes many of them will ultimately vote for Harris, he added, ""it can't and shouldn't be ignored.""

Abbas mentioned sending letters to Vice President Harris's team, including her national security advisor, requesting meetings with those directly affected by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. ""So far, the answer is still no.""

He added that Donald Trump visited the community, took photos with leaders, and invited them to his campaign rally.

Saeed Khan, an associate professor of Near Eastern and Asian Studies at Wayne State University, said Muslim and Arab voters were drifting toward Trump in 2016, and some continue to do so today, not only because of a push away from Democrats, but also a pull toward the Republican party's values. Many Arabs and Muslims, immigrant Muslims, voted for the Republican ticket at least until September 11 and then started to move toward the Democratic Party.

""The Republican message of self-reliance, smaller government or less government intrusion, lower taxes, social conservatism really appealed to many, especially immigrant Muslims and Arabs, because it epitomized the American Dream that they had internalized,"" Khan said."

The July 13 assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump's life was a recurring theme at a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pa. on Saturday.

Trump returned to speak at the Butler Farm Show grounds in the small Pennsylvania city -- the site where, nearly three months ago, a gunman's bullets grazed the Republican presidential nominee's ear, as well as killed one rally attendee and injured two others.

""Exactly 12 weeks ago this evening on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me and to silence the greatest movement, MAGA, in the history of our country,"" Trump said in one of his many references to his near-death experience. ""But by the hand of providence and the grace of God, that villain did not succeed in his goal, did not come close. He did not stop our movement, he did not break out our spirit. He did not shake our unyielding resolve to save America from evils of poverty, hatred and destruction.""

Speaking from behind transparent screens owing to heightened security, Trump honored Corey Comperatore -- the man who was fatally shot during Trump's rally in July -- with a moment of silence. Bells tolled and tenor Christopher Macchio's sang Franz Schubert's ""Ave Maria,"" a piece often performed at funerals. Trump also expressed thanks to the Secret Service team and medical professionals who came to his aid.

Crowds waited for hours in the Pennsylvania sun to hear Trump speak. Their cries of ""Fight! Fight! Fight!"" punctuated the action on stage.

Other speakers at the event also referenced the July 13 shooting.

Eric Trump appeared to blame his father's political opponents for the assassination attempt: ""They tried to kill him,"" Trump's son said. ""And it's because the Democratic Party, they can't do anything right.""

Elon Musk focused on Trump's bravery: ""The true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire,"" the billionaire entrepreneur said. ""We had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot.""

Beyond the references to the July shooting, Trump's speech focused on many of his usual talking points, including putting an end to illegal immigration, the importance of fossil fuels to the U.S. economy (""We are going to drill, baby, drill!"") and his plan to turn the country into a ""manufacturing superpower again.""

He also twice repeated his plan ""to keep men out of women's sports"" on the grounds of it being ""so demeaning to women."""
Stunning photos of a vast e-waste dumping ground  --  and those who make a living off it,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/10/05/g-s1-6411/electronics-public-health-waste-ghana-phones-computers,2024-10-05T17:35:53Z,"The now-demolished Agbogbloshie Scrapyard in Accra, Ghana, once received 250,000 tons of electronic waste each year, making it the world's largest electronic waste dump. Muntaka Chasant hide caption

When he was just 18 years old, Emmanuel Akatire traveled about 500 miles from his home in Zorko, Ghana, to Accra, the nation's capital, to find the only work he could -- sifting through vast piles of discarded electronics to find valuable scrap metal. A week's worth of painstaking, often dangerous work, earns him the equivalent of about 60 U.S. dollars.

""I started doing scrap work around 2021 -- after I lost both my parents -- to provide for the rest of my family,"" he told Muntaka Chasant, a photojournalist in Ghana. ""There's no electricity in my community, no development there,"" he said. So he came to Accra, which has become a major dumping ground for the globe's used electronics.

For years, a site called Agbogbloshie in Accra was the world's largest e-waste dump, getting 250,000 tons of discarded phones, computers and other used electronics each year. Many Western media outlets depicted the site as a public health and environmental tragedy, rife with toxic chemicals that leach into the water and poison the air. While that's undoubtedly true, it's not the full story, according to a new collaborative photojournalism project.

The project, called E-Waste in Ghana: Tracing Transboundary Flows, which won this year's Fondation Carmingac photojournalism award, aims to capture both the positive and negative aspects of e-waste.

""The world cannot throw all its garbage here, it has truly negative consequences on the people,"" says Anas Aremeyaw Anas, an investigative journalist in Ghana who co-led the project. ""But there are positive aspects of sending us e-waste,"" he says, as it's sparked a dynamic, informal recycling economy in the country that, while often dangerous, can also help lift people like Emmanuel Akatire out of poverty.

Globally, e-waste is an enormous problem. In 2022, humans discarded about 62 million tons of used electronics, enough to fill a line of trucks that spans the equator. But there's opportunity too, as those trucks contain over $91 billion of valuable metals, the U.N. estimates, though people like Akatire who do the dangerous recycling work reap the smallest share of those potential profits.

E-waste falls into two broad buckets: functional and non-functional. The line between them can be fuzzy, as what's still usable or repairable to one person may not be to another, but the distinction is important. International laws prohibit trafficking of non-functional e-waste containing toxic substances, but the United Nations sees trading functional e-waste as beneficial, as it can lengthen the lifespan of a product.

The project found that exporters often fail to separate functional from non-functional e-waste. ""If you have a container full of TV screens, how on earth are you going to verify each and every one of them to make sure that they are functioning,"" says photojournalist Bénédicte Kurzen, a co-author of the project. As a result, both kinds of e-waste get stuffed into container ships that make their way to low- and middle-income countries like Ghana.

Formally, Ghana prohibits the import of many forms of hazardous e-waste material. But the team found that a well-placed bribe can get port officials to look the other way. As a result, informal e-waste sites are growing across Ghana's coast. There, both functional and non-functional e-waste get dumped into vast piles that are encroaching on residential areas. Thousands of ""pickers"" come to these sites, picking through the rubbish to separate items that might be repaired from waste that could contain valuable minerals.

Many of the pickers are climate migrants from an area of Ghana known as the ""Upper East,"" says project co-author Chasant, where warming temperatures are upending traditional farming practices. ""This area has the highest unemployment rate among young people,"" he says. They come to e-waste sites to earn money during the dry season, Chasant says, which they bring back to the Upper East. ""There's a whole generation of young people that are building their society from e-waste work.""

It's fraught, precarious work. To separate valuable minerals, like copper wire or iron, from useless plastic, pickers often burn the trash, producing noxious fumes. Burns, cuts and other injuries are common. E-waste workers -- many of whom are children, the team found -- are at risk of exposure to over 1,000 harmful chemicals, according to the World Health Organization, including lead, mercury and brominated flame retardants, which are linked to higher rates of diseases like cancer and diabetes.

Bernard Akanwee Atubawuna, a 21-year-old picker from Upper East, died while doing scrap work, says Chasant. His cause of death is unknown, but ""Akanwee was a sickle-cell carrier and should never have been anywhere near fires/picking. But his parents said it was the only way he supported them. He sent his sister to learn a trade. He was also helping the parents to build a house back in the Upper East -- all from picking.""

The harms extend beyond the dumps themselves. ""There are many communities that have run to a halt as a result of the devastating effects of the poisonous gases that are inhaled,"" says Anas. Heavy metals seep into the soil and water too, which can have profound health effects on local communities. ""When people start burning, the poisonous fumes lead to people relocating.""

A burgeoning recycling and repair industry has risen up alongside those harms. The team documented informal marketplaces, where vendors sell scores of busted cell phones to buyers looking to repair circuit boards or extract their precious metals. On Zongo Lane in Accra, the reporters say, hundreds of small, independent shops sell used or repaired equipment, ranging from televisions to computers.

""In Africa, people still have this thing of repairing is important. Don't throw it away. You can still do things about it,"" says Kurzen. In Western countries, people view these objects as much more disposable, she says, which is helping fuel the growth of e-waste worldwide.

The most valuable minerals extracted from Ghana's e-waste often don't stay in Ghana. Many of the most valuable items get cherry picked and sent to more advanced smelters in Europe or Asia, the team found. ""People are dismantling these items in toxic environments, and then the few piles that contain incredibly valuable minerals are going to be re-exported,"" says Kurzen.

She and her colleagues hope that the project prompts people to re-examine their relationship to the electronics in their lives. The few years we spend with a new phone represents just a blip in the story of the materials that power it, Kurzen says. ""Those materials are traveling worldwide,"" she says, ""These [devices] we hold in our hands come at the expense of somebody, somewhere in the world. Nothing comes for free."""
"Three states show how abortion, schools and taxes are at stake in legislature races",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/05/nx-s1-5124638/state-legislature-supermajority-kansas-arizona-minnesota-elections,2024-10-05T09:04:20Z,"Elections for state legislatures don't get the attention that races for president or Congress do but they often have a big impact on our lives. Congress is divided and gridlocked. In contrast, nearly all state legislatures have both chambers run by one party or another. That makes it easy to pass laws.

And they've been passing a lot. More than 20 states have imposed new limits on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the federal right to abortion in 2022. In education, state lawmakers create voucher programs and determine public school funding. Gun laws, taxes, criminal sentences, access to Medicaid and food stamps are just a few other issues decided by state legislatures.

Redistricting and polarization have increased the political tilt of many legislatures -- even where the state might be more balanced overall.

This year, several legislatures could see power shift if just a few seats flip in the election -- maybe just a matter of hundreds of votes in some districts. Here are three states, Kansas, Minnesota and Arizona, that illustrate the stakes around the country.

TOPEKA, Kansas -- Kansas is one of several states where the Legislature sometimes tilts more conservative than the state's voters overall. While it votes Republican for president, it has elected a Democrat for governor twice in a row and voted with 59% to protect abortion rights.

But Republicans hold 29 of the 40 seats in the Senate and 85 of the 125 seats in the House. That gives them the two-thirds ""supermajority"" to pass bills and override vetoes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.

They've overridden Kelly's vetoes 15 times in the last two years. They used the override to pass a bill requiring doctors to question patients seeking abortions about their reasons. They overrode vetoes to pass laws banning transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports and to limit access to food stamps.

Democrats say they can break the supermajority in this year's elections -- they'd only need to flip two or three seats in either chamber. It would give Kelly a stronger veto in her last two years in office -- and Democrats more leverage over what the majority passes.

""My hope is that with the governor being able to veto and being able to sustain those vetoes, it puts us more at the table for compromise,"" says Democrat Dinah Sykes, the Senate minority leader.

National Democratic party organizations say that goal is within reach. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is highlighting 10 legislative races in Kansas and helping with campaign logistics.

Kansas Republicans, meanwhile, have scorned that contribution as outside interference. And they defend the supermajority.

Republican House Majority Leader Chris Croft says it's a necessary counterbalance to the governor's veto pen.

""[The] supermajority in this case, while it sounds like it's this huge number, in fact, what it does is just gives us a seat at the table,"" Croft told NPR.

Even with their heavy majority, Republican's priorities aren't always veto-proof. Last session, Kelly successfully vetoed three major tax-cut proposals, including one that fell a single vote shy of an override. The fight forced the Legislature into a special session.

""You can't get everything you want in this business. This business has a little bit of give and take and that's the beauty of the process,"" Croft says. ""It's also the frustrating part.""

Supermajorities, like the one held by Kansas Republicans, have become common. Across the country as of their recent legislative sessions, one party or another held a veto-proof majority in 29 states. Republicans had 20 of those, Democrats nine.

Patrick Miller, a political scientist at Kent State University, says supermajorities have spread in part because of polarization and legislators gerrymandering their own districts.

""One of those consequences of supermajority, is a lot more ideological politics and policy,"" he says.

While the U.S. Congress is often locked in stalemate, Miller says state legislatures that are dominated by one party are able to step into the vacuum to pass laws shaping day-to-day life.

""If you care about education, if you care about health care regulation in your state, if you care about abortion, transgender rights, LGBT rights, if you care about whether your roads have potholes ... you need to be looking at your state legislature,"" he says.

TONKA BAY, Minn. -- On a sunny Tuesday morning, Republican state Senate candidate Kathleen Fowke walks door-to-door near Lake Minnetonka just west of Minneapolis. The tree-lined roads by the water are quiet but when she knocks on a door she's reminded that this is hotly contested territory.

""You're in my YouTube all the time,"" says the man inside -- a reminder of the ads targeting voters here.

The contest to win this legislative district could be the state's most expensive ever -- and key to winning the Senate.

For two years, Democrats have controlled the Legislature and the governor's office under Gov. Tim Walz -- now the Democratic nominee for vice president. They've passed more spending for affordable housing and public schools, and guaranteed protections for patients who seek or provide abortion or gender-affirming care.

Now Republicans see a chance to curb the progressive trend. They're just a few seats behind in the state House. The Senate is tied 33-33 and this vacant seat by the lake could be the tiebreaker that ends the Democrats' so-called ""trifecta"" of House, Senate and governorship.

The GOP wants to slow state spending and focus on the economy overall. Fowke, a real estate agent, says that, while voters don't always know about the work the Legislature does, what she does hear about from them is money.

""It's basically affordability, and they can't afford, you know, just to go to the grocery store anymore,"" Fowke says. ""Taxes are high. Inflation is high. They need to find a way to help lower the costs of everything all around them.""

Republicans promise to cut taxes, tighten up on spending and curb fraud and abuse in state programs. ""With one-party, Democrat control, it was easy just to push through partisan policy and partisan priorities,"" House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth says.

Democrats say they address people's cost of living with laws requiring companies to offer paid time off for illness, family leave and safe time and new money for free school lunches.

""They trust the Democrats are going to do more for their economic well being, whereas what they hear from Republicans is, 'Oh, we have to give more tax cuts to corporations,'"" says Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman. The national Democratic Party is helping fund the state party's effort.

Their candidate facing Fowke is civil engineer Ann Johnson Stewart. She's knocking on doors, too, telling people she stands for maintaining legal protections for abortion in the state. ""One of the reasons I'm running is to make sure we can continue on that track,"" she says.

She hopes Democrats will work now on carbon-free energy sources, local infrastructure, expanding mental health care and reducing gun violence.

Andrew Karch, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota, says candidates face an uphill battle getting voters to pay attention to state issues.

""There's a real tendency for these races to sort of fly beneath the radar,"" Karch says. And many voters don't focus on state issues.

""I think politics in Minnesota specifically may have been more distinctive a generation ago than they are today,"" he says. ""State and local politicians are increasingly being asked to comment on issues that we might think of as national.""

Fowke and Johnson Stewart say they hope to keep the conversations focused on what's going on in their district. But they know that's a big ask in a presidential election year.

PHOENIX -- In Arizona, the party that wins the Legislature could determine where tens of thousands of children go to school or how well their schools are funded. At issue is the state's sweeping vouchers program that gives families tax dollars for use in private schools or for homeschooling.

For Chelsea Ellison, a homeschool parent, the program has helped turn things around for a daughter who struggled in public elementary school.

""It took us a little bit of last year to get her where she should have been, in general, and now she's thriving,"" Ellison says. ""She loves school.""

But parents and teachers sticking with public schools say they've paid the price.

""I notice that the amount of resources available to the teachers, directly, it just is not there, any kind of funding for improvements at the school is not there,"" says Miriam Hoban, whose child attends a public school in Scottsdale. She says teachers or parents are forced to pay out of pocket for basic necessities like pencils and markers.

Arizona's program, called Empowerment Scholarship Accounts, is a national model for what advocates call school choice. In 2022, the Republican Legislature and then-Gov. Doug Ducey took a small program offering vouchers for kids with disabilities or in underperforming schools and made it available for any child.

Enrollment in the program leaped from 12,000 students to 78,000 students and growing. Students got a median of $7,409 per year. That added up to a total of about $718 million from the state budget, which was $93 million more than projected, according to the Arizona Department of Education.

Republicans control the Legislature with just a two-seat advantage in both the House and Senate. The narrow margin was in the national spotlight this year as lawmakers just barely repealed an 1864 law that banned abortion.

If Democrats win control, they pledge to scale back the voucher program and they can rely on backing from Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, elected after the program was expanded. ""The previous Legislature passed a massive expansion of school vouchers that lacks accountability and will likely bankrupt this state,"" she said after taking office last year.

Critics point to stories about voucher money going for private lessons in luxury cars and ski resort passes, supposedly part of a child's education. And they say much of the money goes to families that were able to pay for private schools on their own with kids already out of the public schools.

But as the program has grown and gained support among some swing voters, it could be tougher for Democrats in competitive districts to campaign against it. They'll have to temper their ambitions, says Arizona pollster Paul Bentz.

""I don't expect that they could mount a full-fledged repeal,"" Bentz says. ""I think that would be challenging for some of the swing areas for Democrats. But I certainly think at a minimum, there would be regulation on it, and probably some definite changes to the program.""

Ellison, the voucher mom, says her family did try to make it work in public schools before opting to teach at home with voucher support.

""There was larger class sizes, more budget cuts,"" Ellison says of their old public school. ""We had no STEM teacher, we had no music teacher, we had no art teacher.""

Public school supporters say the vouchers drain the money for just those kinds of needs."
A coal power plant demolition serves as a poignant historical moment for the Navajo,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/05/nx-s1-5076973/coal-power-plant-demolition-navajo-new-mexico,2024-10-05T09:04:15Z,"In a small plane flying west out of Farmington, N.M., America's energy transition appeared to be proceeding in an orderly fashion -- a sea change measurable in megawatts, acreage and emission particle parts per million.

Mike Eisenfeld of San Juan Citizens Alliance was our tour guide, his voice crackling over the intercom.

""We're heading toward the San Juan Solar Project,"" he said. ""It's the biggest project going right now, economically.""

Rows and rows of black rectangles planted in bone-dry earth stretched out below us.

Then the plane headed south, where two enormous coal-fired power plants crouched on the landscape.

""At one point San Juan Generating Station and the Four Corners Power Plant, according to Los Alamos National Lab, were the largest source of point-source pollution in the United States,"" Eisenfeld said.

But on this day, the San Juan Generating Station sat dark and inert -- it shut down two years ago. As we flew over the Four Corners Power Plant, puffs of white smoke told us it was still producing energy.

""This is the last coal plant up here,"" Eisenfeld said of Four Corners. ""All the others have been retired. Gone.""

When Eisenfeld first moved to the area nearly 20 years ago, coal mining and coal power were on the rise in northwest New Mexico. Today, several large-scale solar projects are in the works.

He'd scheduled these tours with EcoFlight on Aug. 24 to showcase these big changes but also to witness the demolition of the San Juan Generating Station. That was the day its long, slender smokestacks collapsed into dust.

From the air, the coal and solar power facilities look like pieces like a gameboard. On the ground, the emotional weight of the energy transition is heavy and the complexities are palpable. Public Service Company of New Mexico, signaled years ago that it would decommission San Juan Generating Station; the plant burned its last load of coal in 2022. But the smokestacks are visible from hundreds of miles away. They have been a monumental presence on this landscape since the 1970s, and they've become powerful symbols to the people who live in the region -- especially Navajo people.

The Aug. 24 demolition was a poignant moment in the Navajo Nation's long and complex history with energy development. Over seven decades, coal and the energy made from it have become entwined with the Navajo's cultural beliefs, community life and the Navajo Nation economy.

On the morning of the demolition, employees of Public Utility of New Mexico transported visitors in a passenger van to a dirt lot on site. We drove past the massive concrete block of a building, weaving between heaps of scrap metal slated to be recycled.

There was a whiff of post-apocalypse in the air.

Dozens of contract laborers arrived in trucks and cars to watch the industrial carnage. Elsewhere on site, where former plant employees and local elected officials were gathered, the mood was somber. Still more spectators -- those without an invitation -- parked on the road outside the gates.

For the demolition team, a California contracting company called Integrated Demolition and Remediation, which has demolished dozens of smokestacks at coal power plants all over the U.S., this was business as usual.

""I'm going to do a loud '10, 9, 8, 7, 6,' "" said Rodrigo Roman, an explosives expert with the demolition team. ""Then I'll do a silent, '5, 4, 3, 2, 1.' He's gonna yell, 'Fire in the hole.' You're gonna hear a click. And then it's game on.""

Another member of the crew instructed me to lean back against one of the trucks.

""You're going to feel a shock wave,"" he said. ""It'll push you back a bit.""

Everyone gazed up at the 400 concrete cylinders, bathed in yellow morning sunlight for the last time.

But for at least one Navajo woman, the moment was too heavy to bear.

""I didn't attend the demolition because I'd probably cry,"" Christina Aspaas told me when I met with her in the nearby town of Kirtland, N.M. ""Knowing all that I know of how many jobs lost, the impacts that I'm seeing as a school board member to our district. Going to this demolition? I don't think that would have been good for my whole being.""

Aspaas' family history is embedded in the coal economy here. Her earliest memories of San Juan Generating Station date back to when she was a child.

""It was just some place we dropped my dad off at work,"" she said. ""He was a welder, but he helped build that power plant.""

Grandfathers, uncles and aunts worked at power plants and coal mines across the region, and eventually, Aspaas joined them as a utility worker in one of the mines.

""I worked two jobs before,"" she said. ""Both those checks put together, did not even come near the first check I got as a utility worker. And when they told me how much I was making, I thought I was rich.""

Decades later, she's a journeyman electrician at Navajo Mine and a union member. Her income supports dozens of family members.

""It provided for me and my daughter,"" she said. ""And I'm connected to four different clans and my wealth is not accumulated to myself. When I hear of ceremony or other things going, I help with food, groceries, cash.""

In the span of a decade, thousands of middle-class Navajo people have lost jobs connected to the coal economy; many have moved out of state. When utilities decommissioned the Navajo Generating Station near Page, Ariz., in 2019, the Navajo Nation lost more than $40 million in revenue. New Mexico labor data shows that displaced energy workers are making nearly $30,000 less a year on average since the San Juan power plant closed in 2022.

As a school board member, Aspaas is concerned that in five years, student enrollment has dropped 25% and student homelessness has tripled.

""What industry do we bring in here immediately to make up the tax revenue that's lost?"" she asked.

On the morning of the demolition, Elouise Brown drove more than an hour to park her car outside the gates of the San Juan Generating Station.

""I wanted to witness this with my own eyes,"" she said. ""We've been working on this for a long, long time, and I was very, very excited to see this.

Brown also has memories of the plant from childhood, driving in the car with her grandparents.

""It looked like a huge stove,"" she recalled. ""When my grandma said they burn coal, I was thinking, 'Jeez, how much coal would you burn to make all that smoke come out of those smokestacks?' ""

As an adult, she became concerned about the haze of air pollution all over the reservation.

""It didn't look safe!"" she said. ""How could you have a healthy life if you have a lot of smoke?""

Brown became an anti-coal activist in December 2006, after she learned that former Navajo Nation President Joe Shirley was backing a new coal-fired power plant in the region. The so-called Desert Rock project would have put a third coal plant within a few miles of the other two.

Brown sleuthed around online and discovered that construction was already underway. She drove to the site and started ripping out survey flags. When a semitruck hauling construction materials arrived, she maneuvered her car to block the driver.

""I went off the road, and I went right in front of him,"" she said. ""He had to stop, he had no choice.""

It was the beginning of her journey as an activist.

""He was a huge guy,"" Brown said of the driver. ""He was looking at me and just yelling at me. And I said, 'I don't care what the Navajo Nation president told you. He has no right to do what he did without informing us. So you're not coming through.' ""

Later, Brown blockaded the road with other activists. She picketed in the New Mexico Capitol building in Santa Fe for 60 days straight, and she fought the project until it fizzled in 2009.

""In our Navajo way of life, you don't mess with Mother Earth. You don't mess with the resources inside,"" she said.

For more than 75 years, Navajo people, who call themselves Diné, have forged a complex relationship with coal. Since the 1960s, utilities have burned coal on or near Navajo land, sending electricity to Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, San Diego and Albuquerque.

For some Navajo people, this story is simply a modern kind of colonialism, according to Diné sociologist and historian Andrew Curley.

""How these non-Native communities, especially white communities prey upon Diné people and resources, replicating a pattern of colonial marginalization and dispossession that goes back more than a hundred years,"" Curley said.

Curley's book Carbon Sovereignty explores the Navajo relationship with coal. Many Diné workers he interviewed said their labor in the coal industry was intrinsically and even culturally meaningful.

""[Coal work] became a form of empowerment,"" he said. ""It was a form of identity-building between workers at a site.""

In the 1970s, with the rise of the Red Power movement, Navajo workers and elected officials began to leverage their sovereignty.

""Our tribal leaders started to negotiate royalty rates with extractive companies operating in Indian Country to give more money back to the tribe and give more rights to Diné laborers,"" Curley said.

As coal declines and new resources power the grid, those replacement industries are not supporting Navajo workers the way coal did.

""Oil, gas, solar, wind -- we're not seeing the same type of benefit to workers within any other kind of energy,"" Curley said. ""And they're not getting that social mobility through coal work that we in the social sciences were able to demonstrate existed.""

On the morning of Aug. 24, as the clock ran down, the demolition team shouted out a five-minute warning, then a one-minute warning, followed by the shrill sound of a siren.

For activist Elouise Brown, the demolition was a long time coming.

""I felt chills come down my whole body,"" she said. ""I was telling my family, what a great way to start your morning. What a blessing.""

Coal mine electrician Christina Aspaas watched a video of the implosion later that day on social media.

""It just brought back memories,"" she said, as she wiped away tears. ""My childhood, my dad, my mom.""

Aspaas posted a few words online to honor the generations of Navajo workers who have labored in coal.

""We took them for granted,"" she said. ""I just wanted them to know that I remember you.""

The detonation and shock wave pushed spectators backward, and then, in slow motion, the columns seemed to fall, concrete dissolving into air.

It takes less than a minute to demolish smokestacks.

It will take years, maybe decades, for Navajo communities to come to terms with what they've gained and what's been lost."

The U.S. saw stunningly strong growth in jobs last month. Here's what to know,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140039/labor-market-jobs-economy-interest-rates,2024-10-04T17:19:53Z,"U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs in September -- more than forecasters had expected. Gains for July and August were also revised upward. Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images/Getty Images hide caption

As far as economic data goes, it was a bit of a stunner.

Economists had expected U.S. employers to have added about 150,000 jobs in September. Instead, they created more than a quarter-million jobs last month, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, according to a report Friday from the Labor Department.

Here are five things to know about Friday's surprisingly strong jobs report.

In total, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs in September. Restaurants, retailers and construction companies all added jobs at a healthy pace.

In addition, employment gains for July and August were revised upwards by a total of 72,000 jobs. That means that, on average, employers have added 186,000 jobs in each of the last three months.

While that's a slowdown from the first three months of the year, when employers added an average of 267,000 jobs a month, it's still a solid pace.

A separate report earlier this week also showed the number of job openings increased slightly in August to 8 million.

But not all industries are enjoying a boom. Manufacturing has been in a slump for most of the last two years. Factories cut 7,000 jobs in September, although factory employment is still higher than it was just before the pandemic, by 137,000 jobs. Most of September's job cuts were in the auto industry.

A survey of factory managers released this week by the Institute for Supply Management shows manufacturers are still struggling with high interest rates and uncertainty about the upcoming presidential election.

By contrast, another ISM survey shows continued growth in the much-larger services side of the economy -- things like restaurants and car repair.

In order to keep adding jobs, employers need workers. Fortunately, the U.S. labor force continues to grow.

Friday's report shows 150,000 people joined or re-joined the workforce last month. Much of this growth is driven by immigration. The foreign-born workforce has grown rapidly over the last year, adding 1.4 million workers, while the native-born workforce shrank by nearly 600,000 workers.

Were it not for immigrant workers, job growth might well have stalled. The decline of the native-born workforce is primarily the result of baby boomers retiring. By contrast, the share of people in their prime working years (25 to 54) is near an all-time high.

Average wages in September were up 4% from a year ago. That's likely more than enough to outpace rising prices, giving workers a real boost in their purchasing power.

Inflation data for September won't be released until next week, but in recent months, prices have been climbing at a modest pace -- 2.5% for the 12 months ending in August. In fact, wage gains have exceeded price hikes for fifteen months and September's increase probably extended that trend.

The Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates last month with an aggressive half-a-percentage-point move, signaling a turning point in its years-long battle against inflation.

But Fed chairman Jerome Powell says he and his colleagues may move more cautiously in the future, cutting rates by a quarter point at a time.

""This is not a committee that feels like it's in a hurry,"" Powell said Monday.

Friday's surprisingly strong jobs report is likely to reinforce that patient approach. According to CME's FedWatch tool, odds of a quarter-point rate cut at the next Fed meeting rose to nearly 95% after the jobs report was released, from 68% the day before.

Fed policymakers will get one more monthly jobs report before their next scheduled meeting in early November."
"In swing-state Wisconsin, new districts threaten the GOP hold on the Legislature",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5108996/wisconsin-election-voting-legislature,2024-10-04T16:50:56Z,"GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Smoke from portable grills filled the air with the smell of bratwurst on a recent Sunday in the parking lots that surround Lambeau Field.

People were gathered to watch the Green Bay Packers take on the rival Minnesota Vikings, but in a state and city where football is a staple of the culture, they were also there for the pregame tailgate and the experience of one of Wisconsin's premier gathering places.

In one of the crowded lots, the Packers Tailgate Band meandered its way through lawn chairs and folding tables full of food. Brass and woodwind instruments carried the tune while a makeshift drum set mounted to a stroller kept the time. When the band played ""Roll Out The Barrel,"" a Wisconsin polka staple, people got up from their seats and danced.

""It's probably like the best job I have,"" said Tim Kozlovski, the band's sousaphone player. ""It's just having fun with people and partying with them and getting them in the spirit for the game.""

Kozlovski said the Packers unify people in Wisconsin -- he calls it a ""good place in your heart."" And in an atmosphere like that, he said there are some things you just don't talk about, like politics.

""You gotta learn to keep that to yourself when you're trying to make people happy,"" he said.

Not everyone has that luxury in Green Bay, where for the first time in years, Lambeau Field and the surrounding community are part of a fierce campaign that could decide control of the Wisconsin Legislature. A couple of parking lots over, local Democrats are tailgating, hoping to unlock the political power they were granted when the state redrew its political maps and turned this once-safe GOP district competitive.

""I actually enjoy talking about politics,"" said Ryan Spaude, the Democratic candidate running to represent this area at the state Capitol in Madison. He's a local prosecutor. ""I enjoy having a respectful dialogue with other folks about politics. I also think we can do better than some of the yahoos that are down there in Madison right now.""

Spaude is well aware of the divided nature of his district. President Joe Biden would have won this district in 2020 -- former President Donald Trump would have carried it in 2016. He jokes that this district is as purple as some of the Minnesota Vikings jerseys in the crowd that day.

""Ninety-nine seats in the state Assembly,"" Spaude said. ""There's about a dozen that are like mine that could go either way. These seats will determine who gets the majority.""

When it comes to races for statewide office, Wisconsin has a well-earned reputation as a swing state. Four of the last six presidential contests have been decided by less than a percentage point.

But in races for the Legislature, it's been anything but competitive ever since 2011, when Republicans took control of state government and redrew the state's legislative district lines, cementing their power for years to come.

""There would be a couple competitive seats in the state Assembly every year, but the outcome of them was basically inconsequential,"" said John Johnson, a redistricting expert at Marquette University Law School. ""There was no chance that majority control of the chamber would change.""

The GOP used its majorities to shift Wisconsin's politics to the right. When Republican Scott Walker was in the governor's office, they famously passed laws that weakened unions in a state with deep ties to organized labor.

Even after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers took office, their legislative majorities effectively gave Republicans veto power. As neighboring states expanded Medicaid or legalized marijuana, the GOP was able to block Evers' plans that would have had Wisconsin join them.

This election, in this 50-50 district, the debate is different. Spaude said the number one issue he hears from voters is about the cost -of -living.

""The second issue is -- why can't you people work together? Just the gridlock you see,"" Spaude said.

Nearby, Patrick Buckley, Spaude's Republican opponent is also making the rounds. He's a small business owner and former police officer who currently chairs the board of Brown County, home to Green Bay.

""We get a lot of stuff done at the county,"" Buckley said. ""I'd like to take what I've learned there at the county to the state level. Because I think we need that there.""

Buckley said the new map created an opening for him because this new district had no incumbent. But he insists he hasn't really thought about how his race could tip the balance in the Legislature. When asked about the top three things he talks about with voters, Buckley has a clear answer.

""Economy, economy, economy,"" Buckley said. ""A lot of people are hurting out there, and we gotta figure out what we can do as government to give them some sort of relief.""

The idea that Wisconsin could be in this position seemed, just a few years ago, almost impossible. Even with Evers in the governor's office, the Legislature redrew Wisconsin's maps to make them even more powerful with the help of a then-conservative majority on Wisconsin's Supreme Court.

But everything changed in 2023 when voters flipped control of the court from conservative to liberal, and the new majority ordered new maps drawn

In an unexpected twist, the Republican-controlled Legislature chose maps that were drawn by Evers, making the political calculation that it was their least-worst option. In a brief speech before their vote, Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said the new maps would be ""very competitive,"" and the Legislature would be ""up for grabs.""

""We will have the ability to decide if we want to go toward the direction of Minnesota and Michigan,"" Vos said, referencing two states where Democrats control both the state Legislature and the governor's office.""Or [if] we want to stay in the direction that we're heading in Wisconsin, where we have the ability to have a lower tax burden, a lower regulatory touch, and still a historically good economy for Wisconsin. So I'm optimistic.""

This will be the first test of how that debate plays out in Wisconsin. As with many political issues, the answer could be complicated.

A few blocks away from Lambeau Field, Bud Hearley was watching the game with family and friends from the comfort of a one-car garage turned into a bar. Hearley, who lives in a nearby district, said there are too many extremes in politics, and he'd like to see more compromise.

""I'm looking for a little more give and take on both sides with the issues that they make so extreme,"" Hearley said. ""There's not enough middle.""

Hearly doesn't fit neatly into one box when it comes to the issues. He favors the legalization of marijuana and thinks women should have the right to abortion, with some limits. He's also a strong supporter of capitalism who is leery of government overreach. And he tends to vote for Republicans.

Back at the tailgating event, Democratic voter Denise Gaumer Hutchison concedes that Democrats may or may not win it all this year, but for the first time in years, she said they'll at least be able to force Republicans to have a dialog. That was never possible, she said, under the state's old maps.

""Those maps were not fair to the point that legislators wouldn't even try,"" Gaumer Hutchison said. ""They wouldn't even do doors. They wouldn't even come talk to people who might be of a different opinion because they didn't have to. Now they have to.""

It's not just Lambeau Field's Assembly seat that's up for grabs this year. The district next door is so close it would have been won by both Evers, a Democrat, and Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson two years ago. The surrounding Senate district could also flip and give Democrats a chance at winning that chamber in 2026.

Regardless of the outcome, there's already been a political sea change in Wisconsin, a state where the race for president is seemingly always up for grabs, and now the state Legislature is, too."
The October surprise: Harris is navigating a pair of them,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5137967/kamala-harris-hurricane-israel-iran-october-surprise,2024-10-04T09:09:19Z,"Vice President Harris hands out food to people at the Henry Brigham Community Center in Augusta, Ga., on Oct. 2, during a tour of hurricane damage in the area. Brendan Smialowski/AFP hide caption

With only a month left until Election Day, Vice President Harris is navigating a pair of external challenges in the month of October that pose risk to her campaign.

At home, there's the recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Helene -- including in the vital swing states of North Carolina and Georgia. And abroad, there's the real risk of escalating conflict in the Middle East.

The twin crises present a unique challenge for the Biden administration and, by extension, Harris -- who is a key part of that team. So her campaign and the White House are pulling out the stops to try to show voters they're on top of things, even as Harris pushes ahead on the campaign trail.

For Harris, there's the fear that these ""October surprises"" go sideways and she gets some blame. In a race this close, every vote matters.

But these kinds of high-profile crises also present an opportunity to demonstrate leadership, said Democratic political strategist Ian Russell.

""What she has to do, and what she is doing, is showing up and showing that she's engaged, showing that she's capable of stepping up to the challenges that the country and the world face and I think she's doing that very well,"" Russell said.

Harris took a break from the campaign on Wednesday to visit a Georgia neighborhood ravaged by Hurricane Helene where more than half of residents don't have power and many don't have running water.

""The president and I have been paying close attention from the beginning to what we need to do to make sure the federal resources hit the ground as quickly as possible,"" Harris said. ""That includes what was necessary to make sure that we provided direct federal assistance. And that work has been happening.""

President Biden also surveyed Asheville, N.C., where some of the most severe storm damage occurred, as he and Harris try to reassure voters in the critical state that their administration is up to the task. Harris' campaign has said she plans to tour storm damage in North Carolina soon, too.

Her opponent, former President Donald Trump, is slated to be it the state on Friday for a town hall.

The International Longshoremen's Association decision to go on strike on Tuesday had been another challenge for Harris, threatening to upend the economy heading into the election.

But on Thursday, the union dockworkers and port operators reached a tentative agreement on wages and agreed to extend their contract to Jan. 15. Harris and Biden had sided firmly with the union, and on Thursday Biden said both sides had acted ""patriotically"" to reopen the ports to ensure supplies were available for hurricane rebuilding efforts.

The Trump campaign is on the lookout for anything they can use against Harris in the closely contested race -- including the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

On Tuesday, Trump told his supporters that he was the person to take on Iran after it attacked Israel. ""We have a nonexistent president and a nonexistent vice president, who should be in charge, but nobody knows what's going on,"" Trump said.

Harris made sure to get out in front of cameras this week to reaffirm her support for Israel. ""As I have said, I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist militias,"" she said.

""And let us be clear: Iran is not only a threat to Israel; Iran is also a threat to American personnel in the region, American interests, and innocent civilians across the region who suffer at the hands of Iran-based and -backed terrorist proxies.""

How the White House, Harris and her campaign are able to navigate these ""October surprises"" is critical in a race this close, with only a month left.

""There's always going to be something that could go wrong at home or abroad,"" Russell said. ""And our leaders need to be able to step up and deliver while also being politicians."""
"Tensions are rising in the Middle East, but the rise in oil prices is muted - so far",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5137118/israel-iran-conflict-oil-price-risks,2024-10-03T23:50:09Z,"The sun shines behind a refinery in the South Pars Gas-Condensate field in Asalouyeh Seaport in Iran. Iran's oil and natural gas infrastructure is a possible target for Israeli attacks as tensions in the Mideast mount. Oil prices have risen as a result -- but remain relatively low, compared to most of 2024. SAEID ARABZADEH/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty hide caption

Global crude oil prices rose by more than 4% on Wednesday, surging after President Biden told reporters he was ""discussing"" the question of whether the U.S. would support an Israeli attack on Iranian oil facilities.

""We're discussing that,"" Biden said. ""I think that would be a little ... anyway.""

The cryptic remark sent oil up significantly - but even so, prices are not particularly high by historical standards.

Brent, the global benchmark for crude, closed at $77.62, still lower than it was for most of 2024.

""In the past, if we're talking about any kind of conflict in the Middle East that concerned Iran, prices would probably be above $100"" a barrel, said Amrita Sen, the founder of the energy research firm Energy Aspects. ""People were talking about, like, $120, $130 crude.""

Although tensions between Israel and Iran are currently as serious as they have been for decades, said Sen, ""the market has been completely brushing it aside.""

Why are markets so sanguine? The biggest reason, analysts say, is that the OPEC+ alliance could make a lot more oil -- if it wanted.

As a group, OPEC+, a coalition of oil-producing countries, has an incentive to make less oil; lower supply means higher prices. But individual countries have a strong incentive to produce more oil, which funds their national budgets. Balancing those two competing motivations is the central diplomatic challenge of the cartel.

And for a few years now, the group - and particularly Saudi Arabia - have cut production significantly, trying to hold up prices. That means OPEC+ could, hypothetically, easily make up for missing Iranian oil.

Rystad Energy, an energy research company, estimates that Iran produces about 4 million barrels of crude per day, and exports about 2 million. OPEC+'s spare capacity - the amount of oil the group could make, but is choosing not to - ""currently sits at more than 5 million barrels per day, which could be deployed relatively quickly,"" Claudio Galimberti, the chief economist of Rystad Energy, wrote in a research note.

Whether the alliance would choose to deploy that production is another question.

Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader with CIBC Private Wealth, notes that OPEC+ kept a tight lid on production even after Russia invaded Ukraine and prices spiked. She thinks this time, they'd choose to sell more barrels. Probably.

""Do we know that they will? Nope,"" she said. ""And they love to make surprises."" But the possibility is helping to keep prices from skyrocketing.

There are a few other reasons for the lack of alarm.

Oil prices slid dramatically in September, thanks in part to lower-than-expected demand from China's slowing economy. China has just launched a massive stimulus program, but it's not yet clear how much that will translate into oil consumption.

Meanwhile, the geopolitics of oil have shifted dramatically, shaped in large part by the shale boom, when new drilling methods like fracking unlocked vast oil reserves. The U.S. is now the largest oil producer in history, and a net oil exporter. (Crude exports have not been affected by the port strike this week on the East and Gulf coasts of the U.S.)

And because the U.S. is far less reliant on oil from the Mideast than it used to be, traders think Iran has less incentive to shut down the Strait of Hormuz than it did a few decades ago.

More than a quarter of the world's seaborne crude travels through that waterway, which lies between Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Any blockage would cause ""runaway"" oil prices, Galimberti of Rystad Energy says.

But it would cause less pain to the U.S. than it once would have - and more pain to Iran and its primary customer, China.

Sen thinks markets are currently underestimating how much this conflict could upend markets, and that if an attack on oil infrastructure does happen, the price response will be dramatic. ""This is the biggest short the market has ever had,"" she said.

Babin thinks the market's factoring in the risks just about right. After all, oil markets aren't waving off these risks entirely. Prices are up more than $6 this week, a significant jump. Babin notes in the options market, some traders are placing bets that would only pay off if prices spike more.

But overall, she said, when she looks at the price of oil, ""I see this as very measured: a market that's not panicking, not running away with itself. We're not at $90."""

The strike by tens of thousands of dockworkers on the East and Gulf Coasts has been called off, after the International Longshoremen's Association and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, representing ocean carriers and port operators, reached a tentative agreement on wages.

The two sides also agreed to extend the existing contract until January 15, 2025. In the meantime, they will return to the bargaining table to negotiate all other outstanding issues, including the union's demand on a ban on all automation at the ports.

The International Longshoremen's Association had been seeking $5-an-hour raises in each of the next six years, amounting to a 77% increase over six years. A day before the strike began, the U.S. Maritime Alliance had offered nearly 50% in raises.

The White House had downplayed the economic impact of a short strike, despite warnings from House Republicans and more than 170 industry groups that a work stoppage would have a devastating impact on supply chains and the broader economy.

President Biden repeatedly vowed to let the collective bargaining process play out.

""I don't believe in Taft-Hartley,"" President Biden told reporters days before the strike, citing the federal law that allows the President to call for an 80-day cooling off period when the nation's safety is at risk.

More than $2 billion worth of goods typically flow through these ports daily, from chemicals and clothing to bourbon and bananas. This week, dozens of container ships had started to line up, offshore, waiting for the strike to end.

The affected ports -- from Boston to Houston -- normally handle more than half of all cargo containers coming into the U.S., or about a million containers a month, as well as more than 300,000 containers heading out of the country, according to the freight-tracking company Vizion.

Effective immediately, all work will resume, the two sides said in a joint statement."
How Democrats are targeting red seats in blue New York to help win back the House,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5119744/democrats-flip-new-york-house-races,2024-10-03T09:07:01Z,"New York Gov.

Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in 2022 with the help of a mini red wave in the blue state of New York.

Democrats lost five seats in suburban districts, mostly around New York City, as many in the party were caught off guard. This year top Democrats across the state have joined forces to try to win those seats back, potentially netting the four seats they need to win back control of the chamber.

The GOP formula in 2022 was a barrage of ads and attacks on Democrats on crime, immigration and border security. The targeted messaging energized the Republican base and depressed Democratic turnout.

Party leaders responded this year with an effort modeled on more traditional battleground states will help turn things around for them this cycle with both resources and a stepped up ground game.

New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand told NPR she realized the need for the coordinated effort when she asked what candidates were doing in the week heading into the 2022 midterms and got a puzzling answer.

""There were [check] no big rallies. There was no organized canvassing, there was no coordination at all amongst local candidates and House candidates,"" Gillibrand said.

Kathy Hochul, then the Democratic candidate for governor, was being attacked by her GOP opponent Lee Zeldin about rising crime rates and border security. Gillibrand says tens of millions of dollars in negative ads had a big impact on Democratic voters in suburban districts around New York City.

""We had the worst voter turnout in 10 years,"" Gillibrand said. Hochul won, but the wave of House losses caused Gillibrand to reach out to Democrats in Wisconsin -- a perennial battleground state -- to come up with a 2024 strategy.

""So the day after the election I said to my chief of staff: 'We have to do something differently. Let's create the first-ever coordinated campaign for New York.'""

Now, Hochul says the coordinated campaign is allowing Democrats to connect with voters in a way that hasn't been done before.

""We're making unprecedented investments, rebuilding Party infrastructure, and turning out voters to elect Democrats and flip the House majority in November,"" she said in a statement to NPR.

Gillibrand, Hochul, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and state party leaders have opened 40 offices in seven House districts and hired 100 full-time staffers. Republicans have just five similar ""battle station"" offices.

Democrats linked state and local party operations. That effort has allowed them to make over 2 million contacts with voters between knocking on doors and phone calls, according to a spokeswoman for Hochul.

The strategy focuses on a more sophisticated get-out-the-vote effort, but it also includes going on offense on the issues that hurt the party the most two years ago -- crime and immigration.

Gillibrand points to her first ad as an example. She says it lists ""what I've done personally to make New York safer"" -- and touts her work on addressing fentanyl and illegal guns. Her third ad focuses on reproductive rights.

The move to lean in on crime and border issues follows the blueprint Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi used in February, to win a special election of a seat previously held by GOP Rep. George Santos. Suozzi emphasized a bipartisan immigration reform overhaul proposal, and effectively flipped the script on an issue that has traditionally put Democratic candidates on defense. Party strategists say his message is a good model in other districts in the state.

But Republicans say they still have the upper hand when it comes to the issues that got them elected in the first place.

Long Island Republican Nick LaLota is one of the five House freshmen elected in 2022. LaLota says his party will likely be outspent this cycle but says voters trust the GOP on the core issues.

""Suburban New Yorkers want two big things: a secure border and public safety and a better economy and less inflation. While they have a lot of money in campaign dollars and a lot of field offices and volunteers, their deficit is on policy solutions to those two big areas.""

New York isn't a presidential battleground but LaLota says GOP nominee Donald Trump knows New York is crucial in the battle for the House. He had a rally last month. He told NPR Trump knows his campaign needs to keep House Republican seats in suburban New York.

""His presence there demonstrates that he wants a governing Republican majority to give him the policy he needs from Congress when he returns to the White House.""

Marc Molinaro is another freshman GOP lawmaker whose district stretches from the Hudson Valley to the Finger Lakes. He says House Republicans are a check on an otherwise blue state.

""The people I represent want a balanced approach to government. They know that single-party rule in New York has led to the highest taxes of any people in the country, crime and an open border, Molinaro said.

But ultimately, taxes may prove the decisive issue in these New York contests. Trump's 2017 tax bill capped a popular state and local tax break called SALT, effectively levying an increase on many New York homeowners. Republicans were pleased that Trump stressed at his New York rally that he'll revive it.

""I will cut taxes for families, small businesses and workers including restoring the SALT deduction,"" Trump vowed at his Uniondale rally.

LaLota said that public pledge helps make the case to other GOP lawmakers as they craft a possible tax bill when many of the Trump tax provisions expire in 2025. ""Way to put this on the table -- this is what suburban constituents in blue states want,"" LaLota said.

Molinaro says the GOP has to follow through on that promise.

""If we really mean to provide meaningful tax relief to middle-class families, that's got to include reestablishing the SALT deduction.""

Jeffries vows Democrats will bring back the tax break, and calls out Republicans having it both ways on the tax break.

""They were the arsonists who burned down the state and local tax deduction and they have no credibility in trying to pretend right now they will be the firefighters.""

Democrats argue that Trump will be a factor in the race, and that the GOP lawmakers' decision to stand with Trump at his recent rally and vote in mostly lockstep on legislation championed by hardline House Republicans will hurt them with independents and Democrats in New York.

But several GOP strategists familiar with the campaigns in these districts stress that these incumbents have worked to create their own brands, and some have made a point to call out some extreme GOP colleagues in the House.

Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, another Long Island GOP lawmaker Democrats are targeting, faces a challenge with his own personal issues taking front and center in recent weeks. The New York Times reported that he put his mistress and the daughter of fiancee on his office payroll, something not allowed by House ethics rules, and a possible campaign finance violation. D'Esposito argues he didn't do anything improper and that the story was a political attack.

Republicans hope to link their Democratic challengers to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who was recently indicted on bribery and fraud charges. Lawmakers say his high profile case helps the GOP make their case against electing more Democrats to the House, but challengers in many of these House districts have called on Adams to resign.

Gillibrand waves off Adams as a factor in November House races. She says Democrats this year learned their lesson about engaging voters earlier on liabilities -- like crime -- and this new campaign focuses on the message and mechanics to get their supporters out to vote.

""Last cycle people felt depressed. This is about what we've accomplished, what we're actually doing to address their number one concern."""
"In a climate milestone, the UK - 1st to harness coal power - is among 1st to quit it",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5133426/uk-quits-coal-climate-change,2024-10-02T21:45:52Z,"RATCLIFFE-ON-SOAR, England - When the coal-fired turbines at this sprawling power plant north of London went silent this week, the skies above its eight giant steam stacks finally cleared - and Britain became the world's first major economy to quit coal power.

It's a milestone for the country that was first to harness the dirty fuel, in the 19th century. Coal powered the Industrial Revolution and the expansion of the British Empire. At the height of its reliance on coal, in the 1950s, about 96% of the United Kingdom's electricity came from burning it.

That fell to zero Monday evening, when the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power plant, in the English Midlands, shut off its turbines after 57 years. It was the country's last coal-fired plant.

""This is the first time in 142 years that there's no coal in the U.K. electricity system,"" says Michael Lewis, CEO of Uniper, the German company that runs the plant. ""It's a big, big moment in industrial history. That history can continue with zero carbon.""

It's also a milestone in the effort to tackle climate change. Burning coal releases carbon dioxide, and is a major driver of global warming. A handful of smaller countries have already phased out coal power, but Britain is first among the Group of Seven advanced economies to do so. The entire G7 has pledged to follow suit by 2035.

The U.K. has turned to cheaper and cleaner power sources, including natural gas but also a major expansion of offshore wind and solar farms. Meanwhile, regulations targeting air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions have made burning coal increasingly uneconomical.

In its heyday, Ratcliffe-on-Soar received more than 20 trainloads of coal per day, according to Uniper. That's enough to power two million homes. (Or in British terms, a billion cups of tea a day.)

Decommissioning will take two years; most of the plant's 170 employees are being reallocated. There were a few tears, Lewis said. The longest-serving employee had worked at the plant for nearly 50 years.

""We need to get off coal. We need to address climate change targets,"" Lewis told NPR. ""But at the same time, it's the end of an era.""

The Romans found coal in western England as early as the third century, according to the British Geological Survey. Mining began in earnest in the 1600s across England, Scotland and Wales.

Around the turn of the 17th century, the coal-powered steam engine was invented in Britain, powering industry. In the early 19th century, a British engineer invented the coal-fired locomotive, speeding commerce across the country and its colonies in South Asia and Africa.

Then in 1882, Thomas Edison's company opened Britain's first coal-fired power plant in London.

Since then, British coal plants have burned 5 billion tons of coal, emitting more than 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide. That's according to an analysis by the British publication Carbon Brief, which says the U.K.'s long coal habit produced more carbon emissions than most countries have ever produced from all sources - making it one of the largest historical contributors to climate change.

Those emissions typically stay in the atmosphere for decades or centuries.

By the 1950s, British coal use peaked, and so did pollution. Cities were shrouded in ""pea soup"" - a green toxic haze that included soot and sulfur dioxide from factory furnaces and residential coal fireplaces. The word ""smog"" was coined in London.

In the so-called Great Smog of 1952, at least 4,000 people died in the span of four days. It was so toxic, cows were said to have choked to death in fields.

That health emergency ultimately changed the economics of coal.

""In the 1950s, when the smog was killing thousands of people in London, the clean air laws came in, and then from the 1990s, relatively cleaner and cheaper gas began edging coal out,"" says Sepi Golzari-Munro, a Scotland-based climate and energy analyst. ""Now we see that transition happening again, with renewables.""

In part, Britain got lucky: In the 1960s, it discovered natural gas - a cheaper, relatively cleaner-burning fuel - in the North Sea. Last year, about a third of U.K. electricity came from gas.

In recent decades, the U.K. has also invested in a massive expansion of renewable energy, especially offshore wind. Britain is now the world's second-largest offshore wind market, after China. Last year, offshore wind generated 17% of the nation's electricity, according to the Crown Estate, which manages wind farms on royal land.

""We were able to take the onshore wind industry and move it offshore, where you get much higher wind speeds, and you can put in bigger turbines, and bigger wind farms,"" says Bryony Worthington, an environmental campaigner now in the House of Lords. Worthington helped write the country's Climate Change Act of 2008, which set national targets for the reduction of carbon emissions.

Britain also operates five nuclear power plants. The government plans to quadruple nuclear capacity by 2050.

Unlike the United States, where a number of lawmakers question the scientific consensus that human activity is driving global warming, there's widespread, cross-party consensus in the U.K. in favor of this clean energy transition, and environmental regulation.

""In the early 2000s, we were writing the world's first set of comprehensive laws on climate change that created legally binding carbon budgets,"" Worthington recalls. Those laws limited how much particulate matter coal stations could emit, banned new coal stations from being built, and taxed coal plants for their pollution, she notes.

Looking ahead, the government aims to eliminate natural gas from the U.K. power grid by 2030, and cut carbon emissions entirely by 2050.

Altogether, these laws and taxes mean it's no longer economical to mine British coal, or burn it. In 2015, lawmakers identified the last day of coal power a decade in advance, and then moved it up by a year - a relatively rapid phaseout that could be a model for other countries.

This energy transition has been aided by globalization and deindustrialization. Since the 1970s, the U.K has moved away from manufacturing, to a service economy. This country no longer runs as many big factories.

On Monday night, at a pub not far from the Ratcliffe-on-Soar smoke stacks, former workers raised a pint to the past. But the nostalgia only goes so far.

""It's good it's closing down, because of all the rubbish that was coming out into the atmosphere,"" says 71-year-old Simon Humble. ""When I worked there, even after a shower, you'd sneeze and all the coal dust was coming out of your nose.""

He says he's looking forward to seeing the plant's eight giant cooling towers demolished.

""I imagine they'll dynamite them down to the ground,"" he says. ""Now that'll be something to see."""
Who is the real JD Vance? And 4 other takeaways from the vice-presidential debate,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/g-s1-25869/vp-debate-tim-walz-jd-vance-takeaways,2024-10-02T09:03:51Z,"Republican vice presidential candidate, Sen. JD Vance, and Democratic vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, participate in a debate at the CBS Broadcast Center on Oct. 1, 2024 in New York City. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption

Partisans on both sides will have arguments for why their guy did well at certain times and not as well at others in the first and only vice-presidential debate Tuesday night between Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz.

This debate likely will not move the needle at all in this presidential campaign, because -- first and foremost -- no one votes for the vice-presidential pick. After all, the most important rule of being a running mate is, ""First, do no harm.""

Short of a major mistake, VPs are unlikely to make a fundamental difference in the race. And there wasn't one of those Tuesday night.

But there were five takeaways from an interesting night:

On style, Vance was clearly more polished than Walz, and he likely accomplished what he sought out to do -- appear more rational and agreeable than Trump and, frankly, himself. But there's a real question about who the real Vance is. He was once a Trump critic, who became one of Trump's biggest cheerleaders. Since that transformation, he's gotten a reputation as a hard-charging MAGA partisan willing to take on all comers, known for making controversial statements, whether about ""childless cat ladies,"" not caring what happens to Ukraine ""one way or another"" or propagating false claims about immigrants eating pets.

But with his popularity lower than any vice-presidential running mate in modern history, another Vance showed up Tuesday night -- one largely respectful of his opponent. Vance even thanked the ""folks at CBS,"" a far cry from the booing that takes place on the campaign trail at his rallies when a reporter asks a question.

Vance also did a lot of laundering of Trump's positions, especially on health care, child care and Jan. 6. Because Republicans have an inherent advantage on the cost of living in this election, his strongest moments were when he questioned why Harris hasn't brought down prices already as part of the administration and implemented some of the things she's promising to do if elected president.

Some will see Vance's performance Tuesday night as a more focused version of Trump. Others will see him as something of a chameleon.

Walz got off to a shaky start. He was asked at the beginning about foreign policy, which is clearly not his strong suit. He had some awkward pauses and misspoke (saying he's ""friends with school shooters,"" for example, when he appeared to mean families of victims of school shootings).

Walz seemed to find his footing, though, on domestic issues, like dealing with hurricanes, climate change, abortion rights and, somewhat surprisingly, in an exchange on immigration, which is generally one of the weaker areas for Democrats. Walz effectively painted Trump as uninterested in solving the problem of immigration because he blocked a bipartisan border security bill. Walz also aimed to isolate Trump as the problem -- even saying he thinks Vance wants to find a solution to the issue. Vance's comeback was to say that Harris is inauthentic and a newcomer to a harder line on immigration. Both campaigns will be happy with those lines of attack.

In addition to foreign policy, Walz was weakest in his response to questions about his time in China. Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests, which took place in the spring of 1989. Minnesota Public Radio and others have reported that he didn't actually travel there until later in the summer.

Instead of directly saying he misspoke, Walz gave a meandering answer that included him saying, ""I will talk a lot,"" which could imply you can't believe everything he says.

Walz's best moments of the night came when talking about Jan. 6 and the 2020 presidential election. At one point, Walz asked Vance if Trump had lost the 2020 election. Vance deflected and claimed instead that the real threat to democracy was ""censorship.""

""That's a damning non-answer,"" Walz retorted.

It was something of a stunning admission: Vance dismissed the idea that experts should be trusted.

That posture mirrors how the right more broadly in the last decade of American politics has moved away from believing experts. Democrats have had their own issues with being perceived as elitist and talking down to working-class voters. Republicans, like Trump, have exploited that.

In place of trusting traditional sources of knowledge, Trump has played to cultural grievance, telling people there are simple solutions to complex problems -- like suggesting tariffs will pay for child care, which they will not. Vance embraces this line of thinking and says voters should trust Trump over others. Giving the example of conventional wisdom about the global economy, Vance said, ""For the first time in a generation, Donald Trump had the wisdom and the courage to say to that bipartisan consensus, 'We're not doing it anymore.' ""

That exposes one of the biggest issues in America: People don't agree on a shared set of facts. People have their own ideologies and are finding others who affirm what they believe -- whether Trump or posts on social media -- rather than having their minds changed by contrary evidence.

Sowing distrust in experts lends more credence to conspiracy and makes it harder to bridge divides.

Moderators can only fit so much into a debate, but there were some things that have gotten attention in this campaign that weren't brought up -- some of which involve the vice presidential candidates directly.

Vance wasn't asked, for example, about his 2021 comments about ""childless cat ladies"" that have drawn so much controversy.

Walz didn't have to account for his military record timeline or his misstatements on carrying weapons of war. Vance wasn't asked about his ""stolen valor"" accusations about Walz's service, either.

Neither candidate was asked about Ukraine, where these two campaigns have fundamentally different views, and Vance, in particular, has been a vocal critic of U.S. aid for Ukraine.

Strikingly, there has been no substantive discussion -- in this debate or the two presidential debates -- about Trump's handling of the COVID pandemic.

With the praise from the right of Vance's performance, it makes you wonder if Trump might be reconsidering another debate with Harris.

Does Trump want to let Vance have the last word? Does he want people questioning if Vance is actually a better debater and a more focused candidate?

How the debate plays in conservative circles -- and how much praise Vance gets -- might make the decision for Trump in the end."

This story first appeared in the NPR Network's live blog of the 2024 vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz. For the latest on the campaign, head to NPR's Elections page.

Vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz faced off onstage in New York Tuesday for what is the last scheduled debate of election season.

The tone was largely collegial -- in contrast to much of the campaign so far -- as the two Midwestern men tackled issues like the economy, immigration and health care.

NPR reporters fact-checked the candidates' claims in real time. Here's what they found:

VANCE: ""If you believe [that carbon emissions drive climate change], what would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America ... Unfortunately, Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite.

Under the Biden-Harris administration, the U.S. produced a record amount of oil last year -- averaging 12.9 million barrels per day. That eclipsed the previous record of 12.3 million barrels per day, set under former President Donald Trump in 2019.

Last year was also a record year for domestic production of natural gas. Much of the domestic boom in oil and gas production is the result of hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking"" techniques. While campaigning for president in 2019, Kamala Harris said she would ban fracking, but she changed course when she joined the Biden administration.

In addition to record oil and gas production, the Biden-Harris administration has also coincided with rapid growth of solar and wind power. Meanwhile, coal has declined as a source of electricity.

-- NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley

MODERATOR: ""[Gov. Walz] mentioned that President Trump has called climate change a hoax. Do you agree? ""

VANCE: ""Look, what the president has said is that if the Democrats, in particular Kamala Harris and her leadership, if they really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America, and that's not what they're doing.""

VANCE: ""I've noticed some of our Democratic friends talking a lot about ... this idea that carbon emissions drives all the climate change. Let's just say that's true, just for the sake of argument.""

Former President Trump has, in fact, repeatedly called climate change a hoax and made light of its effects.

His rhetoric on climate change has shifted over the years, with the former president at times saying he believed the issue was real but did not know if it was driven by human activity.

Scientists agree that the climate is changing, and that change is being driven by human activity, specifically burning fossil fuels which increases carbon emissions.

-- NPR producer Lexie Schapitl

VANCE: ""And then I think you make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers. A lot of people will go home if they can't work for less than minimum wage in our own country, and by the way, that will be really good for our workers who just want to earn a fair wage for doing a good day's work.""

As the vice presidential candidates discuss how to address concerns over immigration, increased migration -- both legal and illegal -- has helped to grow the labor force in recent years, allowing employers to keep adding jobs at a rapid clip without putting much upward pressure on prices.

Over the last 12 months, for example, the foreign-born workforce has grown by nearly 1.5 million people while the native-born workforce has shrunk by 768,000 people -- mostly due to retirements, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Were it not for the influx of immigrant workers, the U.S. economy would likely be shrinking.

They do not appear to be displacing native-born workers.

The share of working-age men who were in the workforce in August was 89.5% -- higher than all but one month during the Trump administration. The share of working-age women who were in the workforce last month was the highest ever -- 78.4%.

-- NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley

VANCE: ""A lot of fentanyl is coming into our country ... Kamala Harris let fentanyl into our communities at record levels.""

Once again we heard that undocumented immigrants are bringing fentanyl into the country -- a myth which has been debunked.

In reality, close to 90% of illicit fentanyl is seized at official border crossings. Immigration authorities say nearly all of that is smuggled by people who are legally authorized to cross the border, and more than half by U.S. citizens. Virtually none is seized from migrants seeking asylum.

Also, NPR has reported that the U.S. is currently seeing significantly less fentanyl in circulation and fewer overdoses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that fentanyl-related deaths dropped by roughly 10% last year.

-- NPR immigration correspondent Jasmine Garsd

VANCE: ""If you look at what was so different about Donald Trump's tax cuts, even from previous Republican tax cut plans, is that a lot of those resources went to giving more take-home pay to middle class and working class Americans. It was passed in 2017 and you saw an American economic boom unlike we've seen in a generation this country.""

Despite Trump's frequent claims to the contrary, the 2017 tax cut was not the largest in U.S. history. However, it was big enough to blow a large hole in the federal budget. Tax revenues as a share of GDP dropped to 16.3% in the year after the tax cut was passed, down from 17.1% the year before and an average of 17.7% over the past 40 years. Even though federal spending also declined as a share of GDP in 2018, the deficit topped $785 billion that year, and approached a trillion dollars in 2019 -- the year before the pandemic.

According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, more than half the savings from the 2017 tax cut went to the top 10% of earners, and more than a quarter went to the top 1%.

Large parts of the 2017 tax cut are due to expire next year. Trump has proposed extending all of them, while also calling for an additional cut in the corporate tax rate. Harris has proposed extending the tax cuts for everyone making less than $400,000 a year (97% of the population) while raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy.

While Harris' tax proposals are similar to those made by President Biden, her plan differs from the president's in some respects. For example, she called for a 28% tax on millionaires' investment income -- which is lower than the 39.6% rate Biden has proposed.

Under the Biden-Harris administration, the IRS has also beefed up tax enforcement to ensure that wealthier people and businesses pay what they owe. GOP lawmakers have criticized that effort, and it could be reversed in a second Trump administration.

-- NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley

VANCE: ""I think you can make a really good argument that [Trump] salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came about. ... Donald Trump could have destroyed the program -- instead, he worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that Americans had access to affordable care.""

During his presidency, Trump undermined the Affordable Care Act in many ways -- for instance, by slashing funding for advertising and free ""navigators"" who help people sign up for a health insurance plan on HealthCare.gov. And rather than deciding to ""save"" the ACA, he tried hard to get Congress to repeal it, and failed.

The Biden administration has reversed course from Trump's management of the Affordable Care Act. Increased subsidies have made premiums more affordable in the marketplaces, and enrollment has surged. The uninsurance rate has dropped to its lowest point ever during the Biden administration.

The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010 and is entrenched in the health care system. Republicans successfully ran against Obamacare for about a decade, but it has faded as a campaign issue this year.

-- NPR health policy correspondent Selena Simmons-Duffin

MODERATOR: ""Senator, you have not yet explained how you would protect people with preexisting conditions or laid out that plan.""

JD VANCE: ""Look, we currently have laws and regulations in place right now that protect people with preexisting conditions. We want to keep those regulations in place, but we also want to make the health insurance marketplace function a little bit better.""

Vance was asked about comments he's made recently, trying to fill in the details of Trump's comments during the presidential debate that he had the ""concepts of a plan"" when it comes to replacing the Affordable Care Act. (The Harris-Walz campaign needled the Republican ticket ahead of the debate about not having anything clearer to say on health policy.)

But when Vance refers to ""laws and regulations in place"" protecting people with preexisting conditions, those laws and regulations are the Affordable Care Act.

For context: Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies could deny coverage or charge higher premiums when people had ""preexisting conditions,"" which could be anything from diabetes or cancer to acne or back problems. The ACA made that illegal, and now everyone has to be covered and their premiums are based on their income, not how healthy they are.

Risk pools previously could essentially sort people into a ""healthy"" bucket, where you pay less for a health plan, and ""sick"" bucket, where you pay more or can't get coverage at all. The ACA requires insurance companies to take all people into the risk pool.

Health policy experts across the political spectrum say it's a terrible idea to go back to pre-ACA policies.

Of Vance's idea, conservative health policy expert Joe Antos told Roll Call last week, it ""doesn't make any sense,"" adding, ""you need some healthy people in there with some sick people, otherwise you're going to have a financially unsustainable system.""

Cynthia Cox of KFF, a nonpartisan research group, tweeted a thread enumerating how perilous things were when insurance companies could consider your ""preexisting conditions"" when deciding what coverage to offer you, if any.

""Cops, firefighters, miners, offshore drillers and pro athletes were denied plans,"" she wrote, because their jobs made some insurers think they were too risky to cover. And if your kid had more than three ear infections in the previous year, that could be grounds for denial, too.

-- NPR health policy correspondent Selena Simmons-Duffin

VANCE: ""Thanks to Kamala Harris's open border, we've seen a massive influx in the number of illegal guns run by the Mexican drug cartel.""

Actually, there is long standing evidence showing the gun smuggling route is going in the opposite direction.

Most recently, the Mexican Attorney General of the Republic and the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) made an effort to trace the origin and number of firearms in Mexico coming from or through the United States. Mexico's Secretariat of Foreign Relations found that 70-90% of traced firearms originated from and passed through the U.S. The ATF and U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated a lower rate of 68%.

-- NPR immigration correspondent Jasmine Garsd

VANCE: ""Another driver of the gun violence epidemic ... is the terrible gun violence problem in a lot of our big cities, and this is why we have to empower law enforcement to arrest the bad guys, put them away, and take gun offenders off the streets.""

Of course, crime rates vary by city, but overall across the country, violent crime dropped nationwide in 2023, with murder falling by around 10% from the year before, according to data released just last week from the FBI. More than 16,000 law enforcement agencies sent their crime data to the FBI, covering around 94% of the country's population.

This year-end data, released each fall by the FBI, is the most complete look at national crime rates we have, but it is a little dated. Still, according to preliminary FBI data, violent crime has continued to drop nationwide in the first half of 2024 compared to the first half of 2023.

MODERATOR: ""Governor, you said you were in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests 1989, but Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are reporting that you actually didn't travel to Asia until August of that year. Can you explain that discrepancy?""

WALZ: ""I've not been perfect, and I'm a knucklehead at times ... I got there that summer and misspoke on this.""

Walz has a long relationship with China and claimed he'd been there ""about 30"" or ""dozens"" of times, but after APM Reports questioned how that was possible, his campaign acknowledged the real number of trips from the U.S. to China was ""closer to 15.""

Walz lived in China for about a year, teaching in the southern city of Foshan. His stint with the nonprofit organization WorldTeach started in the summer of 1989, just two months after the Tiananmen Square massacre.

Starting in 1993, he led annual summer trips to China for students in the Nebraska and Minnesota high schools where he taught.

Walz also once described being in Hong Kong in May 1989, during the student uprising that culminated in the Tiananmen Square massacre, the reporting from APM Reports notes -- an assertion that is belied by newspaper accounts at the time."
VP debate: JD Vance and Tim Walz face off tonight. Here's how to watch and when,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/live-updates/jd-vance-tim-walz-debate-2024,2024-10-01T21:58:31Z,"One question likely on the minds of many people watching tonight's faceoff: Who is this for?

National polls show a tight race between Trump and Harris, suggesting the race will come down to voters in a handful of swing states -- depending on who they vote for or whether they vote at all.

And as NPR's Domenico Montanaro reports, only a ""tiny slice"" of the electorate -- from 6% to the low teens -- is considered persuadable.

In NPR's own polling, there have been nearly four dozen undecided voters in the last four months who gave their permission to be contacted.

Montanaro spoke with 10 of them in the days after the Harris-Trump debate, and detailed their reflections here.

""The debate was important for Harris. Most who watched said she performed better than Trump. They were not all moved to vote for her as a result, but four who seemed to need a degree of reassurance about Harris are now voting for her or leaning Harris' direction after the debate.

And while undecided voters often have unique reasons for what influences their votes, there was a clear gender divide. All four who say they are now voting for or leaning toward Harris are women. That also reflects the wide gender gap seen in polls between the candidates.

The other six -- one woman and five men -- were a mix. Five said they likely won't be voting for Harris, most citing the economy or immigration as reasons. One other said he is still truly undecided, but said prices are a major concern.

Two are leaning toward Trump; another said she aligns more with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; a self-described progressive said he doesn't like Harris' stance on the war in Gaza; and one other, a conservative, said he might not vote at all.""

One thing the group had in common? Many did not want their names used, citing security concerns in the current political climate."

Union dockworkers along East Coast and Gulf Coast ports began striking early today, halting the movement of more than $2 billion worth of goods, including cars, clothing, paper, farm machinery and much more. Picketing started just after midnight after talks between the International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance, representing ocean carriers and port operators, failed to result in a new contract. The strike, which impacts work at 14 ports, has two major sticking points: wages and automation. Trade groups warned President Biden that an extended strike would have dire consequences for the U.S. economy.

"In Nevada, Latinos could pick the next president. They aren't sold on either candidate",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25479/nevada-latino-voters-trump-harris-culinary-union,2024-10-01T12:02:30Z,"LAS VEGAS -- Walking out of a grocery store in a Latino neighborhood on the east side of the city, Flor Elena Fernandez says she's wrestling with who to vote for in this year's election.

The 36-year old housekeeping manager worries about the cost of food. She worries about the cost of living.

""We're all waiting for what is going to happen, especially us Hispanics, says Fernandez, who is originally from Cuba. ""The economy is bad. We're waiting to see what happens.""

Her one and a half year old son, dressed in a red Flash superhero shirt is riding in the cart. Her mom also walks along, smiling knowingly.

Flor Maria Parra, Fernandez' mother, explains that she's already decided.

""Yes, for Kamala Harris,"" Parra, explains. ""At least with Hispanics, she defends the Hispanics a lot, while Trump throws them out.""

Around 1 in 5 voters in the Silver State are Latino. Now, that's more political power than the group has in almost any of the other 7 key states in the electoral college count.

President Biden barely eked out a victory in Nevada, in part by winning 60% of the Latino vote, but polls suggest Trump has stronger Latino support than previous Republican campaigns.

It's here in Las Vegas where Trump unveiled his plan to eliminate taxes on tips, seen as a direct pitch largely to Latino workers who make up the backbone of the state's casino and hospitality industry.

Looking to regain their advantage, the Harris campaign is spending $3 million in Spanish-language radio this month, which it says is the largest investment in Hispanic media ever.

The Democrats have also launched their not-so-secret weapon in the state -- an army of service workers from the Culinary Workers Union who have been helping deliver the party victories for several elections.

Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Workers Union, admits Nevada, ""to be honest, should be Trump territory.""

""At the end of the day, we're competitive, and we outwork everybody,"" he said, adding, ""there's a pathway to win if we really can get workers talking to workers face to face at the doors.""

That's exactly what they do. Thousands of cooks and servers and room cleaners will take a leave of absence to knock on doors, six days a week for Harris and the Democrats. The Culinary Union will help cover their missed wages as they undertake this different kind of work.

The Trump campaign is also increasing its efforts to reach Latino voters. In Nevada, it's hosting Spanish phone banking sessions, postcard writing nights and trainings for local volunteers.

Tony Fabrizio, Trump's lead pollster, argues that Harris' team is spending so much money on Latinos because they've lost so much ground within the community, especially in Nevada and Arizona.

""I don't care whose national poll you look at -- even yours, from NPR -- it is really very clear that she is underperforming with Hispanics, not only nationally, but in these two key states,"" Fabrizio said.

Back at the supermarket, views of Trump are widely mixed. Alfredo Alcasar is a maintenance worker. He says he doesn't like how Trump talks about Latinos.

""I don't like to be minimized. Trump always minimizes us, he said. ""And why, if we've done nothing bad? All we've done is try to contribute to the country as best we can.""

But Pedro Fernandez, a carpenter -- who is not related to Flor Elena and her mom -- is less worried about Trump's rhetoric and more concerned about inflation and the cost of living.

""We've been here 18 years, and when Trump was in power, the economy was stronger,"" he said.

As for Flor Elena Fernandez, she's torn. It will be her first time voting after recently becoming a citizen, and she wants to make the right choice. She agrees the economy is bad, but she also sees her mother's perspective.

""We know that she has a plan, but we don't know how good it will be,"" Fernandez says of Harris."

In a bustling restaurant in northwest Atlanta, roughly a dozen young Republicans are surrounded by pitchers, chips and salsa, chatting and laughing as they fill out postcards.

""Anybody need a drink?"" calls Winslow Jones, the president of Atlanta Young Republicans.

The group has met for what they're calling Margaritas and Mailers, and today they are handwriting postcards asking for support for two down-ballot GOP candidates running in nearby districts.

""Margaritas help,"" Jones laughs. ""This is an environment where people can come and connect with likeminded people.""

As election day nears, all eyes are once again on Georgia and its 16 electoral votes. And this time, one essential voting bloc is getting a lot of attention: millennials and Gen Z.

Voters under 44 years old will make up about half the eligible voting population in the U.S. this fall, according to population projections from the U.S. Census Bureau. NPR traveled to Atlanta to see how different groups of young organizers are approaching this moment.

At the Young Republican meet-up, Jones points to the intellectual diversity among its members, including the varying opinions on former President Donald Trump.

""I think across the board there can be mixed feelings about Trump,"" she says. ""But I think what we're all united on is this is a much bigger picture here that we need to look at ... issues that are affecting people at large.""

Jones says the issues resonating with younger conservatives like herself include the economy, the U.S.-Mexico border and crime.

Nearby, Jacquelyn Harn is also busy writing postcards. She's the chairwoman of the statewide group, Young Republicans of Georgia.

""We're excited for a change,"" Harn says when asked about Trump's 2024 run. ""We want the life that we had four years ago when President Trump was president. And his policies -- his conservative policies -- we need those back, and we want those to be able to achieve our version of the American dream again.""

Harn says young people have been hit hard by the economy and inflation. She points to housing and the fact that she can't afford to buy a house because she's ""paying rent out the wazoo every month."" And she doesn't see that changing if Kamala Harris wins.

""She's saying day one, she's going to fix the housing crisis and the pricing and inflation,"" Harn says. ""She's had three-and-a-half years to do that, so no one's buying it.""

Yet while younger Republicans in Atlanta are mobilizing, young conservatives in general are becoming increasingly rare, says Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University.

""Since the Obama years, the youth vote really has sided with the Democratic presidential candidate more often than not,"" Swint told NPR. ""The only question has been, what's the size of that turnout for the Democratic candidate?""

Back at the Margaritas and Mailers event, NPR asks Harn if it's harder for Republican groups to fire up younger voters who may be watching Harris, who is nearly 20 years younger than Trump and has landed high-profile endorsements likely to resonate with young people, like from Taylor Swift.

Harn says she isn't fazed: ""Taylor Swift is a billionaire who doesn't have to worry about how much groceries costs ... you can't tell me she relates to the average person around this table tonight. So if the best they can do is a celebrity endorsement that is not relatable at all, I don't see what they're doing.""

In the two months since President Biden stepped aside and Harris took the top of the ticket, Democratic groups in Georgia have shifted their campaigning into overdrive.

""Things just got crazy out of nowhere,"" says Davante Jennings, the president of Young Democrats of Georgia. ""Like, more people involved, more support, more work, more canvassing, more text banking. But it's good.""

When we meet Jennings recently at the Atlanta headquarters of the Harris-Walz campaign, he is joined by a dozen 20-somethings all typing on laptops set up on white folding tables, surrounded by pizza boxes. At the front of the room, a screen shows dozens more joining via Zoom. This is a joint text banking event, co-hosted by Young Democrats of Georgia, Men4Choice and Reproductive Freedom for All.

For organizers like Jennings, the goal is to hold onto the wave of enthusiasm Harris' candidacy generated and use it to mobilize all Georgians. At this event, they sent about 64,000 texts, all aimed at a very specific group: men of color, 27 to 50 years old.

""The backbone of the Democratic Party is the Black vote, which is why the Republicans are heavily focused on Black men specifically,"" Jennings says. ""When we show up ... elections seem to kind of flip. And right now it's not 100% guaranteed that we're going to get all of the Black vote.""

Jennings is also acutely aware of how seemingly small moments can build momentum. He just took over as the Young Democrats president from Parker Short, who recently went viral for lip-syncing Kendrick Lamar at a Harris rally in Atlanta. Jennings says the group got a lot more inquiries from potential organizers after that.

Yet while the Harris-Walz campaign is leaning hard into online messaging, embracing memes and viral moments on platforms like TikTok, political science professor Bernard Fraga of Emory University says it may have its limits. It's one thing to have that support from young people online, he says, it's another to turn that into ballots.

""It still remains to be seen whether the Harris campaign can continue that momentum all the way into November and make sure that Gen Z and younger voters are mobilized and active participants in our democracy,"" he told NPR.

Outside of campaigning for either party, a swathe of nonpartisan groups operate in Georgia and are working to simply make sure young people are politically engaged.

Among them is Rise, a nonprofit organization specifically targeting Gen Z students. It recruits ambassadors and pays them $3 for every person they get to pledge to vote. We met Rise's Georgia organizers recently in an area of Atlanta that includes a number of HBCUs, like Morehouse, Spelman and Clark Atlanta University.

In a presentation to a group of college students interested in becoming ambassadors, Rise's leaders tell them to highlight issues that are likely to resonate.

""How many folks in here have been impacted by gun violence?"" asks Aunna Dennis, Rise's director of Georgia. Nearly every hand in the room goes up.

Dennis tells NPR the aim is to mobilize millions of young voters across the country, but specifically in Georgia.

""We got 12 million voters here in this area alone, we have over five million registered voters. And we can unleash the youth wave on each of these campus communities,"" she says. ""That's a win for us.""

Meanwhile, at Kennesaw State University, nonprofit Poder Latinx has come to campus for National Voter Registration day. On the campus lawn, organizers are handing out pins, stickers, drinks -- even bottles of Tajin -- waving students over to the tent and encouraging them to register. By the end of the day, 81 new voters had registered, taking the total to more than 1,100 since Poder Latinx started doing this in March.

One of the students that came by the table was 19-year-old Iambianze Jackson. She told us she is planning to vote for Harris this November, but is less than enthusiastic.

""She doesn't really explain her policies well,"" Jackson says. ""She mainly talks about tax cuts for the middle class but like, she doesn't really have policies.""

And then Jackson says something we heard from a few people in this battleground state: The election can't come fast enough.

""I'm ready for it to be over,"" Jackson says with a laugh. ""I'm ready for the results to come out so we can just proceed from there, whatever happens."""
Claudia Sheinbaum to be sworn in as the 1st female president of Mexico,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25648/claudia-sheinbaum-female-president-mexico,2024-10-01T06:38:50Z,"MEXICO CITY -- Claudia Sheinbaum will take the oath of office Tuesday as Mexico's first female president in more than 200 years of independence, promising to protect an expanded social safety net and fight for the poor like her predecessor, but facing pressing problems.

The 62-year-old scientist-turned-politician will receive a country with a number of immediate challenges, foremost among them stubbornly high levels of violence, a sluggish economy and hurricane-battered Acapulco.

Sheinbaum romped to victory in June with nearly 60% of the vote, propelled largely by the sustained popularity of her political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

He took office six years ago declaring ""For the good of all, first the poor,"" and promising historical change from the neoliberal economic policies of his predecessors. Sheinbaum promised continuity from his popular social policies to controversial constitutional reforms to the judiciary and National Guard rammed through during his final days in office.

Despite her pledge of continuity, she is a very different personality.

""López Obrador was a tremendously charismatic president and many times that charisma allowed him to cover up some political errors that Claudia Sheinbaum will not have that possibility of doing,"" said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political analyst at Mexico's Center for Economic Research and Teaching. ""So, where López Obrador was charismatic, Claudia Sheinbaum will have to be effective.""

He is not leaving her an easy situation.

Her first trip as president will be to the flood-stricken Pacific coast resort of Acapulco.

Hurricane John, which struck as a Category 3 hurricane last week and then reemerged into the ocean and struck again as a tropical storm, caused four days of incredibly heavy rain that killed at least 17 people along the coast around Acapulco. Acapulco was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, and had not recovered from that blow when John hit.

Sheinbaum must also deal with raging violence in the cartel-dominated northern city of Culiacan, where factional fighting within the Sinaloa cartel broke out after drug lords Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after they flew there in a small plane on July 25.

López Obrador has long sought to avoid confronting Mexico's drug cartels and has openly appealed to the gangs to keep the peace among themselves, but the limitations of that strategy have become glaringly apparent in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, where gun battles have raged on the city's streets. Local authorities and even the army -- which López Obrador has relied on for everything -- have essentially admitted that the fighting will only end when the cartel bosses decide to end it.

But that's only the latest hotspot.

Drug-related violence is surging from Tijuana in the north to Chiapas in the south, displacing thousands.

While Sheinbaum inherits a huge budget deficit, unfinished construction projects and a burgeoning bill for her party's cash hand-out programs -- all of which could send financial markets tumbling -- perhaps her biggest looming concern is the possibility of a victory for Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.

Trump has already vowed to slap 100% tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico. Though that would likely violate the current U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, there are other things Trump could do to make life difficult for Sheinbaum, including his pledge of massive deportations.

Things with its northern neighbor were already tense after López Obrador said he was putting relations with the U.S. embassy ""on pause"" after public criticism of the proposed judicial overhaul.

First lady Jill Biden struck an optimistic tone for relations with the incoming Sheinbaum administration saying at a reception Monday that, ""Under Dr. Sheinbaum's presidency I know we will continue to build a more prosperous, safe and democratic region -- and take the steps in our U.S.-Mexico partnership.""

There are areas where Sheinbaum could try to take Mexico in a new direction. For example, she has a Ph.D. in energy engineering and has spoken of the need to address climate change. López Obrador built a massive new oil refinery and poured money into the state-owned oil company. But his budget commitments do not leave her much room to maneuver.

Jennifer Piscopo, professor of gender and politics at the Royal Holloway University of London who has studied Latin America for decades, said Mexico electing its first female leader is important because it will show girls they can do it too, but it can also create unrealistic expectations.

""Woman firsts are powerful symbols, but they do not gain magic power,"" she said. ""Especially when the governance challenges are so large, expecting magic solutions overnight can also generate outsized disappointment."""
"Dockworkers begin walking picket lines, risking to snarl East and Gulf Coast ports",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5133391/dockworkers-strike-east-gulf-coast-ports-shipping,2024-10-01T05:17:07Z,"BALTIMORE -- Union dockworkers along East Coast ports began walking picket lines early Tuesday, threatening to halt the movement of billions of dollars' worth of goods including furniture, paper, shoes, manufacturing components, farm machinery and much more.

Workers began forming picket lines outside of East Coast ports shortly after midnight, even though the International Longshoremen's Association had not yet released a statement. The pickets began just after midnight, after talks between the ILA and the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents ocean carriers and port operators, apparently failed to yield a new contract. Workers were seen picketing near the Dundalk Marine Terminal in Baltimore, Maryland.

The two sides have not met face-to-face since June. They appear to be far apart on key issues. The alliance asked for an extension Monday, a request that went unanswered by the union.

Despite pressure from House Republicans and more than 170 industry groups, who warned that a strike will have a devastating impact on the economy, the Biden administration is standing firm in its decision to let the collective bargaining process play out.

""I don't believe in Taft-Hartley,"" President Biden told reporters on Sunday, citing the federal law that allows the President to call for an 80-day cooling off period when the nation's safety is at risk.

How big an economic impact the strike will have depends on how long it lasts.

The strike affects work at 14 ports along the East and Gulf Coasts, according to the U.S. Maritime Alliance. They are the Ports of Boston, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Norfolk, Wilmington, Charleston, Savannah, Jacksonville, Miami, Tampa, Mobile, New Orleans and Houston.

More than $2 billion worth of goods typically flow through these ports daily, from cars and clothing to bourbon and bananas.

That includes more than half of all cargo containers coming into the U.S., or about a million containers a month. It also includes more than three-quarters of the containers carrying exports out -- about 327,000 per month -- according to the freight-tracking company Vizion.

Those volumes dropped sharply in recent days in anticipation of the strike.

""If it goes on for weeks, it's going to be a massive headache,"" said Vizion CEO Kyle Henderson. ""If it's just days, it's probably just a blip.""

Trade groups warned in a letter to President Biden that an extended strike would have dire consequences for the U.S. economy.

""It is imperative that the parties return to the table without engaging in disruptive activities that could harm the economy and the millions of businesses, workers and consumers who rely on the seamless flow of goods, both imports and exports, through our East Coast and Gulf Coast ports,"" the groups' letter said.

The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States notes more than three-quarters of imported liquor typically flows through the affected ports, along with more than 40% of the American spirits sold overseas. Halting those shipments could be particularly costly in the run-up to the Christmas shopping season.

""Consumers love to buy your favorite bottle of American whiskey or scotch or Irish whiskey or cognac as holiday gifts,"" says Chris Swonger, the council's CEO. ""Even a day's strike could have repercussions along the line.""

Companies have made contingency plans to blunt some of the economic impact.

Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a freight forwarding company, says customers already have diverted cargo to the West Coast in anticipation of the work stoppage.

""Really starting at the beginning of the year, it became very clear that this was going to be a major issue,"" says Petersen.

In recent days, he says, Flexport's focus has been on getting cargo out, so as not to incur hefty fees for containers left at East and Gulf Coast ports, and shoring up operations at West Coast ports in anticipation of a surge of activity.

Goods that are already on ships headed to ports affected by the strike will just have to sit offshore until the strike is over, Petersen says.

""The reality is, there's only so much you can do,"" says Jeff Sloan of the American Chemistry Council, whose members rely heavily on ports along the Gulf Coast and in New Jersey and New York. ""For large volume materials like plastic resins, there's just no way to feasibly divert that to other ports or to ship it in some other way.""

Two major sticking points are wages and automation.

In a statement Monday, the U.S. Maritime Alliance says the two sides had traded counteroffers on wages in the past 24 hours.

The alliance said its latest offer would increase wages by nearly 50% and triple contributions to employee retirement plans.

The International Longshoremen's Association had rejected earlier offers, calling them ""stingy,"" given the shipping industry's massive profits in recent years.

""Even a $5.00 an hour increase in wages for each year of a six-year agreement only amounts to an average annual increase of approximately 9.98 percent,"" ILA President Harold Daggett said in a statement last week.

Wage increases under the last contract, signed in 2018, were far more modest, with only $1-an-hour increases in four of the six years, bringing the top hourly wage to $39.

Jobs at the ports have traditionally been among the best-paying blue-collar jobs in the country, often topping $100,000 a year. But Daggett says the port operators should pay workers more.

""When they made their most money was during Covid, when my men had to go to work on those piers every single day,"" he says in a video posted by the union. ""They died out there with the virus. We all got sick with the virus. We kept them going.""

On automation, Daggett has been warning dockworkers that the foreign companies that operate the ports are seeking to replace them with machines.

The U.S. Maritime Alliance has said it's offered to keep the current ban on fully automated equipment and the requirement that any use of semi-automated equipment be negotiated.

At ports around the world and even on the West Coast, advanced technology is already being used to move shipping containers.

But at East and Gulf Coast ports, the International Longshoremen's Association remains staunchly opposed.

How many jobs would be lost in a transition to automated terminals isn't entirely clear. The shipping industry, backed by researchers at UC Berkeley, argues that automation helps ports stay competitive and handle more goods, which in turn creates demand for highly skilled workers.

The Biden administration says it's encouraged all parties to keep negotiating and to do so in good faith.

On Friday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su met with the shipping companies' representatives. They'd also ""been in touch"" with the dockworkers' union throughout last week, according to the White House.

It's clear the union has not been happy with Biden.

""Where's the president of the United States? He's not fighting for us,"" Daggett said in the union video posted in September.

The sharp rebuke came nearly four years after Daggett endorsed Biden in the 2020 election, citing his friendship and support while criticizing former President Trump for filling courts with anti-union judges and supporting so-called right-to-work laws, aimed at weakening unions.

In July, shortly after the first assassination attempt on Trump, Daggett posted a photo of himself with Trump, offered prayers on behalf of the union membership, and recalled ""a wonderful, productive 90-minute meeting"" at Mar-a-Lago with Trump in November 2023.

""I expressed to President Trump the threat of automation to American workers,"" he wrote. ""President Trump promised to support the ILA in its opposition to automated terminals in the U.S. Mr. Trump also listened to my concerns about Federal 'Right To Work' laws.""

While Biden and Vice President Harris have the support of the leaders of most labor unions, the same is not true for many rank-and-file union members.

In 2022, freight rail workers were deeply angry with Biden for signing a measure that imposed a contract on them, blocking a nationwide rail strike.

Now with dockworkers on strike and the presidential election five weeks away, the administration likely does not want to risk major blowback from labor groups."
"Opinion | Biden pledged to restore order as president. In the Middle East, he's failing.",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-iran-war-biden-hezbollah-election-rcna174262,2024-10-08T10:47:49Z,"The president's poor leadership has brought us closer to a regional war that could cause enormous suffering and hurt his own party.

One of Joe Biden's promises in his 2020 presidential campaign was that he would restore strong U.S. leadership abroad and rein in the chaos that Donald Trump had unleashed in the international order.

But if you take a look at the Middle East right now, Biden hasn't done a very good job of fulfilling that pledge.

Under Biden's watch, the Middle East is growing less stable. In the past few weeks, Israel has begun a new war with its invasion of Lebanon, against the public wishes of the Biden administration. Iran has fired around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, the second time it has ever launched such a direct assault on Israel from its own land. Israel has since promised it will retaliate against Iran -- and that if the tit-for-tat continues for an additional round, strikes on Iran's nuclear sites are on the table. Meanwhile Israel's war in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks continues to rage with no end in sight. As a result of the instability, the price of oil is rising, and attacks on oil production in the region could cause it to surge more.

In other words, the Middle East is slowly inching toward breaking out into a full-scale regional war that could shake up the global economy, create a gigantic crisis in U.S. foreign policy and result in the deaths of countless civilians.

This is not good news for the Democrats as Election Day approaches: Just the rumblings of an imminent crisis or potentially surging gas prices could hurt the electoral appeal of Democrats, who are already suffering from their association with inflation.

The growing specter of wide-scale war in the Middle East is not some kind of approaching weather event or natural disaster. It is the product of choices. And our president has made some terrible ones that helped us get to this point. After Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, it was inevitable that Israel was going to retaliate. What was not inevitable was that the Biden administration would give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a far-right leader with neocolonial extremists in his Cabinet, carte blanche to retaliate against the entire population of the Gaza Strip however he wished to.

The Biden administration has appeared to use leaks and statements to suggest that it believes Netanyahu has gone too far in his brutality toward the civilians of Gaza, but in practice it has greenlighted all of Israel's actions. The Biden administration has been a staunch defender of Israel at the United Nations, shielding it from legally binding Security Council resolutions. It has given Israel billions in military aid. Aside from a brief, temporary and ultimately symbolic pause in arms transfers, Biden has not threatened to cut off aid, or even condition aid on Israel's compliance with international or U.S. law. The Biden administration, to keep weapons shipments intact under U.S. law, has reportedly ignored findings from the State Department and USAID that Israel had blocked U.S. humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Netanyahu's takeaway from Biden's support is that he can take U.S. backing as unconditional and do whatever he wants not only toward Palestinian civilians, but in the region more broadly. Netanyahu has embraced a ""shoot first, notify Biden later"" attitude toward many high-stakes and escalatory actions against adversaries in the Middle East, such as when Israel struck the Syrian headquarters of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, or when Israel leveled several buildings in Beirut in a bombing that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's operations in Lebanon -- against Biden's public wishes -- have already displaced close to a quarter of Lebanon's population and killed hundreds of civilians, according to PBS' NewsHour. And Netanyahu has demonstrated he feels no obligation to listen to U.S. calls to wind down the bloody military operation in Gaza, which is why Israel and Hezbollah have locked horns in the last year.

As Atlantic Council fellow Nicholas Blanford explained to me, Israel's escalation with its adversaries in the region increases the likelihood of a regional war. If, for example, Israel decides to entrench itself in a more wide-scale war in Lebanon, it could nudge Hezbollah to unleash its most destructive firepower, such as its precision-guided missiles that it has so far refrained from using. And if Iran were to fear that Israel is about to wipe out Hezbollah at some point, it could ""activate all [its] proxies across the region"" against Israel, dragging several other countries directly into the conflict.

We don't know exactly how Netanyahu would act if Biden were to condition or cut off aid to Israel. But given that U.S. military support is vital to Israel's national security and military operations, Netanyahu would be far more likely to behave conservatively in his military campaigns and targeted strikes across the region.

Netanyahu is aware that the timing of his more aggressive maneuvering comes at an acutely sensitive time for Biden politically. Biden is likely in the weeks before Election Day to be particularly hesitant to initiate an upheaval in U.S.-Israeli relations by cutting off weapons shipments or demanding that Netanyahu act like more of a cooperative U.S. ally. But at the same time Biden looks rudderless and weak by not doing anything.

When asked at a press conference Friday if he believed Netanyahu was trying to influence the U.S. election, Biden said, ""I don't know."" And when asked by another reporter, ""How long are you OK with Israel bombing Lebanon? What is acceptable to you?"" he smiled and walked away from the podium.

Biden has gotten himself into this bind through his record of unconditional support for Israel, no matter how badly it deviates from basic morality in warfare, international law or U.S. interests. One can't help but wonder if Biden's poor leadership in the Middle East might just mark a historic first: a president inadvertently springing an October surprise on his own party."
Trump-supporting billionaires are enabling his white supremacist rantings,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-backing-billionaires-enabling-white-supremacy-rcna174186,2024-10-08T00:54:52Z,"Some of Trump's wealthiest backers say they like his economic policies, so they keep quiet about his racism and xenophobia.

According to polls, the top issue in this year's presidential race is inflation/the economy. But at Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, last week, there was just about no applause when he stated, ""We will end inflation and make America affordable again. We're going to get the prices down."" When did his audience explode with energy? When Trump gave them lines targeting immigrants, like ""On day one of my new administration, the invasion ends and the deportations begin. We get them out."" And, speaking of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, ""Do you trust her to stop the invasion?"" In response, the crowd loudly chanted, ""We need Trump! We need Trump!""

Regardless of what the polls say the top issue is, Trump knows that his rallygoers get most excited when he gives voice to white supremacy. Two weeks ago, at another rally in Pennsylvania, Trump claimed Black migrants were destroying the character of Springfield, Ohio, and then declared, ""You have to get them the hell out. You have to get them out!"" In response, the crowd delivered a bone-chilling chant: ""Send them back! Send them back!""

Over the weekend, Trump told Wisconsin voters that he ""will liberate Wisconsin and our entire nation from this mass migration invasion of murderers, child predators, drug dealers, gang members and thugs."" The facts don't back up Trump's claims of a migrant crime wave. (As Frank Figliuzzi noted in an MSNBC column Sunday, the feds just made a huge bust of a white supremacist gang trafficking in fentanyl.) But Trump doesn't care about facts. He cares about scaring his predominantly white base and then persuading it to see him as the guardian of white America.

We know exactly which immigrants Trump is talking about given his long history of demonizing Latino immigrants and the comments he made when he was president, when he referred to Black nations such as Haiti as ""shithole countries."" His supporters know that when Trump promises ""mass deportation"" -- one of the themes of this year's Republican National Convention -- he means Black and brown people.

Everyone understands what Trump is about. But for too long there has been a tendency to excuse Trump's wealthy supporters -- like Elon Musk, who appeared at Trump's rally on Saturday -- as being on the Trump train only for the tax cuts or other financial gain -- as Trump has explicitly promised them at big-ticket fundraisers. However, these wealthy and often well-educated people see the same headlines we do. They should understand that the most visible part of Trump's campaign is racism, and it's long past time they are called out for enabling Trump's racist agenda.

As Forbes magazine detailed in its article on Trump's top billionaires, some are outspoken, while some support Trump for unspecified reasons.

Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who posted after Jan. 6 attack that Trump should ""resign and apologize to all Americans,"" changed his tune in July when he announced he would endorse Trump. At the time Ackman wrote on social media, ""We are in the midst of a perilous moment for our democracy."" (Seeing Trump, who is facing criminal charges for attempting a coup and called for the ""termination"" of the Constitution, as a guardian of democracy is laughable.)

New York Jets owner Robert ""Woody"" Johnson said this year on Fox News that he is backing Trump again because ""Americans remember how good it was or how much better it was on the border and inflation and gas prices and grocery prices, all that, during the Trump administration, and they want to get back there."" The Winklevoss twins, famously depicted in the film ""The Social Network,"" about the founding of Facebook, donated more than $1 million each to support Trump, citing Trump's ""Pro-Bitcoin Pro-Crypto Pro-Business"" position.

But every one of these billionaires is telling us that in exchange for the policy goals they want, they are on board with or at least comfortable with Trump's bigotry. After all, if racism were a deal-breaker for them, would they still be funding his 2024 campaign?

Others, like Musk, though, appear to be more openly on board with Trump's extremist agenda. Musk has peddled the same types of bigoted attacks Trump has about Black migrants in Ohio, demonized DEI programs while suggesting white people are inherently smarter than Black people. And Ackman has been vocally critical of DEI programs with posts on X such as ""DEI is inherently a racist and illegal movement in its implementation even if it purports to work on behalf of the so-called oppressed.""

Trump has become the head cheerleader for white victimhood and the defender of symbols of white power. This explains why on Friday he told supporters at an event in North Carolina he would rename the local military base to again honor the slave-owning Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg, who, as part of the Confederacy, fought to preserve chattel slavery.

""Should we change the name Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg?!"" Trump asked, and the crowd exploded with cheers. (The name of that base, like others that honored Confederates, was changed in 2020 when Congress overrode Trump's veto of the bill.) Trump vowed that if wins, he is ""doing it."" This syncs up perfectly with Trump's defense of monuments honoring white supremacy as ""beautiful"" when he was president.

Those who claim that they're supporting Trump for his promises of tax cuts or deregulation don't get a pass when he's using such racist language and promising to carry out racist policies. If a candidate campaigning on white supremacy is elected to the presidency again, they won't be able to evade accountability with the claim that that's not why they supported him.

""I think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country,"" Trump told Time magazine in April. He is reportedly planning a second-term overhaul of anti-discrimination law that his allies say would ""dramatically change the government's interpretation of Civil Rights-era laws to focus on 'anti-white racism' rather than discrimination against people of color."" And as the American Civil Liberties Union has recently warned -- citing the mandates of Project 2025 -- if Trump wins there will be a dismantling of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs because he and his supporters have characterized them as ""anti-white racism."" Indeed, 84% of his supporters are worried about ""anti-white"" discrimination.

Trump isn't hiding his bigotry. In fact, it's the cornerstone of his campaign. And if he's returned to office, then everybody who helped him get there is responsible: those who voted for him because of the white supremacy and those who say they had other reasons but didn't treat the white supremacy as disqualifying."

Opinion | Striking dock workers just set an example for all working folks,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dock-workers-strike-sent-powerful-message-bosses-workers-rcna173849,2024-10-05T11:58:58Z,"Dockworkers strike on a picket line outside of the Port of Houston Authority in Texas on Oct. 1.Brandon Bell / Getty Images

On Tuesday, dockworkers went on strike, shutting down ports across the East Coast and Gulf Coast to demand higher wages and a guarantee that automation won't be used to throw many of them out of work. It was a massive demonstration of the power of working people to grind the gears of the economy to a halt by simply refusing to show up.

The bosses caved in record time. Both sides agreed to a tentative deal Thursday. The dockworkers will return to work in exchange for a 62% pay increase over the next six years. That's a very good thing.

What's alarming is that even as the workers were being demonized by right-wing media outlets like The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, many liberals were fretting that the economic chaos resulting from foreign goods not coming into American ports would cost Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris the election. Even some otherwise left-of-center journalists were criticizing the workers for having the audacity to strike or even calling on President Joe Biden to force them back to work.

Naysayers had argued that the workers were greedy. As they saw it, dockworkers already made more than enough money. Others argued that by blocking automation, the workers were standing in the way of progress. Many observers said that collective bargaining is all well and good within reasonable limits, but shutting down this much of the flow of goods coming into the country was too much of an economic disruption to be allowed.

All of those arguments missed the mark by a mile. The only structural power the working class has in a capitalist system is the power to disrupt the economy by withdrawing its labor. That's the entire point of union organizing.

In this case, the union members stuck to their guns and won. Their victory is a victory for everyone who has to sell their working hours to a boss to make a living.

There were breathless headlines about dockworkers who make ""six-figure salaries,"" but those were about the top earners. As Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pointed out in his statement of solidarity with the striking workers, the average income for these workers is $60,000 a year, with ""many East Coast port workers mak[ing] as little as $20 an hour -- the same wage that a fast food worker in California currently makes."" And loading and unloading cargo ships is demanding work, often involving very long hours. The idea that these workers are overentitled clashes jarringly with these basic realities.

There's a much bigger problem, though, with the idea that striking dockworkers didn't deserve support because they already made good wages. That argument assumes that labor activity is just a way of procuring charity for workers who are poor and desperate enough to need it. That's exactly the wrong way to think about it. The labor movement exists to give the working-class majority of a society a say in what goes on at the workplaces where they spend half their waking hours and some input into how the profits created by their hard work are divided up. It imposes some small measure of democracy on the economy. The more that happens, the more everyone who works for a living benefits.

Every dollar that doesn't reach the pockets of workers pads the profits of already wildly profitable companies. The ocean carriers have made record profits in the last few years: $400 billion since 2020. Meanwhile, the dockworkers whose labor does so much to produce those profits are actually making 12% less than they were two decades ago, when adjusted for inflation. Why should the bosses hoard the benefits of the industry's success? If some dockworkers make more money than you do at your job, then why should your conclusion be that the dockworkers are greedy and not that you should organize with your co-workers for a better deal?

It's all too easy to think of corporate CEOs and shareholders raking in money as the inevitable order of things and working people trying to get a bigger piece of the pie as an imposition. Similarly, we just take it for granted that advances in automation will be used to throw some workers into unemployment while the ones lucky enough to keep their jobs have to work as hard as ever as they see their employers' profits skyrocket.

But that's not the only way things could work. Imagine that these companies were collectively owned by the workers themselves. In that scenario, labor-saving technology could actually be used to save labor for everyone. Workers could all work shorter hours for the same income, spread the work that still needs to be done by humans more thinly among themselves and give themselves more time to spend with their loved ones.

In the world we live in, though, ownership and labor are separated, so bosses decide how automation will be implemented. This is a problem that's going to impact every corner of the economy as technology advances, and any workers who want to avoid being left in the cold at the end of the process need to be ready to follow the dockworkers' lead and draw a line in the sand.

And people who profess to be workers' allies need to take their heads out of the sand.

Lee Fang, a heterodox left-wing journalist I'd expect to be sympathetic to organized workers, assailed the dockworkers on the grounds that Biden has been a pro-labor president and the strike had the potential to ""cause crippling inflation only 1 month out from the election."" He said this ""might take the cake"" as an extreme example of ""self defeats of organized labor.""

Dylan Matthews of Vox went so far as to call for Biden to invoke Taft-Hartley, a notorious piece of union-busting legislation passed in the 1940s, lest the dockworkers' strike ""cause inflation to come roaring back weeks before an election."" Matthews said ""you can support bargaining"" without tolerating the ""sabotage"" of the economy that would come from shutting down traffic at East Coast ports.

But what incentive are employers supposed to have to give concessions if workers can't back up their bargaining demands with a credible threat to walk off the job? That's the only way workers have ever been able to build real power.

As it happened, the bosses caved before the supply chain disruptions could cause inflation. Even if things hadn't worked out this way, though, it's disturbing that Matthews was willing to throw striking workers under the bus for the ""greater good."" If Biden had taken Matthews' advice, the ""pro-labor"" president using a union-busting law to shut down a major strike would have had demoralizing ripple effects throughout the rest of the organized working class.

Even if all you care about is Democrats winning elections, screwing over dockworkers would still have been a bad idea. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is already being supported by a higher percentage of union households than any other Republican candidate in the last 40 years. A Democratic president invoking Taft-Hartley to shut down a high-profile strike would likely only make things worse.

As Chris Isidore and Vanessa Yurkevich point out at CNN, if the union had continued to work under a contract extension, thus delaying any strike until after the presidential election, then they ""would have lost bargaining leverage"" by losing the chance to shut down the ports before the ""pre-holiday shipping season"" really got going. In telling the workers to throw away their best chance to win this massive pay raise to make sure Harris won, Fang and Matthews were essentially telling them not to take action themselves but to trust politicians to look out for their interests. But workers can't exert much influence on the political process if they don't start by building power for themselves where they work.

It's true that in many ways, Biden has been more pro-labor than recent presidents. But his record is more mixed than Fang suggests. He came into office promising to pass the PRO Act, which would make it easier for workers to organize unions, but it hasn't passed and never seemed to have been a high priority for his administration. And two years ago, in a situation much like this one, Biden invoked the Railway Labor Act to prevent a major rail strike. It's good that this time around he did the right thing -- he told reporters that he didn't ""believe in Taft-Hartley"" -- but these blotches on his record show the limits of trusting politicians to be benevolent toward workers.

While Republicans are certainly worse on labor issues, the sad fact is that the working class has relatively limited influence in both parties. There's no way to change that more basic reality without building a bigger and more militant labor movement, one that's not afraid to flex its muscles at times that might be inconvenient for others.

And if you work for a living, then that's exactly what you should want to happen."
Stephanie Ruhle: By all measures we have a strong economy. So why don't Americans feel that way?,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/job-report-inflation-economy-biden-rcna174092,2024-10-04T20:53:06Z,"The Biden administration woke up to some good news on Friday. The U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs in September, blowing past the 150,000 expected. Not only did September's numbers beat economists' expectations, but data from previous months were also revised upward and the unemployment rate fell from 4.2% in August to 4.1%.

This is good news. By almost all measures, we've got a strong economy, except for one thing that matters an awful lot: how Americans feel about it. It's a reason why Donald Trump continues to poll better among likely voters on handling the economy.

That feeling is largely frustration that prices are still too high. I'm not talking about the pace of inflation -- just the fact that everything seems to cost more.

Now, the administration and the Harris campaign point to all the recent positive economic news, but they don't always connect the dots to one reason behind those prices: the rise in wages.

Yes, price increases can be due to ""greedflation."" Corporations have held wages low for years while raising prices and pocketing big profits. Many businesses could increase wages and benefits without higher prices. That's why many politicians, including Vice President Kamala Harris, want to investigate and go after those engaging in price gouging.

However, a lot of workers -- especially lower-wage earners -- have gotten a raise in recent years. And when wages go up, prices likely do as well. We want lower-wage earners to be able to support their families, but if you're paying people who work at fast-food joints or pizzerias $20 an hour, then you're not likely going to get $1 menu items anymore, and you're not going to get a pizza that costs less than $20.

Here's an example: My son works at a deli and takes home $20 an hour for making sandwiches. When my mother rolls in to pick him up from work, she can't understand why the sandwiches are $22.

But it's not just about ""greedflation"" and price gouging. Employers are paying people more and it's going to impact all kinds of companies. And if employers pay their workers more, especially small business owners, it has to come from somewhere, and often that means raising prices for consumers.

Let's not forget, this increase in wages is also good news. Wage growth has been rising fastest for the lowest-wage workers. That's a good thing, even if it means we might have to pay a little more for fast food, pizza and sandwiches."
Politicians are trying to tie immigration to our housing crisis. They're lying.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/housing-prices-forced-deportation-immigration-rcna174048,2024-10-04T20:08:28Z,"By Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council

There's no doubt that we need to change our broken immigration system. And there's no doubt that we need more housing. But while some politicians are trying to tie immigration to our housing crisis to justify extreme policies like mass deportation, the available evidence tells a much different story.

Some politicians try to make the United States' housing shortage -- estimates of the deficit run anywhere from 4 million to 7 million homes -- a simple equation of supply and demand. Add more people, and housing prices go up; deport more people, and housing prices go down. The reality is far more complicated. Undocumented immigrants don't just use housing. They also build housing, maintain housing and put money into the pockets of Americans who buy or rent housing.

A new report from the American Immigration Council, where I am a senior fellow, finds that mass deportations would lead to a widespread economic downturn. The impact would be concentrated in industries that rely on undocumented workers, the most prominent of which is construction, the industry necessary to address the country's housing shortage.

Our analysis finds that 1 in 7 people employed in the construction industry as of 2022 were undocumented, accounting for more than 1.5 million workers. Within many of the trades relevant to housing construction and maintenance, the proportion is higher. We estimate that more than 1 in 3 roofers, ceiling tilers, stucco masons, plasterers and drywall installers are undocumented. These workers not only build many of the roughly 1.79 million new units that go onto the market each year, they also maintain and repair existing housing stock. If you think getting a contractor is hard now, wait until the workforce has been cut by a third.

Some might argue that deported construction workers would be replaced by U.S. workers. However, the data suggests that is not true. As of 2024, the construction industry has an extreme labor shortage, even though wages are 80% higher than the average nonfarm job. With persistent hiring problems across the industry, the likeliest outcome of deporting 1.5 million construction workers wouldn't be 1.5 million Americans choosing to fill those jobs; it would be the closure of firms and fewer construction jobs, period.

But even if firms could eventually find new workers, there would be years of turmoil in the interim. In the last year, 1.48 million new residential building permits were issued. How many of those projects would even begin if a third of workers were deported? It could take years before the industry recovered and housing construction got back on track. Americans would suffer in the meantime.

More broadly, there is little evidence that Americans are dealing with high housing prices because of undocumented immigrants -- who are much less likely to be homeowners than the population at large. We estimate that in 2022, the homeownership rate for undocumented immigrant households was 39%, compared to 65.3% for the entire country.

Most undocumented immigrants are renters, and there too, the evidence does not show migrant arrivals have driven up rent prices. According to Apartment List, median rent began spiking in January 2021, peaked in August 2022, and began slowly falling after that. That trend does not align with migration. Our analysis of Department of Homeland Security data shows roughly 1.5 million migrants entered the country during the period when rents were spiking. But from August 2022 through May 2024, an additional 3.6 million migrants entered the country. In short, migration rose dramatically even as rent prices plateaued and fell. This strongly suggests that migration across the border is not directly correlated to rent prices.

Immigration is not a zero-sum game. One migrant entering the country and working does not mean one American will lose a job. In fact, the opposite is true. Immigrants are job creators in multiple ways. We estimate that undocumented immigrants hold $256 billion in spending power, much of which is distributed back into the community, growing the economy and stimulating consumer demand.

As demand rises, the need for labor goes up, more jobs are created, and native workers fill those jobs. When the economy contracts, demand goes down, fewer jobs are needed, and native workers lose their jobs. One recent study found that for every 500,000 people deported, 44,000 American citizens lose work. We estimate that mass deportations would cause the U.S. gross domestic product to fall anywhere from 4.2% to 6.8%. By comparison, the GDP dropped 4.3% during the Great Recession, which at its peak saw 15 million Americans out of work.

The answer to the country's housing shortage is obvious: build more housing to make up for years of stagnant growth following the 2008 housing crash. Mass deportations are not a realistic economic strategy. They would leave us all worse off, facing a collapsing construction industry, rising food prices and destabilizing labor shortages across the supply chain.

Rather than destabilize the economy for the sake of harsh enforcement, we should increase resources to the government agencies that manage the enforcement and adjudication system to ensure that people have their cases heard in a reasonable period of time, while pursuing a path to permanent status for the long-term residents whose hard work makes us better off in the long run. When millions of people leave, they take their skills, money and hard work with them, and American workers, renters and homeowners suffer."
Great news on job growth strengthens Dems' pre-election pitch,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jobs-job-growth-democrats-biden-harris-economy-election-2024-rcna174006,2024-10-04T13:28:30Z,"As Election Day 2024 approaches, Republicans desperately want voters to believe the economy is terrible. Reality keeps getting in the way.

Expectations heading into this week showed projections of about 150,000 new jobs having been added in the United States in September. As it turns out, according to the new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job market fared quite a bit better than that. NBC News reported:

In addition to the encouraging top-line data, the same Labor Department report showed that wage growth continued to outpace inflation.

This is not the final jobs report before Election Day -- that will be released the morning of Nov. 1, five days before voters go to the polls -- but the new data will help drive the public conversation about the economy in the race's final weeks.

The encouraging job numbers also come the week after a surprisingly good report on U.S. economic growth, which led White House National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard to note in a written statement, ""We learned this morning that the economy has grown by 3.2% per year during Biden-Harris Administration -- even stronger than previously estimated -- and better than the first three years of the previous administration.""

As the 2024 election cycle nears its end, Republicans desperately want voters to believe the economy is terrible. Reality, however, keeps getting in the way of GOP talking points.

Let's also circle back to previous coverage to put the data in perspective. Over the course of the first three years of Donald Trump's presidency -- when the Republican said the U.S. economy was the greatest in the history of the planet -- the economy created roughly 6.38 million jobs, spanning all of 2017, 2018, and 2019.

According to the latest tally, the U.S. economy has created over 16.5 million jobs since January 2021 -- more than double the combined total of Trump's first three years. (If we include the fourth year of the Republican's term, the data looks even worse for him.)

For some additional context, consider job growth by year over the past decade, updated to reflect the latest data revisions:"
Trump's newest economic claim is even more wrong than usual,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-newest-economic-claim-even-wrong-usual-rcna173850,2024-10-03T17:59:30Z,"Donald Trump says he's responsible for creating the best economy ever -- even if we include data from 2020. That's demonstrably ridiculous.

It's not uncommon for Democrats to note that Donald Trump left the White House with the worst record on job creation since the Great Depression, with a net loss of over 2 million jobs over four years. Technically, that's true, but I've never been altogether comfortable with the talking point because it lacks context.

To be sure, if we simply tally up all of the monthly job totals from January 2017 (the month of Trump's inauguration) to January 2021 (the month he grudgingly stepped down), the results look dreadful: The Republican was the only president since Herbert Hoover to leave office with the United States having fewer jobs than when he came in.

But the context matters: To arrive at this conclusion, one has to include the Covid-era data, when the pandemic sparked a sudden and sharp recession. To hold Trump directly responsible for the fact that the U.S. economy lost over 20 million jobs in April 2020 has never struck me as altogether fair.

A better assessment, I've long argued, is to focus on the first three years of Trump's term, which have never been as amazing as he's claimed.

The GOP candidate, however, has apparently concluded that my approach is all wrong -- and that there's no reason to exclude the 2020 data. Trump sat down with personal-finance author and radio host Dave Ramsey this week and boasted:

None of this is true. Not even a little.

If we exclude 2020, and focus just on the former president's first three years, Trump's economic record appears fine, but underwhelming. Job growth during the Republican's first three years, for example, not only fell short of his pre-election promises, they were also lower than the job growth from Barack Obama's final three years in office.

How has Trump explained why job growth slowed down after he took office? So far, he hasn't. Instead, he claims the job numbers ""were the best ever,"" which is demonstrably wrong.

Meanwhile, economic growth during the Trump era -- again, before the Covid crisis -- wasn't bad, but it failed to reach 3% GDP growth, it fell short of the kind of growth we saw under other modern presidents, and it didn't come close to the growth the Republican promised to deliver during his 2016 campaign.

But in light of his latest comments, if we take the former president's advice, ""go all four years,"" and include the 2020 data, all of the data looks even worse.

I'm mindful of the fact that Trump might very well win a second term, largely because Americans have been told ad nauseum that his economic record is amazing. But reality tells a very different story."
"Opinion | Who will win? Election forecasters think it's Harris, but they've been wrong before",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-election-forecasts-predictions-rcna173277,2024-10-02T10:48:06Z,"Models looking at everything from polls to economic conditions show a narrow Harris win.

Can science predict the future? The great science fiction author Isaac Asimov wrote a series of books in which a scientist figures out a way to do just that.

""It was the science of human behavior reduced to mathematical equations,"" Asimov wrote in one of the books in his Foundation series. ""The individual human being is unpredictable, but the reactions of human mobs ... could be treated statistically.""

It's a great concept for a book series -- and a well-reviewed streaming TV show -- but in the real world, it falls flat.

The subject has come up again as we are now just a month out from a hotly contested election that could determine everything from the future of abortion rights to the strength of American democratic institutions. It would be comforting to hear from an expert who can read the tea leaves and tell us who will win.

Demand is so high that multiple models are competing for dominance, and two of the biggest forecasters -- historian Allan Lichtman and close poll reader Nate Silver -- got into an online feud over the weekend over how to read the ""13 keys"" that Lichtman uses to make his predictions. (Lichtman says they predict a Kamala Harris win, but Silver argues they actually favor Donald Trump.)

""Allan let's just say the little tricks you've played with the Keys in the past will come back to haunt you! The Keys shall be respected,"" posted Silver, in what sounded like something the villain in a children's movie shouts shortly before an army of elves overtakes the castle.

If you're not sure about the 13 keys, you could look instead at the Misery Index, a crude measure developed by an adviser to President Lyndon Johnson that combines the unemployment rate and the inflation rate, which will tell you the numbers are looking good for Harris. Or you can check out the more sophisticated Time for Change model, which zeroes in on the popularity of the current president, the state of the economy and the number of terms the incumbent party has been in the White House. That also predicts a narrow Harris win.

Or maybe, like Silver, you favor polls. In that case, you can look at 538's proprietary mix of polls, economic and demographic data to see that Harris is projected to win 57 out of 100 times (Silver is no longer with 538). If you're willing to pay, you can see Silver's own forecast, which is based on his new model. Or you can just look at the state-by-state polls yourself and obsessively play with the maps on 270 to Win while muttering about crucial Waukesha County.

Or perhaps you like the newfangled prediction markets, which ask bettors to put their money where their mouth is. PredictIt has a bet on a Harris win at 56 cents, with Trump as the underdog at 47 cents, while VirtualTout blends PredictIt data with some fancy math to come up with a forecast for a ""strong Democratic victory.""

The good news for these forecasters is that if Harris wins, they'll all get to claim that their models were accurate. And if Trump wins, they can say that, after all, their models showed only a high probability of a Harris win, or they'll switch to talking about the popular vote.

The problem with all of these models, however, is that they attempt to make iron laws out of the scrap metal of past elections. We've had only 59 presidential elections since the Constitution went into effect -- even fewer if you consider only those since the expansion of voting rights, the advent of TV news and the development of sophisticated voter targeting in the 20th century. Statistically speaking, that's just not a lot of data.

More recently, you can throw in the complications the Electoral College has caused since 2000 by diverging twice from the national popular vote, the increasingly intense partisanship and the closely divided elections, and it's basically impossible to make definitive predictions. Would your favored political model have predicted an Al Gore or George W. Bush win in 2000? Did it predict Trump or Joe Biden winning by tens of thousands of votes in a handful of swing states?

If your model assumes how voters will respond to a president running for re-election, how does it factor in the president's dropping out and endorsing his vice president just months before the election? Or a former president's running for a nonconsecutive second term? What about a candidate who was impeached for trying to overturn the results of the last election?

Most models can be useful to a point. They can give us the general sense of the political landscape or enough information to start make contingency plans for after the election. If Harris wins, maybe the models will make at least some voters less open to bogus arguments that the election was stolen. (I'm not holding my breath on that one.) And some can tell us how well a generic Democratic or Republican candidate might have done in a particular environment, which can help the parties review their strategies.

But ultimately, we aren't voting for a generic candidate. We have to choose between two specific people, with their own strengths and weaknesses. And sometimes the polls, the economic models and the betting markets can't measure that.

In Asimov's series, the scientist's predictions of the future are accurate for centuries until, through random chance, a man is born with a mutation that allows him to psychically manipulate other people's emotions, creating fear and devotion in order to rise to power. That proposition -- that predictions of the future ultimately cannot account for the unknown or the unexpected -- is worth keeping in mind as we head into the November election, especially given that we have a candidate on the ballot who's adept at creating fear and devotion.

In the end, election forecasts are not bad at telling us how the future will look, as long as it continues to look like the past."

Opinion | This is the rare vice presidential debate that actually matters,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-tim-walz-vp-debate-vice-presidential-rcna172750,2024-10-01T23:15:15Z,"""Ain't nobody coming to see you, Otis"" is an iconic line from ""The Temptations,"" a 1998 NBC miniseries. Delivered by the actor playing David Ruffin, it's a boast that the audience was not paying to see anyone else in the group, just Ruffin. Conventional wisdom says one could apply this logic to Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.

In a ""normal election,"" a debate between the No. 2s on the ticket would be interesting but not statistically significant. The rule for a vice presidential debate is generally the same election to election: Stick to the top of the ticket's message, draw a contrast with the challenger anchored in that message and, crucially, do no harm. Conventional wisdom says people do not cast ballots because of whom the Democratic or Republican nominee chose as an eventual governing partner. It's the name on the top of the ticket that matters.

However, this is not a normal election, and I disagree with the conventional wisdom. Running mates matter, and tonight's debate is quite significant!

If the nominees' choice for potential governing partner did not matter, then there would no reason to put them on the stage together before the election. Choosing a running mate is the first presidential-level decision a major party nominee makes. It is a statement about who they are and what their agenda and legacy will be if elected president. In selecting the millennial Vance, former President Donald Trump tripled down on Trumpism, cementing it as a key pillar of the Republican Party apparatus and the bedrock of the GOP's next generation.

In selecting Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris signaled that the Democratic tent is big and that she is serious about making her bold plans on child care, reproductive freedom and the economy a reality. Just look at what her running mate has done in Minnesota when it comes to those issues.

Tonight's debate could be the last time voters hear from the campaigns in a forum at which they are mandated to stand next to each other and defend their plans. A literal split screen where the comments of both participants will take center stage. That alone raises the stakes.

Vance will have to answer for his treasure trove of soundbites on everything from likening Trump to Hitler and the racist conspiratorial lies about Haitian people in his home state, to name just two. Walz will be asked to defend his record in Minnesota (because apparently feeding children is too progressive) and his military service record. Regardless of what the moderators ask, a candidate who is well prepared will answer the question then quickly pivot out of the conversation about themselves and back to the issues and their No. 1. This is not always easy to do, but it is critical.

When we first sat down for debate prep in 2020 with then-Sen. Harris, we initially focused on ensuring she knew what then-candidate Joe Biden had said publicly about each issue. It was important she was well versed in his thoughts, so she knew the contours of where and how far to go in discussing any particular topic.

The last thing a campaign wants is the running mate making unauthorized news.

When Vance sat down with my colleague Kristen Welker on ""Meet the Press,"" he emphatically stated Trump would not sign a national abortion ban into law. And yet, during Trump's second debate this cycle, he walked back Vance's answer on national television. Vance will want to avoid making the same mistake tonight, but a large part of being vice president is speaking for the president. If Vance cannot do that in a debate, why would he be able to do it at the White House?

For Walz, he will have to walk the tightrope of part attack dog and part explainer. This is an area where many voters still say they want to know more about Harris' plans, so Walz will have to use his time wisely, find moments to speak directly to the people at home and explain how a prospective Harris-Walz administration would make a difference for families across the country. Much has been said about Walz not being a seasoned debater, but remember he was a high school teacher and a football coach! One could say he honed his oratory skills in the lion's den.

In 2020, during Harris' debate prep, we had many internal discussions about how to handle the question of age if it came up. Tonight, Walz won't have that problem. Harris will turn 60 this month; however, Vance will have to speak to why Americans should trust 78-year-old Donald Trump to sit behind the resolute desk again and if he himself -- a freshman senator with no legislative accomplishments and no other political or government experience -- would actually be ready to lead the country if duty called.

Tonight, while no one will be looking for Otis, all political eyes will be on Tim Walz and JD Vance."
Airlines say they're capping fares in the hurricane's path as Biden warns against price gouging,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/airlines-price-gouging-biden-hurricane-milton-177a6a8c3fae702bcefa471ab7826af8,2024-10-08T21:52:14Z,"A few airports in Florida began closing and airlines canceled hundreds of flights on Tuesday ahead of Hurricane Milton's arrival. Government officials from President Joe Biden on down warned companies not to overcharge people fleeing the storm's path.

""I'm calling on the airlines and other companies to provide as much service as possible to accommodate evacuations, and not to engage in price gouging -- to just do it on the level,"" Biden said after a hurricane briefing.

Airlines defended their actions, some saying they had imposed fare caps in the last couple days.

By midafternoon Tuesday on the East Coast, airlines had canceled more than 700 U.S. flights, compared with fewer than 200 cancellations on Monday and fewer than 100 each of the two previous days, according to the FlightAware tracking service.

About half of Tuesday's cancellations were at Tampa International Airport, which shut down in the morning as Milton approached.

Travelers packed the airport on Monday, hoping to catch one of the remaining flights out of the storm's predicted path. Cerina McQuillan was trying to get her 17-year-old daughter on a flight to New York.

McQuillan said that when she first tried to buy a one-way ticket, prices were around $200. Then the airline's site crashed.

""All of a sudden it went back on again, and the flights quadrupled in price. It went up to like $750 within a matter of seconds,"" she said. ""There were prices even as high as $1,000 for one leg. So wrong! So wrong!""

Jeremy Bingaman, a music-industry podcaster, posted a screenshot of United Airlines fares for flights out of Tampa to St. Louis on Tuesday. They went as high as $2,351 for refundable tickets in economy class on United Express, compared with Southwest, which showed tickets at $399, and American, which displayed flights to Chicago for around $600.

""Hey (at)united, what's up with the price gouging in Tampa for people trying to evacuate? ... shady,"" he wrote in an X post that was reposted more than 4,000 times.

None of those flights he highlighted took off -- they were all scheduled after the airport suspended operations.

United spokesperson Leslie Scott said the itinerary that Bingaman posted included two connections, and noted that the flight never happened.

""We implemented fare caps on Sunday. Since then, the average price paid for a one-way, economy-class ticket to our hubs from the impacted Florida markets was below $500,"" Scott said.

Large U.S. airlines ""are working diligently to accommodate customers impacted by Hurricane Milton,"" said Hannah Walden, a spokesperson for the trade group Airlines for America. She noted that several carriers are allowing consumers to rebook trips to, from or through the storm's path, ""allowing passengers to adjust their travel plans if needed. The safety of our passengers and employees is our top priority.""

Even when the weather is good, airlines often raise prices on tickets bought hours or a few days before departure, when there are fewer unsold seats left. That can blur the line between price gouging and the airlines' regular practice of maximizing revenue from each flight.

Biden did not give any examples of price gouging this week. A spokesperson for the U.S. Transportation Department said the agency has been in touch with airlines to get more information about the availability and affordability of flights in the storm's path.

Earlier, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a post on X, ""The Department takes all allegations of airline price-gouging seriously. We are keeping a close eye on flights in and out of areas affected by Hurricane Milton to make sure airlines are not charging excessively increasing fares.""

William McGee, a travel expert and advocate for the American Economic Liberties Project, which opposes big corporations, said his group has seen the comments on social media about airlines -- especially United, Delta and American -- raising prices as the hurricane approached Florida.

""We've seen this with growing frequency in the deregulated era in response to natural disasters and terrorist attacks,"" McGee said. ""It's important for consumers who are experiencing this to file complaints with the (Transportation Department) and perhaps share details on social media.""

Travelers struggling to get out of Florida expressed exasperation and fatigue over high prices, canceled and delayed flights, and poor customer service.

John Fedor, a roofer from the Philadelphia suburbs, and his wife were trying to get home after a Caribbean cruise. They missed their flight out of Tampa. He said they got no help and were ""treated so horribly"" by a Frontier Airlines agent, then looked into other ways home. He was quoted $675 for a rental car. They saw train fares for $125 each, but by the time they tried to purchase a pair, the train was sold out.

""I still don't know how we're going to get home. We don't know what day we're getting home,"" Fedor said. ""This probably has been the worst vacation of my life.""

"As Israel plots to strike Iran, its choices range from symbolic to severe",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-nuclear-hezbollah-hamas-missile-retaliation-0184e79d4ee5ec012960e0b24ddae102,2024-10-08T19:54:06Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel has promised to retaliate for Iran's massive missile attack last week. How it does so involves great risk, and could have major repercussions for the archenemies, the Middle East and the world.

Israel's options range from symbolic strikes on military targets to crippling attacks on Iran's vital oil industry or its secretive and heavily fortified nuclear program.

The intensity and timing of any retaliatory strike was expected to top the agenda of a planned meeting this week at the Pentagon between Israel's defense minister and his U.S. counterpart. But late Tuesday, the Pentagon said the meeting was abruptly postponed.

In a sign of possible disagreement over the right approach, President Joe Biden has already urged Israel not to hit Iran's nuclear program and discouraged it from hitting the oil industry.

The Associated Press spoke to two former Israeli prime ministers and other experts to explore Israel's options. There is broad consensus that Israel must strike back, but deep disagreement over the best way to do so.

""The question is not whether Israel will retaliate or respond,"" former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told AP. ""The question is which way.""

Israel and Iran have been involved in a bitter shadow war for years -- primarily through Israel's battles against Iranian-backed militant groups across the region. Israel also has been suspected of killing Iranian nuclear scientists and carrying out attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, but it rarely acknowledges involvement.

Direct clashes have been rare. But things changed after Hamas attacked Israel from the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023, and Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel the following day. Both groups receive support from Iran.

In April, Iran fired over 300 drones and missiles toward Israel after accusing it of killing two Iranian generals in a diplomatic compound in Syria. Nearly all of the missiles malfunctioned or were intercepted, and Israel responded with a limited strike that signaled it did not want any further escalation.

After last week's Iranian attack, Israel signaled its next response would be different.

Iran said the barrage of at least 180 ballistic missiles was to avenge a series of Israeli strikes against its close allies, Hamas and Hezbollah, including the assassination of the group's longtime leader. Although the missiles caused little damage or casualties, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had made a ""big mistake and it will pay for it."" Members of his hard-line coalition have called for a harsh response.

Israel has a broad range of choices of targets - from Iranian government buildings and military bases to sensitive oil installations to heavily fortified nuclear facilities hidden deep below ground. Israel accuses Iran of developing nuclear weapons -- a charge Iran denies.

Striking anywhere in Iran is a logistical challenge for Israel. Warplanes would need to fly over 1,500 kilometers (about 1,000 miles) to their target, requiring a complicated midair refueling operation, potentially over hostile skies. Any strike would also mean confronting Iran's Russian-made air-defense systems.

""Remember that Iran is 1,500, 1,600 kilometers (about 1,000 miles) away from Israel, and you have countries in between -- Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia. Some are friends. Some are foes,"" said Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv and a former adviser on Iranian affairs on Israel's National Security Council.

""You don't want to embarrass your friends. You don't want to get hostile fire from other countries,"" he said.

Olmert, who served as prime minister from 2006 to 2009, said Israel is more than capable of coping with these challenges.

""We have the capabilities,"" he said. ""I'm not certain it would be wise and responsible to expose them.""

Even if Israel has the means, there are diplomatic considerations. A strike on the oil sector, Iran's economic backbone, or on the nuclear program would almost certainly guarantee an Iranian response and raise the risk of further escalation.

Such strikes could rattle global oil markets and shake the U.S. economy on the eve of a presidential election. They also could risk Iranian retaliation not only against Israel, but against American troops stationed in the region or Gulf Arab countries aligned with the West.

""Unlike Lebanon and Gaza, every Israeli attack on Iran has international and global repercussions,"" said Menahem Merhavy, an Iran expert at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

Former leaders are divided on what path Israel should choose.

Olmert said a strike on multiple military targets, spread across Iran's vast territory, would be more than enough to send a message. The goal, he said, is to show that Israel can strike anywhere and anytime.

""That's precisely what deterrence is all about,"" he said.

Olmert said hitting Iran's oil sector would be an unnecessary escalation that invites a response, and that striking the nuclear program is not worth the risk. Not only would it trigger Iranian retaliation, but the odds of success are uncertain, he said.

""Trying to attack the nuclear program will be a mistake,"" he said.

Another former prime minister, Yair Lapid, believes Israel should strike Iran's oil industry infrastructure.

""That is the most painful target for the Iranian regime,"" Lapid, who served as premier in 2022, said in a written response to a question from The Associated Press.

""Iran's ballistic missile attack against Israel must be met with a forceful response,"" he said, adding that Iran must understand ""there is a high cost to its regional aggression.""

In an interview with the Israeli news site Ynet, Lapid said a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities should only be done as part of an international coalition in coordination with the United States.

Lapid's predecessor as prime minister and former governing partner, Naftali Bennett, takes an even tougher line, saying now is the time for Israel to bomb the Iranian nuclear project.

Bennett said in a video posted on social media Tuesday that Iran and its allies have been weakened, and that Israel has a rare chance to deliver a decisive blow to Iran's leadership, economy and nuclear program.

""We must not settle for Iranian military bases or noisy-yet-meaningless actions that are meant only to deliver a message,"" Bennett said. ""The time for messages is over.""

Olmert, however, said he hopes cooler heads will prevail.

""What do we want to achieve and how far do we want to go and how arrogant do we want to be?"" he said. His advice: ""Try to be smart."""
Will the polls be right in 2024? What polling on the presidential race can and can't tell you,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-polls-kamala-harris-donald-trump-b497bd1015d35ed563e085c8db075802,2024-10-08T19:18:52Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential race is competitive.

That's about as much as the national polls can tell us right now, even if it looks like Democrat Kamala Harris is down in one poll or Republican Donald Trump is up in another.

And that's just fine.

Even though polls are sometimes treated as projections, they aren't designed to tell you who is likely to win.

Polls are better for some things than others. Tracking shifts in voter intention is hard to do with a survey, particularly when the number of truly persuadable voters is relatively small. Voters' opinions can change before Election Day and they often do. Horse race polls can only capture people's viewpoints during a single moment in time. Even then, a margin that looks like one that could decide an election -- say, one candidate has 48% support and the other has 45% support -- might not be a real difference at all.

When reporters at The Associated Press are covering the election, horse race polling numbers don't take center stage. The reason for this is that the AP believes that focusing on preelection polling can overstate the significance or reliability of those numbers.

Election-year polls are still useful, particularly when they're trying to assess how the public is feeling about the candidates or the state of the country. They told us quite clearly, for instance, that many Americans wanted Democratic President Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 race. But they're not the same thing as an election result, and even a poll conducted just before Election Day still reflects opinion before all ballots have been cast.

Polls are useful tools, but it's important not to overstate their accuracy. After all, a polling organization can't talk to every single person in the country. They instead rely on a sample to produce a statistically valid estimate of the views of all adults. Even though polls can give a reasonable approximation of the views of the larger group, the question is how much each finding could vary.

The margin of error, which all high-quality pollsters will share along with their results, helps capture some of that uncertainty. It means that in a poll with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, a finding that 47% of voters say they'll support a particular candidate actually means that there's a very good chance that anywhere between 50% and 44% of voters are supporting that candidate. If the other candidate has 45% support, which could really be anywhere from 42% to 48%, the 2 percentage point difference isn't statistically meaningful.

That's why the AP will only say a candidate is leading if that candidate is ahead by more than twice the margin of error.

When you're looking at a subgroup, rather than a national sample, the potential error is even larger. The fewer people interviewed, the larger the margin of error. This means that state-level polls or polls that measure the views of a subgroup such as women, men, Hispanic Americans or Black Americans are subject to even more error than a national finding.

The margin of sampling error is not the only source of survey error. It is simply the only one that can be quantified using established statistical methods. But there are other factors, too. The wording and order of questions can affect how people answer. An interviewer's skill can have an effect. Even in high-quality polls, some respondents may be less likely to answer, which means their views can be underrepresented.

National polls measure how voters all over the country are thinking about the election. But that's not how we elect presidents.

The Electoral College system means that presidential elections are functionally decided by a small number of states. So in some ways, looking at polls of those states is a better way to assess the state of the race.

But state-level polls introduce their own challenges. They're not conducted as frequently as national polls and some states get polled more often than others. Also, the number of people surveyed for state polls is often smaller than for national polls, which means the margin of error is broader.

Some media outlets or organizations publish polling averages or aggregates that combine the results of multiple polls into a single estimate. There are some organizations that create polling averages or models during elections that attempt to determine which candidate is leading in overall polls.

But averaging poll results does not eliminate polling error and it can introduce additional problems. Polling averages contain their own methodological decisions, such as which polls are included or receive greater weight. Some of them also include other factors such as the state of the economy to turn those estimates into forecasts.

In election polling, survey averages can provide a general sense of the state of a race. But it's also important to not overstate the accuracy of an average or expect it to be a crystal ball into the election outcome. Sometimes the individual results of multiple different polls can provide a better sense of the potential array of outcomes than an average boiled down to a single number.

"How AP VoteCast works, and how it's different from an exit poll",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/how-ap-votecast-works-exit-poll-48c02b728cecb06c26a896b049fe1096,2024-10-08T19:18:40Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- When it comes to understanding elections, it's not just about who won and lost. To explain what really happened, it's important to understand who voted and how, what they cared about and how they felt about important issues facing the country.

At The Associated Press, AP VoteCast is a key part of answering those questions, explaining the voting coalitions that elected the president, determined congressional control and decided state-level ballot measures.

Launched in 2018, AP VoteCast is an extensive survey of both voters and nonvoters that aims to tell the story behind election results. Conducted for the AP and Fox News by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, it's a detailed snapshot of the American electorate that helps explain who voted, who didn't vote, what issues they care about, how they feel about the candidates and why they voted the way they did -- or didn't vote at all.

Although it serves a similar purpose, AP VoteCast is not an exit poll.

Traditional exit polls, including the one conducted by a consortium of news networks in the United States, rely largely on in-person interviews with voters conducted outside of select polling places after they've voted, supplemented with a phone survey to reach mail-in voters. Before AP VoteCast the AP worked with other major news organizations to conduct Election Day exit polls.

AP VoteCast was created in part to reflect significant changes over the years in how people vote, from a world where most people vote by showing up at the polls on Election Day to one where a growing number vote before Election Day.

In 1972, for example, about 95% of voters nationwide cast a ballot in-person on the day of the election. Since then, the number of those voting before Election Day has grown steadily, especially in the past few elections. In 2018, roughly 4 in 10 voters cast their ballots before the November general election. In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, the number shot up to about 7 in 10. In the 2022 midterms, about half of voters cast pre-Election Day ballots.

AP VoteCast captures the views of voters -- whether they vote in person on Election Day or weeks ahead of time -- by beginning to interview registered voters several days before Election Day. Those interviews conclude as polls close in each state. Interviews are offered in English and Spanish, as needed.

This approach allowed AP VoteCast to reliably survey more than 130,000 registered voters in all 50 states during the 2020 presidential election, and comprehensively explain how Democrat Joe Biden won the presidential election.

AP VoteCast uses a combination of methods -- mail, phone and online interviews -- to reach registered voters and capture their opinions about the candidates and the election, regardless of whether they vote in-person on or before Election Day or by mail-in ballot.

The first step in the process is to find people to participate in the survey. A random sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files is contacted through the mail and invited to take the survey online or by phone. Some voters are also contacted by phone if they do not respond to the initial invitation to take part in the survey.

Besides the randomly selected group of eligible registered voters, AP VoteCast collects data by conducting interviews with additional voters recruited through ""opt-in"" online panels where the participants are not selected randomly but instead recruited through internet advertising. This helps give AP VoteCast a broader reach and additional depth.

To make sure these additional interviews don't overrepresent or underrepresent important demographic and ideological groups, the panel's composition is carefully calibrated to match the random sample survey on key attitudes, along with matching the demographic characteristics of all registered voters.

Voters are asked a standard set of demographic questions, such as their age, sex, race and ethnicity, education level and the type of neighborhood they live in. They're asked to share their views on what they look for in a candidate, what they think about the candidates on the ballot and what they believe are the key issues facing the country, such as abortion, crime, the economy, health care and immigration.

While voters are asked for whom they're voting, the AP doesn't use this information to report an overall horse race result or to replace vote totals. But the survey results do provide valuable insight into how specific groups voted. For example, in the 2020 presidential election, AP VoteCast results showed that white men favored Republican Donald Trump, while women with college degrees favored Biden. That year, voters who thought the economy was the top issue preferred Trump, while those who thought health care was the top issue supported Biden.

In the 2024 Republican primary, AP VoteCast surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina showed that while Trump won commanding victories in the early states, he struggled to broaden his support beyond those groups that have generally supported him in the past. Harris didn't become the Democratic nominee through the primary process, so her support among the party's primary voters wasn't captured in AP VoteCast surveys.

Harris proposes expanding Medicare to cover in-home senior care,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-home-health-care-sandwhich-generation-098a7ed48dfd94d11fb0efcd5d63b42b,2024-10-08T19:05:50Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris is proposing to provide federal funding to cover home care costs for older Americans, aiming to help the "" sandwich generation "" of adults caring for aging parents while raising their children at the same time.

Appearing Tuesday on ABC's ""The View,"" Harris talked about taking care of her mother when she was dying and personally experiencing the challenges many families face when seeking affordable in-home care for their aging loved ones.

She promised that if, elected in November, she will seek to expand Medicare, the federal health insurance program for older Americans, so that it covers long-term care and includes services like in-home aides. Harris said aides could help seniors do things as simple as preparing meals or putting on sweaters because it is ""about dignity for that individual. It's about independence for that individual.""

Her proposal is a new one just a month out from Election Day but the issue is one that President Joe Biden 's administration has been working on for years.

In an effort to soften the effects of inflation, the White House promoted as part of Build Back Better, its legislative agenda that stalled on Capitol Hill years ago, steeply increased federal spending for child care as well as for seniors. After Build Back Better collapsed, the Biden administration continued to promote increasing spending for what it calls ""the care economy,"" a cause Harris has continued to mention after replacing Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.

""These plans are common sense. They can help family caregivers work and save both families and the federal government money by allowing seniors to stay in their homes instead of being sent to nursing homes,"" the Harris campaign said in a fact sheet detailing her proposal. ""Medicare at Home will also reduce hospitalizations.""

As part of a blitz of media interviews she's been doing in recent days, Harris sat down after her appearance on ""The View"" with radio personality Howard Stern, who said that his mother is 97. Taking care of an elderly parent, he said, ""will bankrupt you.""

Such costs have increased pressure on adults caring for their parents and kids simultaneously. In 2019, roughly 30% of family caregivers of older Americans lived in households that included children or grandchildren, according to AARP.

Harris would likely have to work with Congress to achieve key parts of her proposal. Harris' campaign points to past, similar proposals projected to cost $40 billion annually, but says much of that can be offset by savings achieved through efforts begun by the Biden administration to expand Medicare's ability to negotiation prices with major drug manufacturers.

Harris is also promising to further expand Medicare to include hearing and vision coverage, while changing existing rules that can allow federal authorities to seize a deceased beneficiary's home to recuperate costs. The campaign fact sheet says that practice ""means that those homes are not passed on to the seniors' children, which particularly harms rural and minority families."""
¿Por qué es Tampa Bay tan vulnerable a los huracanes?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/climate-and-environment/por-que-es-tampa-bay-tan-vulnerable-a-los-huracanes-d840c8f4f8abaa8d7149ee667029cc27,2024-10-08T18:17:04Z,"La última vez que una tormenta de la envergadura del huracán Milton golpeó a Tampa Bay fue en 1921, cuando la ciudad era un poblado tranquilo de unos pocos cientos de miles de habitantes. Hoy en día es una de las metrópolis de más rápido crecimiento en Estados Unidos, con más de 3 millones de habitantes y sumamente vulnerable a las inundaciones debido al cambio climático. A medida que Milton avanza hacia Florida como huracán de categoría 5, muchos expertos temen que un siglo de buena fortuna ha terminado.

Esto es lo que hay que saber:

El Centro Nacional de Huracanes de Estados Unidos vaticina oleajes en Tampa Bay de entre 2,5 a 3 metros (8 a 12 pies) por encima de condiciones de marea normales, y entre 10 y 15 centímetros (4 y 6 pulgadas) de lluvia por el huracán Milton.

Toda la costa occidental de Florida es particularmente susceptible a los oleajes altos. La semana pasada el huracán Helene, que entró en tierra más al oeste, a unos 240 kilómetros (150 millas) de Tampa, logró causar muertes por ahogamiento en el área de Tampa debido a fuertes oleajes de entre 1,5 y 2,5 metros (entre 5 y 8 pies) por encima del nivel normal.

""Si hubiese entrado en tierra apenas un poquito más hacia el sur y hacia el este, hubiera sido mucho, mucho peor"", dijo Philip Klotzbach, investigador de huracanes de la Universidad Estatal de Colorado.

La mayor susceptibilidad se debe en parte a la topografía. La costa de Florida sobre el Golfo de México es de poca profundidad, con una ladera de tenue inclinación. El más alto lecho marino actúa como barrera que retiene el agua de la tormenta, haciendo que el agua se desborde sobre la superficie. Ocurre lo contrario en la costa oriental de Florida, donde el lecho marino cae súbitamente a pocas millas de la orilla.

""Puedes tener la misma tormenta, la misma intensidad, el mismo todo, pero oleajes muy distintos"", observó Klotzbach.

Un reporte de 2015 de Karen Clark and Co., una compañía en Boston que se especializa en pronósticos de desastres naturales, concluyó que Tampa Bay es el lugar en Estados Unidos más vulnerable a las inundaciones a raíz de un huracán y que podría sufrir 175.000 millones de dólares en daños.

Si bien los floridanos no son ajenos a las tormentas, Tampa no ha estado en el trayecto de un huracán mayor en más de un siglo.

En ese lapso, la zona ha tenido un crecimiento explosivo. Decenas de miles de personas se mudaron allí durante la pandemia de COVID-19, muchas de ellas a las islas cerca de Clearwater y St. Petersburg, sobre las aguas usualmente plácidas y esmeraldas del golfo. Más de 51.000 personas se mudaron allí entre el 2022 and 2023, convirtiéndola en la quinta zona metropolitana de Estados Unidos de mayor crecimiento, según datos del censo.

Los residentes de más larga data, tras numerosas falsas alarmas y tormentas cercanas como Irma en el 2017, podrían no estar preparados para un impacto directo. Cunde la leyenda que bendiciones de americanos nativos que vivían por esa zona y que construyeron montículos para ahuyentar a invasores han protegido al lugar de fuertes tormentas durante siglos.

El profesor de meteorología de MIT Kerry Emanuel dijo que un huracán en Tampa es como ""el cisne negro"", el peor de los casos de lo que los expertos han advertido desde hace años.

""Es una gran población. Está muy expuesta y es muy inexperta, y eso es mal augurio"", dijo Emanuel, quien ha estudiado huracanes por 40 años. ""Siempre pensé que Tampa era la ciudad por la cual más debíamos preocuparnos"".

___

Detrás de todas las olas y los vientos está el cambio climático. Las crecientes temperaturas, provenientes de los gases del efecto invernadero, han calentado los océanos, han hecho crecer los niveles del mar y han aumentado la humedad atmosférica, factores todos que determinan la fuerza de un huracán y su potencial para causar inundaciones.

""Debido al cambio climático, los modelos climáticos prevén que los huracanes causarán lluvias más intensas y un mayor riesgo de inundaciones costeras debido al mayor oleaje causado por el aumento del nivel del mar"", dijo Angela Colbert, científica del Laboratorio de Propulsión a Chorro de la NASA, en reporte del 2022.

El lunes, el Centro Nacional de Huracanes calificó a Milton como tormenta de categoría 5 debido a que su intensidad aumentó a 120 kilómetros por hora (75 millas por hora) en las 24 horas previas. Una razón podría ser las temperaturas del agua particularmente altas, que actúan como combustible para la tormenta.

""La velocidad con la que Milton se intensificó es increíble"", dijo en un email Brian McNoldy, investigador de la Universidad de Miami. ""Desde hace meses he estado advirtiendo: las aguas del golfo están a niveles récord o casi récord"".

Añadió que, debido a la elevación del nivel del mar producido por el cambio climático, las aguas del huracán Andrew estarían hoy en día 17 centímetros (7 pulgadas) por encima de donde estaban cuando la tormenta azotó Florida 30 años atrás.

Las autoridades de la zona empezaron el lunes a emitir órdenes de evacuación para seis condados alrededor de Tampa Bay donde viven cerca de 4 millones de habitantes. En particular riesgo están los residentes de casas móviles, vehículos recreativos y casas manufacturadas incapaces de soportar vientos de 177 kph (110 mph).

Kevin Guthrie, director de la División de Gestión de Emergencias de Florida, exhortó enfáticamente a los habitantes de las zonas costeras a que evacúen, notando que los habitantes de las islas que murieron durante el huracán Ian en 2022 estarían vivas hoy en día si hubiese cruzado el puente y conseguido refugio en la parte continental.

""Por favor, si están en el área de Tampa Bay, tienen que evacuar. Si se ha emitido una orden de evacuación, les ruego, les imploro, que evacúen. Las muertes por ahogamiento debido a aguas crecidas son cien por ciento evitables si se salen de ahí"", declaró Guthrie.

De manera casi inexplicable, las tormentas han pasado a Tampa por alto: La mayoría de los fenómenos en el golfo han afectado a las zonas muy al norte de la ciudad. La última vez que la zona de Tampa fue abofeteada por el ojo de un huracán grande fue el 25 de octubre de 1921. El huracán no tenía nombre oficial, pero hoy en día se le conoce como la tormenta de Tarpon Springs, por el pueblo costero por donde entró.

El oleaje generado por ese huracán, estimado como de categoría 3 con vientos de 207 kph (129 mph) fue calculado en 3,3 metros (11 pies). Por lo menos ocho personas murieron y los daños ascendieron a unos 5 millones de dólares.

Hoy en día, la zona turística célebre por sus playas de arena blanca ha crecido aceleradamente, con una economía estimada de casi 200.000 millones de dólares. El huracán Milton amenaza con arrasar todo ese desarrollo.

"Encuesta: Votantes negros apoyan más a Harris, pero no están seguros de que cambiará las cosas",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/politics/encuesta-votantes-negros-apoyan-mas-a-harris-pero-no-estan-seguros-de-que-cambiara-las-cosas-b8e6e2f00c41d9e00df2a6b5503abc4b,2024-10-08T16:01:14Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Los votantes registrados negros tienen un punto de vista abrumadoramente positivo de la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris, pero no están seguros de que ella cambiará al país para bien, según una encuesta de AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

La encuesta, realizada a mediados de septiembre, halló que alrededor de un 70% de los votantes negros tienen una opinión muy o algo favorable de Harris, con escasa diferencia entre hombres y mujeres. Los votantes más jóvenes y los de edad más avanzada también tenían opiniones similares de la vicepresidenta.

Las opiniones entre los votantes negros hacia el expresidente y candidato presidencial republicano Donald Trump, en cambio, son abrumadoramente negativas, lo que subraya la dificultad que enfrenta en sus intentos por quitarle a Harris apoyo entre las personas de raza negra. Los votantes negros son un importante baluarte para los demócratas y pocos están alineados con el Partido Republicano. Según la encuesta, dos tercios de los votantes negros se identifican como demócratas, un 20% se identifica como independiente y solo un 10% se identifica como republicano.

Pero el sondeo también halló que, a pesar de la profunda discrepancia en los puntos de vista hacia los candidatos, los votantes negros tienen menos certeza en cuanto a que Harris pueda colocar al país en una mejor trayectoria o cambiar sus vidas de manera significativa. Preguntados si la frase ""Cambiaría al país para bien"" describe bien a Harris, solo la mitad dijo que la describiría muy o extremadamente bien, un 30% dijo que la describiría ""más o menos bien"" y un 20% dijo que la describe ""no muy bien"" o ""para nada bien"". Y solo alrededor de la mitad opinan que el resultado de estas elecciones tendrá ""mucho"" o ""algo"" de impacto en sus vidas, una proporción similar a la hallada en la población general.

""El Partido Demócrata no es lo suficiente fuerte para mí"", expresó Raina Johnson, una habitante de Chicago de 53 años de edad. Vaticinó que Harris ""tratará de hacer algo a favor de la gente"" pero se verá limitada ""como ocurrió con (Barack) Obama, porque el Partido Republicano le trancó el camino"".

Si bien Johnson opina que las elecciones serán muy importantes, no cree que le afectará mucho en su vida ""porque yo seguiré viviendo mi vida, seguiré adaptándome a los problemas que surjan"".

Preguntados sobre cuál candidato haría un mejor trabajo en encarar los temas que enfrentan al país -- como la economía, la atención médica y la delincuencia - la mayoría de los votantes negros coincidieron: Harris.

Al igual que en la población general, un 80% de los votantes negros dijeron que la economía es uno de los temas principales en esta campaña. Pero un 75% de los votantes negros dijeron que la atención médica es uno de los temas más importantes, comparado con poco más de la mitad de la población general. Además, los votantes negros son más propensos a opinar que las normas sobre tenencia de armas y la delincuencia son problemas importantes, que en la población general.

En todos esos temas, así como en otros como el aborto y el cambio climático, Harris supera cómodamente a Trump entre los votantes negros. Pero el tamaño de esa ventaja es mayor en algunos temas que en otros. Un 60% de los votantes negros opinan que Harris está mejor posicionada para manejar la economía, mientras que un 20% dice lo mismo de Trump, lo que le da a Harris una ventaja de alrededor de 40 puntos. En cuanto al aborto, ella tiene una ventaja de alrededor de 60 puntos.

La campaña de Trump ha estado aumentando sus intentos por ganarse el apoyo de las comunidades negras, creyendo que su mensaje en cuanto a la economía, la inmigración y los valores tradicionales puede quitarle votos a los demócratas, particularmente entre los hombres negros más jóvenes.

Rod Wettlin, un jubilado y veterano de la Fuerza Aérea en Surprise, Arizona que desea más acción en cuanto a la atención médica y la inmigración, dice que se opone fuertemente a Trump y que teme que la democracia estadounidense está en peligro.

""Lo que está pasando ahora es la culminación de algo a lo que nos hemos enfrentado desde hace años"", dijo Wettlin. ""Ojalá después de las elecciones volveremos a un discurso más civil, pero esta gente desde ya está clamando por un caos. Y eso es su derecho, yo luché para que ellos tengan ese derecho. Pero que no vengan a pisarme mis derechos"".

Hay indicios de que algunos votantes negros consideran a Harris una figura más fuerte. Las mujeres negras y los votantes negros de mayor edad especialmente son más propensos a describir a Harris como alguien que ""luchará a favor de gente como tú"", comparado con los hombres negros y los votantes negros más jóvenes.

Son relativamente pocos los votantes negros que tienen una opinión positiva de Trump, o que lo consideran un candidato poseedor de las cualidades necesarias para ser presidente. La encuesta halló que alrededor del 80% de los votantes negros tienen una opinión algo o muy desfavorable de Trump, mientras que apenas un 15% tienen una opinión algo o muy favorable. Apenas alrededor de un 10% dicen que frases como ""Cambiaría al país para bien"" o ""Lucharía por gente como tú"" describen bien a Trump, y una proporción igualmente baja de votantes negros dijeron que Trump sería un buen presidente.

""Creo que iremos por la dirección correcta si Kamala Harris gana"", opinó Roslyn Coble, una residente de Oakboro, Carolina del Norte, de 63 años de edad. ""Pero si Donald Trump gana, las cosas irán mal. Él ya dejó claro lo que va a hacer, va a ser un dictador"".

Alrededor del 70% de los votantes negros dicen que la frase ""Dirá cualquier cosa para ganar las elecciones"" describe a Trump por lo menos muy bien.

En un indicio de cómo la decisión del presidente Joe Biden de retirarse como candidato demócrata en julio podría haber afectado la contienda, solo un 55% de los hombres negros tienen una opinión favorable de Biden, comparado con 70% entre las mujeres negras.

Biden ""hizo lo mejor que pudo"", declaró Wettlin. Añadió que Biden debió haberse retirado mucho antes, y se mostró escéptico ante los logros del mandatario.

Grupos de activismo negro dicen que han detectado un aumento en energía y entusiasmo desde que Harris se convirtió en la candidata demócrata, y tanto la campaña de Harris como la de Trump siguen centrando esfuerzos en ese sector demográfico.

La campaña de Trump ha estado organizando eventos en vecindarios negros de ciudades como Filadelfia, Detroit y Milwaukee y organizó una gira en autobús con el lema ""Voces Negras A Favor De Trump"" en septiembre. Por su parte, la campaña de Harris ha realizado varios eventos orientados hacia los votantes negros, especialmente los hombres, y ha despachado a varios partidarios prominentes - como legisladores, celebridades y líderes de derechos civiles - en comunidades negras en semanas recientes.

La encuesta abarcó 1.771 votantes registrados y se realizó entre el 12 y 16 de septiembre usando una muestra AmeriSpeak, diseñada para ser representativa de toda la población estadounidense. Tiene un margen de error de +/- 3,4 puntos porcentuales."
Hungary's Orbán interrupted by activist during EU presidency news conference,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/orban-interrupted-activist-news-conference-hungary-8051e9a43229b10b62380c025355022e,2024-10-08T15:18:20Z,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- An activist and municipal councilor for a Hungarian opposition party disrupted a news conference in Strasbourg, France, on Tuesday as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was laying out his plans for Hungary's six-month presidency of the European Union.

The activist, Márton Gyekiczki, interrupted Orbán as he was speaking about his opposition to immigration, running toward the podium where Orbán sat and throwing a stack of what appeared to be banknotes at the prime minister.

""How much did you sell out the country for? How much did you sell out the country for, Mr. Prime Minister?"" Gyekiczki yelled as the papers scattered. ""He sold out to Putin, he sold out to Xi Jinping!"" -- referring to the leaders of Russia and China.

The disruption came as Orbán was set to address the European Parliament on Wednesday during Hungary's six-month rotating presidency of the bloc. His government has long been at odds with the EU over what it sees as his curtailing of democratic rights, and has increasingly come under fire for his close relations with autocracies like Russia and China.

Gyekiczki, the activist, who was taken to the ground by a security guard and led out of the room, is a member of Hungary's Democratic Coalition party and a local council member in a Budapest suburb.

The president of that party, former Prime Minister Ference Gyurcsány, later wrote on social media that he was ""proud"" of Gyekiczki for his actions.

""We will say it everywhere and always: Hungary has a traitorous government!"" he wrote.

Orbán is expected to receive a mixed reception in the EU parliament on Wednesday. Many lawmakers have pushed for his government to be deprived of EU funds over what they see as rule-of-law and corruption violations.

Two years ago, the parliament declared that Hungary under Orbán had become ""a hybrid regime of electoral autocracy,"" taking it out of the community of democracies.

Yet Orbán this year successfully formed the Patriots for Europe group within the parliament, uniting far-right parties from around the continent to form the third-largest group in the EU legislature.

During the news conference on Tuesday, Orbán lamented what he sees as a declining EU economy and lagging competitiveness with the United States and China, saying that he saw that as ""the most serious challenge we have to face.""

He also argued against recently adopted EU tariffs on Chinese-produced electric vehicles, and railed against immigration which he said was resulting in the destruction of the EU's visa-free Schengen area as countries like Germany, Austria, Italy and Slovenia have introduced temporary border checks along their frontiers.

""These individual attempts will actually break up the Schengen system,"" Orbán said, adding that he proposed a regular ""Schengen Summit"" for member countries to meet and discuss border policy.

""We need a big, joint decision,"" he said.

Responding to the disruption by the activist, Orbán offered ""a word of explanation for Hungarian political culture.""

""When a Hungarian politician tells another one that he is a scoundrel, all it means in our culture is that 'I disagree with you,'"" he said."
Harris hace campaña en podcasts y otros medios para llegar a los votantes,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/politics/general-news-06359cf38877693936c735a02260abc1,2024-10-08T15:07:52Z,"NUEVA YORK (AP) -- Cuando la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris apareció en el podcast de Alex Cooper, la conversación no comenzó con el análisis de posturas políticas. El objetivo, le dijo Cooper a la candidata demócrata, era ""conocerla a usted como persona"".

Y eso le pareció muy bien a Harris, que acudió al popular podcast ""Call Her Daddy"" porque ""una de las mejores formas de comunicarse con la gente es siendo auténtica"".

Mucho más allá de la mitad de su inesperada campaña presidencial, y con la votación ya en marcha, Harris sigue dándose a conocer a los votantes estadounidenses que determinarán su destino en la elección presidencial de este año.

El martes, su campaña mediática la llevara a distintos estudios en todo Manhattan, mientras la candidata demócrata trata de llegar a tantas personas como pueda en el menor tiempo posible. Es un marcado contraste con la época en la que evitaba dar entrevistas desde que reemplazó al presidente Joe Biden en la candidatura presidencial, y una forma implícita de reconocer que tiene que hacer más para superar al candidato republicano Donald Trump.

Harris conversará con las mujeres del programa ""The View"" de ABC, hablará con el conductor de radio Howard Stern y grabará un programa con el comediante nocturno Stephen Colbert. Las tres apariciones se producen después de que Harris concediera entrevistas en ""60 Minutes"" de CBS que se transmitió el lunes en la noche, y en el podcast de Cooper, emitido el domingo.

El podcast ""Call Her Daddy"" suele ser provocativo, y se habla abiertamente de sexo, pero Harris y Cooper comenzaron hablando de sus respectivas madres.

Harris señaló que el primer instinto de su madre fue nunca consolar a su hija mayor cuando se metía en problemas. En cambio, le preguntaba, ""¿Qué hiciste?"".

Aunque eso podría parecer frío, señaló la vicepresidenta, ""en realidad me estaba enseñando a pensar, dónde tuviste influencia en ese momento y qué pudiste decidir hacer o no. No dejes simplemente que las cosas te ocurran"".

Son interacciones como esas a las que el equipo de Harris da prioridad para la vicepresidenta, en las últimas cuatro semanas antes del día de la elección. Ella aún no ha dado entrevistas a diarios o revistas, pero su personal considera la posibilidad de que acuda a más podcasts donde piensan que Harris pueda llegar a votantes que no siguen los medios noticiosos tradicionales.

Anna Greenberg, una encuestadora demócrata, dijo que Harris debe motivar a las personas que se han desligado de la política porque piensan que ""todos los políticos son iguales, dicen lo mismo, no saben nada de mi vida, y no puedo identificarme con ellos en absoluto"".

""Quieren que les gustes y que puedan confiar en ti"", dijo.

Jennifer Harris, exdirectora de alto nivel de economía de la Casa Blanca, dijo que Harris tiene un camino más largo que recorrer por la forma en que se convirtió en candidata demócrata.

""No tuvimos una buena y larga elección primaria para conocer a Kamala Harris en la forma que muchos votantes están acostumbrados"", dijo. Harris debe hallar la manera de demostrar los instintos y principios que ""guiarán cientos de cuestiones políticas que surgirán durante la presidencia"".

A new system will allow EU to sanction people waging sabotage on behalf of Russia,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/eu-russia-ukraine-sanctions-69b106f14e30653a4a7b5fd15b11d251,2024-10-08T14:15:46Z,"BRUSSELS (AP) -- The European Union on Tuesday set up a system for imposing sanctions against people accused of cyberattacks, information manipulation or acts of sabotage on behalf of Russia to undermine EU support for Ukraine.

NATO warned earlier this year of Russian ""hostile state activity"" against the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and the U.K., and said that the Kremlin's actions ""constitute a threat to allied security.""

The EU said that it too has ""detected an increasing number of a broad range of activities."" It said that Russia also continues to disrupt satellite communications, violate European airspace and organize physical attacks against people.

The challenge is that many of the activities fall below a threshold that might require a military response and both organizations are struggling to discourage such attacks effectively.

The EU's new framework will allow it to target people, agencies or organizations that seek to undermine its fundamental values or ""security, independence and integrity."" But no actual sanctions have yet been imposed. These measures would come later, once agreed by member countries.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that the members are ""united and determined to address these activities and hold perpetrators accountable. Our support to Ukraine will remain solid and unwavering for as long as it takes.""

The asset freezes and travel bans would be imposed for several kinds of hybrid threats, including undermining elections, democratic institutions or the economy, as well as attacking critical infrastructure or using migrant flows to destabilize countries.

It would allow the EU to ""target those who are responsible for, implement, support or benefit from Russia's destabilizing actions worldwide, as well as their associates and supporters,"" a statement said."
"States sue TikTok, claiming its platform is addictive and harms the mental health of children",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-lawsuit-youth-mental-health-2993f8e70d2e3d4eab9988df168fb948,2024-10-08T14:12:05Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- More than a dozen states and the District of Columbia have filed lawsuits against TikTok on Tuesday, alleging the popular short-form video app is harming youth mental health by designing its platform to be addictive to kids.

The lawsuits stem from a national investigation into TikTok, which was launched in March 2022 by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general from many states, including California, Kentucky and New Jersey. All of the complaints were filed in state courts.

At the heart of each lawsuit is the TikTok algorithm, which powers what users see on the platform by populating the app's main ""For You"" feed with content tailored to people's interests. The lawsuits also emphasize design features that they say make children addicted to the platform, such as the ability to scroll endlessly through content, push notifications that come with built-in ""buzzes"" and face filters that create unattainable appearances for users.

In its filings, the District of Columbia called the algorithm ""dopamine-inducing,"" and said it was created to be intentionally addictive so the company could trap many young users into excessive use and keep them on its app for hours on end. TikTok does this despite knowing that these behaviors will lead to ""profound psychological and physiological harms,"" such as anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia and other long-lasting problems, the complaint said.

""It is profiting off the fact that it's addicting young people to its platform,"" District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said in an interview.

Keeping people on the platform is ""how they generate massive ad revenue,"" Schwalb said. ""But unfortunately, that's also how they generate adverse mental health impacts on the users.""

TikTok does not allow children under 13 to sign up for its main service and restricts some content for everyone under 18. But Washington and several other states said in their filing that children can easily bypass those restrictions, allowing them to access the service adults use despite the company's claims that its platform is safe for children.

Their lawsuit also takes aim at other parts of the company's business.

The district alleges TikTok is operating as an ""unlicensed virtual economy"" by allowing people to purchase TikTok Coins - a virtual currency within the platform - and send ""Gifts"" to streamers on TikTok LIVE who can cash it out for real money. TikTok takes a 50% commission on these financial transactions but hasn't registered as a money transmitter with the U.S. Treasury Department or authorities in the district, according to the complaint.

Officials say teens are frequently exploited for sexually explicit content through TikTok's LIVE streaming feature, which has allowed the app to operate essentially as a ""virtual strip club"" without any age restrictions. They say the cut the company gets from the financial transactions allows it to profit from exploitation.

Many states have filed lawsuits against TikTok and other tech companies over the past few years as a reckoning grows against prominent social media platforms and their ever-growing impact on young people's lives. In some cases, the challenges have been coordinated in a way that resembles how states previously organized against the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries.

Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued TikTok, alleging the company was sharing and selling minors' personal information in violation of a new state law that prohibits these practices. TikTok, which disputes the allegations, is also fighting against a similar data-oriented federal lawsuit filed in August by the Department of Justice.

Several Republican-led states, such as Nebraska, Kansas, New Hampshire, Kansas, Iowa and Arkansas, have also previously sued the company, some unsuccessfully, over allegations it is harming children's mental health, exposing them to ""inappropriate"" content or allowing young people to be sexually exploited on its platform. Arkansas has brought a legal challenge against YouTube, as well as Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook and Instagram and is being sued by dozens of states over allegations its harming young people's mental health. New York City and some public school districts have also brought their own lawsuits.

TikTok, in particular, is facing other challenges at the national level. Under a federal law that took effect earlier this year, TikTok could be banned from the U.S. by mid-January if its China-based parent company ByteDance doesn't sell the platform by mid-January.

Both TikTok and ByteDance are challenging the law at an appeals court in Washington. A panel of three judges heard oral arguments in the case last month and are expected to issue a ruling, which could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court."
El Nobel de Física premia avances que permitieron el aprendizaje automático,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/science/general-news-c084d86ea5b41f8b7c731ace0cd3ec83,2024-10-08T10:02:54Z,"ESTOCOLMO (AP) -- John Hopfield y Geoffrey Hinton ganaron el premio Nobel en Física por descubrimientos e inventos que sentaron las bases del aprendizaje automático, según anunció el martes el comité del Nobel.

""Los dos laureados de este año con el Nobel en Física han utilizado herramientas de la física para desarrollar métodos que son la base del potente aprendizaje automático actual"", indicó el comité en una nota de prensa.

Hopfield realiza su investigación en la Universidad de Princeton, mientras que Hinton trabaja en la Universidad de Toronto.

Tres científicos ganaron el Nobel de Física del año pasado por ofrecer el primer atisbo de una fracción de segundo al vertiginoso mundo de los electrones, un campo que algún día podría mejorar los dispositivos electrónicos o los diagnósticos médicos.

El premio de 2023 fue para la física franco-sueca Anne L'Huillier, el científico francés Pierre Agostini y Ferenc Krausz, nacido en Hungría, por su trabajo con la parte diminuta de cada átomo que gira en torno a su núcleo, y que es fundamental casi para cualquier cosa: la química, la física, nuestros cuerpos y nuestros dispositivos.

Los seis días de anuncios del Nobel comenzaron el lunes, cuando los estadounidenses Victor Ambros y Gary Ruvkun ganaron el premio de Medicina por su descubrimiento de fragmentos diminutos de material genético que sirven como interruptores dentro de las células y ayudan a controlar lo que hacen las células y cómo lo hacen.

Si los científicos pueden aprender cómo funcionan y cómo manipularlos, algún día podrían llevar a potentes tratamientos para enfermedades como el cáncer.

El premio de Física incluye 11 millones de coronas suecas (1 millón de dólares) en metálico, que proceden del legado dejado por el creador del certamen, el inventor sueco Alfred Nobel. Se ha concedido en 117 ocasiones. Los laureados están invitados a recibir sus premios en ceremonias el 10 de diciembre, el aniversario e la muerte de Nobel.

Los anuncios de este año continuarán con el galardón de Química el miércoles y el de Literatura el jueves. El Nobel de la Paz se anunciará el viernes, y el de Economía el 14 de octubre."
Saudi Arabia executes Filipino convicted of murder despite Philippine presidential appeal,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/saudi-arabia-philippines-filipino-executed-7c4c3d676659fb0fd3e9774997c17957,2024-10-08T08:05:42Z,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Saudi Arabia has put to death a Filipino citizen convicted of murder despite years of efforts by the Philippines to prevent the execution, including a presidential appeal, officials said Monday.

Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and other officials did not provide details, including the identity of the Filipino and the nature of the case, citing a family request for privacy.

A Philippine official with knowledge of the case, however, said the Filipino was arrested by Saudi Arabian authorities in 2020 after being accused of the killing. The death penalty was handed down with finality last year and the execution was carried out on Saturday, the official said.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the details of the execution publicly.

Asked by reporters for comment, Marcos said the execution was ""very unfortunate"" and that his administration would provide help to the executed person's family.

""We appealed to the better nature, I guess, of our friends in Saudi Arabia, perhaps, to have another look and they did,"" Marcos said. ""Unfortunately, the law there is very strict and, apparently, the conviction has stood and one of ours has been taken away.""

The Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said the Philippine government provided legal help ""and exhausted all possible remedies, including a presidential letter of appeal"" to try to stop the execution, but that the victim's family had refused to accept ""blood money,"" a financial settlement to secure forgiveness.

Saudi Arabia has drawn criticism from human rights groups for its methods of capital punishment, including beheadings and mass executions. In the past, Saudi Arabian authorities publicly pinned the body and severed head of executed people on poles as a warning to others.

At least 86 Filipinos, including 63 males and 23 females, are facing the death penalty worldwide, many for murder and illegal drug-related offenses, according to Philippine officials.

Millions of Filipinos work in countries around the world to e scape poverty and unemployment at home and to provide for their families.

The large amount of money they send home has supported the Philippines' consumption-driven economy for decades, but the largescale deployment of Filipino workers has had social costs, including broken families, human trafficking and abuse by employers, especially of housemaids in the Middle East."
China announces more support for economy but holds back on major spending package,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-monetary-fiscal-stimulus-85d066a30085549200cdff18984c343a,2024-10-08T06:48:28Z,"HONG KONG (AP) -- China's economic planning agency outlined details of measures aimed at boosting the economy on Tuesday but refrained from major spending initiatives.

The piecemeal nature of the plans announced Tuesday appeared to disappoint investors who were hoping for bolder moves, and Shanghai's benchmark gave up a 10% initial gain as markets reopened after a weeklong holiday to trade just 3% higher.

The head of the National Development and Reform Commission said the government will frontload 100 billion yuan ($14.1 billion) in spending from the government's budget for 2025 in addition to another 100 billion yuan for construction projects.

The scale of spending overall was well below the multi-trillion yuan levels that analysts said might be expected.

The NDRC's chairman, Zheng Shanjie, said China was still on track to attain its full-year economic growth target of around 5%. But he acknowledged the economy faces difficulties and an increasingly ""more complex and extreme"" global environment.

China's leaders have been struggling to rev up growth since the COVID-19 pandemic ended. A downturn in the property market has deepened that challenge, as consumer spending has lagged and global demand also has slowed.

In a note, UBS chief China economist Tao Wang said that the market was ""likely expecting a significant fiscal stimulus.""

A modest package of 1.5 to 2 trillion yuan ($210 billion to $280 billion) is more reasonable to expect in the near-term, she said, with another 2 to 3 trillion yuan ($280 billion to $420 billion) in 2025.

In September, China unveiled a monetary stimulus package including cuts to mortgage rates and in the amount of reserves are required to keep on deposit with the central bank. Those and other measures were the most aggressive efforts so far to try to pull the property industry out of the doldrums and spur faster growth.

On Tuesday, the NDRC said that new measures would focus on boosting investment and spending and supporting small and medium-sized businesses that operate at a disadvantage to large, state-corporations.

But much of the information focused on technical issues such as payment regulations, management of projects and deployment of bonds for financing.

To counter falling housing sales and home prices, Zheng said there would be ""comprehensive policy measures to help stop the decline in the real estate market.""

""In response to volatility and declines in the stock market, we will introduce a series of powerful and effective measures to strive to boost the capital market,"" he said, without giving details."
Mozambique's presidential election: Here's what to know,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-elections-president-nyusi-insurgency-climate-explainer-35d66b57f691671c343185dc5c493dd7,2024-10-08T04:13:05Z,"MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Mozambicans are expected to turn out in large numbers on Wednesday for an election that will choose a successor to President Filipe Nyusi after his two terms.

Close to 17 million voters in the southern African nation of 31 million people are registered to vote for the next president along with 250 members of parliament and provincial assemblies.

While the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo, is widely expected to retain power, at least four candidates have been campaigning to bring change to a country which faces a yearslong jihadist insurgency in its north and whose long Indian Ocean coastline is vulnerable to extreme climate conditions like flooding.

Over 1.3 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to the insurgency, while millions more have faced severe food shortages due to drought.

The local elections held in Mozambique a year ago were marred by allegations of vote-rigging and fraud, sparking violent protests in the capital, Maputo, and surrounding areas. This time, concerns have been muted.

Here's what to know about Wednesday's vote:

The ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power since independence from Portugal in 1975, has fielded David Chapo as its presidential candidate. The 47-year-old Chapo is a former governor of the southern province of Inhambane, a strong driver of the country's tourism economy.

Chapo is expected to face the most competition from 50-year-old Venacio Mondlane, a banker and forestry engineer who runs as an independent candidate under the slogan ""Save Mozambique, this country's ours"" and has drawn large crowds.

Mondlane is backed by the Optimistic Party for the Development of Mozambique, or Podemos, set up by dissidents from the ruling party. He ran as a mayoral candidate in local elections last year, and his supporters alleged that he won but was robbed.

The Democratic Movement of Mozambique has fielded Lutero Simango. His party was created in 2008, breaking away from the rebel group-turned-opposition party Mozambique National Resistance, or Renamo. Simango's party resonates with youth because of its policies on inequality and jobs.

Renamo is represented by Ossufo Momade, who became the party's head after the death of the charismatic Afonso Dhlakama, a former rebel leader who died in 2018.

Mozambique has been fighting an Islamic State-affiliated group that has launched attacks on communities in the northern province of Cabo Delgado since 2017, including beheadings.

Around 600,000 of the 1.3 million people who fled have since returned home, many to shattered communities where houses, markets, churches, schools and health facilities have been destroyed, the United Nations said earlier this year.

The candidates have promised to address development issues exacerbated by the insurgency, including the halting of a crucial gas project by French energy company TotalEnergies in northern Mozambique as a result of the extremist rebel insurgency there.

Mozambique also faces high levels of unemployment and hunger, exacerbated by El Nino-induced severe drought. According to the U.N. World Food Program, 1.3 million people face severe food shortages.

The ruling Frelimo party has been tainted by corruption scandals, including the so-called ""tuna bond"" scandal in which former finance minister Manuel Chang was jailed earlier this year for taking payoffs to arrange secret loan guarantees for government-controlled fishing companies.

The loans were plundered, and Mozambique ended up with $2 billion in ""hidden debt,"" spurring a financial crisis as the International Monetary Fund halted financial support.

There is just one day of voting and counting starts immediately, with partial results announced as they trickle in. Official results will be announced by the National Election Commission after 15 days and subsequently validated by the Constitutional Council. Any party may file objections with the council, which will decide whether they have merit."

What polling shows about Black voters' views of Harris and Trump,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-black-voters-biden-78e344ddea4886dd23582f4a51eb0da6,2024-10-08T04:06:13Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive view of Vice President Kamala Harris, but they're less sure that she would change the country for the better, according to a recent poll from the  AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

The poll, which was conducted in mid-September, found about 7 in 10 Black voters have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, with few differences between Black men and women voters on how they view the Democratic candidate. Younger and older Black voters also had similar views of the vice president.

Black voters' opinions of former President Donald Trump, by contrast, were overwhelmingly negative, underscoring the challenges that the Republican candidate faces as he seeks to erode Harris' support among Black men. Black voters are an important Democratic constituency, and few are aligned with the Republican Party. According to the survey, two-thirds of Black voters identify as Democrats, about 2 in 10 identify as independents and about 1 in 10 identify as Republicans.

But the poll also found that despite this dramatic gap in views of the candidates, Black voters are less certain of whether Harris would set the country on a better trajectory, or make a substantial difference in their own lives. Only about half of Black voters say ""would change the country for the better"" describes Harris very or extremely well, while about 3 in 10 say it describes her ""somewhat well"" and about 2 in 10 say it describes her ""not very well"" or ""not well at all."" And only about half believe the outcome of this presidential election will have ""a great deal"" or ""quite a bit"" of impact on them personally, an assessment that's in line with Americans overall.

""The Democratic Party is not strong enough for me,"" said Raina Johnson, 53, a safety case manager in Chicago. Johnson predicted that Harris would ""try to do something for the people"" but she felt that Harris would be limited as it was ""with (Barack) Obama, because the Republican Party shut him down.""

While Johnson felt that the stakes of the election were extremely high, she did not think it would have a large personal impact on her.

""Because I'll still live my life. I'll just have to roll with the punches,"" she said.

When asked which candidate would do a better job handling their top issues, including the economy, health care and crime, Black voters had the same answer: Harris.

Like voters overall, about 8 in 10 Black voters said the economy is one of the most important issues to their vote. But about three-quarters of Black voters said health care was one of their most important issues, compared to slightly more than half of registered voters, and they were also more likely than the electorate as a whole to say gun policy and crime were top issues.

In all of those areas, as well as on other topics like abortion and climate change, Harris held a commanding advantage over Trump among Black voters. But the size of that edge was bigger on some issues than others. About 6 in 10 Black voters said Harris was better positioned to handle the economy, while about 2 in 10 said this about Trump, giving Harris about a 40-point advantage. On abortion policy, she had around a 60-point advantage over Trump.

The Trump campaign has stepped up with some outreach to Black communities this year. The former president's campaign believes that his message on the economy, immigration and traditional values can make notable inroads into the Democrats' traditional base of support among Black voters, especially younger Black men.

Rod Wettlin, a retired Air Force veteran in Surprise, Arizona, who wants greater action on issues like health care and immigration, said he was deeply opposed to Trump and was concerned about the implications of the election for American democracy.

""What's going on now is the culmination of a lot of stuff that's been in our face for years,"" said Wettlin. ""Hopefully after the election it is civil, but these cats out here are already calling for bedlam. And that's their right, I fought for them to have that right. But don't infringe on mine.""

There are signs that some groups of Black voters see Harris as a stronger figure, though. Black women voters and older Black voters were especially likely to describe Harris as someone who would ""fight for people like you,"" compared to Black men and younger Black voters.

Relatively few Black voters have a positive view of Trump, or see him as a candidate who has important qualities for the presidency. The poll found that about 8 in 10 Black voters have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Trump, while just 15%  have a somewhat or very favorable view. About 1 in 10 said ""would change the country for the better"" or ""would fight for people like you"" describes Trump at least very well, and a similarly low share of Black voters said that Trump would make a good president.

""I think we're headed in the right direction if Kamala Harris gets it,"" said Roslyn Coble, 63, and a resident of Oakboro, North Carolina. ""But if Donald Trump gets it, it's going to be bad. He already told us what he's going to do. He's going to be a dictator.""

About 7 in 10 Black voters say the phrase ""will say anything to win the election"" describes Trump at least very well.

In a sign of how former President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw as the Democratic candidate in July may have altered the race, only 55% of Black men voters have a favorable view of Biden, compared to 7 in 10 Black women voters.

""He did his best,"" said Wettlin. He said that Biden should have bowed out of the presidential race far sooner and was skeptical of some of his achievements.

Black voter engagement organizations say they have also seen a burst of energy from voters and advocates since Harris' entrance into the race, and both the Harris and Trump campaigns are continuing to focus on this group.

The Trump campaign has been conducting listening sessions and community events in Black neighborhoods in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee. The campaign has also coordinated a ""Black Voices for Trump"" bus tour across cities in September. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign has held a number of events geared toward Black voters, especially Black men, and has deployed a number of high-profile surrogates, including lawmakers, celebrities and civil rights leaders, to Black communities in recent weeks.

The poll of 1,771 registered voters was conducted Sept. 12-16, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points."
"Stock market today: Chinese shares soar, then fade as Beijing outlines details of stimulus",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-treasury-china-rates-c1c41b35ddbb4fd0bf93ee93df1f1a2c,2024-10-08T03:48:19Z,"TOKYO (AP) -- Shares soared Tuesday in Shanghai as Chinese markets reopened after a weeklong holiday but then gave up a chunk of their initial gains as officials in Beijing outlined details of plans to revive the world's second-largest economy.

The Shanghai Composite index was up 5.5% at 3,519.88 and in Shenzhen, Japan's smaller market, the main index gained 5.3%. The Shanghai benchmark initially gained 10% but fell back as officials of China's main economic planning agency briefed reporters about a slew of policies announced earlier meant to address key problems such as a property market slump.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng sank 5.8% to 21,758.45 as traders sold to lock in profits from recent gains.

""China's markets rally has hit a wall, leaving investors deflated. The reopening surge from the week-long holiday barely had time to gather steam before fizzling out, and now the once-thrilled bulls are licking their wounds,"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.

Elsewhere in Asia, markets were mostly lower.

Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 1.2% to 38,861.09. as the dollar fell to 147.91 Japanese yen from 148.18 yen. A weaker yen tends to push share prices higher.

The Kospi in Seoul declined 0.5% to 2,596.38. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.2% to 8,187.10.

On Monday, U.S. stocks slid after Treasury yields hit their highest levels since the summer and oil prices continued to climb.

The S&P 500 dropped 1% to 5,695.94 and is still close to its all-time high set a week earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9% to 41,954.24, coming off its own record. The Nasdaq composite sank 1.2% to 17,923.90.

It's a stall for U.S. stocks after they rallied to records on relief that interest rates are finally heading back down, now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming instead of just fighting high inflation. A blowout report on U.S. jobs growth released Friday raised optimism about the economy and hopes that the Fed can pull off a perfect landing for it.

When Treasury bonds, which are seen as the safest possible investments, are paying more in interest, investors become less inclined to pay very high prices for stocks and other things that carry bigger risk of losing money.

It's more difficult to look attractive to investors seeking income when a 10-year Treasury is paying a 4.02% yield, up from 3.97% late Friday and from 3.62% three weeks ago.

The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, jumped more on Monday. It rose to 3.99% from 3.92% late Friday.

Treasury yields may also be feeling upward push from the recent jump in oil prices. Crude prices have been spurting higher on worries that worsening tensions in the Middle East could ultimately lead to disruptions in the flow of oil.

Brent crude, the international standard, shed $1.23 to $79.70 per barrel. It had jumped 3.7% Monday. Benchmark U.S. crude, meanwhile, slipped $1.24 to $75.90. It also gained 3.7% on Monday.

Stocks that are seen as the most expensive can feel the most downward pressure from higher Treasury yields, and the spotlight has been on Big Tech stocks. They drove the majority of the S&P 500's returns in recent years and soared to heights that critics called overdone.

Apple fell 2.3%, Amazon dropped 3% and Alphabet sank 2.4% to act as some of Monday's heaviest weights on the S&P 500.

An exception was Nvidia, which rose another 2.3%. It rode another upswell in excitement about artificial-intelligence technology after Super Micro Computer soared 15.8% after saying it recently shipped more than 100,000 graphics processing units with liquid cooling.

If Treasury yields keep rising, companies will likely need to deliver bigger profits to drive their stock prices much higher, and this week marks the start of the latest corporate earnings reporting season.

Analysts say earnings per share grew 4.2% during the summer for S&P 500 companies from a year earlier, led by technology and health care companies, according to FactSet. If those analysts are correct, it would be a fifth straight quarter of growth.

In other dealings early Tuesday, the euro rose to $1.0986 from $1.0977.

Intelligence officials say US adversaries are targeting congressional races with disinformation,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/congress-russia-trump-china-cuba-disinformation-election-a4de250124d7cb93f16718831d0715a9,2024-10-07T22:33:09Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's not just the presidential election: Foreign governments are targeting House and Senate races around the country in their effort to meddle with American democracy this election year, intelligence officials warned Monday.

Russia, China and Cuba have all launched influence operations designed to help or hurt candidates in specific congressional races. Without giving specifics about the number of affected races, an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Monday that all three countries have zeroed in on races where they believe they have a national security interest at stake.

The warning from intelligence officials comes during a particularly tight battle for the House and Senate, where control could be decided by just a handful of races. While much of the attention has focused on attempts by foreign adversaries to influence the presidential race, Monday's warning underscores the threat that online disinformation also poses in state and local contests.

Leaders in Russia, China and Cuba understand the American political system well enough to recognize that this year's close elections create good conditions for the use and spread of disinformation, said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity under rules set by the office of the director.

Foreign adversaries have also targeted some races even further down the ballot, including statewide offices and state legislative campaigns, the official said.

Moscow's goal is to erode support for congressional candidates who favor assisting Ukraine in its war with Russia. Officials wouldn't say which candidates were targeted, but it's likely that the Kremlin's effort is intended to hurt Democrats and centrist Republicans who have supported Ukraine.

China has targeted candidates from both parties based on their stance on issues of key importance to Beijing, including support for Taiwan. Officials said they have observed Chinese disinformation agencies focusing on candidates in ""tens"" of races.

Cuba's government has mounted a narrower operation aimed at boosting candidates it believes would favor better relations with the island, such as reduced economic sanctions.

Influence operations can include false or exaggerated claims and propaganda designed to mislead voters about specific candidates, issues or races. It can also include social media posts or other digital content that seeks to suppress the vote through intimidation or by giving voters false information about election procedures.

Along with cyberattacks on election systems, influence operations that stoke distrust and divisiveness are a critical threat facing the 2024 election, national security officials have said.

State and local authorities have invested heavily in securing the vote that last week, Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told The Associated Press there is no way a foreign adversary could alter the overall results.

Disinformation can be a harder threat to quantify. Foreign adversaries create networks of fake websites and social media accounts mimicking Americans, and then work to amplify divisive and incendiary claims about contentious debates like immigration, the economy or the federal government's response to disasters.

Officials in Russia, China, Iran and Cuba have all rejected accusations that their governments are trying to interfere with the U.S. election, despite indications that the use of disinformation designed to influence the outcome of this year's elections is increasing.

When foreign governments target a specific candidate, office or organization with election information they are often given what's called a defensive briefing by intelligence officials. While ODNI won't say how many defensive briefings they have delivered so far this election cycle, they say the number is three times higher than the previous cycle.

In the presidential race, intelligence officials have concluded that Russia supports Trump, who has criticized Ukraine and the NATO alliance while praising Russian President Vladimir Putin. They have assessed that China is taking a neutral stance in the race between the Republican former president and Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat.

Iran opposes Trump's reelection, intelligence officials have said, seeing him as more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran. Trump's administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran's leaders to vow revenge.

Last month federal authorities charged three Iranian men for their alleged involvement in Iran's hacking of Trump's campaign. Iran later offered the material to Trump's Democratic opponent, but no one replied.

Officials said Monday they have seen no indications that Iranian disinformation is targeting down ballot races so far in 2024."
"As Milton takes aim at Florida, why is Tampa Bay so vulnerable to hurricanes?",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-milton-tampa-bay-ace324900762a0e3c385830f3cf1479b,2024-10-07T20:04:49Z,"The last time the eye of a major storm like Hurricane Milton struck Tampa Bay, in 1921, the city was a sleepy backwater of a few hundred thousands people. A century later, it's among the fastest-growing metropolises in the United States, with more than 3 million people, and highly vulnerable to flooding due to climate change. As Milton barrels toward the Gulf Coast of Florida, strengthening Monday into a Category 5 storm, experts are worried that a century of luck could come to a sudden end.

Here's what to know:

The National Hurricane Center is predicting storm surge in Tampa Bay and surrounding waters of between 8 and 12 feet (2.5 to 3 meters) above normal tide conditions, and rainfall of between 4 and 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) because of Hurricane Milton.

The entire Gulf Coast of Florida is especially vulnerable to storm surge. Last week, Hurricane Helene, which came ashore some 150 miles (240 kilometers) away from Tampa in the Florida Panhandle, still managed to cause drowning deaths in the Tampa area due to surges of around 5 to 8 feet (1.5 to 2.5 meters) above normal tide levels.

""Had it made landfall just little farther to the south and east, it could have been a lot, lot worse,"" said Philip Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University.

The heightened risk is partially a result of topography. The Gulf of Mexico coastline of Florida is shallow with a gentle, sloping shelf. The higher ocean floor acts as a barrier that retains the storm's outflow of water, forcing the ocean to surge onto shore. That's the opposite of Florida's east coast, where the ocean floor drops suddenly a few miles from the coast.

""You can have the same storm, the same intensity, the same everything, but very different surges,"" said Klotzbach.

A 2015 report from the Boston-based catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark and Co. concluded that Tampa Bay is the most vulnerable place in the U.S. to storm surge flooding from a hurricane and stands to lose $175 billion in damage.

While Floridians are no strangers to storms, Tampa hasn't been in the direct path of a major hurricane in over a century.

In that lapse, the area has exploded in growth. Tens of thousands of Americans moved to the area during the COVID-19 pandemic, with many choosing to settle along barrier islands like Clearwater and St. Petersburg overlooking the normally placid, emerald Gulf waters. More than 51,000 people moved to the area between 2022 and 2023, making it the fifth-largest-growing U.S. metropolitan area, according to U.S. Census data.

Longer term residents, after having experienced numerous false alarms and near misses like Irma in 2017, may be similarly unprepared for a direct hit. A local legend has it that blessings from Native Americans who once called the region home and used to build mounds to keep out invaders have largely protected the area from major storms for centuries.

MIT meteorology professor Kerry Emanuel said a hurricane in Tampa is the ""black swan"" worst-case scenario that experts have worried about for years.

""It's a huge population. It's very exposed, very inexperienced and that's a losing proposition,"" Emanuel, who has studied hurricanes for 40 years, said. ""I always thought Tampa would be the city to worry about most.""

Also lurking in the waves and wind are the effects of climate change. Rising temperatures from greenhouse gas emissions have warmed the oceans, led to sea level rise and added moisture to the air -- all key factors determining a hurricane's strength and the potential flooding it can cause.

""Due to global warming, global climate models predict hurricanes will likely cause more intense rainfall and have an increased coastal flood risk due to higher storm surge caused by rising seas,"" Angela Colbert, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, wrote in a 2022 report.

On Monday, the National Hurricane Center upgraded Milton to a Category 5 storm after it gained 75 mph (120 kph) of intensity in the last 24 hours. One reason may be especially high water temperatures, which act like fuel for the storm.

""Milton's rapid intensification is incredible,"" University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said in an email. ""I've been pointing out for months, the Gulf has been and is record or near-record warm.""

The researcher noted that, due to rising sea levels brought on by climate change, Hurricane Andrew's storm surge today would be 7 inches (17 centimeters) higher than it was when that storm pounded South Florida 30 years ago.

Officials in the area began issuing evacuation orders Monday for residents in six counties surrounding Tampa Bay that are home to almost 4 million people. Residents of mobile homes, RVs and manufactured homes not capable of withstanding winds of up to 110 mph (177 kph) are especially at risk.

Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie strongly urged people to leave coastal areas, noting people who died on barrier islands during Hurricane Ian in 2022 would still be alive if they just crossed the bridge to the mainland and found shelter.

""Please, if you're in the Tampa Bay area, you need to evacuate. If they have called an evacuation order, I beg you, I implore you to evacuate. Drowning deaths due to storm surge are 100% preventable if you leave,"" Guthrie said.

Almost inexplicably, storms seem to by bypass Tampa, with most Gulf disturbances passing well north of the city. The last time the Tampa area was hit by the eye of a major hurricane was Oct. 25, 1921. The hurricane had no official name but is known locally as the Tarpon Springs storm, for the seaside town where it came ashore.

The storm surge from that hurricane, estimated at Category 3 with winds of up to 129 mph (207 kph) was pegged at 11 feet (3.3 meters). At least eight people died, and damage was estimated at $5 million at the time.

Now, the tourist-friendly area known for its sandy white beaches has grown by leaps and bound, with an economy estimated to be worth nearly $200 billion. Hurricane Milton threatens to wash away all of that development.

Will global soccer be reshaped after EU's top court issued a major ruling in Lassana Diarra case?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/soccer-diarra-case-explainer-transfers-5cca63020ecd634172e6ba8ef7cda705,2024-10-07T15:25:13Z,"The global soccer transfer market, worth more than $10 billion each season, is facing a revolutionary overhaul or a nuanced evolution following last week's ruling by the European Court of Justice in the Lassana Diarra case.

By ruling that some FIFA regulations on player transfers are contrary to EU legislation relating to competition and freedom of movement, the bloc's top court has paved the way for deep changes in the sport's economy.

Here is a look at the key elements of the case and the possible impact of the landmark ruling.

Lassana Diarra is a former much-traveled footballer whose career saw him play for prestigious clubs such as Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid. He represented France 34 times. At one point in his career, Diarra moved to the Russian league. It's a dispute with Lokomotiv Moscow that triggered the legal case examined by the European Court of Justice (ECJ).

Diarra signed a four-year contract with Lokomotiv in 2013. The deal was terminated a year later after he was unhappy with alleged pay cuts. Lokomotiv applied to the FIFA dispute resolution chamber for compensation and the player submitted a counterclaim seeking compensation for unpaid wages. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found the Russian club terminated the contract ""with just cause"" and the player had to pay 10.5 million euros ($11.2 million). Diarra said his search for a new team was hampered by FIFA rules stipulating that any new club would be jointly responsible with him for paying compensation to Lokomotiv.

Free movement is a fundamental right of workers in the European Union within the single market. On that basis, the EU's top court said that the FIFA rules, including the one that resulted in the refusal to provide Diarra with an international transfer certificate (ITC) for a move to Charleroi, restricted his freedom of movement.

The court also found that FIFA regulations breached the bloc's competition law because they aim at restricting and preventing ""cross-border competition which could be pursued by all clubs established in the European Union.""

The ECJ ruling will now be referred back to the appeal court in Mons, Belgium, which will rule on the Diarra case. This could take years rather than months. Although FIFA said it was satisfied ""that the legality of key principles of the transfer system have been reconfirmed,"" Diarra's lawyers claimed ""total victory.""

The judges in Luxembourg acknowledged having stability in player rosters and regularity in competitions are legitimate objectives for FIFA, but that rules must be applied proportionally.

Some analysts have compared it to the ECJ's 1995 decision on Belgian Jean-Marc Bosman. That ruling removed restrictions placed on foreign EU footballers within national leagues and allowed players in the bloc to move to another club for free when their contracts ended. Those principles had an obviously wider focus than the narrower scope of Diarra, about terminating a contract for cause.

For now, the decision on Diarra does not change how the transfer market functions. But many legal experts believe that the ruling will ultimately have major effects on the sport's economy.

""The decision essentially says the current system is too restrictive and so will have to change,"" said Ian Giles, a partner at Norton Rose Fulbright law firm. ""It's entirely possible this means players will feel they can now break contracts and sign on with new clubs, without the selling club being able to hold them or demand significant transfer fees. This will likely result in reduced transfer fees and more economic power for players -- but over time things will have to stabilize to allow clubs to remain economically viable.""

It took more than five years after the Bosman ruling for updated FIFA transfer rules to be published in 2001. Some of those debates then will now be revisited.

A major reset of transfer fee values can seriously affect many smaller market clubs. Bosman already accelerated gaps in wealth and competitive balance across European soccer, which is increasingly dominated by a small group of clubs. They can lure free-agent players with higher signing bonuses and salaries - money that previously would be more widely distributed via transfer fees.

Spending by super-wealthy clubs can still reward smaller ones who excel at investing time and expertise in scouting and developing local and global talent: Ajax, Brighton, Genk in Belgium, which nurtured Kevin De Bruyne, Thibaut Courtois and Leandro Trossard.

The influential European Club Association, which represents more than 700 teams, sees potential threats to the industry's health in the fallout from Diarra. Transfer fees and payments to clubs from former players being sold later in their career ""are an efficient and effective means of wealth distribution from bigger clubs to smaller ones,"" the ECA noted.

The soccer industry is increasingly a game being played by lawyers in courts and government offices.

FIFA is being challenged in several legal arenas, in part because it works (Diarra, Super League, agents regulations ). There is also a growing perception FIFA does not listen before launching projects and that pro-transparency reforms demanded and passed a decade ago are in decline.

Within hours of the Diarra ruling Friday, the group of domestic leagues and player unions announced a news conference in Brussels for Oct. 14 to explain their filing to the European Commission. The complaint on competition law grounds argues FIFA adds new and bigger tournaments to the congested calendar without proper consultation.

European Leagues and FIFPRO once had a seat at FIFA's Football Stakeholders Committee that was a key forum for debate, including on the transfer market. FIFA paused the panel in 2021 and soon its president Gianni Infantino pushed for playing World Cups every two years. The idea was resisted by a widespread backlash. The leagues group says the Diarra ruling shows how representation at FIFA is ""becoming legally essential.""

FIFA had indicated before Friday it would consult widely on transfer market reforms it believes can focus on specific issues raised by Diarra, rather than a total overhaul.

Diarra's lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont -- who also represented Bosman 30 years ago -- sees a bigger picture. He appeared to be recruiting for a wider suit against FIFA by claiming ""all professional players have been affected by these illegal rules"" and could now seek compensation."
Dos estadounidenses ganan el Nobel de Medicina por su descubrimiento del microARN,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-49489c47122a1cc5ba6e78dcf15a98ff,2024-10-07T14:18:25Z,"ESTOCOLMO (AP) -- Los estadounidenses Victor Ambros y Gary Ruvkun ganaron el lunes el Nobel de Medicina por su descubrimiento del microARN, fragmentos diminutos de material genético que modifican cómo funcionan los genes a nivel celular y que podrían llevar a nuevos tratamientos contra el cáncer.

Sus hallazgos ""están demostrando ser de importancia fundamental"" en la comprensión del desarrollo y el funcionamiento de los organismos, explicó la Asamblea del Nobel del Instituto Karolinska en su anuncio oficial.

El microARN ha abierto nuevas estrategias para los científicos a la hora de tratar enfermedades como el cáncer al ayudar a regular cómo funcionan los genes a nivel celular, indicó la doctora Claire Fletcher, profesora de oncología molecular en el Imperial College London.

El microARN proporciona las instrucciones genéticas que indican a las células que produzcan nuevas proteínas, explicó Fletcher, y hay dos campos principales en los que puede resultar útil: en el desarrollo de fármacos que traten enfermedades y para servir como biomarcadores.

""El microARN modifica cómo funcionan los genes en la célula"", dijo Fletcher, una experta que no está relacionada con el premio Nobel.

""Si tomamos el ejemplo del cáncer, tendremos a un gen concreto trabajando de más, podría haber mutado y está trabajando en exceso"", dijo. ""Podemos tomar un microARN que sabemos modifica la actividad de ese gen y podemos suministrar ese microARN concreto a las células cancerosas para que ese gen mutado deje de tener su efecto"".

Ambrose realizó la investigación que le valió el premio en la Universidad de Harvard. Actualmente es profesor de ciencias naturales en la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Massachusetts. Por su parte, Ruvkun hizo su investigación en el Hospital General de Massachusetts y en la Facultad de Medicina de Harvard, donde es profesor de genética, indicó Thomas Perlmann, secretario general del Comité del Nobel.

Perlmann dijo que había hablado con Ruvkun por teléfono poco antes del anuncio.

""Tardó mucho en llegar al teléfono y parecía muy cansado, pero en seguida estuvo bastante emocionado y feliz, cuando comprendió de qué iba todo"", dijo Perlmann.

El premio de medicina se ha entregado 114 veces a un total de 227 laureados. Apenas 13 mujeres han conseguido el reconocimiento, que incluye 11 millones de coronas suecas (un millón de dólares) en efectivo, obtenidas de un fondo dejado por el creador del certamen, el inventor sueco Alfred Nobel.

Los ganadores del año pasado fueron la húngaro-estadounidense Katalin Karikó y el estadounidense Drew Weissman, por descubrimientos que permitieron la creación de vacunas de ARN mensajero contra el COVID-19, que fueron cruciales para frenar la pandemia.

El premio de Medicina da inicio a la temporada de los Nobel, que continúa el martes con el premio de Física, el miércoles con el de química y el de literatura el jueves. El Nobel de la Paz se anunciará el viernes y el de Economía el 14 de octubre.

Los laureados están invitados a recibir sus premios en ceremonias el 10 de diciembre, el aniversario de la muerte de Nobel.

Hay pruebas clínicas en marcha para estudiar cómo podrían emplearse técnicas con microARN para ayudar a tratar el cáncer de piel, aunque todavía no hay ningún tratamiento farmacológico aprobado por los organismos reguladores, indicó Fletcher. Eso podría tomar entre cinco y 10 años, estimó.

El microARN ofrece otra forma de controlar el comportamiento de los genes para tratar y seguir el rastro a diferentes enfermedades, añadió.

""La mayoría de terapias que tenemos en este momento van dirigidas a las proteínas en las células"", dijo. ""Si podemos intervenir al nivel del microARN, eso abre toda una nueva forma de desarrollar medicinas y controlar la actividad de los genes cuyos niveles pueden verse alterados en enfermedades"".

India ofrece ayuda a las Maldivas en intento por mejorar relaciones,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-4d3450156897e127392c7b9f91c968cf,2024-10-07T14:18:00Z,"NUEVA DELHI (AP) -- India aumentó su asistencia para el desarrollo de las Maldivas luego que los dos líderes sostuvieron conversaciones en Nueva Delhi el lunes, en un intento por reparar unas relaciones maltrechas luego que el presidente del archipiélago buscó lazos más cercanos con China.

Tras las conversaciones, el primer ministro indio Narendra Modi dijo que India ofrecerá apoyo financiero a las Maldivas por medio de bonos del tesoro de 100 millones de dólares. Los países además firmaron un acuerdo para canje de divisas valorado en 400 millones de dólares.

Los dos líderes inauguraron a distancia la nueva pista del Aeropueto Internacional Hanimaadhoo en las Maldivas, y Modi anunció que se acelerarán las labores de una iniciativa para vincular a las islas del archipiélago por medio de una moderna red de transporte.

""India es el vecino más cercano de las Maldivas y un amigo cercano"", dijo Modi en conferencia de prensa conjunta. Añadió que las Maldivas ocupa una posición importante en la política de ""primero los países vecinos"".

Las tensiones entre India y las Maldivas han aumentado desde que el presidente Mohamed Muizzu, quien favorece lazos más estrechos con China, fue elegido el año pasado al derrotar al entonces presidente Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, quien favorecía lazos con la India. Previo a las elecciones, Muizzu había prometido expulsar a soldados indios desplegados en las Maldivas como parte de una misión humanitaria. En mayo, India reemplazó a decenas de soldados suyos con expertos civiles.

En enero, los líderes maldivos fustigaron a Modi por promover el archipiélago Lakshadweep de la India para los viajeros indios, considerando que era un intento de desalentar a los turistas indios de ir a las Maldivas. Ello provocó enojadas protestas de celebridades indias que llamaron a boicotear a los sitios turísticos maldivos. El turismo es un pilar de la economía maldiva.

La disputa se agravó cuando Muizzu visitó China antes de visitar a la India en enero, lo que la India consideró como un desaire. Al regresar, Muizzu anunció planes de poner fin a la dependencia de la India que tenía su país en los sectores salud e importación de productos básicos."

Maldives President Muizzu to meet India's Modi to repair strained diplomatic ties,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/india-maldives-muizzu-modi-884a8b1843a7ac227430bc12b47ad15e,2024-10-07T05:23:30Z,"NEW DELHI (AP) -- Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu is expected to talk Monday with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi as he aims to repair ties between the countries that have been strained since he came to power last year.

Muizzu and Modi are expected to discuss ""bilateral, regional, and international issues of mutual interest,"" according to India's foreign ministry. Muizzu will also hold meetings with senior Indian officials during his five-day India visit.

Tensions between India and Maldives have grown since pro-China Muizzu came to power last year after defeating India-friendly incumbent Ibrahim Mohamed Solih.

Leading up to the 2023 elections, Muizzu had promised to expel Indian soldiers deployed in Maldives to help in humanitarian assistance. In May, New Delhi replaced dozens of these soldiers with civilian experts.

Ties were also strained in January when some Maldivian leaders lashed out at Modi for promoting India's Lakshadweep archipelago for Indian travelers. Lakshadweep is off the southwestern coast of the Indian mainland.

Maldivian leaders saw the move as a way to lure Indian tourists away from their country and encourage them to visit Lakshadweep instead. It sparked angry protests from Indian celebrities who called for a tourism boycott to Maldives. Tourism is the mainstay of the Maldives' economy.

The dispute deepened when Muizzu visited China ahead of India in January, a move which was seen as a snub to New Delhi. On his return, Muizzu spelled out plans to rid his tiny nation of dependence on India for health facilities, medicines, and import of staples.

A thaw ensued after Muizzu attended Modi's June swearing-in ceremony in New Delhi for a third five-year term. Since then, Muizzu has toned down his anti-Indian rhetoric, and official-level contacts have intensified with New Delhi.

India's foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, on Sunday said he was confident Muizzu's talks with Modi would give ""a new impetus"" to the ""friendly ties"" between the countries.

Regional powers India and China compete for influence in the archipelago nation, which is strategically located in the Indian Ocean.

For decades, India has been a critical provider of development assistance to the Maldives, including infrastructure projects, medical care, and health facilities. Meanwhile, Maldives is part of China's ""Belt and Road"" initiative to build ports and highways and expand trade, as well as China's influence across Asia, Africa, and Europe.

Muizzu's visit to New Delhi is essential for Modi, who is facing a challenging time in neighborhood diplomacy with Marxist politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake taking over as Sri Lanka's president and India-friendly Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fleeing to India in August after being forced to resign by students-led protests. Nepal also now has pro-China K.P. Sharma Oli as its prime minister.

Experts say India needs to maintain close ties with Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and the Maldives, which are its traditional spheres of influence."
Mideast violence is spiraling a year since the Gaza war began,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-hezbollah-lebanon-anniversary-73916b17394f093f01ca5554cf26b528,2024-10-07T05:00:00Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- A year after Hamas' fateful attack on southern Israel, the Middle East is embroiled in a war that shows no signs of ending and seems to be getting worse.

Israel's retaliatory offensive was initially centered on the Gaza Strip. But the focus has shifted in recent weeks to Lebanon, where airstrikes have given way to a fast-expanding ground incursion against Hezbollah militants who have fired rockets into Israel since the Gaza war began.

Next in Israel's crosshairs is archenemy Iran, which supports Hamas, Hezbollah and other anti-Israel militants in the region. After withstanding a massive barrage of missiles from Iran last week, Israel has promised to respond. The escalating conflict risks drawing deeper involvement by the U.S., as well as Iran-backed militants in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

When Hamas launched its attack on Oct. 7, 2023, it called on the Arab world to join it in a concerted campaign against Israel. While the fighting has indeed spread, Hamas and its allies have paid a heavy price.

The group's army has been decimated, its Gaza stronghold has been reduced to a cauldron of death, destruction and misery and the top leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah have been killed in audacious attacks.

Although Israel appears to be gaining the edge militarily, the war has been problematic for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, too.

Dozens of Israeli hostages are languishing in Hamas captivity, and a year after Netanyahu pledged to crush the group in ""total victory,"" remnants of the militant group are still battling in pockets of Gaza. The offensive in Lebanon, initially described as ""limited,"" grows by the day. A full-on collision with Iran is a possibility.

At home, Netanyahu faces mass protests over his inability to bring home the hostages, and to many, he will be remembered as the man who led Israel into its darkest moment. Relations with the U.S. and other allies are strained. The economy is deteriorating.

Here are five takeaways from a yearlong war that has upended longstanding assumptions and turned conventional wisdom on its head.

A long list of previously unthinkable events have occurred in mind-boggling fashion.

The Oct. 7 attack was the bloodiest in Israel's history. Young partygoers were gunned down. Cowering families were killed in their homes. In all, about 1,200 people died and 250 were taken hostage. Some Israelis were raped or sexually assaulted.

The ensuing war in Gaza has been the longest, deadliest and most destructive in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Gaza health authorities say nearly 42,000 people have been killed -- roughly 2% of the territory's entire population. Although they do not give a breakdown between civilians and combatants, more than half of the dead have been women and children. Numerous top Hamas officials have been killed.

The damage and displacement in Gaza have reached unseen levels. Hospitals, schools and mosques - once thought to be insulated from violence - have repeatedly been targeted by Israel or caught in the crossfire. Scores of journalists and health workers have been killed, many of them while working in the line of duty.

Months of simmering tensions along Israel's northern border recently boiled over into war.

A growing list of Hezbollah officials - including the group's longtime leader -- have been killed by Israel. Hundreds of Hezbollah members were killed or maimed in explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies. Israel's ground offensive is its first in Lebanon since a monthlong war in 2006.

Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has displaced tens of thousands of Israelis and over 1 million Lebanese. Israel promises to keep pounding Hezbollah until its residents can return to homes near the Lebanese border; Hezbollah says it will keep firing rockets into Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza.

When the war erupted, the days appeared to be numbered for both Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.

Netanyahu's public standing plummeted as he faced calls to step aside. Sinwar fled into Gaza's labyrinth of tunnels as Israel declared him a ""dead man walking.""

Yet both men -- facing war crimes charges in international courts -- remain firmly in charge, and neither appears to be in a rush for a cease-fire.

The end of the war could mean the end of Netanyahu's government, which is dominated by hard-line partners opposed to a cease-fire. That would mean early elections, potentially pushing him into the opposition while he stands trial on corruption charges. Also looming is the prospect of an unflattering official inquiry into his government's failures before and during the Oct. 7 attack.

Fearing that, his coalition has hung together even through mass protests and repeated disagreements with top security officials pushing for a deal to bring home the hostages. After a brief period of post-Oct. 7 national unity, Israel has returned to its divided self -- torn between Netanyahu's religious, conservative, nationalist right-wing base and his more secular, middle-class opposition.

Sinwar, believed to be hiding in Gaza's tunnels, continues to drive a hard bargain in hopes of declaring some sort of victory. His demands for a full Israeli withdrawal, a lasting cease-fire and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for scores of hostages have been rejected by Israel -- even as much of the international community has embraced them.

With cease-fire efforts deadlocked and Netanyahu's far-right coalition firmly intact, the war could go on for some time. An estimated 1.9 million Palestinians remain displaced in Gaza while an estimated 68 hostages remain captive in Gaza, in addition to the bodies of 33 others held by Hamas.

Early in the war, Netanyahu promised to destroy Hamas' military and governing abilities.

Those goals have been achieved in many ways. Israel says it has dismantled Hamas' military structure, and its rocket barrages have been diminished to a trickle. With Israeli troops stationed indefinitely in Gaza, it is difficult to see how the group could return to governing the territory or pose a serious threat.

But in other ways, total victory is impossible. Despite Israel's overwhelming force, Hamas units have repeatedly regrouped to stage guerrilla-style ambushes from areas where Israel has withdrawn.

Across the Middle East, bitter enemies are witnessing the limits of force and deterrence.

Israel's deepening invasion of Lebanon and repeated strikes on Hezbollah have failed to halt the rockets and missiles. Missile and drone attacks by Iran and its allies have only deepened Israel's resolve. Israel is vowing to strike Iran hard after its latest missile barrage, raising the likelihood of a broader, regionwide war.

Without diplomatic solutions, the fighting is likely to persist.

Israel is still deeply traumatized as people try to come to terms with the worst day in its history.

The Oct. 7 killings and kidnappings had an outsized impact on a tiny country founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Israelis' sense of security was shattered, and their faith in the military was tested like never before.

Photos of Israeli hostages are everywhere, and mass demonstrations are held each week calling on the government to reach a deal to bring them home. The prospect of ongoing war looms over families and workplaces as reserve soldiers brace for repeated tours of duty.

The trauma is far more acute in Gaza - where an estimated 90% of the population remains displaced, many of them living in squalid tent camps.

The scenes have drawn comparisons to what the Palestinian call the Nakba, or catastrophe - the mass displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the war surrounding Israel's creation in 1948. The Palestinians now find themselves looking at a tragedy of even greater scale.

It remains unclear when displaced Palestinians in Gaza will be able to return home and whether there will be anything to return to. The territory has suffered immense destruction and is littered with unexploded bombs. Children are missing a second consecutive school year, virtually every family has lost a relative in the fighting and basic needs like food and health care are lacking.

After a hellish year, the Palestinians of Gaza have no clear path forward, and it could take generations to recover.

The international community's response to this bloodiest of wars has been tepid and ineffective.

Repeated cease-fire calls have been ignored, and a U.S.-led plan to reinstate the Palestinian Authority in postwar Gaza has been rejected by Israel. It remains unclear who will run the territory in the future or who will pay for a cleanup and reconstruction effort that could take decades.

One thing that seems clear is that old formulas will no longer work. The international community's preferred peace formula - the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel - seems hopelessly unrealistic.

Israel's hard-line government opposes Palestinian statehood, says its troops will remain in Gaza for years to come and has further cemented its undeclared annexation of the West Bank. The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority has been pushed to the brink of irrelevance.

For decades, the United States has acted as the key mediator and power broker in the region - calling for a two-state solution but showing little political will to promote that vision. Instead, it has often turned to conflict management, preventing any side from doing anything too extreme to destabilize the region.

This approach went up in smoke on Oct. 7. Since then, the U.S. has responded with a muddled message of criticizing Israel's wartime tactics as too harsh while arming the Israeli military and protecting Israel against diplomatic criticism. The result: The Biden administration has managed to antagonize both Israel and the Arab world while cease-fire efforts repeatedly sputter.

This approach has also alienated the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, complicating Kamala Harris' presidential aspirations. The warring sides appear to have given up on the Biden administration and are waiting for the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election before deciding their next moves.

Whoever wins the race will almost certainly have to find a new formula and recalibrate decades of American policy if they want to end the war."
Stock market today: Asian shares climb after blockbuster US jobs report,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-japan-oil-24925e5840a2491fbc1acc07543bc37d,2024-10-07T04:50:17Z,"Asian shares advanced Monday after a surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report raised optimism about the economy, sparking a rally on Wall Street.

U.S. futures slipped and oil prices also fell.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.9% to 39,354.63 after the yen sank against the U.S. dollar. The Japanese currency has bounced on speculation over the central bank's plans for interest rates since Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba took office last week.

In a policy speech on Friday, Ishiba said he wants to see salary increases that outpace inflation and that he will promote investment to create ""a virtuous cycle of growth and distribution."" He promised economic support for low-income households and measures for regional revitalization and disaster resilience.

But he offered no major new initiatives, and his initial public support ratings are around 50% or lower, relatively low for a new leader, according to Japanese media. He plans to dissolve parliament on Wednesday for an election on Oct. 27.

After surging against the dollar the yen fell back late last week. Early Monday, the dollar was trading at 148.57 yen, down from 148.72 late Friday. Lower interest rates tend to boost prices of shares and other assets.

Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.4% to 23,056.53 and the Kospi in Seoul surged 1.1% to 2,597.34.

Taiwan's Taiex gained 1.3%.

Mainland Chinese markets reopen from a weeklong holiday on Tuesday, and the government said it plans to explain details of plans for economic stimulus at a morning news conference in Beijing. Before the Oct. 1 National Day holiday began, announcements of policies aimed at reviving the ailing property market pushed share benchmarks sharply higher and this week could bring more volatility.

""More fiscal stimulus to stabilize the property market and restructure local government debts, and structural reforms to address the over-capacity and deflation issues are needed to turn around the economy,"" B of A Securities said in a research note, pointing to continued declines in home sales, housing prices and credit growth.

On Friday, the S&P 500 climbed 0.9% and got close to its all-time high set on Monday, closing at 5,751.07. The Dow gained 0.8% to 42,352.75, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.2% to 18,137.85.

Leading the way were banks, airlines, cruise-ship operators and other companies whose profits can benefit the most from a stronger economy where people are working and better able to pay for things. Norwegian Cruise Line steamed 4.9% higher, JPMorgan Chase rose 3.5% and the small companies in the Russell 2000 index gained 1.5%.

Worries over tensions in the Middle East still are casting a shadow, having pushed oil prices sharply higher as the world waits to see how Israel will respond to an Oct. 1 missile attack by Iran.

But U.S. benchmark crude oil slipped 19 cents to $74.19 per barrel early Monday, while Brent crude, the international standard, lost 29 cents to $77.76 per barrel.

Treasury yields soared Friday after the U.S. government said employers added 254,000 more jobs to their payrolls last month than they cut. That was an acceleration from August's hiring pace of 159,000 and blew past economists' forecasts.

Recent encouraging data on the economy have raised hopes that the job market will hold up after the Fed pressed the brakes on the economy through higher rates in order to stamp out high inflation.

The Fed has begun cutting interest rates and Friday's jobs report was so strong traders are now forecasting it will not deliver another half-point interest rate cut before the end of the year after doing so in September.

In other dealings early Monday, the euro rose to $1.0973 from $1.0967."
"Tips, overtime, Social Security: A look at Donald Trump's no-tax pledges and what they might cost",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-taxes-social-security-overtime-tariffs-989016ef41dc1533b05d1871d69c03ff,2024-10-07T04:21:13Z,"Donald Trump has pledged to end taxes on everything from tips to Social Security and overtime pay if he's elected to the White House again. But he hasn't detailed how he would fund those ideas and avoid creating a huge budget shortfall, beyond arguing he will usher in an economic boom.

He argues his ideas would improve Americans' personal financial standing and the overall U.S. economy. A debate about the tax code will be a dominant legislative issue next year given that tax cuts Trump signed in 2017 will be set to expire. If he's elected again, Trump could push Congress to enact some or all of his proposals, though that might be difficult if Democrats end up in control of either the House or the Senate.

Estimates from outside economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts ranged between nearly $6 trillion and $10 trillion over 10 years, depending on which ideas become policy and how they're implemented.

A look at Trump's various tax-related ideas:

In June, Trump announced his plan to exclude workers' tips from federal taxes, saying he got the idea from a waitress at his Las Vegas hotel.

""To those hotel workers and people who get tips, you are going to be very happy, because when I get to office we are going to not charge taxes on tips, people making tips,"" Trump said, adding: ""We're going to do that right away, first thing in office.""

Trump made the announcement in Nevada, a key battleground state with six electoral votes and home to the highest concentration of tipped workers in the country. Nevada has an average of 25.8 waiters and waitresses per 1,000 jobs. President Joe Biden won the state in 2020, but the Trump campaign hopes to put it in play this fall.

Trump has not specified whether he wants to exempt tips from just income taxes or from the payroll tax -- which funds Medicare and Social Security -- as well.

Vice President Kamala Harris has echoed Trump's call for no taxes on tips, making a pledge that would apply to hospitality and service industry workers at a Nevada rally of her own two months after her GOP opponent's announcement.

Trump has also pledged tax cuts for older Americans, posting on Truth Social in July that ""SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!""

The challenge is that taxes on Social Security benefits help to pay for the program. The loss of revenue could mean that Social Security would be unable to pay out its full benefits in 2033, two years ahead of the current estimate, according to Brendan Duke of the liberal Center for American Progress.

According to the Social Security Administration, recipients must currently pay federal income taxes if combined income -- 50% of the benefit amount plus any other earned income -- is higher than $25,000 annually if filing individually, or $32,000 if filing jointly.

While in the Senate, Harris co-sponsored a bill that would have required the wealthy to pay higher Social Security taxes and made benefits more generous for some. The White House has said her views on the program are similar to Biden's, but Harris hasn't talked in detail about Social Security during her campaign.

Trump has also said he would support legislation to eliminate taxes on overtime pay.

""That gives people more of an incentive to work,"" Trump said in September at a campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona. ""It gives the companies a lot, it's a lot easier to get the people.""

Harris has not said if she would also call for cuts to taxes of overtime pay.

Trump's plans include proposed breaks for businesses, too. He's called for lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%, but only for companies that produce in the U.S.

""We're putting America first,"" Trump said. ""This new American industrialism will create millions and millions of jobs.""

As president, Trump signed legislation in 2017 that cut the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.

Harris has said she believes that big corporations and the ultra-wealthy should pay more in taxes -- including a 28% rate for corporations -- and wants to use those revenues to help spur the construction of 3 million homes and offer tax breaks for parents.

Ahead of a September rally on Long Island, Trump pledged that he would ""get SALT back,"" suggesting he would eliminate a cap on state and local tax deductions that were part of tax cut legislation he signed into law in 2017.

The so-called SALT cap has led to bigger tax bills for many residents of New York, New Jersey, California and other high-cost, high-tax states, and is an important campaign issue in those states, particularly among those New York Republicans serving in districts Biden won.

Some Democrats have pushed to lift the $10,000 cap, a move many Republicans have said they oppose. Some, including Trump's former GOP primary foe Nikki Haley, have called for making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. Some of that notion is enshrined in Republicans' 2024 platform, although the permanence provision specifically calls out portions ""that doubled the standard deduction, expanded the Child Tax Credit, and spurred Economic Growth for all Americans.""

Harris has not said that she would try to preserve Trump-era tax cuts, which are set to run out at the end of next year. But, like Biden, she has vowed not to raise taxes for Americans who earn less than $400,000 annually.

Angling to bring back more overseas jobs and manufacturing to the U.S., Trump has said repeatedly that he wants higher tariffs on imported goods, and has said the idea wouldn't increase inflation. He has floated the idea of a universal tariff as high as 20% on all imports and even higher tariffs on Chinese products and on U.S. companies that move factory jobs overseas.

In a recent speech at the Economic Club of New York, Trump suggested that tariffs could be used to solve seemingly unrelated challenges such as the rising cost of child care in the U.S., as part of a broader promise that tariffs can raise trillions of dollars to fund his agenda without those costs being passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. That's a view with which many economists disagree since tariffs directly raise the prices of purchasing goods.

Particularly as it relates to the U.S. auto industry, it's a notion he called for again recently in Savannah, Georgia, where Trump said he'd put a 100% tariff on every car imported from Mexico. Calling for a ""new American industrialism,"" Trump suggested that the only way to avoid those charges would be for an automaker to build the cars in the U.S.

Harris has described Trump's ideas for tariffs as a ""sales tax"" on American households that could cost a typical family roughly $4,000 annually.

"New analysis suggests national debt could increase under Harris, but it would surge under Trump",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/budget-deficit-trump-harris-kamala-debt-1ee3ff65e22ccf19d19b792ee22c46da,2024-10-07T04:13:41Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- No one is likely to be happy with the projected higher deficits laid out in a new analysis of Kamala Harris' and Donald Trump's economic plans.

The analysis released Monday by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests a Harris presidency could increase the national debt over 10 years by $3.5 trillion. That's even though the vice president's campaign insists her proposed investments in the middle class and housing would be fully offset by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. Her campaign policy guide states that Harris is ""committed to fiscal responsibility -- making investments that will support our economy, while paying for them and reducing the deficit at the same time.""

The same analysis says former President Trump's ideas could heap another $7.5 trillion onto the debt and possibly as much as $15.2 trillion. That's even though he suggests growth would be so strong under his watch that no one would need to worry about deficits.

The 34-page report released by the fiscal watchdog group puts a spotlight on the issue of government borrowing that will confront the winner of November's election. Total federal debt held by the public now tops $28 billion and is expected to keep climbing as revenues can't keep up with the growing costs of Social Security, Medicare and other programs. The analysis noted that the expense of servicing that debt in dollar terms has ""eclipsed the cost of defending our nation or providing health care to elderly Americans.""

Drawing on the candidates' speeches, campaign documents and social media posts, the analysis warns bluntly: ""Debt would continue to grow faster than the economy under either candidates' plans and in most scenarios would grow faster and higher than under current law.""

Neither candidate has meaningfully stressed budget deficit reduction in their pitch to voters. But multiple analyses show a clear difference of Harris being much more fiscally responsible than Trump.

Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was the top economist in the Obama White House, estimated in an opinion article for The Wall Street Journal that Harris' plans could cut deficits by $1.5 trillion or raise them by $1.5 trillion. Meanwhile, his estimates show that Trump's plans would increase deficits by $5 trillion, though that figure does not include his plans to charge no taxes on overtime pay and scrap the limit on deductions of state and local taxes.

There are other estimates by The Budget Lab at Yale and the Penn Wharton Budget Model that also show Harris would be better at keeping the deficit in check.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis estimates that Harris' policy ideas could add $3.5 trillion to the national debt through 2035. That conclusion depends on its treatment of how much various programs could cost.

It forecasts that Harris would implement $4.6 trillion in tax reductions, including extensions of some of the expiring 2017 tax cuts that Trump signed into law and tax breaks for parents and no taxes on tipped income for hospitality workers. Roughly $4 trillion in higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy would be insufficient to cover the total cost of her agenda and the additional interest on the debt that it could generate.

Still, the analysis notes that its numbers depend on various interpretations of what Harris has said. It's possible that Harris' agenda would add nothing to baseline deficits, but the report also said it might plausibly add as much as $8.1 trillion in debt in what appears to be a worse-case scenario.

By contrast, Trump's ideas would likely add another $7.5 trillion to the debt. His $2.7 trillion in tariff revenues would be unable to cover $9.2 trillion in tax cuts and additional expenditures such as $350 billion to secure the border and deport unauthorized immigrants.

But the analysis includes other possibilities that show far higher deficits under Trump. If his tariffs raised less money and there were higher costs for his mass deportations and tax breaks, the national debt could jump by $15.2 trillion.

On the other hand, if the tariffs raised $4.3 trillion and there were no costs tied to deportations, Trump's plans could only increase the debt by $1.5 trillion over 10 years."
Walz says he'll 'own up' when he misspeaks as the Democratic ticket steps up media interviews,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/walz-harris-media-interview-presidential-campaign-83325184cd7f93ca505df590f7a27ede,2024-10-06T16:08:51Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly a week after verbal stumbles in the only vice presidential debate, Democrat Tim Walz used his debut campaign appearance on a Sunday news show to try to fend off criticism of his stand on abortion rights and ""own up"" to past misstatements.

The interview on ""Fox News Sunday"" reflected a broader media blitz by presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate as the Democrats seek to garner public attention in the final 30 days of the campaign against Republicans Donald Trump and JD Vance.

Harris has taped an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that will air Monday night. She is booked Tuesday on Howard Stern's satellite radio show, ABC's ""The View"" and ""The Late Show"" with Stephen Colbert on CBS. Her interview on the podcast ""Call Her Daddy"" is scheduled to be released later Sunday. Walz will be on Jimmy Kimmel's ABC show on Monday.

Walz's Fox appearance also touched on the turmoil in the Middle East, with anchor Shannon Bream pressing the Minnesota governor on whether Israel has a right to preemptively attack Iran's nuclear and oil facilities in response to Tehran's firing of missiles against Israel. It was a question that Walz did not fully answer during his debate this past week with Vance, an Ohio senator.

Walz said Sunday that ""specific operations will be dealt with at the time."" He said Israel has a right to defend itself and that Harris worked with Israel this past week to repel the Iranian attack. President Joe Biden said last week he would not support an Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran's nuclear program.

Walz defended a law that he signed as governor to ensure abortion protections, saying it ""puts this puts the decision with the woman and her health care providers."" He questioned the statement by Trump that he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

On the economy, Walz said Harris' proposals would make life more affordable for the middle class by helping with the construction of 3 million new homes and expanding tax credits for parents. He said tariffs floated by Trump could increase costs by an estimated $4,000 a year on a typical family.

Walz also faced questions in the interview about misstatements pertaining to his military service, drunken driving arrest, infertility treatment for his family and claims to have been in Hong Kong before the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China.

""I will own up when I misspeak,"" Walz said.

He said he believes voters are more concerned by the fact that Vance could not acknowledge during their debate that Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden and that there could restrictions on the infertility treatment of intrauterine insemination that his wife, Gwen, received.

""I think they're probably far more concerned with that than my wife and I used IUI to have our child and that Donald Trump would restrict that,"" Walz said. ""So I think folks know who I am.""

Bream noted that Trump has come out in support of fertility treatments, even as he has said that abortion questions should be decided by states."
"Biden pledged to campaign hard for Harris. So far, he's been mostly a no-show",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-harris-lame-duck-joint-campaigning-79496a704736e8965010eea3bb6b6b5d,2024-10-05T14:54:19Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the last day of August, President Joe Biden was asked about his fall campaign plans. He promised a Labor Day appearance in Pittsburgh and said he would be ""on the road from there on.""

Biden did campaign with Vice President Kamala Harris on Labor Day, but he largely has been a campaign no-show since. Beyond that, sometimes his official events push hers to the background.

Case in point: After Hurricane Helene, Harris scrapped campaign events in Las Vegas to hurry back to Washington for a briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But as Harris stepped to a podium in the command center, Biden was delivering his own storm response comments from the Oval Office, pulling the political spotlight away from his intended successor.

The lack of presidential campaigning and occasional schedule clashes could matter not just for Harris but as Democrats try to hold control of the Senate and retake the House and compete in races further down the ballot.

Even former President Barack Obama announced he will campaign for Harris. Obama will appear in Pittsburgh on Thursday and plans to spend the remaining time before the Nov. 5 election traveling to battleground states. He also recorded ads promoting Democratic Senate candidates in Michigan, Maryland and Florida.

It is not uncommon for a lame-duck president to struggle with finding the right balance between fulfilling the job and carving out a role in a would-be successor's campaign. Biden's situation is unusual because he was seeking a second term until his dramatic departure from the race left Harris with a condensed time frame for her own run.

""I think he's doing his job as president,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday. ""I think that's the most important thing.""

Hurricane Helene has complicated matters in the short term. Biden canceled a campaign stop in Pennsylvania this past week and he and Harris made separate trips Wednesday to the Carolinas and Georgia, respectively, to survey the damage and offer support.

That time, their remarks did not overlap. But on Friday, while Harris was speaking about the importance of unions outside Detroit, Biden caused a stir by making a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room. It was the first of his presidency.

Biden has taken official trips to battleground states and he will be in suburban Philadelphia on Tuesday to campaign for Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. The Harris team had no comment on its hopes for Biden's campaign role.

The president was born in Pennsylvania and maintains a strong connection to its union leaders and blue-collar voters, and former Democratic National Committee chief Donna Brazile said she would ""put him on a bus"" to campaign there.

""I would make sure he is out there in the closing weeks and days of the campaign,"" Brazile said. ""He connects with people she will need.""

Biden and Harris have appeared together at several other official events, including a recent one at the White House on combating gun violence, and at a health care-related event in August where Biden said, ""We cannot let Kamala lose."" Both have been in the Situation Room frequently to discuss the growing conflict in the Middle East.

On Labor Day, when Biden and Harris made their lone joint political appearance since the vice president took over the top on the ticket, the White House asked that Biden introduce Harris. The break with protocol was meant to highlight her record of supporting union workers.

""If you elect Kamala Harris as president it will be the best decision you will have ever made,"" Biden told the crowd.

But when he finished speaking, Biden began shaking hands with those around him -- an awkward moment because Harris had yet to have her turn at the podium.

It is an open question whether Harris really wants Biden's help, given that Democratic voters say they are far happier with her than they were with Biden as their nominee. Harris has praised the administration and her work in it, while also seeking to show distance on some key issues.

That includes her call for raising long-term capital gains taxes for wealthy Americans when Biden had pushed to lower them, getting tougher on the U.S.-Mexico border by potentially further stiffening limits for immigrants seeking asylum and talking up being a gun owner in ways Biden does not.

Biden's campaign absence could now be compounded as his administration deals with the recovery effort after Helene and the expanding conflict in the Mideast.

""You don't need to campaign when you're just doing your job,"" said Nikki Fried, chair of the Democratic Party in Florida. Biden visited parts of the state on Thursday, demonstrating, as Fried put it, that ""the full force of the federal government stands with the people during times of heartbreak and uncertainty.""

But then there are always big demands on a president's time -- from the U.N. General Assembly meetings last month in New York to Biden's upcoming travel to Germany and Angola. Though the White House says there will be more political events after that, the trip means he will not have time to turn his attention to campaigning for Harris until at least mid-October -- just three weeks before Election Day,

Fried thinks Biden will make it work.

""Joe Biden loves being on the campaign trail,"" she said. ""You can see him walking around and talking to voters and to communities, and it certainly puts an extra lift in his step and a smile on his face.""

There are times when a president's absence can be helpful to that party's candidate.

In 2008, the financial crisis sent President George W. Bush's approval ratings crashing. Republican nominee John McCain distanced himself from the White House on the economy after criticizing the federal response to Hurricane Katrina and the Iraq War.

""If my showing up and endorsing him helps him -- or if I'm against him and it helps him -- either way, I want him to win,"" Bush said.

In 2000, when Democratic Vice President Al Gore was seeking the White House, he criticized President Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky scandal and took other steps to distance himself from Clinton. Some Democrats later speculated that was the reason Gore lost an exceedingly close race to Bush.

Paul Begala, a key architect of Clinton's 1992 campaign, does not see a lot of parallels between Clinton and Biden.

""In 2000, Clinton was broadly popular,"" Begala said. ""Biden is not.""

Begala said Biden would do best to ""focus on governing, and leave the campaigning to Kamala"" and her top supporters.

""Lots of people can campaign for her: the Obamas, the Clintons, Oprah, Taylor Swift,"" Begala said. ""But only Joe Biden can be president."""
"Biden talks election, economy and Middle East in surprise news briefing",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-conference-hamas-israel-kamala-harris-lebanon-hezbollah-jd-vance-0093866898d9f9067ff0676672cba9d8,2024-10-04T20:48:51Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 1,080 days as president, Joe Biden on Friday decided to pop in and take questions in the White House briefing room for the first time, striding in with a grin after a strong monthly jobs report and the temporary settlement of a strike by ports workers.

The president has been less available than his recent predecessors to questions from White House press corps, making his surprise appearance welcome to the gathered reporters who waited as his press secretary's daily briefing was moved up 15 minutes, then delayed for nearly one hour.

The president stepped through the press room's blue door in a dark gray suit and red tie and proceeded to make news in response to questions about comments on the 2024 presidential election, the latest jobs numbers and the escalating conflict in the Middle East.

The 81-year old stepped aside from the Democratic nomination this summer, backing Vice President Kamala Harris instead. He acknowledged doubts about whether the November election would be peaceful, given comments by former President Donald Trump that the results could be rigged.

""I'm confident it will be free and fair. I don't know whether it will be peaceful,"" Biden said. ""The things that Trump has said, and the the things that he said last time when he didn't like the outcome of the election, were very dangerous.""

Biden has tried to rebut a political movement that has at times openly trafficked in conspiracy theories, with the latest revolving around the government reporting Friday that employers added 254,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%.

""Another fake jobs report out from Biden-Harris government today,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., posted on social media. ""But all the fake numbers in the world aren't going to fool people dealing with the Biden-Harris.""

The jobs reports are legitimate and have capped a solid run for the U.S. economy. Growth has stayed solid even as the inflation rate has dropped from a four-decade high in 2022 to an annual rate of 2.5%.

Consumer confidence has been weak relative to overall economic growth, a sign that many people still don't feel the strength seen in the latest jobs and inflation numbers. But Biden stressed that he was operating on valid data despite unfounded claims of falsification by supporters of Trump's Make America Great Again movement.

""If you notice, anything the MAGA Republicans don't like they call 'fake,'"" Biden said. ""The job numbers are what the job numbers are. They're real. They're sincere.""

The president also highlighted the deal reached Thursday to suspend a strike by 45,000 dockworkers on East and Gulf coast ports until Jan. 15, creating time to try to hash out a new contract.

Still, challenges remain for Biden as his final months as president involve the risk of a wider war in the Middle East.

Since Hamas attacked Israel nearly a year ago, Israel has retaliated by bombarding the Gaza region in ways that have raised human rights concerns, as well as killing Hezbollah leaders and launching airstrikes in Lebanon. On Tuesday, Iran fired at least 180 missiles into Israel and there are concerns about additional retaliation that could cause the conflict to deepen.

When asked, Biden clarified his comments from a day earlier about Israel possibly striking Iranian oil facilities, which caused the price of the commodity to jump on the prospect of supplies being squeezed.

""Look, the Israelis have not concluded what they're going to do in terms of a strike,"" Biden said Friday. ""That's under discussion. I think if I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.""

The president emphasized that he and Harris are ""singing from the same song sheet"" on foreign and domestic policy, calling her a ""major player in everything we've done.""

As Biden began to leave the room, he was asked if he would reconsider his decision to exit the race. Biden cocked his head and smiled."

"Maryland cancels debt for parole release, drug testing fees",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/maryland-parole-drug-testing-fees-debt-canceled-e30573696f383dc1e6edaecfc8449b05,2024-10-04T19:50:57Z,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Maryland's corrections department will cancel the debt for mandatory, parole and administrative release fees, as well as drug testing fees, for people who are currently under the supervision of the agency's parole and probation division, Gov. Wes Moore said Friday.

The action will relieve administrative debt for 6,715 cases, totaling more than $13 million, the governor's office said.

""Marylanders who serve their time deserve a second chance without bearing the financial burden of recurring administrative fees,"" Moore, a Democrat, said. ""Leave no one behind is not just a talking point for us, it's a governing philosophy. This action will create paths to work, wages, and wealth for Marylanders; grow our economy; and build a state that is more equitable and just.""

The Division of Parole and Probation in the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services collects supervision fees from people who are under mandatory release, parole, administrative release or under probation supervision when ordered by the court.

The supervision fee is now $50 a month for people who were placed on supervision on or after June 1, 2011, and $40 per month for people who were placed on supervision before June 1, 2011.

A new law that took effect Tuesday repealed the Maryland Parole Commission's authority to assess supervision fees against someone under supervision. The law also repealed the commission's authorization to require a person who is on parole, mandatory, or administrative release supervision to pay for drug and alcohol testing fees under some circumstances.

Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, a Democrat, said waiving supervision fees, which disproportionately affect low-income communities and people of color, will ease financial burdens on Marylanders who are ""trying to get their lives back on track.""

""These changes will also lower the risk of recidivism and help advance our shared goal of eliminating mass incarceration,"" Brown said in a news release.

Fee reductions apply only to current parolees who are under active supervision, the governor's office said. The reductions do not apply to people who are no longer under supervision or cases that have already been referred to the Department of Budget and Management's Central Collection Unit.

""I commend the administration for taking this important step in removing an unnecessary barrier to reentry,"" said Del. Elizabeth Embry, a Baltimore Democrat. ""Waiving these fees allows people to focus on providing for themselves and for their families as they reintegrate back into the community."""

Meanwhile, Trump is heading to Georgia to appear with Gov. Brian Kemp, the latest sign that he's patched up his rocky relationship with the top Republican in a key battleground state.

Former President Barack Obama is planning to hit key swing states to boost Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign for the White House, starting on Thursday in Pittsburgh.

The Harris campaign says Obama will travel around the country over the final 27 days ahead of the election. It noted that the former president and Harris have a friendship that goes back 20 years, from when they first met while he was running for Senate.

Harris was also an early supporter of Obama's 2008 presidential bid and knocked on doors for him in Iowa ahead of its caucus that led off voting in the Democratic primary.

In his speech at the Democratic convention in August, Obama said Harris ""wasn't born into privilege. She had to work for what she's got.""

""And she actually cares about what other people are going through,"" the former president added then."
India's foreign minister becomes the first such dignitary to visit Sri Lanka since the election,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-india-china-bilateral-ties-01819172aaf279f71ce4d1376c9006c9,2024-10-04T14:02:57Z,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- India's Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar met Sri Lanka's newly elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake Friday in the first such visit of a dignitary since a new government took office in the island nation last month, amid questions over how Dissanayake would balance between regional powers China and India. The two men discussed ways to deepen bilateral ties.

Sri Lanka is located on one of the world's busiest shipping routes in what India considers part of its strategic backyard. China too has exerted influence in the country in recent years by including it in its Belt and Road project.

""Appreciate his warm sentiments and guidance for the India-Sri Lanka relations. Discussed ways to deepen ongoing cooperation and strengthen India-Sri Lanka ties for the benefit of people of two countries and the region,"" Jaishankar said in a post on the social media site X.

The support of the two regional rivals is crucial for Sri Lanka to emerge from its worst economic crisis in decades, which led to a political calamity and finally paved the way for Dissanayake's party to come to power.

Beijing was once widely seen as having an upper hand with its free-flowing loans and infrastructure investments. But Colombo's economic collapse in 2022 provided an opportunity for India, as New Delhi stepped in with massive financial and material assistance including food, fuel and medicines.

At the same time, China's support to restructure its infrastructure loans to Sri Lanka is vital for Sri Lanka to emerge from its dire economic crisis.

On Friday, India's top diplomat also met his counterpart Vijitha Herath and ""assured him of India's continued support to Sri Lanka's economic rebuilding,"" in a separate post on his account on X.

Sri Lanka's foreign ministry said the main objective of Jaishankar's visit was to congratulate the new president and the government and also ""to demonstrate India's commitment in moving forward with the strong bilateral partnership.""

Jaishankar has extended an invitation to Dissanayake to visit India at a mutually convenient date, the ministry said in a statement.

Traditionally, Sri Lankan leaders undertake their maiden official trip to India.

China has lent Sri Lanka billions of dollars for development projects, some of which have been criticized as having little practical use. They include the Hambantota port, built with Chinese money in former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's home region, despite the plan having been rejected by an expert panel.

When the port failed to generate enough revenue to pay back the loan, Sri Lanka in 2017 was forced to hand the facility and thousands of acres of surrounding land to Beijing for 99 years -- giving China a key foothold in the country directly opposite India's coastline.

Both India and China have separately agreed on terms with Sri Lanka for restructuring its debt, which would enable the country to come out from bankruptcy and rebuild the tattered economy.

Sri Lanka plunged into an economic crisis in 2022, suffering severe shortages and drawing strident protests that led to the ouster of then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

It declared bankruptcy in April 2022 with more than $83 billion in debt -- more than half of it to foreign creditors.

China accounts for about 10% of Sri Lanka's loans, trailing Japan and the Asian Development Bank.

Sri Lanka last year agreed to a $2.9-billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund. Over the past year, Sri Lanka's severe shortages of essentials like food, fuel and medicine have largely abated, and authorities have restored power supplies.

But public dissatisfaction has grown over the government's efforts to increase revenues by raising electricity bills and imposing heavy new income taxes on professionals and businesses.

Dissanayake won last month's election over his predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa as Sri Lankans rejected the old political guard whom they blamed for pushing the country into an unprecedented economic crisis.

During the campaign, Dissanayake said that he would renegotiate the bailout agreement with the IMF agreed by Wickremesinghe. He said he wants to make austerity measures more bearable for the poor.

Wickremesinghe, however, had warned that any move to alter the basics of the agreement could delay a fourth tranche of nearly $3 billion from the IMF, which is crucial for economic stability. Days before the election Wickremesinghe's administration also agreed in principle to restructure Sri Lanka's foreign debt.

Separately on Friday, Dissanayake met the visiting IMF officials.

According to a statement from the president's office, Dissanayake told the IMF officials that he would agree with the objectives of the IMF program, but at the same time, his government expects to provide relief to the masses. No further details on the meeting were immediately available."
EU countries vote to impose duties on China EVs ahead of an end-of-October deadline,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/eu-china-ev-electric-vehicles-duties-tariffs-1ae2ff03f316de858d077595f9cc148b,2024-10-04T12:41:07Z,"BRUSSELS (AP) -- European Union countries on Friday voted to impose duties on imports of electric vehicles from China, as talks continued between Brussels and Beijing to find an amicable solution to their trade dispute before an end-of-October deadline.

Electric vehicles have become a major flash point in a broader trade dispute over the influence of Chinese government subsidies on European markets -- which has forced the undercutting of EU industry prices -- and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the bloc.

The European Commission, which manages trade on behalf of the 27 member countries, welcomed their majority approval of its plan to impose the duties, even though EU automotive powerhouse Germany and Hungary voted against it.

Those duties will come into force on Oct. 31 unless China has a solution to end the standoff.

Commission spokesman Olof Gill said that any solution proposed by Beijing would have to be fully compatible with World Trade Organization rules, remedy ""the injurious subsidization"" by China, and be ""monitorable and enforceable.""

Beijing opposes the duties. ""China firmly opposes the EU's unfair, non-compliant and unreasonable protectionist practices in this case, and firmly opposes the EU's imposition of anti-subsidy duties on Chinese electric vehicles,"" a spokesperson at China's Commerce Ministry said in comments posted online.

Still, it means that the EU and the Chinese government have four more weeks to negotiate. Talks have already been held between Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner for the economy, and Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao, as well as at the level of technical experts.

The China-EU technical teams are due to resume negotiations on Oct. 7.

The duties on Chinese manufacturers, if applied, would be 17% on cars from BYD, 18.8% on those from Geely and 35.3% for vehicles exported by China's state-owned SAIC. Geely has brands including Polestar and Sweden's Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain's MG, one of Europe's bestselling EV brands.

Other EV manufacturers in China including Western companies such as Volkswagen and BMW would be subject to duties of 20.7%. The commission has an ""individually calculated"" rate for Tesla of 7.8%.

The retaliatory duties have run into opposition in Germany, which has Europe's biggest economy and is home to major automakers.

Germany's auto industry association, the VDA, said the German government sent the ""right signal"" by voting against them. Hildegard Müller, who chairs the group, called the decision ""a further step away from global cooperation.""

She acknowledged that there is a need for negotiations with China and said that they ""must prevent an escalation - ideally avert the tariffs, so that we don't risk a trade conflict.""

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán warned that the EU risks starting an ""economic cold war"" with China, and he pledged to vote against the duties. ""This is the worst thing that can happen to Europe. ... If this continues, the European economy will die,"" he told state radio.

According to the commission, Chinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices.

Brussels says companies in China accomplished that with the help of subsidies across the production chain. They ran from cheap land for factories from local governments to below-market supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises to tax breaks and easy financing from state-controlled banks.

The rapid growth in market share has sparked fears that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU's ability to produce its own green technology to combat climate change, as well as the jobs of 2.5 million auto industry workers and 10.3 million more people whose jobs depend indirectly on EV production.

Dockworkers' union suspends strike until Jan. 15 to allow time to negotiate new contract,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-ports-dockworkers-agreement-ila-f136bdcd52738e94f2938aaa79a1fa2a,2024-10-04T10:57:53Z,"DETROIT (AP) -- Some 45,000 dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports are returning to work after their union reached a deal to suspend a strike that could have caused shortages and higher prices if it had dragged on.

The International Longshoremen's Association is suspending its three-day strike until Jan. 15 to provide time to negotiate a new contract. The union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies, said in a joint statement that they have reached a tentative agreement on wages.

A person briefed on the agreement said the ports sweetened their wage offer from about 50% over six years to 62%. The person didn't want to be identified because the agreement is tentative. Any wage increase would have to be approved by union members as part of the ratification of a final contract.

Talks now turn to the automation of ports, which the unions says will lead to fewer jobs, and other sticking points.

Industry analysts have said that for every day of a port strike it takes four to six days to recover. But they said a short strike of a few days probably wouldn't gum up the supply chain too badly.

The settlement pushes the strike and any potential shortages past the November presidential election, eliminating a potential liability for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. It's also a big plus for the Biden-Harris administration, which has billed itself as the most union-friendly in American history. Shortages could have driven up prices and reignited inflation.

The union went on strike early Tuesday after its contract expired in a dispute over pay and the automation of tasks at 36 ports stretching from Maine to Texas. The strike came at the peak of the holiday season at the ports, which handle about half the cargo from ships coming into and out of the United States.

Most retailers had stocked up or shipped items early in anticipation of the strike.

""With the grace of God, and the goodwill of neighbors, it's gonna hold,"" President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday night after the agreement.

In a statement later, Biden applauded both sides ""for acting patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability of critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding.""

Biden said that collective bargaining is ""critical to building a stronger economy from the middle out and the bottom up.""

The union's membership won't need to vote on the temporary suspension of the strike. Until Jan. 15, the workers will be covered under the old contract, which expired on Sept. 30.

The union had been demanding a 77% raise over six years, plus a complete ban on the use of automation at the ports, which members see as a threat to their jobs. Both sides also have been apart on the issues of pension contributions and the distribution of royalties paid on containers that are moved by workers.

Thomas Kohler, who teaches labor and employment law at Boston College, said the agreement to halt the strike means that the two sides are close to a final deal.

""I'm sure that if they weren't going anywhere they wouldn't have suspended (the strike),"" he said. ""They've got wages. They'll work out the language on automation, and I'm sure that what this really means is it gives the parties time to sit down and get exactly the language they can both live with.""

Kohler said the surprise end to the strike may catch railroads with cars, engines and crews out of position. But railroads are likely to work quickly to fix that.

Just before the strike had begun, the Maritime Alliance said both sides had moved off their original wage offers, a tentative sign of progress.

Thursday's deal came after Biden administration officials met with foreign-owned shipping companies before dawn on Zoom, according to a person briefed on the day's events who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. The White House wanted to increase pressure to settle, emphasizing the responsibility to reopen the ports to help with recovery from Hurricane Helene, the person said.

Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su told them she could get the union to the bargaining table to extend the contract if the carriers made a higher wage offer. Chief of Staff Jeff Zients told the carriers they had to make an offer by the end of the day so a manmade strike wouldn't worsen a natural disaster, the person said.

By midday the Maritime Alliance members agreed to a large increase, bringing about the agreement, according to the person.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government also deployed paramilitary rangers and additional police and shut schools in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi after Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party refused to withdraw its call for the protest.

Videos posted online showed police placing shipping containers on bridges and roads on a key highway in the northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where Khan's party holds power. Khan's supporters plan to march from the province to Islamabad, defying a ban on rallies imposed this week.

Police reportedly arrested some party supporters.

Khan, Sharif's main political rival, has been in prison for more than a year in connection with more than 150 police cases. He remains a popular figure despite the cases, which critics and his party say are politically motivated. He was ousted in 2022 through a no-confidence vote in Parliament and arrested in 2023 after a court handed him a 3-year jail sentence in a graft case.

The suspension of cellphone service in Islamabad and Rawalpindi on Friday disrupted communications and affected basic services such as online banking, ride and food delivery services. Many people faced difficulties traveling because of the obstacles placed on the roads.

On Thursday, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told Khan's party to cancel the planned protest and warned that there would be ""no leniency"" if the ban on protests is defied.

A message on Khan's social media account urged supporters to join the protest.

""The tyrants in power want to terrorize us,"" it said. ""So go forth fearlessly, and remember if you still hesitate, to step forward and truly liberate yourself.""

Sharif's government says Khan's party wants to weaken the country's economy by staging violent protests despite the threat of attacks by the Pakistani Taliban, who have stepped up attacks in recent years.

Pakistan, which recently received a $7 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, has been struggling to overcome an economic crisis.

On Friday, supporters of Khan gathered in Swabi, a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to begin a march toward Islamabad.

Provincial Chief Minister Ali Amin Gundapur, who led a large rally last month near Islamabad demanding Khan's release, planned to join the march.

Officials said the provincial government has mobilized heavy machinery to remove the shipping containers placed by the federal authorities on the highway leading to the capital."
"EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles are part of an 'economic cold war,' Hungary's Orbán says",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hungary-orban-eu-china-electric-vehicles-b255691c021fb901ceb2f1563e3a4346,2024-10-04T08:58:14Z,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- The European Union risks entering an ""economic cold war"" with China, Hungary's prime minister said on Friday, pledging to vote against an EU plan to impose higher tariffs on the import of Chinese electric vehicles.

EU countries are set to vote on Friday whether to finalize the tariffs, part of a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc.

The tariffs are expected to pass the vote. But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said on Friday that his country will oppose them, and warned that Europe's tendency toward economic protectionism would destroy the EU's economy.

""What they're making us do, what the European Union is doing, is an economic cold war,"" Orbán told state radio. ""This is the worst thing that can happen to Europe. ... If this continues, the European economy will die,"" he said.

The EU in July imposed the provisional tariffs of up to 37.6% on EVs made in China, saying they unfairly benefit from government subsidies. Beijing, in response, filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization in August, saying the tariffs violate WTO rules and undermine global cooperation on climate change.

China also launched retaliatory investigations into French cognac exports and European pork in what some analysts fear could develop into an economically harmful trade war with the EU.

Hungary under Orbán has pursued close ties with China and Russia while its Western partners increasingly seek to distance their economies from those countries. Moscow's war in Ukraine and fears that a flood of inexpensive Chinese products could disrupt Western markets have accelerated those efforts.

Meanwhile, Hungary has sought major investment from Beijing, opening a series of Chinese EV battery manufacturing plants across the country. Late last year, it announced that BYD, one of China's largest EV makers, will open its first European production factory in southern Hungary.

Orbán on Friday said that EU protectionism represented a ""huge danger"" to Hungary's export-oriented economy. His government has declared a policy of ""economic neutrality"" that favors trade with all willing countries regardless of alliances or geopolitical considerations.

He said Western partners including the EU had ""attacked"" Hungary over its policies in order to ""divert it from the path of economic neutrality.""

""What's behind every attack is that they're trying to ... force Hungary into the bloc where they are, where I think there is no growth, no development, no future,"" he said."
"Japan's new leader expresses regret for governing party slush fund scandal, vows stronger defense",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/japan-ishiba-policy-us-china-security-economy-a5412430588c624ea25ee5dc8f38ae7f,2024-10-04T06:18:05Z,"TOKYO (AP) -- New Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba opened his first policy speech in office Friday by expressing deep regrets over the governing party's slush funds scandal that dogged his predecessor.

Ishiba replaced Fumio Kishida on Tuesday with the paramount mission of quickly pacifying public anger over financial misconduct in the Liberal Democratic Party and regaining support ahead of an Oct. 27 parliamentary election.

""I will achieve politics that is not for politicians but for the people,"" Ishiba said, pledging to provide sincere explanations and ensure that lawmakers abide by the rules.

He set five policy pillars to uphold, including security, economy and disaster resilience.

Ishiba said he will bolster Japan's military capability to defend itself from threats from China, Russia and North Korea under the framework of the Japan-U.S. security alliance.

He did not mention two goals he advocated before taking office -- making the Japan-U.S. security alliance more equitable and establishing a NATO-like collective defense system in Asia -- apparently to avoid controversy ahead of the election that the LDP must win.

Omitting those goals also saves him from possibly irking Washington, but may disappoint those who saw him as willing to speak up even when he risked disagreement with his own party.

Ishiba noted violations of Japanese airspace last month by Chinese and Russian warplanes and North Korea's advancing missile technology and testing as examples of the worsening security environment that Japan faces and stressed the need for a further buildup of Japan's military.

He said he will promote a ""strategic, mutually beneficial relationship"" with China and increase communication on all levels to build ""stable and constructive"" ties. He also said he will further strengthen and expand Japan's ties with South Korea and the trilateral cooperation Japan has with it and the United States.

He called the Japan-U.S. security alliance a cornerstone of Japanese diplomacy and security as well as the foundation of peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and international society.

The first public support ratings for Ishiba as prime minister were around 50% or even lower, the lowest levels for a new leader, according to Japanese media.

Opposition leaders have criticized him for rushing to hold an election after only adding a new face and fresh image to the party without any concrete results. He plans to dissolve parliament next Wednesday for an election on Oct. 27, allowing only a few days of debate on his policies.

On the economy, Ishiba said in his speech that he wants workers to have sustainable salary increases that exceed inflation, and will promote investment to create ""a virtuous cycle of growth and distribution."" He promised economic support for low-income households and measures for regional revitalization and disaster resilience.

Despite earlier supporting a phasing out of nuclear power following the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster, he pledged to maximize the use of nuclear energy and push for geothermal and other renewable sources to meet the soaring electricity needs of data centers in the age of AI."
Tunisia votes Sunday in its third presidential election since the Arab Spring,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-presidential-election-kais-saied-9cb6593c3154b0e9a32131d1afe6d118,2024-10-04T05:34:16Z,"TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) -- With his major opponents imprisoned or left off the ballot, Tunisian President Kais Saied faces few obstacles to winning reelection on Sunday, five years after riding anti-establishment backlash to a first term.

The North African country's Oct. 6 presidential election is its third since protests led to the 2011 ouster of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali -- the first autocrat toppled in the Arab Spring uprisings that also overthrew leaders in Egypt, Libya and Yemen.

International observers praised the previous two contests as meeting democratic norms. However, a raft of arrests and actions taken by a Saied-appointed election authority have raised questions about whether this year's race is free and fair. And opposition parties have called for a boycott.

Not long ago, Tunisia was hailed as the Arab Spring's only success story. As coups, counter-revolutions and civil wars convulsed the region, the North African nation enshrined a new democratic constitution and saw its leading civil society groups win the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering political compromise.

But its new leaders were unable to buoy its struggling economy and were plagued by political infighting and episodes of violence and terrorism.

Amid that backdrop, Saied, then 61 and a political outsider, won his first term in 2019. He advanced to a runoff promising to usher in a ""New Tunisia"" and hand more power to young people and local governments.

This year's election will offer a window into popular opinion about the trajectory that Tunisia's fading democracy has taken since Saied took office.

Saied's supporters appear to have remained loyal to him and his promise to transform Tunisia. But he isn't affiliated with any political party, and it's unclear just how deep his support runs among Tunisians.

It's the first presidential race since Saied upended the country's politics in July 2021, declaring a state of emergency, sacking his prime minister, suspending the parliament and rewriting Tunisia's constitution consolidating his own power.

Those actions outraged pro-democracy groups and leading opposition parties, who called them a coup. Yet despite anger from career politicians, voters approved Saied's new constitution the following year in a low-turnout referendum.

Authorities subsequently began arresting Saied's critics including journalists, lawyers, politicians and civil society figures, charging them with endangering state security and violating a controversial anti-fake news law that observers argue stifles dissent.

Fewer voters turned out to participate in parliamentary and local elections in 2022 and 2023 amid economic woes and widespread political apathy.

Many wanted to challenge Saied, but few were able to.

Seventeen potential candidates filed paperwork to run and Tunisia's election authority approved only three: Saied, Zouhair Maghzaoui and Ayachi Zammel.

Maghzaoui is a veteran politician who has campaigned against Saied's economic program and recent political arrests. Still, he is loathed by opposition parties for backing Saied's constitution and earlier moves to consolidate power.

Zammel is a businessman supported by politicians not boycotting the race. During the campaign, he has been sentenced to prison time in four voter fraud cases related to signatures his team gathered to qualify for the ballot.

Others had hoped to run but were prevented. The election authority, known as ISIE, last month dismissed a court ruling ordering it to reinstate three additional challengers.

With many arrested, detained or convicted on charges related to their political activities, Tunisia's most well-known opposition figures are also not participating.

That includes the 83-year-old leader of Tunisia's most well organized political party Ennahda, which rose to power after the Arab Spring. Rached Ghannouchi, the Islamist party's co-founder and Tunisia's former house speaker, has been imprisoned since last year after criticizing Saied.

The crackdown also includes one of Ghannouchi's most vocal detractors: Abir Moussi, a right-wing lawmaker known for railing against Islamists and speaking nostalgically for pre-Arab Spring Tunisia. The 49-year-old president of the Free Destourian Party also was imprisoned last year after criticizing Saied.

Other less known politicians who announced plans to run have also since been jailed or sentenced on similar charges.

Opposition groups have called to boycott the race. The National Salvation Front -- a coalition of secular and Islamist parties including Ennahda -- has denounced the process as a sham and questioned the election's legitimacy.

The country's economy continues to face major challenges. Despite Saied's promises to chart a new course for Tunisia, unemployment has steadily increased to one of the region's highest at 16%, with young Tunisians hit particularly hard.

Growth has been slow since the COVID-19 pandemic and Tunisia has remained reliant on multilateral lenders such as the World Bank and the European Union. Today, Tunisia owes them more than $9 billion. Apart from agricultural reform, Saied's overarching economic strategy is unclear.

Negotiations have long been stalled over a $1.9 billion bailout package offered by the International Monetary Fund in 2022. Saied has been unwilling to accept its conditions, which include restructuring indebted state-owned companies and cutting public wages. Some of the IMF's stipulations -- including lifting subsidies for electricity, flour and fuel -- would likely be unpopular among Tunisians who rely on their low costs.

Economic analysts say that foreign and local investors are reluctant to invest in Tunisia due to continued political risks and an absence of reassurances.

The dire economic straits have had a two-pronged effect on one of Tunisia's key political issues: migration. From 2019 to 2023, an increasing number of Tunisians attempted to migrate to Europe without authorization. Meanwhile, Saied's administration has taken a harsh approach against migrants arriving from sub-Saharan Africa, many who have found themselves stuck in Tunisia while trying to reach Europe.

Saied energized his supporters in early 2023 by accusing migrants of violence and crime and portraying them as part of a plot to change the country's demography. The anti-migrant rhetoric prompted extreme violence against migrants and a crackdown from authorities. Last year, security forces targeted migrant communities from the coast to the capital with a series of arrests, deportation to the desert and the demolition of tent camps in Tunis and coastal towns.

Bodies continue to wash ashore on Tunisia's coastline as boats carrying Tunisians and migrants from sub-Saharan Africa manage only to make it a few nautical miles before sinking.

Tunisia has maintained ties with its traditional Western allies but also forged new partnerships under Saied.

Much like many populist leaders who've taken power worldwide, Saied emphasizes sovereignty and freeing Tunisia from what he calls ""foreign diktats."" He has insisted that Tunisia won't become a ""border guard"" for Europe, which has sought agreements with him to better police the Mediterranean.

Tunisia and Iran lifted visa requirements and in May announced plans to boost trade ties. It has also accepted millions in loans as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative to build hospitals, stadiums and ports.

Yet European countries remain Tunisia's top trade partners and their leaders have maintained productive ties with Saied, hailing agreements to manage migration as a ""model"" for the region.

Saied has spoken ardently in support of Palestinians as war has swept the Middle East and opposes moves made to normalize diplomatic ties with Israel."
"For migrant women who land in Colorado looking for jobs, a common answer emerges: No",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/immigration-us-work-permit-tps-aurora-colorado-30dc5eeac61cfa7cb36872f348637844,2024-10-04T04:16:38Z,"AURORA, Colo. (AP) -- East Colfax Avenue was the best place to find a job. That's what everyone told Sofia Roca.

Never mind the open drug use, the sex workers or the groups of other migrant women marching the sidewalks soliciting work at the very same Mexican restaurants and bakeries.

On East Colfax in Aurora, Colorado, bosses and customers would speak Spanish and might be willing to hire someone like Roca -- a 49-year-old immigrant from Colombia -- without legal authorization to work. That was the rationale for going back to Colfax each morning, fruitless as it was.

""Do you know how to cook Mexican food?"" asked one woman, looking up from the limes she was quartering, when Roca inquired about a kitchen position advertised on the door. Roca's accent was a giveaway: not Mexican.

As record numbers of South Americans attempt to cross the U.S. southern border seeking better economic opportunities, many are landing in communities that are unprepared for them -- and sometimes outright hostile.

And many migrants have also been unprepared for the realities of their new home.

Women are leaving Colombia, and to a greater extent Venezuela, to escape starvation and violence, to provide for their children and to seek medical care. They represent some of the more than 42,000 migrants who have arrived in the Denver area over two years. Many didn't know anyone in Denver. But it was the closest city to which Texas was offering free bus rides, both to relieve pressure on its towns and to make a political point to liberal-leaning cities about immigration's impact on the border.

From Denver, untold numbers made their way to the neighboring suburb of Aurora, lured by cheaper rent and abundant Spanish speakers. But finding a job and an affordable place to stay has been anything but easy, and women face their own particular challenges.

Last year, nearly 900,000 women and girls tried to cross the U.S. southern border, more than a fivefold increase over the last decade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows. Like many of them, Roca came to the United States to help her children. Her adult daughter back in Colombia suffers from lupus and can't afford ""the good medicines.""

The economy in Colombia never recovered from pandemic shutdowns, and Roca heard from acquaintances that in the United States she could earn $1,000 a week. ""That's a lot of money in Colombia,"" she said. Back home, ""one U.S. dollar can buy breakfast for your entire family.""

Roca set out for the United States with an uncle. He was detained in Mexico, but Roca made it across the border in Juárez and told U.S. agents she was seeking asylum. She heard from a shelter worker in El Paso that Denver was offering free housing for migrants and Texas would pay to get her there.

As of September, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has bused at least 119,000 migrants from the border to cities run by Democratic mayors, including Denver, New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C., according to a press release from the governor's office.

Roca arrived in November and stayed for two weeks in a hotel-turned-shelter paid for by the city of Denver. When she went looking for work in front of Home Depot and along East Colfax, she observed an icy reception from locals. ""They said horrible things about Venezuelans,"" she said.

She didn't know the benefits many recent migrants have received -- specifically, a path to a temporary work visa and with it better-paying jobs -- were causing resentment among Aurora's large Mexican community. Many have loved ones in the country illegally or have themselves lived for years in the United States without legal permission to work.

As chaos and economic collapse drove more migrants to the border, President Joe Biden's administration created and expanded legal pathways to enter the U.S., with the possibility of applying for work permits. However, in June, Biden temporarily suspended asylum for new immigrants who cross illegally, ending a main pathway to legal work.

Roca never was eligible for a work permit, but Mexican residents in Aurora still associate her with the many migrants who are.

Resentment for newcomers was building in another corner of Aurora, too -- City Hall. Aurora officials in February had warned other communities against housing migrants there, vowing not to spend city money to help them. This summer, Aurora's mayor repeated a landlord's claim that a notorious Venezuelan gang had taken over an apartment building, saying he would investigate how so many Venezuelans ended up living in Aurora. Even though police say gangs hadn't taken over the building, former President Donald Trump took up the claim, mentioning it at his campaign rallies. The mayor last month walked back some of his comments.

Roca never made a deliberate decision to settle in Aurora. To her, it wasn't clear where Denver ended and Aurora began, or that Denver was more eager to help migrants coming to the area.

So when her time is almost up at the Denver shelter, she does the only thing she knows to do: She heads to East Colfax in Aurora.

She walks up and down the sidewalks, dodging people who'd taken over the bus shelters to shoot up drugs or smoke fentanyl and who sell apparently shoplifted toiletries on the sidewalks. She approaches migrants holding cardboard signs and begging for money outside Walmart, asking if they know of work or a place to stay.

A man standing by his truck parked outside a Goodwill thrift store catches her attention. He is singing along to rap music in Spanish. He seems happy, she thinks. He seems like a good guy.

He says he can help her and her cousin, who arrived a few weeks earlier. But not in Colorado. She can come back to Kentucky with him and his family. To hold her over in the short term, the man -- El Cubano, she calls him -- gives her $10 and invites her for ice cream.

After more than a week of staying with the family in Kentucky and cooking and eating meals together, Roca learns El Cubano's wife works in el negocio, or ""the business."" There is not much work in Kentucky, so she earns her money through sex work, she tells Roca, while her kids play a few feet away.

A few days later, while they are cooking dinner together at the couple's trailer, a Mexican man in his 30s pulls up outside in a pickup truck.

He'd seen a picture of Roca and liked her -- and would pay $1,000 for two nights with Roca, the wife says. Roca would keep $600, the couple would get $400. Roca would have to pay him $6 for each ride to and from his house.

Roca stops chopping the onion and looks at her cousin. Don't go with that man, the cousin says. You don't know him.

Roca considers all of the jobs she's done in her life. Caring for Alzheimer's patients as a home health aide. Answering phones at a call center. Selling beauty products on the street in Mexico.

In her month in the United States, she has quickly come to understand she'll have to make sacrifices in this country. That the reports she'd heard back in Colombia about earning $1,000 a week were likely hyperbole. That she'll have to push her body to its limits doing manual labor. She'll have to accept below-standard wages until she gets work permission, if it ever comes. She'll have to stay in someone's living room with other new arrivals and give up her privacy.

But subjecting herself to the whims of a stranger in such an intimate and vulnerable way?

""No,"" she tells the woman. ""I'm not going anywhere with anyone.""

The man is told to leave. The insults start immediately.

How are you going to earn money, girl? asks the woman. You're not going to just live here for free. The food here is good, isn't it? But it's not free.

Roca doesn't know what to expect -- maybe violence. She and her cousin have no money or transportation. They're essentially trapped. But a few days later, Roca leaves as El Cubano yells insults from his trailer. A Venezuelan woman she met outside Home Depot finds someone to help them leave Kentucky.

Where did they want to go? Somewhere she knew people, she remembers thinking. Somewhere with other migrants.

Back to Aurora and East Colfax Avenue.

Back in Aurora, Roca reached out to a Venezuelan woman she'd met briefly begging for money outside the Walmart on Colfax. Soon she took a place in the woman's living room, sharing a queen-sized blow-up mattress with the woman's teenage son.

Roca found a job on the weekends helping a man set up and break down his stall at an outdoor flea market. She hefted large sacks of used clothing over her shoulders, put out the clothing on display, talked to customers. All for $10 an hour. ""It's an abusive wage,"" she said, ""but it's a job.""

She tried standing outside Home Depot, but found many people propositioned her for sex or wouldn't pay her after she completed legitimate jobs. She gave up standing outside a day laborer's center in Aurora when she didn't feel safe trying to jockey for work against dozens of men, who would push her out of the way and jump onto moving trucks rounding up workers.

On most days walking along Colfax Avenue, Roca says, men would solicit her for sex, holding up their fingers to signal how many hundreds of dollars they were willing to pay.

As she looked for work in March, she came across what looked like an old motel, a place she hadn't tried before. ""Is this a hotel or a motel? I don't know,"" she said as she opened the heavy metal door. ""Let's check.""

In the small vestibule, a 1970s-era cigarette vending machine stood in the corner. A grandfatherly man waited behind a plexiglass sliding window. There were no vacancies, but he urged her to try the bar in the back. ""They're always looking for girls,"" he said.

Roca walked to the rear of the building and recognized the name of the bar. ""I know about this place,"" she said.

At a few Mexican cantinas around Aurora and Denver, women are paid to talk and drink with men. ""Ficheras,"" as the women are known in Spanish, sell beers at a significant markup to men and pocket the profits. It can be a fast way to earn money, but also a route to sex trafficking or the drug trade. Visit these establishments, and you can see some ""ficheras"" wearing government-issued ankle bracelets with their sky-high heels. The bracelets were given to them by federal immigration officials to monitor their movements while they await immigration hearings.

""I don't think I have to do that yet,"" Roca said. ""But this street -- it only offers prostitution.""

Since returning to Aurora, Roca had discovered she has few options for establishing legal residence or working legally in the U.S. She told U.S. Border Patrol officials she plans to plead for asylum at her deportation hearing next year, but she doubts they will grant it. Ironically, what happened to her in Kentucky could help her win a visa. The U.S. government issues special visas to victims of sex trafficking here, but Roca has never wanted to report the Cuban couple, fearing they might come after her.

She had gotten in touch through Facebook with a high school friend from Colombia living for the last year in the northeastern United States. ""She's told me she can get me a job at a hotel and I can stay with her,"" she said. ""What would you do if you were me?"" she asked a reporter. ""Would you go?""

The idea of learning to move around a new American city exhausted Roca. But without more work, there wasn't much keeping her in Aurora. Her roommates were headed to eviction court the next week. She didn't know where she would go if they lost the apartment.

Two days later, with about $80 in her pocket, Roca boarded a Greyhound bus paid for by the city of Denver. She landed in a new town -- one that hasn't received busloads of migrants from Texas -- and reunited with her high school friend. (The Associated Press is not identifying her new location, since Roca is afraid the Cuban couple might seek her out after she spoke about them in the media.)

Roca's friend followed through on her promises, allowing her to live with her and connecting her to a job cleaning hotel rooms. Roca has already changed jobs and has found one she likes better. She walks through the city with ease -- and anonymously.

""It's a huge difference from my life in Denver,"" she says. ""There's less chaos, and no one has disrespected me. It's been a great refuge.""

She's not sure how long she'll stay. But Sofia Roca will never live in Aurora, Colorado, again.

Harris and Trump battle for labor support as dockworkers suspend strike,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-labor-michigan-georgia-dockworkers-98eee32bc975ed5bc284d3e0785e5d7b,2024-10-04T04:16:32Z,"DETROIT (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris will visit the union stronghold of Flint on Friday as she battles with Donald Trump for working-class voters who could tip the scales in this year's election.

Her appearance in the battleground state of Michigan comes the day after U.S. dockworkers suspended their strike in hopes of reaching a new contract, sparing the country a damaging episode of labor unrest that could have rattled the economy. A tentative agreement was reached to raise salaries, although other issues still need to be resolved.

Harris issued a statement saying the development ""indicates progress toward a strong contract and represents the power of collective bargaining."" She added that ""dockworkers deserve a fair share for their hard work getting essential goods out to communities across America.""

Unions have long been a bedrock of support for Democrats, but Harris has failed to secure some key endorsements. The International Association of Fire Fighters announced this week that it wouldn't back a candidate this year, following a similar announcement from the Teamsters. Both unions endorsed Joe Biden four years ago.

It's not a total cold shoulder for Harris. Some Teamsters locals are supporting her, and she won quick endorsements from national teachers unions, the building trades, the AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers after replacing Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.

But the divide within the labor community is a reminder of shifting loyalties in American politics. Democrats have increased their support among white-collar professionals while Republicans try to make inroads among voters who didn't attend college.

During a rally in Michigan on Thursday, Trump claimed that Republicans are now ""the party of the American worker,"" glossing over his anti-union record as president. In a reference to labor unrest at the country's ports, he insisted that ""under my leadership Americans won't have to go on strike for a better wage or a better life.""

Trump is heading to Georgia on Friday to appear with Gov. Brian Kemp, the latest sign that he's patched up his rocky relationship with the top Republican in a key battleground state. Later in the day, he's holding a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

Union voters have traditionally leaned toward Democrats, with 56% supporting Biden in 2020. But Trump has pushed hard to win over blue-collar workers traditionally represented by some of the biggest unions. He won 62% of white voters without college degrees -- though only 24% of non-white voters without college degrees -- in 2020.

It's frustrating for Democrats, who point to the White House's firm support for unions. Biden even joined a UAW picket line last year.

Lisa Anderson, 59, drove more than an hour from Green Bay in her green ""AFSCME for Harris-Walz"" shirt to hear the vice president speak Thursday in Wisconsin.

She's been an elementary school administrative assistant for 17 years, and she's confident that Harris' union support runs deep.

""I'm not worried about it,"" Anderson said. ""If you're voting for Trump, how can you believe in unions?"" AFSCME is the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

Labor relations could have been a dominant issue in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign if the dockworkers strike continued, leading to snarled ports and shortages on store shelves.

Biden expressed satisfaction that a deal was being worked out.

""We've been working hard on it,"" he said at the White House. ""With the grace of God, and the goodwill of neighbors, it's gonna hold."""
Jobs report is likely to show another month of modest but steady hiring gains,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jobs-hiring-federal-reserve-inflation-unemployment-economy-87447d5187b37bb0f5cf996e25bad808,2024-10-04T04:06:40Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. labor market is still reliably cranking out jobs each month, enough to give Americans the confidence and paychecks to keep spending and sustaining the economy. Yet the pace of hiring has lost momentum over the past several months, evidence that employers have become more cautious.

September likely brought more of the same. The Labor Department is expected to report Friday that employers added a decent but hardly spectacular 140,000 jobs last month, roughly matching August's 142,000 gain, according to forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet.

""We'll get modest employment gains, not all that great, but enough to keep the economy moving forward,'' said Brian Bethune, an economist at Boston College.

The economy's resilience has come as a relief. Economists had expected that the Federal Reserve's aggressive campaign to subdue inflation -- it jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 -- would cause a recession. It didn't. The economy kept growing even in the face of ever-higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.

Last month, the Fed began cutting rates, in part to try to bolster the slowing job market. And, as Bethune noted, the once unlikely prospect of a ""soft landing'' -- in which high interest rates help vanquish inflation without triggering a recession -- ""is already secure.''

The economy is weighing heavily on voters as the Nov. 5 presidential election nears. Many Americans are unimpressed by the job market's durability and are still frustrated by high prices, which remain on average 19% above where they were in February 2021. That was when inflation began surging as the economy rebounded with unexpected speed and strength from the pandemic recession, causing severe shortages of goods and labor.

Across the economy, most indicators look solid. The U.S. economy, the world's largest, grew at a vigorous 3% annual pace from April through June, boosted by consumer spending and business investment. A forecasting tool from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta points to slower but still healthy 2.5% annual growth in the just-ended July-September quarter.

On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, reported that America's services businesses grew for a third straight month in September and at an unexpectedly fast pace. The economy's service sector is closely watched because it represents more than 70% of U.S. jobs.

Last month, the nation's households increased their spending at retailers. And even with hiring having slowed, Americans are enjoying extraordinary job security. Layoffs are near a record low as a percentage of employment. The number of people filing for unemployment benefits also remains near historically low levels.

Companies seem generally reluctant to let workers go even though they are also hesitant to expand their payrolls. That unusual dynamic may stem from many employers having been caught flat-footed and short of staff after the economy began roaring back from the pandemic recession.

Employers added an average of just 116,000 jobs a month from June through August, including a dismal 89,000 in July. That marked the weakest three months of hiring since mid-2020. Hiring has plummeted from a record average of 604,000 a month in 2021 at the end of COVID recession and 377,000 in 2022.

Posted job openings, too, have declined steadily, to 8 million in August, after having peaked at 12.2 million in March 2022.

Workers have noticed the chillier environment for jobseekers. Far fewer feel confident enough to leave their jobs to seek a better position. The Labor Department reported this week that the number of Americans who are quitting their jobs fell to its lowest level since August 2020, when the economy was still reeling from COVID.

Job-hopping isn't as lucrative as it had been, either. Last month, those who changed jobs were earning 6.6% more than they had earned a year earlier -- a 1.9 percentage point premium over the 4.7% median pay gain of those who stayed put. The job-hopping premium used to be far higher -- a peak of 8.8 percentage points in April 2022, according to Liv Wang, lead data scientist at ADP Research.

Two and a half years of high interest rates, it seems, have taken a toll on the job market. But relief might be coming.

The Fed last month slashed its benchmark interest rate by a hefty half-percentage point -- its first and biggest rate cut since the 2020 recession. The central bank said it was encouraged by progress in its fight against inflation. Consumer prices were up 2.5% from a year earlier in August, barely above the Fed's 2% inflation target and down dramatically from a year-over-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022.

Friday's jobs report may bring more good news on inflation. Diane Swonk, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm KPMG, said she expects that average hourly wages rose 0.2% last month, down from a 0.4% increase in August. That would translate, she says, into a 3.7% gain from a year earlier. That's close to the 3.5% that many economists regard as consistent with the Fed's inflation target. Such a drop would ease pressure on employers to pass along the cost of higher wages by raising their prices and thereby feeding inflation.

The Fed's focus shifted to supporting the job market as hiring slowed this summer and unemployment rose, even while remaining relatively low. The central bank has signaled that it expects to cut its key rate twice more this year -- likely by modest quarter-points -- and four additional times in 2025.

The expectation of lower borrowing costs could encourage employers to pick up the pace of hiring.

""They see light at the end of the tunnel of this monetary tightening that's been going on a couple of years,'' Bethune said."
Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed after Middle East tensions weigh on Wall St,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-oil-iran-cb6a744bb4c16fe09d59091a60c66609,2024-10-04T03:54:40Z,"TOKYO (AP) -- Asian shares were mixed Friday after worsening tensions in the Middle East sent shares lower on Wall Street, while boosting crude prices.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 edged up 0.3% in morning trading to 38,668.36. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.7% to 8,145.70. South Korea's Kospi added 0.6% to 2,577.51. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 1.6% to 22,473.56. Trading was closed in Shanghai.

In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged down to 146.52 Japanese yen from 146.83 yen. The euro stood unchanged at $1.1034.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office on Tuesday, was due to give a policy speech on Friday that could indicate his government's stance on issues such as interest rates and spending.

The Bank of Japan has begun very gradually raising its benchmark rate from near zero. It now stands at around 0.25%. Expectations of rising rates had pushed the yen higher after the Liberal Democrats elected Ishiba to head the ruling party and thus serve as prime minister. But the yen has fallen back against the dollar in the past two days after officials sent clear signals that they did not favor further rate hikes at this time.

A cheaper yen could work as a plus for Japan's giant exporters like Nintendo and Toyota by boosting the value of its overseas earnings. But it raises the cost of imports of oil and other vital commodities, pushing prices higher and pinching household spending.

Stocks sank Wednesday on Wall Street as oil prices kept rising as the world waits to see how Israel will respond to Iran's missile attack on Tuesday.

The S&P 500 fell 0.2% to 5,699.94 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% to 42,011.59. The Nasdaq composite edged less than 0.1% lower to 17,918.48.

Benchmark U.S. crude added 5 cents to $73.76 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 8 cents to $77.70 a barrel. On Thursday, Brent leaped 5% after starting the week below $72. It's potentially on track for its biggest weekly percentage gain in nearly two years.

The rise came after President Joe Biden suggested on Thursday that U.S. and Israeli officials were discussing a possible strike by Israel against Iranian oil facilities.

""We're in discussion of that,"" Biden said to reporters. He added, ""I think that would be a little ... anyway,"" without finishing the thought. Biden also said he doesn't expect Israel to retaliate immediately against Iran.

Iran is a major oil producer and a broadening of the fighting could choke off Iran's flows to China and also affect neighboring countries that are integral to crude supplies. Helping to keep prices in check, though, are signals that oil inventories remain ample at the moment. Brent crude fell to its lowest price in nearly three years last month.

A report Thursday showed growth for real estate, health care and other U.S. services businesses accelerated to its strongest pace since February 2023.

A separate report suggested the number of layoffs across the United States remains relatively low. Slightly more workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, but the number remains low compared with history.

Outside of this week's worries about the Middle East, the dominant question hanging over Wall Street has been whether the job market will continue to hold up after the Federal Reserve earlier kept interest rates at a two-decade high. The Fed wanted to press the brake hard enough on the economy to stamp out high inflation.

Stocks are near their records because of hopes the U.S. economy will indeed continue to grow, now that the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates. The Fed last month lowered its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years and indicated more cuts will arrive through next year."
G20 environment ministers back funding for forest conservation,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/brazil-g20-environment-ministers-climate-change-marina-silva-f6ec8c0d48c8840e4c6d55e6c2ae0aff,2024-10-03T21:52:04Z,"SAO PAULO (AP) -- Environment ministers of the Group of 20 nations agreed Thursday to support the creation of funding sources for ecosystem services, acknowledging Brazil's proposal to establish a trust fund for forest conservation.

The Brazilian initiative, known as the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, would reward tropical forest countries for protecting critical biomes.

Unlike the Amazon Fund, which rewards Brazil if it succeeds in reducing deforestation, the initiative would benefit all tropical forest nations based on the area preserved, paying local and Indigenous communities involved for maintaining ecosystems that ""benefit everyone,"" João Paulo Capobianco, executive secretary of Brazil's Minister of the Environment, told journalists after the ministers' meeting.

The environment ministers of leading rich and developing countries assembled this week in Rio de Janeiro for four-day meetings to discuss climate change and sustainability. The topic is one of Brazil's priorities as it hosts the G20 presidency until the end of the year, with heads of state convening in Rio next month.

Over the past few days, environment ministers discussed efforts to address climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. They also assessed public and private financing strategies to support climate change adaptation, transition policies and the disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations, Brazil's Environment Minister Marina Silva said in opening remarks at Thursday's meeting.

""We have no time to lose, and we cannot leave anyone behind,"" Silva said. She addressed extreme events that have afflicted her own country this year, including a deadly flood in southern Rio Grande do Sul state and an historic drought that helped spread massive wildfires across the country.

""In the Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes, record drought isolates communities and cities and triggers wildfires of enormous proportions,"" Silva said. ""The situation is no different globally, showing in three dimensions the damage and suffering that average temperatures of 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial levels are already causing to much of humanity.""

The declaration emphasized scaling up mitigation and adaptation efforts. It also reiterated the signing ministers' support for the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Other focus areas included oceans, waste reduction, circular economy and plastic pollution.

Heads of state on Nov. 18-19 will assess the proposals their proxies have developed in the run-up to their meeting.

Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has put issues that concern the developing world -- such as the reduction of inequalities and the reform of multilateral institutions -- at the heart of the country's G20 presidency."

What's next after prosecutors reveal new evidence in Trump's 2020 election interference case,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-capitol-riot-jack-smith-jan-6-e687b91aa27df9f985580c122c5ef34c,2024-10-03T18:59:03Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Special counsel Jack Smith has provided a road map for how prosecutors hope to prove their case charging former President Donald Trump with an illegal scheme to overturn his 2020 election loss -- if it ever gets to trial.

In court papers unsealed Wednesday, Smith's team details new evidence of Trump's ""increasingly desperate"" efforts to cling to power even as those close to him sought to convince him that he had lost the presidency.

It comes just over a month before the presidential election that could determine the future of the case.

The Republican presidential nominee, who has railed against the case as politically motivated, slammed the filing in a NewsNation interview, calling it ""pure election interference"" and ""weaponization of the government.""

Here's a look at what the filing means and what's next:

The purpose of the filing is to convince U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington that allegations against Trump can move forward to trial even after the Supreme Court in July ruled that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.

While the Supreme Court said former presidents have at least presumptive immunity for actions taken in their official role as president, the justices said they are not shielded from prosecution for things they do in their private capacity.

Smith's team is trying to make the case that Trump's prosecution is not off limits because he was acting as a private candidate for office -- not a commander in chief -- when he schemed to overturn the will of voters. Prosecutors say Trump ""must stand trial for his private crimes as would any other citizen.""

""Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one,"" prosecutors wrote.

""Working with a team of private co-conspirators, the defendant acted as a candidate when he pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt, through fraud and deceit, the government function by which votes are collected and counted -- a function in which the defendant, as President, had no official role.""

The case was supposed to go to trial in March in Washington's federal court but was put on hold last December so Trump could appeal his sweeping claims of presidential immunity. Trump had asked the Supreme Court to dismiss the case entirely, saying it the ""Presidency itself cannot retain its vital independence, if the President faces criminal prosecution for official acts once he leaves office.""

While the Supreme Court didn't dismiss the case, it effectively stripped from the indictment allegations involving Trump's dealings with the Justice Department. And it sent the case back to Chutkan to determine which of the remaining allegations in the indictment involve official actions for which Trump may be immune from prosecution and which allegations, if any, can move forward to trial.

In August, Smith's team filed a new indictment that kept the same criminal charges but narrowed the allegations in an attempt to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling.

Trump's lawyers had objected to the filing, accusing prosecutors of wanting to publicize their ""politically motivated manifesto"" to hurt Trump's campaign in the final weeks before the election.

The defense will now get a chance to respond to the arguments from Smith's team. Trump's response is due later this month, but his lawyers on Tuesday evening asked for a five-week extension to file by Nov. 21.

Trump's lawyers have argued that the allegations in the indictment -- including conversations with his vice president and pressing state officials on the administration of elections -- cut to the core of Trump's responsibilities as commander in chief. Trump attorney John Lauro told the judge during a hearing last month that the Supreme Court's opinion required the outright dismissal of the case -- a position the judge made clear she did not accept.

Even if the judge agrees with prosecutors, the case isn't heading to trial anytime soon. Her rulings are expected to be appealed -- likely all the way to the Supreme Court.

And if Trump defeats Biden, he could appoint an attorney general who would seek the dismissal of this case and the other federal prosecutions he faces. Or Trump could potentially order a pardon for himself.

The filing gives Democrats new material to use as they campaign against Trump and offers voters a reminder of the allegations just a month out from Election Day, even as voting has already begun in some states.

Trump, too, has seized on the report, casting it as yet another effort by his rivals to try to hobble his campaign -- complaints that have proven a powerful motivator for his base and a boon for his fundraising.

It's unclear, though, what impact it will have on voters, given the wealth of detail about the 2020 campaign that has already been released as well as Trump's multiple indictments. In polling, concerns about protecting democracy have typically lagged behind concerns about issues like the economy and inflation.

That includes a recent CNN poll that found 4 in 10 likely voters said the economy was their most important issue when deciding how to vote, versus about 2 in 10 who said it was protecting democracy.

The issue of protecting democracy appears to be more important for Democrats and voters already backing Harris. Roughly 4 in 10 voters who support Harris say it is their top issue. For Republicans and Trump supporters, about 6 in 10 name the economy as their top voting issue, followed by immigration. Just 5% of Trump supporters said protecting democracy was their top issue.

Rare whale died of chronic entanglement in Maine fishing gear,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/right-whale-entangled-endangered-maine-7ffdd2faf5b09dfd476395ca0ff728a5,2024-10-03T17:04:47Z,"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A rare whale found dead off Massachusetts earlier this year died as a result of entanglement in Maine lobster fishing gear, federal authorities said.

The North Atlantic right whale was found dead off Martha's Vineyard in January. The whales are declining in population and are at the center of efforts to more tightly regulate shipping and commercial fishing off the East Coast.

A necropsy determined that the whale died from ""chronic entanglement"" in gear that was earlier determined to be consistent with the kind of rope used in Maine's lobster fishery, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Wednesday. NOAA said a law enforcement investigation into the whale's death remains open.

The right whales number less than 360 and they have experienced high mortality in recent years. The death of the whale reignited a longstanding debate between environmentalists and commercial fishermen about the need to more tightly regulate lobster fishing.

The right whales, which can weigh 150,000 pounds (68,000 kilograms), are vulnerable to lethal entanglement in the ropes commonly used in lobster fishing that connect lobster traps to surface buoys.

""Dying this way is a horrendous fate that no creature deserves, but it'll happen again and again until we get these deadly fishing ropes out of the water,"" said Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director for the Center for Biological Diversity.

Members of the industry said Thursday they have made strides to avoid the whales and have largely succeeded. The vast majority of America's lobster catch comes to the docks in Maine, where the seafood is a cultural icon and a key component of the economy.

""The fact is we know that entanglement in Maine gear is extremely rare. This is the first reported entanglement of a right whale in Maine lobster gear in 20 years and the first death attributed to the fishery,"" the Maine Lobstermen's Association said in a statement. ""Maine lobstermen have made significant changes to how they fish over the last 25 years to avoid entanglement.""

The population of the whales fell by about 25% from 2010 to 2020. They were once abundant off the East Coast, but they were decimated during the commercial fishing era and have been slow to recover.

The whales' migration has become dangerous in recent years because their food sources appear to be moving as waters warm, scientists have said. Scientists and environmentalists have said the whales stray from protected areas of ocean and become vulnerable to entanglements and collisions."
Elections have less impact on your 401(k) than you might think,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-stocks-volatility-bonds-economy-retirement-59201a39bffd596b253021a6526a4b60,2024-10-03T10:04:57Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Much like those annoying political TV ads, the warnings come back every four years: All the uncertainty around the U.S. presidential election could have big consequences for your 401(k)!

Such warnings can raise anxiety, but remember: If your 401(k) is like many retirement savers', with most invested in funds that track the S&P 500 or other broad indexes, all the noise may not make much of a difference.

Stocks do tend to get shakier in the months leading up to Election Day. Even the bond market sees an average 15% rise in volatility from mid-September of an election year through Election Day, according to a review by Monica Guerra, a strategist at Morgan Stanley. That may partly be because financial markets hate uncertainty. In the runup to the election, uncertainty is high about what kinds of policies will win out.

But after the results come in, regardless of which party wins the White House, the uncertainty dissipates, and markets get back to work. The volatility tends to steady itself, Guerra's review shows.

More than which party controls the White House, what's mattered for stocks over the long term is where the U.S. economy is in its cycle as it moved from recession to expansion and back again through the decades.

""Over the long term, market performance is more closely correlated with the business cycle than political party control,"" Guerra wrote in a recent report.

Where the economy currently is in its cycle is up for debate. It's been growing since the 2020 recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some pessimistic investors think the expansion is near its end, with all the cumulative slowing effects of the Federal Reserve's hikes to interest rates in prior years still to be felt. Other, more optimistic investors believe the expansion may still have legs now that the Fed is cutting rates to juice the economy.

Politics may have some sway underneath the surface of stock indexes and influence which industries and sectors are doing the best. Tech and financial stocks have historically done better than the rest of the market one year after a Democratic president took office. For a Republican, meanwhile, raw-material producers were among the relative winners, according to Morgan Stanley.

Plus, control of Congress may be just as important as who wins the White House. A gridlocked Washington with split control will likely see less sweeping changes in fiscal or tax policy, no matter who the president is.

Of course, the candidates in this election do differ from history in some major ways. Former President Donald Trump is a strong proponent of tariffs, which raise the cost of imports from other countries, for example.

In a scenario where the United States applied sustained and universal tariffs, economists and strategists at UBS Global Wealth Management say U.S. stocks could fall by around 10% because the tariffs would ultimately act like a sales tax on U.S. households.

But they also see a relatively low chance of such a scenario happening, at roughly 10%."
Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed and the yen slips against the dollar,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-yen-iran-8c9ee16a53152dcb07bafd0051c3de93,2024-10-03T04:34:23Z,"Asian shares were mixed on Thursday after U.S. stocks were little changed as investors watched to see developments in the Middle East.

The U.S. dollar gained against the Japanese yen as officials downplayed the likelihood of an interest rate hike soon.

That helped push Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index higher. It gained 2.2% to 38,655.03, while the dollar traded at 146.80 Japanese yen, up from 146.41 yen late Wednesday.

The dollar had been trading around 142 yen after the ruling Liberal Democrats chose Shigeru Ishiba to head the party and succeed Fumio Kishida as prime minister. Ishiba had expressed support for the central bank's recent moves to raise its near-zero benchmark interest rate, which stands at around 0.25%. That led traders to bet that the yen would gain in value.

But after a meeting between Ishiba and Bank of Japan Gov. Kazuo Ueda, both officials indicated that the central bank did not view further rate hikes as suitable for the economy at this time. That prompted a flurry of selling of yen.

The meeting between Ishiba and Ueda was not expected to bring major news, however, ""when Ishiba hinted that growing global risks should keep the BoJ firmly grounded, yen bulls hit the exits faster than you can say 'sayonara,'"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.

Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.5% to 21,661.99 as investors locked in profits after it roared 6.2% higher a day earlier on a wave of investor enthusiasm over recent announcements from Beijing to rev up the Chinese economy.

With Shanghai and other markets in China closed for a weeklong holiday, trading has crowded into Hong Kong. Markets in South Korea and Taiwan also were closed. India's Sensex fell 0.7%.

Oil prices rose again as the world waited to see how Israel will respond to Tuesday's missile attack from Iran.

U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 73 cents to $70.83 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 67 cents to $74.57 per barrel.

Israel is not a major producer of oil, but Iran is, and a worry is that a broadening war could affect neighboring countries that are also integral to the flow of crude.

On Wednesday, Wall Street benchmarks ended little changed amid uncertainty over conflict in the Middle East.

The S&P 500 gained less than 1 point, to 5,709.54, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.1% to 42,196.52. The Nasdaq composite added 0.1% to 17,925.12.

In the bond market, Treasury yields rose after a report indicated hiring by U.S. employers outside the government may have been stronger last month than expected.

The report from ADP Research said private-sector employers accelerated their hiring in September. That could be an encouraging signal for the more comprehensive report on the U.S. job market due to arrive Friday from the U.S. government.

The dominant question hanging over Wall Street has been whether the job market can keep holding up after the Federal Reserve earlier kept interest rates at a two-decade high. The Fed was trying to press the brakes hard enough on the economy to stamp out high inflation.

Stocks are near records in large part on the belief that the U.S. economy will continue to grow now that the Federal Reserve has shifted to cutting interest rates. The Fed last month lowered its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years and indicated more cuts will arrive through next year.

Nike sank 6.8% even though the athletic giant reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts, and the slump shows how much work incoming CEO Elliott Hill has in making the brand cool among customers.

Tesla sank 3.5% despite reporting an increase in its deliveries of electric vehicles during the latest quarter, the first time that's happened this year. The number topped analysts' forecasts, but investors may have been expecting an even bigger increase."
"Casey, McCormick to meet for first debate in Pennsylvania's battleground Senate race",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-senate-debate-casey-mccormick-89f4120ac553b31d778523dc699d5771,2024-10-03T04:22:51Z,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Republican challenger David McCormick will meet Thursday night for their first debate in an expensive race for a swing-state seat that could help determine control of the Senate in November's election.

Casey, perhaps Pennsylvania's best-known politician, is seeking a fourth term and is facing what he calls his toughest reelection challenge yet.

Casey, 64, is a staunch ally of labor unions, a former state auditor general and treasurer and Pennsylvania's longest-serving Democrat in the Senate. He has campaigned on preserving the middle class, abortion rights, labor rights and voting rights, and calls McCormick and former President Donald Trump a threat to all those.

McCormick, 59, is making his second run for the Senate after losing narrowly to Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022's Republican primary. He is a former hedge fund CEO who served at the highest levels of former President George W. Bush's administration and sat on Trump's Defense Advisory Board.

He has accused Casey of rubber-stamping Biden administration policies on immigration, the economy, energy and national security that he blames for inflation, domestic turmoil and war. He also has attacked Casey as out of touch after being in elected office for almost three decades.

Casey, in turn, has attacked McCormick as a carpetbagger from Connecticut's ritzy "" Gold Coast "" who got rich at the expense of others while an executive at a hedge fund there.

Casey has been a key player for Democrats trying to reframe the election-year narrative about the economy by attacking ""greedflation"" -- a blunt term for corporations jacking up prices and ripping off shoppers to maximize profits -- as fast-rising prices opened a big soft spot in 2024 for Democrats.

McCormick, meanwhile, has made a bid for Jewish voters by traveling to the Israel-Gaza border, speaking to Jewish audiences across the state and arguing that Casey and the Biden administration have not fought antisemitism or backed Israel strongly enough in the Israel-Hamas war.

Democrats currently hold a Senate majority by the narrowest of margins but face a difficult 2024 Senate map. A Casey loss could guarantee Republican control of the Senate.

More than $150 million has been spent on the race so far, according to Federal Election Commission records, and the total is on track to exceed $300 million, based on campaign ad tracking by AdImpact, which includes spots reserved between now and Election Day.

The 60-minute debate will air on TV starting at 8 p.m. across Pennsylvania and stream live online. The debate is being hosted by WHTM-TV in Harrisburg.

The candidates have agreed to another debate, to be held at a Philadelphia TV station Oct. 15.

Both Casey and McCormick were uncontested for their party's nominations in the primary election.

Also on the Nov. 5 Senate ballot are John Thomas of the Libertarian Party, Leila Hazou of the Green Party and Marty Selker of the Constitution Party. They were not invited to the debate."
Hurricane Helene brings climate change to forefront of the presidential campaign,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/helene-climate-walz-vance-debate-harris-trump-e1023e209548db8ec587115505c9797f,2024-10-03T04:05:58Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene has brought climate change to the forefront of the presidential campaign after the issue lingered on the margins for months.

Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Georgia Wednesday to see hard-hit areas, two days after her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, was in the state and criticized the federal response to the storm, which has killed at least 178 people. Thousands of people in the Carolinas still lack running water, cellphone service and electricity.

President Joe Biden toured some of the hardest-hit areas by helicopter on Wednesday. Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms and other natural disasters, traveled to the Carolinas to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation. He is expected to visit Georgia and Florida later this week.

""Storms are getting stronger and stronger,"" Biden said after surveying damage near Asheville, North Carolina. At least 70 people died in the state.

""Nobody can deny the impact of the climate crisis any more,'' Biden said at a briefing in Raleigh, the state capital. ""They must be brain dead if they do.""

Harris, meanwhile, hugged and huddled with a family in hurricane-ravaged Augusta, Georgia.

""There is real pain and trauma that resulted because of this hurricane'' and its aftermath, Harris said outside a storm-damaged house with downed trees in the yard.

""We are here for the long haul,'' she added.

The focus on the storm -- and its link to climate change -- was notable after climate change was only lightly mentioned in two presidential debates this year. The candidates instead focused on abortion rights, the economy, immigration and other issues.

The hurricane featured prominently in Tuesday's vice presidential debate as Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz were asked about the storm and the larger issue of climate change.

Both men called the hurricane a tragedy and agreed on the need for a strong federal response. But it was Walz, the governor of Minnesota, who put the storm in the context of a warming climate.

""There's no doubt this thing roared onto the scene faster and stronger than anything we've seen,"" he said.

Bob Henson, a meteorologist and writer with Yale Climate Connections, said it was no surprise that Helene is pushing both the federal disaster response and human-caused climate change into the campaign conversation.

""Weather disasters are often overlooked as a factor in big elections,'' he said. ""Helene is a sprawling catastrophe, affecting millions of Americans. And it dovetails with several well-established links between hurricanes and climate change, including rapid intensification and intensified downpours.""

More than 40 trillion gallons of rain drenched the Southeast in the last week, an amount that if concentrated in North Carolina would cover the state in 3 1/2 feet of water. ""That's an astronomical amount of precipitation,"" said Ed Clark, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

During Tuesday's debate, Walz credited Vance for past statements acknowledging that climate change is a problem. But he noted that Trump has called climate change ""a hoax"" and joked that rising seas ""would make more beachfront property to be able to invest in.''

Trump said in a speech Tuesday that ""the planet has actually gotten little bit cooler recently,"" adding: ""Climate change covers everything.""

In fact, summer 2024 sweltered to Earth's hottest on record, making it likely this year will end up as the warmest humanity has measured, according to the European climate service Copernicus. Global records were shattered just last year as human-caused climate change, with a temporary boost from an El Niño, keeps dialing up temperatures and extreme weather, scientists said.

Vance, an Ohio senator, said he and Trump support clean air, clean water and ""want the environment to be cleaner and safer."" However, during Trump's four years in office, he took a series of actions to roll back more than 100 environmental regulations.

Vance sidestepped a question about whether he agrees with Trump's statement that climate change is a hoax. ""What the president has said is that if the Democrats -- in particular Kamala Harris and her leadership -- really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America. And that's not what they're doing,"" he said.

""This idea that carbon (dioxide) emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So we're not arguing about weird science. If you believe that, what would you want to do?"" Vance asked.

The answer, he said, is to ""produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.''

Vance claimed that policies by Biden and Harris actually help China, because many solar panels, lithium-ion batteries and other materials used in renewable energy and electric vehicles are made in China and imported to the United States.

Walz rebutted that claim, noting that the Inflation Reduction Act, the Democrats' signature climate law approved in 2022, includes the largest-ever investment in domestic clean energy production. The law, for which Harris cast the deciding vote, has created 200,000 jobs across the country, including in Ohio and Minnesota, Walz said. Vance was not in the Senate when the law was approved.

""We are producing more natural gas and more oil (in the United States) than we ever have,"" Walz said. ""We're also producing more clean energy.""

The comment echoed a remark by Harris in last month's presidential debate. The Biden-Harris administration has overseen ""the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil,"" Harris said then.

While Biden rarely mentions it, domestic fossil fuel production under his administration is at an all-time high. Crude oil production averaged 12.9 million barrels a day last year, eclipsing a previous record set in 2019 under Trump, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Democrats want to continue investments in renewable energy such as wind and solar power -- and not just because supporters of the Green New Deal want that, Walz said.

""My farmers know climate change is real. They've seen 500-year droughts, 500-year floods back to back. But what they're doing is adapting,'' he said.

""The solution for us is to continue to move forward, (accept) that climate change is real"" and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, Walz said, adding that the administration is doing exactly that.

""We are seeing us becoming an energy superpower for the future, not just the current'' time, he said.

Kaine and Cao face off in only debate of campaign for US Senate seat from Virginia,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/virginia-senate-debate-kaine-cao-7371d70b8969bef41c070be7259502a7,2024-10-03T02:18:51Z,"The hourlong showdown at Norfolk State University mostly traced the contours of the nation's political fault lines. But it also included matters that resonate in Virginia and the coastal city of Norfolk, which is home to the country's largest Navy base.

Cao, a 25-year Navy veteran, criticized COVID vaccine mandates for service members and the chaotic troop withdrawal from Afghanistan when asked about the military's collective failure to recently meet recruiting goals. He also criticized diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.

""When you're using a drag queen to recruit for the Navy, that's not the people we want,"" Cao said. ""What we need is alpha males and alpha females who are going to rip out their own guts, eat them and ask for seconds. Those are the young men and women that are going to win wars.""

Kaine, who is on the Senate Armed Services Committee, responded by saying that railing at DEI ""is a red herring"" and the real challenge is informing more Americans about the benefits of the military when only about 1% of the population serves in the armed forces.

""We need to do a better job of talking about the G.I. Bill and other benefits as well as the tremendous leadership training that you get in the military,"" Kaine said.

Another subject was former President Donald Trump's proposal to place more tariffs on imported goods.

""What we need to do is not tax our industry here,"" Cao said. ""What we need to do is tax other countries bringing in goods.""

Kaine criticized Trump's proposal.

""The Trump tariffs would be a massive tax that would cause prices on all of these items that are imported to go up,"" Kaine said. ""On that, I differ strongly from my opponent.""

Asked whether he would support mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, Cao did not answer directly but said: ""If you came here illegally, you've basically screwed up the whole system.""

Cao, whose family fled Vietnam in the 1970s, said they waited seven years for their naturalization papers.

""You can't jump the line,"" Cao said. ""I mean, you go to Costco and jump the line, what do you think is going to happen? You can't come here and expect the American dream if you're not willing to obey the American laws and embrace the American culture.""

Kaine said he has never supported amnesty for immigrants who are in the country illegally but mass deportation would ""devastate the economy.""

Kaine also criticized Republicans and Trump for failing to pass stronger border security laws.

""We recently negotiated a very tough border deal that would have put a lot of resources on the border to stop illegal immigration,"" Kaine said. ""President Trump asked for Republicans to oppose it, even though it was supported by the border control union.""

With Kaine's seat considered solidly Democratic, the race has not seen the kind of dead-heat polling as the national presidential contest or the high stakes drama of other Senate races such as those in Montana and Ohio, where Democratic incumbents face tough re-election bids.

Trump has endorsed Cao. And political scientists say his path to victory is narrow given Virginia's moderate electorate, aversion to Trump in 2020 and Kaine's salience with voters.

Kaine won his last race in 2018 by 16 percentage points, although he said he was preparing for a tough race this year. The most recent Republican from Virginia to hold a U.S. Senate seat was the late John Warner, a centrist with an independent streak who last won in 2002.

Republicans can still win statewide offices in Virginia, however: Glenn Youngkin was elected governor by two points in 2021, along with a Republican lieutenant governor and attorney general."
Virginia House candidates debate abortion and affordability as congressional election nears,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/derrick-anderson-eugene-vindman-congress-election-virginia-9eb610dfc95d6e18cad17a5d19518416,2024-10-03T01:11:02Z,"FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Nearly a month before election day, Republican Derrick Anderson and Democrat Yevgeny ""Eugene"" Vindman attempted to portray themselves as the candidate best fit for Congress on Wednesday in what is shaping up to be Virginia's most competitive race.

Anderson, a former Army Green beret native of the state's 7th District, touted his local roots and military service, stressing his desire to represent his community and continue his public service endeavors.

Vindman, an Army veteran who rose to national prominence after contributing to President Donald Trump's first impeachment alongside his brother, argued that he would be a fierce defender against Republican extremism in Congress.

In a roughly hourlong debate hosted by the University of Mary Washington, the candidates blasted each other's actions on the campaign trail. Anderson accused Vindman of lying about his military rank and combat experience. Vindman was promoted to colonel, but he retired before being eligible to retain the rank.

""He's lied about being a colonel -- he's not a colonel,"" Anderson said, later adding: ""My opponent said that he used weapons of war in combat when knows very well he did not.""

Vindman, in turn, flamed Anderson for ""trying to fool the voters in the district about his fake family,"" referencing a photo reported by the New York Times of Anderson standing to a woman and her three daughters. Anderson's campaign said Wednesday that he never claimed the women in the photo were his family, and that Anderson has often posted photos with his actual family.

""If you're going to portray yourself as a family man so people like you, how can you be trusted on more serious topics?"" Vindman said.

The rebukes are some of the latest jabs Vindman and Anderson have made in their battle to win the House seat, which became open after Democratic incumbent Rep. Abigail Spanberger filed to run for Virginia governor and declined to seek reelection.

Home to some of the fastest-growing counties in Virginia, the congressional district ranges from outer-ring D.C. suburbs to the rural piedmont of central Virginia. Experts say the election could be critical in determining which party will clinch a House majority. According to the Virginia Public Access Project, Anderson had raised $1.4 million,and Vindman nearly $7.5 million throughout their campaigns.

Over the course of the debate, Anderson focused on the economy, criticizing President Joe Biden's economic policies and the lack of affordability in Virginia.

""Are you better off than you were four years ago today?"" Anderson said. ""I would say the answer is 'No.' ""

Vindman emphasized his pledge to protect abortion rights and fend off Republican extremism, making reference to Project 2025, a detailed blueprint for governing in the next Republican administration.

He referenced his daughter, who he argued had fewer rights than the generations of women before her.

Supporters of candidates clapped, cheered, booed and heckled at the candidates throughout the debate. At one point, the moderator told the crowd: ""Your job is to be an audience member, not a candidate.""

Before the event, supporters gathered on the university campus, waving signs and donning candidate T-shirts."
Last call at 4 a.m. in California? Governor says yes for one private club in LA Clippers' new arena,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/newsom-alcohol-exception-los-angeles-clippers-club-39e62c268490e199ad037b78671133f3,2024-10-02T22:26:20Z,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The last call for drinks is 2 a.m. in California, but the state will soon carve out an exception to allow alcohol to be served until 4 a.m. for one private, members-only club located in the Los Angeles Clippers' new state-of-the-art arena.

The new law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom over the weekend will allow about 100 club members to be served wine, beer and other liquor until 4 a.m. in private suites inside the Intuit Dome after game days and concerts.

It was sponsored by a group owned by Steve Ballmer, the current Clippers owner and former CEO of Microsoft. Ballmer funded the Intuit Dome and his wife, Connie Ballmer, gave Newsom's campaign $1 million in 2021 to help fight a recall election against the governor. The group owned by Steve Ballmer also spent roughly $220,000 this year to sway lawmakers on the legislation, among other proposals, according to lobbying reports.

The measure drew criticism from some, including ethics experts, for granting an exception benefiting a major campaign donor's family member.

""It's certainly going to become an issue for his opponents and critics to point to the fact that he seemed to provide a special favor to a wealthy sports franchise owner and its facility and its wealthy fans,"" said John Pelissero, director of government ethics at Santa Clara University. ""It just doesn't look good.""

Newsom's spokesperson Izzy Gardon said ""the Governor's decisions on legislation are made solely on the merits of each bill.""

It's not the first time the governor has faced a backlash for carving out exceptions for a select few. He was lambasted for attending a birthday party in 2020 at the pricy French Laundry restaurant in wine country north of San Francisco, breaking the very rules he preached to the public to slow the spread of the coronavirus during the pandemic.

The new California law allowing the exception for the private club members comes after California lawmakers spent years unsuccessfully pushing to extend the last call for drinks in a few cities. Several states, including New York and Tennessee, have already passed legislation extending serving hours beyond 2 a.m.

""If they think opening venues and having drinking until 4 o'clock in the morning is good for just exclusive groups, then it should be for everyone, and my contention is, it's not good for anyone,"" said Republican state Sen. Kelly Seyarto in August of the measure.

Representatives working for Steve Ballmer didn't immediately respond to calls about the new law and potential influence.

The arena officially opened in August with 18,000 seats. It is scheduled to host the 2026 All-Star Game and serve as the basketball venue for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

Supporters of the new California law said it's a pilot program that will boost the local economy and attract more visitors to the entertainment hub in the city of Inglewood, which boasts several iconic venues including the Rams' SoFi stadium, the Forum and now the new Intuit Dome. Under the law, the exception will sunset in January 2030 and the new last-call rule still needs final approval from the city. Opponents worry the new last-call hours will lead to more drunk driving and promote excessive drinking.

In a signing message, Newsom also said he would direct California Highway Patrol to work with local police to monitor drunken driving incidents in the area and report back findings to lawmakers for further consideration.

""I remain cognizant of the potential risks to public safety posed by extending service hours for alcoholic beverage service, which could lead to an increase in driving under the influence-related crashes and fatalities,"" Newsom said."

Edmunds' experts have done that homework for you so you can start your search with the five recommended models listed below. RepairPal, a network of automotive repair shops, gives each one a high score for overall reliability. The vehicles also have favorable consumer reviews on Edmunds.

As with any used vehicle purchase, the car's history is important. Watch out for reported accidents and other problems, and avoid models showing signs of neglect or abuse. Also, have patience if you can. It's better to wait for the right vehicle than to buy something you might not like and regret your purchase later on.

Small Car: 2014-2018 Mazda 3

Fun to drive and stylish, the 2014-2018 Mazda 3 is available as a four-door sedan and a five-door hatchback. Several versions of the car are available, ranging from econocar basic to unexpectedly upscale. The Mazda 3 offers a choice between two four-cylinder engines and a manual or an automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is not available, but you can find it in the next-generation Mazda 3 that debuted in 2019. High-mileage examples of that version of the car sometimes squeak in under the $15,000 mark.

Look for: The available 2.5-liter engine is more powerful and worth getting. Look for a Mazda 3 with the 2.5 designation, which is usually a Touring or Grand Touring trim level. Mazda improved the car's handling and refreshed its interior for the 2017 model year.

Small SUV: 2012-2016 Honda CR-V

Few small SUVs are as outright practical as the roomy Honda CR-V. It has comfortable seating for five and plenty of cargo space behind the back seat. The best word to describe the CR-V is ""easy."" It's easy to drive, park and see out of. Only one engine is offered, but it gets good fuel economy for a small SUV. All-wheel drive is optional. It's a great pick for an all-around SUV that also gets high marks for reliability.

Look for: Honda redesigned the CR-V in 2012. Updates in 2015 brought appealing design revisions, a more efficient engine, more modern infotainment technology, and additional driver assist features. The 2016 CR-V Special Edition is a particularly good value.

Midsize Car: 2013-2017 Honda Accord

For decades, the Honda Accord has been a benchmark car, and the 2013-2017 coupes and sedans are no different. You can get this Accord with a four-cylinder or a V6 engine, and a manual or an automatic transmission. Both engines provide sporty acceleration and pleasing fuel economy. Other Accord highlights include a roomy interior, responsive handling and easy-to-use controls.

Look for: An Accord Hybrid became available for the 2014 model year. It might be worth seeking out if high mpg is a priority for you; otherwise, stick with the standard Accord. In 2016, a new touchscreen infotainment system arrived with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. These smartphone integration systems make it easy to use many of your phone's features and apps through the touchscreen.

Midsize SUV: 2014-2019 Toyota Highlander

The Highlander is the best vehicle on this list for big families. This SUV has three rows of seats, plenty of cargo room, and a choice of four-cylinder, V6 and hybrid engines. Get the V6 for satisfying acceleration or choose the hybrid for maximum fuel economy. Both are available with all-wheel drive and in different trim levels that cater to your equipment needs.

Look for: The 2017-2019 models that boast numerous improvements over earlier versions. These include more power and fuel efficiency, added driver assist features and a sporty SE trim level.

Pickup Truck: 2005-2015 Toyota Tacoma

Tacomas are just about as bulletproof as trucks come, which means they hold their value extraordinarily well. Finding a used one with less than 100,000 miles for under $15,000 is tough, but if the truck is clean and properly maintained, don't worry too much about a six-digit odometer reading. However, do plan on getting something basic unless you can increase your budget.

Look for: Important safety features became standard on the Tacoma starting with the 2009 model year. If you want a Tacoma with a luxury vibe, look for one with the Limited package starting for 2013. In general, the newer the Tacoma, the better the infotainment technology it will have.

Edmunds Says

You can find success by exercising patience and casting a wide net in search of a reliable ride for under $15,000. No matter what you decide to buy, obtain a vehicle history report and closely inspect any used car for signs of neglect and abuse."
The Latest: Trio of crises loom over final the campaign's final stretch,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-vance-walz-election-f0400b64e7e632e39e0704b07b415b48,2024-10-02T12:40:12Z,"In a debate that evoked a calmer era in American politics, Tim Walz and JD Vance went after each other's running mates Tuesday and sought to shore up their campaigns' vulnerabilities at a time of renewed fears of a regional war in the Middle East and sadness over devastation from Hurricane Helene.

Meanwhile, those new trials -- along with a dockworkers strike that threatens the U.S. economy -- are looming over the final weeks of the presidential campaign and could help shape the public mood as voters decide between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.

Over the past four years, President Joe Biden has jetted off to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires and tropical storms. It's not a role Kamala Harris has played as vice president.

But on Wednesday, they'll both fan out across the Southeast to grapple with the damage from Hurricane Helene, seeking to demonstrate commitment and competence in helping devastated communities after Donald Trump's false claims about their administration's response. Biden is heading to North and South Carolina, while Harris is going to Georgia.

Harris' stop will also serve as a political test in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. She's trying to step into the role for which Biden is best known -- showing the empathy Americans expect in times of tragedy -- in the closing stretch of her campaign for president.

Former President Donald Trump is going back to Butler, Pennsylvania, where the world saw him pump his fist and beseech followers to ""fight,"" even as blood streaked his face from a would-be assassin's bullet.

In announcing his return, the current Republican nominee said he planned to ""celebrate a unifying vision for America's future in an event like the world has never seen before.""

The question is: Is Butler ready?

While many are predicting a large crowd to hear Trump speak back at the very Farm Show property where a bullet grazed his right ear on July 13, there's also apprehension in town, along with a sense that Butler is still healing."
Sex workers are hit hard by Congo's mpox outbreak but say their only option is to keep working,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mpox-outbreak-sex-workers-miners-kamituga-congo-5f6f3c7e9f0abd1917f8daf41678ea2b,2024-10-02T04:51:43Z,"KAMITUGA, Congo (AP) -- It's been four months since Sifa Kunguja recovered from mpox, but as a sex worker, she said, she's still struggling to regain clients, with fear and stigma driving away clients who've heard she had the virus.

""It's risky work,"" Kunguja, 40, said from her small home in eastern Congo. ""But if I don't work, I won't have money for my children.""

Sex workers are among those hardest-hit by the mpox outbreak in Kamituga, where some 40,000 of them are estimated to reside -- many single mothers driven by poverty to this mineral-rich commercial hub where gold miners comprise the majority of the clientele. Doctors estimate 80% of cases here have been contracted sexually, though the virus also spreads through other kinds of skin-to-skin contact.

Sex workers say the situation threatens their health and livelihoods. Health officials warn that more must be done to stem the spread -- with a focus on sex workers -- or mpox will creep deeper through eastern Congo and the region.

Mpox causes mostly mild symptoms such as fever and body aches, but serious cases can mean prominent, painful blisters on the face, hands, chest and genitals.

Kunguja and other sex workers insist that despite risks of reinfection or spreading the virus, they have no choice but to keep working. Sex work isn't illegal in Congo, though related activities such as solicitation are. Rights groups say possible legal consequences and fear of retribution -- sex workers are subject to high rates of violence including rape and abuse -- prevent women from seeking medical care. That can be especially detrimental during a public health emergency, according to experts.

Health officials in Kamituga are advocating for the government to shutter nightclubs and mines and compensate sex workers for lost business.

Not everyone agrees. Local officials say they don't have resources to do more than care for those who are sick, and insist it's sex workers' responsibility to protect themselves.

Kamituga Mayor Alexandre Bundya M'pila told The Associated Press that the government is creating awareness campaigns but lacks money to reach everyone. He also said sex workers should look for other jobs, without providing examples of what might be available.

Miners stream into Kamituga by the tens of thousands. The economy is centered on the mines: Buyers line streets, traders travel to sell gold, small businesses and individuals provide food and lodging, and the sex industry flourishes.

Nearly a dozen sex workers spoke to AP. They said well over half their clients are miners.

The industry is well organized, according to the Kenyan-based African Sex Workers Alliance, composed of sex worker-led groups. The alliance estimates that 13% of Kamituga's 300,000 residents are sex workers.

The town has 18 sex-worker committees, the alliance said, with a leadership that tries to work with government officials, protect and support colleagues, and advocate for their rights.

But sex work in Congo is dangerous. Women face systematic violence that's tolerated by society, according to a report by UMANDE, a local sex-worker rights group.

Many women are forced into the industry because of poverty or because, like Kunguja, they're single parents and must support their families.

The sex workers who spoke to AP described mpox as an added burden. Many are terrified of getting the virus -- it means time away from work, lost income and perhaps losing business altogether.

Those who recover are stigmatized, they said. Kamituga is a small place, where most everyone knows one another. Neighbors whisper and tell clients when someone is sick -- people talk and point.

Since contracting mpox in May, Kunguja said she's gone from about 20 clients daily to five. When she was sick, the lesions on her genitals were so painful she could hardly walk, hunched over and wobbling to get around. Her 9-year-old son caught it from her, she said -- he's out of the hospital but still has lesions.

She's been supporting her 11 children through sex work for nearly a decade, but said she now can't afford to send them to school. To compensate, she's selling alcohol by day, but it's not enough.

She said she wants the government to subsidize her income so she doesn't have to put herself or others at risk.

Disease experts say a lack of vaccines and information makes stemming the spread difficult.

Some 250,000 vaccines have arrived in Congo, but it's unclear when any will get to Kamituga. Sex workers and miners are among those slated to receive them first.

Community leaders and aid groups are trying to teach sex workers about protecting themselves and their clients via awareness sessions where they discuss signs and symptoms. They also press condom use, which they say isn't widespread enough in the industry.

Sex workers told AP that they insist on using condoms when they have them, but that they simply don't have enough.

Kamituga's general hospital gives them boxes of about 140 condoms every few months. Some sex workers see up to 60 clients a day -- for less than $1 a person. Condoms run out, and workers say they can't afford more.

Dr. Guy Mukari, an epidemiologist working with the National Institute of Biomedical Research in Congo, noted that the variant running rampant in Kamituga seems more susceptible to transmission via sex, making for a double whammy with the sex industry.

Even health experts admit the lack of information about the virus makes it unclear how effective condoms are. Lesions are usually found around the base of the penis, an area that condoms don't cover, they note.

Some women resort to flimsy plastic bags when they can't find condoms, sex worker Irene Mabwidi said. As a leader in her local sex industry group, she said she tries to advise women on other protection measures, such as inspecting clients' bodies for lesions, though that's far from foolproof.

Erin Kilbride of Human Rights Watch said it's crucial that sex workers are in the room when the government designs outreach programs.

""The government should proactively reach out to sex worker organizations, at the local and national level, who are experts in what their communities need,"" Kilbride said.

Health experts say miners are also key to containing the virus. While mpox is spread mainly through close contact, it can also occasionally spread from the environment via objects or surfaces touched by an infected person, according to the World Health Organization.

There's little awareness of that in mines, where conditions are often unsanitary. Mines have few, if any, handwashing stations, and sometimes miners don't shower for days. Infected miners might urinate or openly defecate in mines and contaminate water sources, health officials say.

Miners told AP more information and advocacy is needed in mines. Debus Bulambo said he got mpox in February, but sees most fellow miners failing to take the virus seriously. People want to spend cash on sex, even during an epidemic, sometimes paying five times more to go without a condom, he noted. And miners earn a lot -- up to about $120 a month, more than double the country's average annual income.

Bulambo said he occasionally paid for sex in the past but stopped, though he realizes he's the exception.

""People aren't afraid,"" he said bluntly. ""I don't understand.""

"Harris, Trump's approach to Mideast crisis, hurricane to test public mood in final weeks of campaign",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-mideast-dockworkers-hurricane-biden-a17bb5abe3c9bcfbea58a6ed17eb0ba6,2024-10-02T04:29:21Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A trio of new trials -- a devastating hurricane, expanding conflict in the Mideast and a dockworkers strike that threatens the U.S. economy -- are looming over the final weeks of the presidential campaign and could help shape the public mood as voters decide between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.

How events shake out -- and how the candidates respond -- could be decisive as they claw for votes in battleground states.

The sitting president, Joe Biden, is still the steward of a U.S. economy and foreign policy at this tumultuous moment and may well bear ultimate responsibility for how they play out. But how Harris and Trump approach the three disparate issues could have rippling impact on how Americans perceive their two choices this November.

""Unfortunately, there are going to be events like this, and this is where you see the leadership of a president show up,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Tuesday. ""I think this should send a message to Americans: It matters. It matters who sits behind the Resolute Desk.""

Harris, with Biden's help, is trying to display steady calm as a flurry of difficult problems arise all at once.

She and Biden on Tuesday toggled between directing Hurricane Helene recovery and rescue response work and huddling with aides in the White House Situation Room to watch as the U.S. helped Israel defend against a massive attack by Iran in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed leaders of Lebanese Hezbollah.

All the while, they were keeping close contact with economic advisers as dockworkers took to the picket line Tuesday, a walkout stretching from ports in Maine to Texas that threatens to snarl supply chains and cause shortages and higher prices if it stretches on for more than a few weeks.

Trump, for his part, lashed out at Harris as in over her head, while claiming that this sort of crush of problems never would have happened under his watch.

""We have been talking about World War III, and I don't want to make predictions,"" Trump said at a campaign event in Wisconsin. ""The whole world is laughing at us. That's why Israel was under attack just a little while ago. Because they don't respect our country anymore.""

Yet voters cast Trump aside four years ago in large part because of how they viewed his handling of the swirling economic, social and public health challenges that emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Biden, in comments to reporters before meeting with aides Tuesday to discuss the ongoing hurricane response, seemed to acknowledge the growing frustration with the federal response to the massive storm.

""I've been in frequent contact with the governors and other leaders in the impacted areas, and we have to jumpstart this recovery process,"" Biden said. He will travel to the Carolinas on Wednesday to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation. He is also expected to visit hurricane-impacted areas in Georgia and Florida later this week. ""People are scared to death. People wonder whether they're going to make it.""

Harris, meanwhile, is headed to Georgia on Wednesday and North Carolina in the coming days to do the same.

Tuesday's vice presidential debate offered a sampling of how the two campaigns were reacting to new developments to bolster their own messages and sharpen their attacks on their rivals. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised ""steady leadership"" under Harris while Ohio Sen. JD Vance pledged a return to ""peace through strength"" if Trump is returned to the White House.

Biden has stayed off the campaign trail since announcing in July that he was ending his reelection effort amid sliding public approval ratings.

His conspicuous absence underscores that Democrats see him as more of a liability than an asset in making the case for Harris, said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania.

But how well Biden deals with the three latest emergency situations could have a big impact in how undecided voters perceive Harris in these final days.

""President Biden can't help Kamala Harris on the stump,"" Borick said. ""But in a campaign where you are turning over every rock in a few states to get that undecided voter, how he manages these crises over the next several weeks could have an impact.""

The Harris campaign understands the risks it faces with multiple crises converging all at once, especially given their varied and unpredictable nature. A prolonged strike, a bungled disaster response or a further expansion of Middle East conflict could raise doubts about Biden's leadership, and by extension that of his second-in-command.

At the same time, Harris campaign aides believe the perilous moment presents an opportunity to demonstrate to voters the stakes of who's in the job and the seriousness with which they approach it, according to campaign officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking.

The former president, in a speech in Waunakee, Wisconsin, and in social media postings Tuesday, offered a mixture of prayer and concern for those impacted by Helene, jabs at Harris for the dockworkers strike, and an aside about the casting of Stanley Kubrick's film ""Full Metal Jacket.""

""The situation should have never come to this and, had I been president, it would not have,"" Trump said in a statement about the strike.

Harris aides made a point of having the vice president deliver brief remarks on the Iranian attack Tuesday in between taping interviews for her campaign, aiming to portray her as ready to take command.

Late-term tumult has been fixture in American presidential politics, sometimes in the form of scandal and other times with an incumbent hoping to demonstrate that he or his preferred successor would be a steady head at an uncertain time.

George W. Bush pushed a rescue package through Congress to stabilize a reeling financial system by creating the Troubled Asset Relief Program amid fears that the economy was on the verge of collapse. The broader economic conditions didn't help Republican John McCain in the race he lost to Barack Obama.

Jimmy Carter's reelection campaign in 1980 was paralyzed by the Iran hostage crisis. Fifty-two hostages were released on January 20, 1981, soon after his successor, Ronald Reagan, was inaugurated.

Lyndon Johnson announced a halting of bombings in North Vietnam days before the 1968 election, a step he hoped would bring the conflict toward a peace settlement. But the South Vietnamese indicated they would not negotiate and Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey, lost narrowly to Republican Richard Nixon.

""The efforts by incumbents to help themselves or their party's nominee with 'October surprises' go back quite a ways,"" said Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian. ""In this current climate, I'm not sure how many voters can be persuaded by a candidate this late in the game trying to show competency.""

"Tokyo shares fall, Hong Kong's advance as tensions escalate in the Middle East",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-strike-iran-3c147dc46c6ef60cd1e16dd099c4be3e,2024-10-02T04:25:08Z,"Asian shares were mixed on Wednesday, with Tokyo's benchmark falling while Hong Kong's advanced despite the sharp escalation of tensions in the Middle East.

Oil prices extended gains after Iran fired dozens of missiles into Israel, potentially raising the risk of disruptions to supplies. That news overshadowed an upbeat report showing U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in August as the American labor market continued to show resilience.

But regional trading was thin, with mainland Chinese markets closed for a weeklong national holiday.

In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 lost 1.7% to 37,993.18. It has retreated since the ruling Liberal Democratic Party chose Shigeru Ishiba to lead the government, replacing Fumio Kishida, who stepped aside on Tuesday. A weaker Japanese yen and higher energy prices would add to Ishiba's burdens as he works to pep up the economy.

The dollar was trading at 143.82 yen, up from 143.57 yen late Tuesday.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.3% to 21,615.87, riding a wave of investor enthusiasm over recent moves by Beijing to rev up the Chinese economy with policies aimed at reviving the ailing property sector and supporting financial markets.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was flat at 8,208.50 and the Kospi in Seoul lost 0.5% to 2,579.63.

On Tuesday, U.S. stocks retreated from their records, with the S&P 500 dropping 0.9% to 5,708.75. The Dow dropped 0.4% to 42,156.97, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.5% to 17,910.36.

White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan called Iran's missile attack a ""significant escalation,"" although he said it was ultimately ""defeated and ineffective.""

Israel is not a major producer of oil, but Iran is, and the potential for a wider conflict could affect other, neighboring producers of crude. The price for a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose as much as 5% before settling 2.4% higher. Brent crude, the international standard, rallied 2.6%.

Early Wednesday, U.S. crude was up $1.15 at $70.98 per barrel. Brent crude climbed $1.10 to $74.66 per barrel.

On Tuesday, oil-and-gas producers logged some of the market's biggest gains. ConocoPhillips rose 3.9%, and Exxon Mobil climbed 2.3%.

Shares of defense contractors also rallied. Northrop Grumman rose 3%, and RTX added 2.7%. RTX partners with Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems to make the ""Iron Dome"" air defense system that Israel's government uses.

Most U.S. shares fell.

The all-time high that the S&P 500 set on Monday was its 43rd of the year so far. Stocks had been jumping on hopes the U.S. economy can continue to grow despite a slowdown in the job market, as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to give it more juice. The Fed last month lowered its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years, and it's indicated it will deliver more cuts through next year.

The dominant question hanging over Wall Street is whether the cuts will ultimately prove to be too little, too late after the Fed earlier kept rates at a two-decade high in hopes of braking on the economy enough to stamp out high inflation.

A discouraging report arrived Tuesday, showing U.S. manufacturing weakened by more in September than economists expected.

Another threat to the economy could lie in a strike by dockworkers at 36 ports across the eastern United States that could snarl supply chains and drive up inflation.

The workers are asking for a labor contract that doesn't allow automation to take their jobs, among other things. Supply chain experts say consumers won't see an immediate impact because most retailers have stocked up on goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items.

An encouraging update from Europe showed inflation among the 20 countries that use the euro came in below 2% in September, the first time that's happened in more than three years. That could give the European Central Bank leeway to cut interest rates more quickly."
Palestinians in West Bank risk crossing Israel's separation barrier to flee failing economy,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jobs-palestinians-israel-barrier-economy-west-bank-2971f01fd6fd878399911cef00bfa087,2024-10-02T04:13:51Z,"YATTA, West Bank (AP) -- At dawn in mid-May, Sayyed Ayyed and dozens of other unemployed Palestinian men gathered at the foot of the towering wall of concrete and barbed wire dividing the occupied West Bank from Israel.

A smuggler was there with a ladder and ropes. Each man handed over the equivalent of $100. Ayyed waited his turn as others clambered over.

The 30-year-old father of two young daughters hadn't found work for a year. Debts were mounting. Rent had to be paid. On the Israeli side, there was the lure of work on a construction site. He just had to get over the wall.

""When we reach the point where you see that your children do not have food,"" he said, ""the barrier of fear is broken.""

A year of war in Gaza has reverberated across the West Bank, where the World Bank warns the economy is at risk of collapse because of Israeli restrictions barring Palestinian laborers from entering the country for work, and the biggest wave of violence in decades.

Unemployment has skyrocketed, reaching 30% from around 12% before the war. The past year, some 300,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, many of whom worked in Israel, have lost their jobs, the Palestinian Economy Ministry says. Over the first quarter of 2024, the territory's economy contracted by 25%, according to the World Bank.

Desperate for jobs, some Palestinians are resorting to smuggling themselves at great personal risk through the guarded barrier and into Israel.

When they find them, Israeli security forces arrest them -- or at times open fire. There are no official figures from Palestinian authorities about workers killed or injured by Israeli gunfire trying to cross the barrier. The Associated Press spoke to families of three Palestinians who said their relatives were killed trying to sneak across.

""These people are being shot at trying to go to work,"" said Assaf Adiv, director of MAAN, a worker's association that focuses on Palestinian labor rights.

Before the war, some 150,000 Palestinians from the West Bank were crossing legally every day into Israel to work, mainly in construction, manufacturing and agriculture.

After Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Israeli authorities barred entry to most Palestinians, saying it was necessary for security. Tens of thousands of Palestinians became jobless overnight.

Eyad al-Najjar, a 47-year-old laborer from a village near the West Bank town of Yatta, slipped into Israel through a barbed-wire section of the barrier in July, earning the equivalent of $650 for a week's work, his family said.

Then his son got married. The wedding set the family back $8,000. So al-Najjar tried his luck again.

He approached a hole in the barrier Aug. 26, three days after the wedding. Israeli troops spotted al-Najjar and opened fire, killing him with a shot to the head, his relatives said.

""His children will have to work to close this debt in the future,"" relative Jawadat al-Najjar said. ""No one helps in these difficult days.""

The Israeli military told the AP it couldn't comment on the shooting without specific coordinates of where relatives said it happened.

""The IDF forces work to prevent illegal infiltrations and to maintain the security of the barrier and the safety of residents,"" it said in a statement. ""The forces conduct proactive ambushes along the barrier, arresting infiltrators and infiltrator smugglers and operate both overtly and covertly to protect the barrier area.""

Labor rights experts say infiltrations happen daily, often involving dozens of Palestinians at a time.

Many Palestinians found their livelihoods gutted by the restrictions. Some sold possessions. On West Bank roadsides, children hawk tissues, bottled water and air fresheners. Some men have tried their hand at selling sandwiches at makeshift street stalls.

It isn't just the cutoff from jobs in Israel. The military also tightened its grip in the West Bank, implementing a network of new military checkpoints that have hampered the movement of commerce and workers.

Vehicles can wait for hours as soldiers inspect everyone, unlike before the war, when many were waved through. Other roads are shut off completely. In one case, the army closed a road linking 12 villages to the southern town of Dura, said local activist Badawi Jawaed. Many workers couldn't reach their jobs and were laid off, he said.

Violence has surged, with increased Israeli raids targeting armed groups. More than 700 West Bank Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, the Palestinian Health Ministry says. Many were shot dead in armed clashes, others for throwing stones at troops. But some appear to have posed no apparent threat.

In Israel, Palestinians can earn double or triple a West Bank salary. Standing in their way is Israel's barrier, running some 700 kilometers (400 miles) long and peaking at 7-meters (23-feet) tall.

Many climb over with ladders and ropes. Others hide in trucks that pass through checkpoints. Some slip through holes in fencing, workers and experts said.

Ayyed once worked for an Israeli construction company that paid 7,000 shekels ($1,850) monthly. Cut off from the job since the war began, he searched for work in his home city of Jenin, in the northern West Bank.

Ayyed said he tried grocery stores and restaurants, but no one was hiring.

To get by, he borrowed money from friends, racking up around $1,600 in debt. He cut back on water and electricity. By spring, he had no one left to borrow from and a $500 monthly rent bill to pay.

So he decided to risk it.

As he scaled the wall, the ladder slipped. Ayyed fell to the ground on the West Bank side, breaking his leg. He limped home penniless.

Palestinian smugglers or middlemen linked to gangs on both sides of the barrier arrange the crossings. They provide ladders and rope, as well as vehicles on the Israeli side to whisk workers away from the patrolled barrier.

They charge 300 to 1,000 shekels ($79 to $260), said Arafat Amro, a Palestinian labor rights expert.

Once through, work isn't hard to find, due to a labor shortage across Israel, mostly in construction and agriculture, Palestinian workers and Amro said.

To evade Israeli authorities, Palestinian workers are ""sleeping in the fields, they sleep in the farms, they sleep under the trees, at the construction sites,"" Amro said.

Raouf Adra, a laborer from Yatta, said he found two week's work on a construction site in the southern Israeli town of Dimona that would have paid 350 shekels ($65) daily. After climbing the barrier and reaching the site, he was told he was forbidden to leave after his shifts, to prevent discovery.

The next day, Israeli police stormed the site, arresting Adra and several other Palestinians. The Israeli site manager was nowhere to be seen.

""He ran away,"" Adra said.

Adra was handed a 40-day prison sentence and fined 1,500 shekels ($390). Once released, he was transported back to the West Bank and banned from entering Israel for three years.

Unable to walk after his fall in May, Ayyed said he had to sell the gold his family gave his wife as a wedding present and then his car.

""I know people who sold their furniture,"" he said.

Four months later, his broken leg is almost completely healed.

Asked if he would try again, he replied: ""If the situation remains the same, I will consider it."""
Vance and Walz focus their attacks on the top of the ticket  --  not each other: VP debate takeaways,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/debate-takeaways-vance-walz-harris-trump-5b6f219b555416ff579764048ac238a1,2024-10-02T02:25:01Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice Presidential hopefuls Tim Walz and JD Vance squared off Tuesday night in what may be the last debate of the 2024 presidential campaign. It was the first encounter between Minnesota's Democratic governor and Ohio's Republican senator, following last month's debate between the tops of their tickets, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.

No more debates are on the political calendar before Election Day. Tuesday's confrontation came as the global stakes of the contest rose again as Iran fired missiles at Israel. The vice presidential hopefuls sparred over the violence in the Middle East, climate change and immigration. Here are some takeaways from Tuesday's debate.

Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel on Tuesday elicited a contrast between the Democratic and Republican tickets on foreign policy: Walz promised ""steady leadership"" under Harris while Vance pledged a return to ""peace through strength"" if Trump is returned to the White House.

The differing visions of what American leadership should look like overshadowed the sharp policy differences between the two tickets.

The Iranian threat to the region and U.S. interests around the world opened the debate, with Walz pivoting the topic to criticism of Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, then referenced the ""nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes"" and responding to global crises by tweet.

Vance, for his part, promised a return to ""effective deterrence"" under Trump against Iran, brushing back on Walz's criticism of Trump by attacking Harris and her role in the Biden administration.

""Who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years and the answer is your running mate, not mine,"" he said. He pointedly noted that the Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, happened ""during the administration of Kamala Harris.""

Vance and Walz trained the bulk of their attacks not on their on-stage rival, but on the running mates who weren't in the room.

Both vice presidential nominees sought to convey a genial mien as they lobbed criticism at Harris and Trump, respectively.

It was a reflection of the fact that most voters don't cast a ballot based on the vice president, and on a vice presidential nominee's historic role in serving as the attack dog for their running mates.

Walz pointedly attacked Trump for failing to meet his pledge of building a physical barrier across the entire U.S.-Mexico border at the country's southern neighbor's expense.

""Less than 2% of that wall got built and Mexico didn't pay a dime,"" Walz said.

Underscoring the focus on the top of the ticket, during a back-and-forth about immigration, Vance said to his opponent: ""I think that you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does.""

In the wake of the devastation of Hurricane Helene, Vance took a question about climate change and gave an answer about jobs and manufacturing, taking a detour around Trump's past claims that global warming is a ""hoax.""

Vance contended that the best way to fight climate change was to move more manufacturing to the United States, because the country has the world's cleanest energy economy. It was a distinctly domestic spin on a global crisis, especially after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the international Paris climate accords during his administration.

Walz also kept the climate change focus domestic, touting the Biden administration's renewable energy investments as well as record levels of oil and natural gas production. ""You can see us becoming an energy superpower in the future,"" Walz said.

It was a decidedly optimistic take on a pervasive and grim global problem.

The two running mates agreed that the number of migrants in the U.S. illegally is a problem. But each laid the blame on the opposing presidential nominee.

Vance echoed Trump by repeatedly calling Harris the ""border czar"" and suggested that she, as vice president, single-handedly rolled back the immigration restrictions Trump had imposed as president. The result, in Vance's telling, is an unchecked flow of fentanyl, strain on state and local resources and increased housing prices around the country.

Harris was never asked to be the ""border czar"" and she was never specifically given the responsibility for security on the border. She was tasked by Biden in March 2021 with tackling the ""root causes"" of migration from the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and pushing leaders there and in Mexico to enforce immigration laws. Harris was not empowered to set U.S. immigration policy -- only the president can sign executive orders and Harris was not empowered as Biden's proxy in negotiations with Congress on immigration law.

Walz advanced Democrats' arguments that Trump single-handedly killed a bipartisan Senate deal to tighten border security and boost the processing system for immigrants and asylum seekers. Republicans backed off the deal, Walz noted, only after Trump said it wasn't good enough."
"Maryland governor aims to cut number of vacant properties in Baltimore by 5,000",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/baltimore-vacant-property-maryland-governor-5e0c2a7c2e96bb08523a078ae0637351,2024-10-01T23:50:42Z,"BALTIMORE (AP) -- Maryland Gov. Wes Moore signed an executive order Tuesday that aims to transform 5,000 vacant properties in Baltimore into homeownership or other positive outcomes in five years.

The order creates a program called Reinvest Baltimore. It will coordinate state, city, nonprofit and for-profit partners' efforts to eliminate concentrations of vacant properties and revitalize neighborhoods.

""Baltimore's vacant property crisis is an issue that cannot wait -- because in order to have a strong state, you must have a strong housing market, where people own more than they owe,"" Moore, a Democrat, said in a statement. ""I want to thank all the partners who raised their hand to be a part of this work that will open paths to work, wages, and wealth for Baltimoreans and grow our state's economy.""

The executive order creates a council that will tap community, corporate, philanthropic and government leaders. The initiative also aims to strengthen the partnership between city and state officials to create more attractive spaces for people to live and put down roots.

""Tackling the issue of vacants in Baltimore at scale and ending this decades long crisis is going to take partnership, coordination, and vision,"" said Mayor Brandon Scott, who launched a 15-year plan to address the city's vacant properties last year.

Baltimore has more than 13,000 vacant structures and more than 20,000 vacant lots."
Speaker Johnson lays out agenda for Republicans as they fight to hold House majority,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/house-republican-agenda-speaker-johnson-fb0d90c029b5ba595d3ef58b887794b5,2024-10-01T23:34:48Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speaker Mike Johnson laid out on Tuesday a policy agenda should Republicans take the majority next year that extends the tax cuts approved when Donald Trump was president, reduces the size of the federal workforce and gives parents more choice on where they can send their children to school.

Johnson emphasized five main policy points during a speech at the New York Stock Exchange. He talked of extending and building on the Trump tax cuts, confronting China, boosting oil and gas production, expanding school choice and cutting the size and scope of the federal government.

""The survival of the American dream depends upon our victory,"" Johnson said.

The speaker and House Republicans are fighting this election season to hold their narrow House majority, with just a handful of seats to spare. Republicans are hopeful that a Trump victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in the election will help propel them to majorities in the House and Senate, which would give them unified control of Washington for the first time since 2018 and the ability to enact a sweeping legislative agenda.

Against the campaign backdrop, Johnson provided a bleak view of the economy under President Joe Biden, though the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, inflation is on the decline and the unemployment rate is still low by historical standards. He spoke to an audience of Wall Street investors, traders and others who have witnessed stock markets reach record highs in recent days.

But Johnson said that as he has traveled the country, he's meeting business owners on the verge of collapse because of high inflation, high taxes and over-regulation. And he said he's met moms and dads who have resorted to donating plasma and setting up crowdfunding pages so that they didn't lose their homes.

""Our incredible people are hanging on right now in spite of so many unprecedented challenges, but many can't afford to do it much longer,"" Johnson said.

The first policy priority he outlined was enhanced tax breaks, citing specifically immediate expensing for research and development costs. He also cited the need for a ""strong"" child tax credit, though he did not provide specific numbers. He said the Republican tax policies would ""respect the dignity of work, and it doesn't pay people more for staying out of the workforce.""

Trump has laid out a series of tax cuts on the campaign trail, such as extending the expiring provisions of his 2017 overhaul, and not taxing tips and Social Security. Outside experts say the tax cuts proposed by Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris would cause the debt to rise even faster the pace under current law.

Doing more to confront China and rolling back environmental regulations are a common denominator for Republicans that Johnson embraced in his speech. On education, he said millions of Americans have the opportunity to send their children to a school that best fits their need, and ""Republicans want to expand that choice so that every American has that opportunity.""

Johnson also emphasized cutting the debt by cutting the size of the federal government, saying ""we're going to reduce the size of the federal workforce and root out a long list of non-essential jobs through the federal bureaucracy.""

""It's hard to roll back the entrenched bureaucracy and face the system that has produced the decline. It's a difficult task, but it's a task that can be achieved,"" Johnson said."
Nike's quarterly sales and profits slump as it faces shoppers' sluggish demand for its products,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/nike-sales-profit-first-quarter-67e864a20131f48afbcb8fa1dab52986,2024-10-01T21:30:52Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Nike sales and profits slumped in its fiscal first quarter as the sportswear giant wrestles with shoppers' sluggish demand for new sneaker models and other products.

The lackluster results Tuesday came after Nike announced last month that its CEO, John Donahoe, is stepping down on Oct. 13. Company veteran Elliott Hill is coming out of retirement to head up the company.

Nike has been known for its innovation but in recent years, analysts have said that it has lost its focus on coming up with cool products.

Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail, said that some of the sales decline was due to a weaker consumer economy that has shoppers buying fewer sneakers and not splurging on clothing as they once did.

""Nike has done itself no favors with a lack of focus and oomph in a market where far more effort and exertion is needed to hold onto sales,"" he said. ""There is a general sense that Nike has lost its edge and that the power of its innovation and the quality of its storytelling have both been faded.""

Saunders noted that at the same time, smaller rival brands have moved into Nike's territory and successfully connected with consumers in a way that Nike has failed to do.

Nike posted net income of $1.05 billion, or 70 cents per share, in the quarter that ended Aug. 31. That compares with $1.45 billion, or 94 cents per share, in the year-ago period.

Sales fell 10% to $11.59 billion.

Analysts were expecting earnings of 52 cents a share on sales of $11.64 billion, according to FactSet.

Shares of Nike Inc., which is based in Beaverton, Oregon, were down about 7% in after-hours trading following the earnings report. They are down 18% so far this year."
A battered child care industry's latest challenge? Competing for 4-year-olds.,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/texas-child-care-children-general-news-d4d085ae9430b33072128b215eda95ef,2024-10-01T19:37:33Z,"Gingerbread Kids Academy owner Tim Kaminski can easily tick off examples of how tough it is to keep a child care business open more than four years after the pandemic hit.

Before COVID-19 came to the United States in 2020, Kaminski had 45 employees and averaged up to 130 children enrolled in each of his two child care centers and after school programs in Fort Bend County. Today, he can only sustain about half that: 70 kids and 22 staff members.

This year, the last of emergency COVID-19-related aid to child care providers that kept them up and running ends and many like Kaminski are returning to a very changed economy.

But even before the pandemic, Kaminski and other providers were bracing for another big blow to make its way to the state's 16,000 child care providers, one delivered by the Texas Legislature in 2019 that for all its good intents -- making public schools offer full day pre-kindergarten -- is now capturing child care's most profitable customer base: 3-and 4-year-olds.

""We pay school property taxes and we have them (schools) taking business away from us,"" he said.

Compounding the challenges is the Texas Legislature has hesitated approving meaningful infusions of state dollars into child care. While lawmakers approved a way to allow certain child care centers a property tax exemption, the method is not widely used statewide.

Meanwhile, more than 91,000 Texas children are on a state waitlist for subsidies to pay for child care, which can cost as much as a monthly home mortgage.

""The pandemic did not cause our child care crisis, it revealed our child care problem,"" said Kim Kofron, senior director of education for Houston-based Children at Risk.

Texas schools started offering half day of state-supported pre-K in 1984 to help ready low-income children for school. In 2019, Texas made it mandatory for public schools to offer a full day of pre-kindergarten, but the last-minute move caught child care advocates by surprise, Kaminski recalls, and providers like him immediately saw the threat to their own industry.

Less than a year after full-day pre-K passed, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, closing child care centers and homes, along with schools. So the competition between the two was slow to emerge.

By 2021, child care operators struggled to reopen, some closed entirely and those that remained were able to do so with emergency federal funding -- $126,869 on average for centers and $17,678 for homes -- which helped providers pay their own business mortgages or rent and staff salaries.

Overall, about one-third of Texas child care centers and homes closed at some point during the pandemic, according to an 11-state study by the Bipartisan Policy Center.

Last month, Kaminski and others detailed for the House Committee on International Relations and Economic Development how an already battered industry is now taking a state-inflicted second beating with pre-K.

""It was going to have a devastating impact on our businesses,"" Kaminski, who also serves as president-elect of the Texas Licensed Child Care Association, said during the hearing.

Cheslee Escobedo, a senior vice president with KinderCare Learning companies, the nation's largest provider of child care, told committee members how this one age group acts as an industry stabilizer. Older children help offset the higher staffing costs of caring for infants and young toddlers, the savings of which are passed on to families, she explained.

""So in a real world example, when 3-and 4-year-olds leave our care and enroll in a public school-run pre-K program, the impact to the overall child care center can be disastrous,"" she said.

When child care centers like Kaminski's charge $240 to $270 a week and his local school district in Fort Bend can charge $645 a month, it's not hard to see how a major restructuring of child care funding is needed.

""Our school districts in our area are actively advertising to get kids to come in under their private pay tuition. That puts them in direct competition with us,"" Kaminski told the committee chaired by state Rep. Angie Chen Button, R-Richardson.

While child care providers can partner with schools to offer pre-K classes, the lack of guidance and coordination from the state has made this doubly confusing for child care providers, who answer to as many as five state agencies when it comes to remaining licensed and in business.

""We were all left to our own devices,"" Kaminski said.

Kofron concedes that the expansion of pre-K has hurt the child care industry but there doesn't have to be winners and losers here.

""There's enough children for all of us,"" Kofron said, adding there are 2.3 million Texas children under the age of 6 and not enough slots in pre-K or child care to accommodate them all right now.

The Legislature has to prioritize funding for child care and pre-K, she said.

""We have done some very good incremental steps to improve our child care system,"" Kofron said. ""But what we haven't used is the riches that Texas does have.""

More clarity could be on the horizon when the Texas Legislature returns in January.

Earlier this year, both the Texas House and Senate made child care a priority this interim session, placing these charges in their respective economic development committees. This one move by both chambers has been a hopeful signal for child care providers and advocates.

""It's more than a family issue, it's more than an education issue,"" said Button, the House committee's chair, at last month's hearing. ""It is also a workforce development issue and it is also an economic development issue.""

Case in point? The number of low income children whose parents are waiting on state child care assistance is growing. As of August, there were 91,309 children waiting for subsidized child care, according to the Texas Workforce Commission.

Every child who is waiting, Escobedo says, has a parent who cannot return or enter the workforce because they cannot locate an affordable day care provider in today's diminished industry.

Texas loses $9.3 billion annually because of child care breakdowns, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation.

""We know that the number of parents and caregivers able to consistently work, build self-sufficiency, pay taxes and stimulate the economy would increase exponentially,"" Escobedo testified.

By 2022, Texas parents paid on average $8,718 a year for center-based toddler care, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation.

To help pay for that cost, parents can receive up to a $3,600 child care credit on their taxes.

For more immediate relief, Texas low-income families can turn to the Texas Workforce Commission subsidy program. The Child Care Services program is a $1.3 billion program where 96% of the funding comes from the federal government. But only child care providers who meet higher quality standards mandated by the workforce commission through its Texas Rising Star program can take those children.

Fewer than half - about 7,600 - of the state's child care providers participate in Texas Rising Star.

The subsidy program paid part or all of the child care bill for 1.2 million Texas children.

While the waitlist fell dramatically during the pandemic when schools and child care centers were closed, it is now creeping back up. By the agency's calculation, it would cost more than $861 million dollars to get that list down to zero.

That's prompting Texas advocates and providers to push for a bigger state investment into child care, similar to what other Republican-led states have been doing in the past two years to help prepare for the end of federal COVID-19 aid.

Since 2023, Florida has used its own tax dollars, at least $100 million, to increase its version of the child care subsidy program. Alabama has added another $30 million to its child care rating and improvement program, replacing federal dollars that were previously used. Montana added another $7 million to expand its program and cover child care costs for another 700 children a year.

""I think we have to do it in Texas,"" said David Feigen, director of early learning policy for Texans Care For Children, a nonprofit policy and advocacy group. ""Getting people to rally behind investments, that will strengthen our programs.""

Last year, the Texas Legislature put to voters a measure that allows cities and counties to offer a property tax exemption for land used by child care providers. Texas voters approved Proposition 2 but cities and counties have been slow to enact it.

A stumbling block to qualify for the property tax exemption: child care providers must be in the state's Rising Star program -- and -- 20% of their children must be receiving state child care subsidies.

""Voters thought they were giving all providers property tax relief,"" Kaminski said. ""It's a very small percentage.""

Kofron, who worked with lawmakers on the measure, admits its shortcomings but sees it as a framework to build on. ""It was a way to get our foot in the door,"" she said. ""Was it perfect? No. But 65% of Texans voted for this.""

By late June, 14 counties and 11 cities approved the property tax exemption for low-income child care providers. Most of those are located in the state's most populous areas: Austin, Dallas, Houston, Fort Worth, San Antonio and El Paso.

As counties and cities have been discussing whether to offer the property tax exemption for subsidized child care providers, it's sparked more of a conversation among local leaders, who are asking what more they can do.

In Travis County, where only about 50 of the 300 child care providers would qualify for the new property exemption, leaders have approved a ballot initiative to infuse more money into child care. Voters in November will decide on a 2.5 cent property tax hike to raise $75 million to create more slots with existing providers for infants and toddlers, as well as children in after school care and employees who work non-traditional work hours.

The money would also fund incentives for employers to help with child care costs and address the long waitlist for state subsidies.

""We have 5,000 children on the waiting list locally,"" said Cathy McHorse with United Way for Greater Austin. ""That's a 43% increase in the number of Travis County children on that waiting list since January. Right now, the expected wait time is two years.""

Local efforts like these are welcome but a larger investment from the state, as well as better coordination between schools and child care providers, are what advocates and providers want to see happen soon.

""It's a culture change that needs to happen,"" Feigen said. ""We're not lacking in demand.""

The Latest: VP candidates Vance and Walz meet in last scheduled debate for 2024 tickets,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-harris-trump-walz-vance-debate-9d7e3087d38a0e4b308613c0e2a91a94,2024-10-01T15:18:15Z,"Barring a late addition to the schedule, Tuesday night's vice presidential debate between J.D. Vance and Tim Walz could be the last debate of the 2024 campaign between the Republican and Democratic tickets.

Both Vance, a GOP senator from Ohio, and Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, have embraced the traditional role of attack dog for the person at the top of the ticket. That could be on full display during the vice presidential debate in New York hosted by CBS News.

Although conventional wisdom says the matchup between the candidates with second billing on the ticket seldom have much impact, polls are so tight that it could sway voters on the margins. It also could be the last head-to-head matchup between the tickets because Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, haven't agreed to a second meeting.

A new AP-NORC poll found that Walz is better liked than Vance, potentially giving the Republican an added challenge.

Although Vance has said he didn't ""have to prepare that much"" for the debate because he had ""well-developed views on public policy,"" he had been doing debate prep sessions with his wife, Usha Vance, senior aides, and Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who has played Walz, according to a person familiar with his preparations who requested anonymity to discuss strategy.

Walz's debate prep included sessions hunkered down in a Minneapolis hotel, with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg standing in for Vance, according to a person familiar with the process who requested anonymity to discuss the campaign's internal dynamics.

Trump was scheduled to speak about the economy Tuesday in the critical swing state of Wisconsin.

The former president was visiting a manufacturing facility in Waunakee, a suburb of Wisconsin's capital city of Madison in the Democratic stronghold of Dane County. Later he planned to hold an event at a museum in the state's largest city of Milwaukee, with hopes of reaching that city's conservative suburbs, where his support has softened.

Dane County, the location of Trump's first stop, is Wisconsin's fastest-growing county and an economic engine for the state, fueled by jobs in the health care and tech industries. It is also home to the University of Wisconsin.

""President Trump's appearance will be a big shot in the arm for demoralized conservatives here,"" the Dane County Republican Party Chairman Brandon Maly posted on X, the social media platform, when the visit was announced. He has said Trump must get at least 23% of the vote in Dane County to have a chance of winning statewide.

Democratic presidential candidates have long come to Dane County to hold massive rallies to fire up the base. Harris campaigned there on Sept. 20, holding a rally in Madison that attracted more than 10,000 people.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Harris cut short a campaign visit to Las Vegas to return to Washington for briefings while Trump headed to Georgia to see the storm's impact.

Hurricane Helene's death toll is more than 130 people and rising, with some of the worst damage caused by inland flooding in North Carolina.

In addition to being humanitarian crises, natural disasters can create political tests for elected officials, particularly in the closing weeks of a presidential campaign.

Presidents typically avoid racing toward disaster zones so they don't interfere with recovery efforts. The White House said Harris would visit impacted areas ""as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations.""

President Joe Biden planned to survey the devastation on Wednesday.

A GoFundMe campaign launched by former president Donald Trump to help the victims of Hurricane Helene has raised more than $1 million.

The website calls the effort ""an official response for MAGA supporters to offer their financial assistance to their fellow Americans impacted by Hurricane Helene"" and promises that all donations will be directed to those who have been impacted by the devastation.

Trump earlier Monday paid a visit to Valdosta, Georgia, and said he had brought with him supplies, including fuel, that will be distributed by the Christian relief group Samaritan's Purse.

Former President Trump criticized the Biden administration's response to the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Helene, even as his supporters have called for cuts to federal agencies that warn of weather disasters and deliver relief to hard-hit communities.

As president, Trump delayed disaster aid for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico and diverted money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to finance an effort to return undocumented migrants to Mexico. And Project 2025, backed by Trump supporters, would restructure FEMA to limit aid to states and says that the National Weather Service, which provides crucial data on hurricanes and other storms, ""should be broken up and downsized.""

Read more here.

President Biden criticized Trump for ""lying"" about federal contacts with Georgia officials during the response to Hurricane Helene. Trump falsely claimed during a Monday tour of the damage that Biden hadn't been in touch with the state's Republican governor. ""He's lying, and the governor told him he was lying.""

""I don't know why he does this,"" Biden continued. ""I don't care about what he says about me, but I care what he what he communicates to people that are in need. He implies that we're not doing everything possible. We are. We are.""

State election officials in North Carolina are gathering information about options available to voters in the counties hardest hit by Hurricane Helene and plan a press conference for Tuesday.

Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said during an emergency board meeting on Monday that she will be providing more information, including details on how voters could declare ""natural disaster"" as their reason for not being able to provide a photo ID.

The board met Monday to approve a resolution granting counties flexibility for holding weekly meetings required under state law to review absentee ballots. These meetings are required to begin every Tuesday between now and Election Day, officials said. The resolution passed unanimously."
"Offering a dose of healing, curious beluga whales frolic in a warming Hudson Bay",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/beluga-whales-climate-change-hudson-bay-social-e8148924d3f3455afd9bfc465dd58543,2024-10-01T14:23:41Z,"ON HUDSON BAY (AP) -- Playful large white beluga whales bring joy and healing to Hudson Bay. Their happy chirps leap out in an environment and economy threatened by the warming water melting sea ice, starving polar bears and changing the entire food chain.

Loud and curious belugas swarm boats here, clicking, nudging and frolicking. At any given summer moment on the Churchill River that flows into the Hudson Bay, as many as 4,000 belugas can be up and down the waterway, surrounding vessels of all sizes. That makes it hard to find a place where you don't see them, said whale biologist Valeria Vergara, senior scientist at the Raincoast Conservation Foundation. It's in their nature.

""The social butterflies of the whale world... You can see it in Churchill,"" Vergara said.

The town of Churchill is counting on that to continue. The mostly Indigenous community, pulled out of economic doldrums by polar bear tourism, faces the prospect of a dwindling number of bears because of climate change. So it is counting on another white beast, the beluga, to come to the rescue and entice summer tourists -- if the sea mammals can also survive the changes to this gateway to the Arctic.

There's something healing about belugas. Just ask Erin Greene.

Greene was attacked by a polar bear in 2013. She doesn't like to go into details about the attack, but Mayor Mike Spence said she was thrashed by a bear which had her in its jaws. A neighbor hit the bear with a shovel, and a third person used a truck to scare off the bear, which was later found and killed. Years later, Greene said contact with the sociable whales helped pull her out of post-traumatic stress disorder. Now she goes out in the water with them, on a paddleboard, and sings to and with the whales. She also rents paddleboards to tourists, so they can do the same.

Greene, who isn't native to Churchill but came to work in the tourism industry, tried yoga, which eventually led to paddleboarding in Hawaii. It made her feel a little better, so she thought she'd bring it back to Churchill where there isn't just water, but belugas. And that helped her heal, ""moving through the various stages of dealing with trauma,"" she said.

But it's not just her, she said. When she brings her customers into the water, inches from the whales, they also feel better.

""I've never seen an animal except for maybe puppies bring that amount and capacity of joy to people,"" Greene said. ""Everybody's smiling when they get off the water... Everybody's just experiencing joy. And it's the whales that provide that.""

""With the beluga whales, I think it's quite a different connection than with any other animal because the whales are truly choosing to socialize with you. They want to play,"" Greene said. ""That's really what sets them apart from other animals. They're so gentle. They have no desire to hurt the human.""

It doesn't hurt that the whales have gotten to know Greene. Vergara has no doubt that they know her.

Greene sings to the whales, including ""Yellow Submarine"" by the Beatles. She also sings the Will Ferrell Eurovision movie song ""Husavik (My Hometown)"" with the lyric, ""where the whales can live 'cause they're gentle people.""

That lyric is close to reality, whale expert Vergara said.

""They really have traits that are so similar to human culture, so we can really empathize with them,"" Vergara said. ""They form communities and networks. They cooperate and help raise each other's young. They're unbelievably vocal. They're probably one of the most acoustically active or vocal mammals, along with humans, on Earth.""

Unlike humpback whales, the vocalizations from belugas aren't songs with rhythm and a pattern, she said. When she puts her hydrophones in the water to record the whales' calls ""you really don't think, 'Oh, I'm hearing singing.' You think 'I'm in a jungle full of birds'.""

It's a cacophony of clicks and whistles. But it's not random, it's like being dropped into a noisy festival, Vergara said.

""You can't help but wonder what is it that they are communicating with each other,"" she said. ""They absolutely rely on sound to maintain these very complex societies.""

Research has shown that individual belugas have a distinct call that they use in communication, much like a name, Vergara said. And it takes a couple years for young whales to learn their parents' name and their own. But whales that are related or hang out together have calls or names that are similar, sort of like a last name, she said.

Belugas get the nickname ""canary of the sea"" because of their vocalization, but it also could apply like the canary in the coal mine, warning about an environment getting more dangerous, Vergara said.

Sea ice is shrinking all over the Arctic, including here in Hudson Bay. And even though this is probably the biggest beluga population in the world, scientists are a bit concerned.

""The disappearing ice is going to affect them,"" Vergara said. ""We don't know how they're going to react to shifts in water temperature, shifts in food availability, shifts in the availability of regular prey.""

The change in ice is part of an overall altering of the base of the food chain: plankton. When those tiny creatures change it means ""a whole shift in the prey base of belugas,"" Vergara said.

Arctic cod, a high-fat fish that is key in beluga diets, is diminishing, said beluga expert Pierre Richard of the Northern Studies Center in Churchill and author of three whale books. But he said it's an open question on whether belugas can adapt.

In the Beaufort Sea, research shows that belugas aren't as fat as they used to be, but scientists don't know about those in Hudson Bay, Richard said. Another issue is that killer whales that hunt belugas are coming more often into the Hudson Bay and less sea ice means fewer places for belugas to hide, he and University of Washington marine mammal scientist Kristin Laidre said.

""Whether belugas in the Hudson Bay are suffering from these ecosystem changes is not clear at all,"" Richard said.

Beluga whales, unlike polar bears, as a species aren't on an endangered or vulnerable species list, although an Alaskan population of them is. There are as many as 200,000 belugas worldwide and the International Union for Conservation of Nature that creates a global endangered list calls them a species of ""least concern,"" so Vergara said she often gets asked why not concentrate on animals in more imminent danger.

""I would say that the threat to animal cultures can happen much quicker than the extinction of an entire species,"" Vergara said. And if subpopulations of belugas are wiped out, their cultures disappear too.

""It's like losing a human language or a human culture,"" Vergara said. ""We should care.""

US job openings rise to 8 million as labor market remains sturdy,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/job-openings-economy-unemployment-inflation-federal-reserve-4f4122a0601c7622a53de1625d63f51f,2024-10-01T14:16:35Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in August as the American labor market continued to show resilience.

The Labor Department reported Tuesday that employers posted 8 million vacancies in August, up from 7.7 million in July. Economists had expected openings to be virtually unchanged.

Layoffs fell in August. But the number of Americans quitting their jobs -- a sign of confidence in the labor market -- slid in August.

Job openings have come down steadily since peaking at 12.2 million in March 2022, but they remain above where they stood before the coronavirus pandemic hit the American economy in early 2020. When the economy roared back with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns, companies scrambled to find enough workers to keep up with customer orders.

The overheating economy caused an outburst of inflation, and the Federal Reserve responded by raising its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has come down -- from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.5% in August.

The economy proved surprisingly resilient in the face of the Fed hikes, averting a widely forecast recession. But the job market has gradually lost momentum. Hiring averaged just 116,000 net new jobs a month from June through August -- the weakest three-month average since mid-2020.

When the Labor Department releases its jobs report for September on Friday, it is expected to show that employers added 143,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate remained at a low 4.2%, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.

The Fed, satisfied with the progress against inflation and worried about the cooling job market, last month cut its benchmark rate by a hefty half percentage point, the central bank's first and biggest rate cut since March 2020."
Port strikes extend a new era of American labor activism,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/port-strike-dockworkers-boeing-0d5333299539255be379ab58d836dbd3,2024-10-01T12:09:59Z,"The U.S. dockworkers who went on strike early Tuesday are just the latest unionized group to back their demands for better contracts by walking off the job to illustrate their value to both the national economy, and their employers' bottom line.

Unions representing auto workers, actors, hotel housekeepers and aircraft assembly workers all called strikes as organized labor made itself heard over the past year. Members argued they made the sacrifices their companies asked of them during the pandemic and rough economic patches, and now it's time to catch up, particularly after several years of heightened inflation.

Between 2022 and 2023, the number of work stoppages rose 9% to 466 strikes and four lockouts, according to figures maintained by Cornell University's IRL School. However, the number of workers involved in work stoppages, approximately 539,000, was more than double than the previous year, according to the school's research.

A database maintained by Cornell and the School of Labor and Employment Relations at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign recorded 250 strikes and other labor actions in 2024 as of Monday.

Here's a look at some recent showdowns between companies and organized labor

Dockworkers at 36 ports from Maine to Texas hit picket lines early Tuesday, the first strike for them in decades, over wages and automation even though progress had been reported in contract talks. The contract between the ports and about 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association expired at midnight.

The alliance said it had increased its offer to 50% raises over six years and it pledged to keep limits on automation in place from the old contract. The alliance also said its offer tripled employer contributions to retirement plans and strengthened health care options. In a statement early Tuesday, the union said it rejected the alliance's latest proposal because it ""fell far short of what ILA rank-and-file members are demanding in wages and protections against automation."" The two sides had not held formal negotiations since June.

Workers at the Port of Philadelphia walked in a circle outside the port and chanted ""No work without a fair contract."" The union, striking for the first time since 1977, had message boards on the side of a truck reading: ""Automation Hurts Families: ILA Stands For Job Protection.""

If drawn out, the strike will force businesses to pay shippers for delays and cause some goods to arrive late for peak holiday shopping season -- potentially impacting delivery of anything from toys and artificial Christmas trees to cars, coffee and fruit.

Aircraft assembly workers walked off the job at Boeing factories near Seattle and elsewhere on Sept. 12 after union members voted overwhelmingly to reject a proposed contract and go on strike. Boeing and negotiators from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers have held three bargaining sessions alongside federal mediators. The company presented a revised contract last week, but the union refused to present it for a vote after surveying its members, who said it failed to meet their wage and pension demands.

Earlier this month video game performers reached agreements with 80 individual games that have signed interim or tiered budget agreements with the performers' union and accepted the artificial intelligence provisions they have been seeking.

The performers had been striking for over a month.

Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists began striking in July after negotiations with game industry giants that began more than a year and a half ago came to a halt over AI protections.

The interim agreement secures wage improvements, protections around ""exploitative uses"" of artificial intelligence and safety precautions that account for the strain of physical performances, as well as vocal stress. The tiered budget agreement aims to make working with union talent more feasible for independent game developers or smaller-budget projects while also providing performers the protections under the interim agreement.

Last month, thousands of hospitality union workers on the Las Vegas Strip reached a tentative deal with the Venetian and Palazzo resorts, a first for employees at the sprawling Italian-inspired complex that opened 25 years ago.

The Culinary Workers Union announced on the social platform X that the deal came together after a year of negotiations. It covers over 4,000 hotel and casino workers, from housekeepers and cocktail servers to bartenders and porters.

Bethany Khan, a union spokesperson, said the deal mirrors the major wins secured in recent contracts awarded to 40,000 hospitality workers at 18 Strip properties owned or operated by casino giants MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts.

Those wins included a 32% pay increase over five years, housekeeping workload reductions and improved job security amid advancements in technology and artificial intelligence.

The bump in pay under those contracts will amount to an average $35 hourly wage by the end of the contracts, according to the union. Workers at these properties were making about $26 hourly with benefits before winning their latest contracts in November.

More than 10,000 workers at 25 hotels across the U.S. staged a Labor Day weekend strike to amplify their demands for higher pay, fairer workloads and the reversal of COVID-era cuts. The majority of the striking housekeepers and other hospitality workers represented by the UNITE HERE union stayed off the job for a few days. On Sept. 24, about 2,000 unionized workers at Hawaii's largest resort, the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort, joined another couple thousand hotel workers who remained on strike at Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott hotels in Honolulu, San Diego and San Francisco, according to the union.

Unions representing 85,000 health care workers reached a tentative agreement with industry giant Kaiser Permanente in October 2023 following a strike over wages and staffing levels.

The deal included setting minimum hourly wages at $25 in California, where most of Kaiser's facilities are located, and $23 in other states. Workers would also see a 21% wage increase over four years.

The lead up to the agreement included a three-day strike involving 75,000 workers in multiple states.

The agreement also included protective terms around subcontracting and outsourcing, as well as initiatives to invest in the current workforce and address a staffing crisis.

Late last year, the United Auto Workers union overwhelmingly ratified new contracts with Ford and Stellantis, along with a similar deal with General Motors, that would raise pay across the industry and force automakers to absorb higher costs.

The agreements, which run through April 2028, ended contentious talks that began in the summer of 2022 and led to six-week-long strikes at all three automakers.

The new contract agreements were widely seen as a victory for the UAW, though Ford's top executive said the company will rethink where it will build cars in the future. The companies agreed to dramatically raise pay for top-scale assembly plant workers, with increases and cost-of-living adjustments that would translate into 33% wage gains.

Top assembly plant workers were to receive immediate 11% raises and would earn roughly $42 an hour when the contracts expire in April of 2028.

Under the agreements, the automakers also ended many of the multiple tiers of wages they had used to pay different workers. They also agreed in principle to bring new electric-vehicle battery plants into the national union contract.

UPS workers that are members of the Teamsters union approved a tentative contract with the package delivery company last year before hitting the picket lines as they had vowed to do. The run up to the approval was not smooth though, with contentious labor negotiations that threatened to disrupt package deliveries for millions of businesses and households nationwide.

After negotiations broke down in early July 2023, Atlanta company reached a tentative contract agreement with the Teamsters just days before an Aug. 1 deadline.

At the time the agreement was struck, full- and part-time union workers were set to get $2.75 more per hour in 2023, and $7.50 more in total by the end of the five-year contract. Starting hourly pay for part-time employees also got bumped up to $21, but some workers said that fell short of their expectations.

UPS said at the time that by the end of the new contract, the average UPS full-time driver would make about $170,000 annually in pay and benefits. It was not clear how much of that figure benefits accounted for.

As part of the deal, the delivery company also agreed to make Martin Luther King Jr. Day a full holiday, end forced overtime on drivers' days off and stop using driver-facing cameras in cabs, among a host of other issues. It eliminated a two-tier wage system for drivers and tentative deals on safety issues were also reached, including equipping more trucks with air conditioning.

Hollywood's actors voted to ratify a deal with studios in December 2023 that ended their strike after nearly four months, bringing an official finish to a labor strife that shook the entertainment industry for most of last year.

Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists approved a three-year contract.

Control over the use of artificial intelligence was the most hard-fought issue in the long, methodical negotiations. The contract called for a 7% general pay increase with further hikes coming in the second and third years of the deal.

The agreement also included a hard-won provision that temporarily derailed talks: the creation of a fund to pay performers for future viewings of their work on streaming services, in addition to traditional residuals paid for the showing of movies or series."
Dockworkers go on a strike that could reignite inflation and cause shortages in the holiday season,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/dockworkers-strike-ports-ila-longshoremen-91703e4798dbc9ee82185e983f31a3f6,2024-10-01T10:47:03Z,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A strike by dockworkers at 36 ports from Maine to Texas, the first in decades, could snarl supply chains and lead to shortages and higher prices if it stretches on for more than a few weeks.

Workers began walking picket lines early Tuesday in a strike over wages and automation even though progress had been reported in contract talks. The contract between the ports and about 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association expired at midnight.

The strike comes just weeks before the presidential election and could become a factor if there are shortages.

Workers at the Port of Philadelphia walked in a circle outside the port and chanted ""No work without a fair contract."" The union, striking for the first time since 1977, had message boards on the side of a truck reading: ""Automation Hurts Families: ILA Stands For Job Protection.""

Local ILA president Boise Butler said workers want a fair contract that doesn't allow automation of their jobs.

Shipping companies made billions during the pandemic by charging high prices, he said. ""Now we want them to pay back. They're going to pay back,"" Butler said.

He said the union will strike for as long as it needs to get a fair deal, and it has leverage over the companies.

""This is not something that you start and you stop,"" he said. ""We're not weak,"" he added, pointing to the union's importance to the nation's economy.

At Port Houston, at least 50 workers started picketing around midnight local time carrying signs saying ""No Work Without a Fair Contract.""

The U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports, said Monday evening that both sides had moved off of their previous wage offers. But no deal was reached.

The union's opening offer in the talks was for a 77% pay raise over the six-year life of the contract, with President Harold Daggett saying it's necessary to make up for inflation and years of small raises. ILA members make a base salary of about $81,000 per year, but some can pull in over $200,000 annually with large amounts of overtime.

Monday evening, the alliance said it had increased its offer to 50% raises over six years, and it pledged to keep limits on automation in place from the old contract. The alliance also said its offer tripled employer contributions to retirement plans and strengthened health care options.

The union wants a complete ban on automation. It wasn't clear just how far apart both sides are.

In a statement early Tuesday, the union said it rejected the alliance's latest proposal because it ""fell far short of what ILA rank-and-file members are demanding in wages and protections against automation."" The two sides had not held formal negotiations since June.

Supply chain experts say consumers won't see an immediate impact from the strike because most retailers stocked up on goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items.

But if it goes more than a few weeks, a work stoppage could lead to higher prices and delays in goods reaching households and businesses.

If drawn out, the strike will force businesses to pay shippers for delays and cause some goods to arrive late for peak holiday shopping season -- potentially impacting delivery of anything from toys and artificial Christmas trees to cars, coffee and fruit.

The strike will likely have an almost immediate impact on supplies of perishable imports like bananas, for example. The ports affected by the strike handle 3.8 million metric tons of bananas each year, or 75% of the nation's supply, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.

It also could snarl exports from East Coast ports and create traffic jams at ports on the West Coast, where workers are represented by a different union. Railroads say they can ramp up to carry more freight from the West Coast, but analysts say they can't move enough to make up for the closed Eastern ports.

J.P. Morgan estimated that a strike that shuts down East and Gulf coast ports could cost the economy $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion per day, with some of that recovered over time after normal operations resume.

Retailers, auto parts suppliers and produce importers had hoped for a settlement or that President Joe Biden would intervene and end the strike using the Taft-Hartley Act, which allows him to seek an 80-day cooling off period.

But during an exchange with reporters on Sunday, Biden, who has worked to court union votes for Democrats, said ""no"" when asked if he planned to intervene in the potential work stoppage.

A White House official said Monday that at Biden's direction, the administration has been in regular communication with the ILA and the alliance to keep the negotiations moving forward.

"Mysteries of universe revealed? Hardly. But CERN still fascinates, discovers on its 70th anniversary",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/cern-particle-accelerator-physics-geneva-anniversary-4554c83f661a53a8efa43bff3b62c253,2024-10-01T09:31:02Z,"GENEVA (AP) -- The research center that is home to the world's largest particle accelerator is celebrating its 70th anniversary on Tuesday, with the physicists who run it aiming to unlock secrets about dark matter and other mysteries to promote science for peace in today's conflict-darkened world.

Over the last seven decades, CERN, the sprawling research center on the Swiss-French border at Geneva, has become a household name in Europe, the West and beyond, but its complex inner workings remain a puzzle to many people.

Here's a look at CERN and how its discoveries have changed the world and our view of the universe -- and could change them more in coming years.

The European Organization for Nuclear Research, which has retained the French-language acronym CERN for its predecessor outfit, had its origins in a 1951 meeting of the U.N.'s scientific organization that sought to build a state-of-the-art physics research facility in Europe and ease a brain drain toward America after World War II. Groundbreaking was on May 17, 1954.

Today, for cognoscenti, CERN is probably best known as home to the Large Hadron Collider, trumpeted as the world's biggest machine, which powers a network of magnets to accelerate particles through a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground loop in and around Geneva and slam them together at velocities approaching the speed of light.

By capturing and interpreting the results of the collisions -- as many as a billion per second -- of such beams of particles, thousands of scientists both on hand at the center and remotely around the world pore over the reams of resulting data and strive to explain how fundamental physics works.

CERN says collisions inside the LHC generate temperatures more than 100,000 times hotter than the core of the sun, on a small scale and in its controlled environment.

At the LHC, ""we are able to reproduce every day the conditions of the primordial Universe as they were a millionth of a millionth of a second after the Big Bang. Yet, many crucial open questions remain,"" CERN Director-General Fabiola Gianotti said in a prepared speech she was to make before many leaders of its 24 member countries.

Over the years, CERN and its experimental facilities have grown into a vast research hub with applications in many scientific fields and industries.

""In a world where conflicts between countries, cultures and religions sadly persist, this is a truly precious gift that cannot be taken for granted,"" Gianotti added in an advance copy of the speech provided to the AP.

Experiments in the collider helped confirm in 2012 the subatomic Higgs boson, an infinitesimal particle whose existence had been theorized decades earlier and whose confirmation completed the Standard Model of particle physics.

CERN is also where the World Wide Web was born, in the mind of British scientist Tim Berners-Lee 35 years ago, as a way to help universities and institutes share information. In 1993, the software behind the web was put into the public domain -- and the rest is history, in smartphones and on computers worldwide.

The spillover science and tools generated at CERN have rippled through the world economy. Thousands of smaller particle accelerators operate around the world today, plumbing applications in fields as diverse as medicine and computer chip manufacturing.

Crystals developed for CERN experiments roughly four decades ago are now widely used in PET scanners that can detect early signs of health troubles like cancer and heart disease.

Some skeptics have over the years stirred fears about CERN. Insiders variously argue and explain that such fears are overblown or inaccurate, and CERN has issued its own retort to some of the theories out there.

For the most part, CERN technicians, researchers and theoreticians of more than 110 nationalities today carry out new experiments that aim to punch holes in the Standard Model -- smashing up conventional understandings to move science forward -- and explain a long list of lingering scientific unknowns.

Its scientific whizzes hope to solve riddles about dark energy -- which makes up about 68% of the universe and has a role in speeding up its expansion -- and test hypotheses about dark matter, whose existence is only inferred and which appears to outweigh visible matter nearly six-to-one, making up slightly more than a quarter of the universe.

CERN has two big projects on its horizon. The first is the High-Luminosity LHC project that aims to ramp up the number of collisions -- and thus the potential for new discoveries -- starting in 2029.

The second, over the much longer term, is the Future Circular Collider, which is estimated to cost 15 billion Swiss francs (about 16 billion euros or $17.2 billion) and is hoped to start operating in an initial phase by 2040.

Despite its aim to foster scientific progress in the cause of peace and humanity, CERN has found itself ensnared in politics.

Its constitution says the organization ""shall have no concern with work for military requirements."" In 2022, CERN's governing council voted to pause ties with institutes in Russia because of President Vladimir Putin's order for Russian troops to invade Ukraine earlier that year. Some fear that applications from CERN's research could make their way into Moscow's war machine.

On Nov. 30, CERN will formally exclude Russia -- affecting some 500 scientists, about 100 of whom have joined non-Russian institutes in order to maintain their research with the center.

The suspension will come at a cost, depriving CERN of some 40 million Swiss francs in Russian financing for the High-Luminosity LHC. It amounts to about 4.5% of the budget for its experiment, which will now have to be shouldered by other CERN participants."
Inflation in Europe falls below 2% and opens the way for faster rate cuts,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/europe-inflation-ecb-economy-847e2d9d7ed449fb347cac18682dcc1a,2024-10-01T09:20:10Z,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro fell to 1.8% in September, below the European Central Bank's target of 2% for the first time in more than three years as falling energy prices give consumers relief from a burst of inflation that at one point reached into double digits.

Tuesday's official figure coupled with an anemic growth outlook could pave the way for faster interest rate cuts from the ECB, which has already trimmed rates twice.

Inflation fell from 2.2% in August, according to European Union statistics agency Eurostat. The last time inflation hit the ECB's 2% goal was in June, 2021 when it was 1.9%.

Economists have started to consider the possibility of a rate cut at the bank's Oct. 17 meeting. A few weeks ago, the expectations were that the central bank would wait until December before lowering borrowing costs again for consumers and businesses.

The bank must juggle the need to make sure inflation is under control, which would mean waiting longer to lower rates, against concerns over slow economic growth, which would argue for swifter cuts.

Higher central bank interest rate benchmarks combat inflation by raising rates throughout the economy, making it more expensive to borrow and spend. That reduces demand for goods and pressure on prices. But that also slows economic activity.

The ECB, U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks rapidly raised rates to combat a burst of inflation that broke out as the economy rebounded from the pandemic, straining supplies of parts and raw materials, and after Russia invaded Ukraine.

The invasion led Russia to cut off natural gas pipeline supplies to Europe, spiking energy prices there and raising fears that Russia oil would be lost to the global market. Those strains have largely eased and inflation is low enough that central banks are cautiously trimming rates to keep the economy chugging.

The ECB might not be able declare final victory over inflation quite yet. Economists expect inflation to tick slightly higher before the end of this year, and some underlying measures of inflation such as services prices are still high enough to instill caution. Bank President Christine Lagarde has said the bank is not committing to a future rate cut schedule but will take decisions meeting to meeting based on incoming economic data."
"Asian markets mixed, Japanese stocks rally from Monday's slump",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-japan-fed-6b846be540b1ede94c2a2cb8410e6f15,2024-10-01T06:02:38Z,"HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian shares were mixed on Tuesday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index regaining some of its sharp losses from a day earlier.

A quarterly ""tankan"" survey by the Bank of Japan showed business confidence among large manufacturers remained steady at 13, indicating an improved outlook for business conditions. A positive number indicates that more companies maintain an optimistic outlook on business conditions than those who feel pessimistic.

The survey is closely monitored for clues about the impact of the Bank of Japan's interest rate decisions, especially after the central bank ended negative rates in March and raised its short-term rate to 0.25% in July.

Japan also reported that its unemployment rate for August fell to 2.5% from 2.7% in July, in line with market expectations.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rallied 1.5% in early Tuesday to 38,476.33, as the yen weakened. The dollar is trading at 144.00 yen, up from 143.62 yen.

On Monday, the Nikkei tumbled nearly 5% as markets reacted to the selection of Shigeru Ishiba to be Japan's next prime minister. Ishiba was due to take office Tuesday following the resignation of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

Ishiba, an expert on defense and on domestic economic issues, was seen as a less favorable choice than some of his rivals in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, partly because he has voiced support for raising interest rates. That caused the Japanese yen to briefly jump in value against the dollar, which would hurt profits of large export manufacturers.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dipped nearly 0.7% to 8,214.80 after the data showed that retail sales in August rose 3.1% from the same period last year, which is above expectation.

Markets in China and South Korea were shut for holidays. Mainland Chinese markets, which had their best day since 2008 on Monday, will remain closed until Oct. 7 for the National Day break.

On Monday, the S&P 500 climbed 0.4% to reached an all-time high at 5,762.48 and clinched its fifth straight winning month and fourth straight winning quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added less than 0.1% to 42,330.15. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.4% to 18,189.17.

Wall Street has catapulted to records on hopes the slowing U.S. economy can keep growing while the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to offer it more juice. A big test will arrive Friday, when the U.S. government offers its latest monthly update on the job market.

An overriding worry on Wall Street is whether the economy may already be heading for a recession. Even though the Fed cut rates earlier this month and has indicated more relief is on the way, U.S. employers have already begun paring back on their hiring. Before this month, the Fed had kept interest rates at a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the economy enough to stamp out high inflation.

In the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields rose after investors took comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell as a hint that coming cuts to interest rates may be more traditional sized.

The Fed began its rate cuts with a larger-than-usual reduction of half a percentage point, and many traders expect the next meeting in November could yield a similar sized reduction. Fed policy makers already had indicated they were planning two more cuts this year of the traditional size of a quarter of a percentage point.

But Powell said again on Monday that rate cuts are not something the Fed needs to work quickly on. After his comments, traders were betting on just a 35% probability the Fed will cut rates by another half a percentage point in November. That's down from a 53% chance seen the day before, according to data from CME Group.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.78% from 3.75% late Friday.

In other dealings Tuesday, benchmark U.S. crude oil added 10 cents to $68.27 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 15 cents at $71.85 per barrel."
"Claudia Sheinbaum to be sworn in as 1st female president of Mexico, a country with pressing problems",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-7d3599b39a7298df46e7eda34d80afee,2024-10-01T04:18:42Z,"MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Claudia Sheinbaum will take the oath of office Tuesday as Mexico's first female president in more than 200 years of independence, promising to protect an expanded social safety net and fight for the poor like her predecessor, but facing pressing problems.

The 62-year-old scientist-turned-politician will receive a country with a number of immediate challenges, foremost among them stubbornly high levels of violence, a sluggish economy and hurricane-battered Acapulco.

Sheinbaum romped to victory in June with nearly 60% of the vote, propelled largely by the sustained popularity of her political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

He took office six years ago declaring ""For the good of all, first the poor,"" and promising historical change from the neoliberal economic policies of his predecessors. Sheinbaum promised continuity from his popular social policies to controversial constitutional reforms to the judiciary and National Guard rammed through during his final days in office.

Despite her pledge of continuity, she is a very different personality.

""López Obrador was a tremendously charismatic president and many times that charisma allowed him to cover up some political errors that Claudia Sheinbaum will not have that possibility of doing,"" said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political analyst at Mexico's Center for Economic Research and Teaching. ""So, where López Obrador was charismatic, Claudia Sheinbaum will have to be effective.""

He is not leaving her an easy situation.

Her first trip as president will be to the flood-stricken Pacific coast resort of Acapulco.

Hurricane John, which struck as a Category 3 hurricane last week and then reemerged into the ocean and struck again as a tropical storm, caused four days of incredibly heavy rain that killed at least 17 people along the coast around Acapulco. Acapulco was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, and had not recovered from that blow when John hit.

Sheinbaum must also deal with raging violence in the cartel-dominated northern city of Culiacan, where factional fighting within the Sinaloa cartel broke out after drug lords Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after they flew there in a small plane on July 25.

López Obrador has long sought to avoid confronting Mexico's drug cartels and has openly appealed to the gangs to keep the peace among themselves, but the limitations of that strategy have become glaringly apparent in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, where gun battles have raged on the city's streets. Local authorities and even the army -- which López Obrador has relied on for everything -- have essentially admitted that the fighting will only end when the cartel bosses decide to end it.

But that's only the latest hotspot.

Drug-related violence is surging from Tijuana in the north to Chiapas in the south, displacing thousands.

While Sheinbaum inherits a huge budget deficit, unfinished construction projects and a burgeoning bill for her party's cash hand-out programs -- all of which could send financial markets tumbling -- perhaps her biggest looming concern is the possibility of a victory for Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.

Trump has already vowed to slap 100% tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico. Though that would likely violate the current U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, there are other things Trump could do to make life difficult for Sheinbaum, including his pledge of massive deportations.

Things with its northern neighbor were already tense after López Obrador said he was putting relations with the U.S. embassy ""on pause"" after public criticism of the proposed judicial overhaul.

First lady Jill Biden struck an optimistic tone for relations with the incoming Sheinbaum administration saying at a reception Monday that, ""Under Dr. Sheinbaum's presidency I know we will continue to build a more prosperous, safe and democratic region -- and take the steps in our U.S.-Mexico partnership.""

There are areas where Sheinbaum could try to take Mexico in a new direction. For example, she has a Ph.D. in energy engineering and has spoken of the need to address climate change. López Obrador built a massive new oil refinery and poured money into the state-owned oil company. But his budget commitments do not leave her much room to maneuver.

Jennifer Piscopo, professor of gender and politics at the Royal Holloway University of London who has studied Latin America for decades, said Mexico electing its first female leader is important because it will show girls they can do it too, but it can also create unrealistic expectations.

""Woman firsts are powerful symbols, but they do not gain magic power,"" she said. ""Especially when the governance challenges are so large, expecting magic solutions overnight can also generate outsized disappointment."""
Trump heads to Wisconsin's critical Democratic stronghold ahead of vice presidential debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-biden-wisconsin-debate-walz-vance-60307f1fa8530c60a7f7cde721260efc,2024-10-01T04:17:51Z,"Trump is scheduled to appear at a manufacturing facility in Waunakee, a suburb of Wisconsin's capital city of Madison in the Democratic stronghold of Dane County. Trump has never campaigned in Dane County before and didn't visit as president.

Later on Tuesday, Trump is expected to hold an event at a museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin's largest city and home to the largest number of Democratic voters and second-largest number of Republicans. His appearance there will also give him reach into the city's conservative suburbs, a part of Wisconsin where his support has softened but where he must do well to win.

Trump is expected to focus his comments on the economy. On Saturday, he held a rally in western Wisconsin where he blamed Harris for crimes committed by people in the country illegally.

Both stops come ahead of Tuesday's debate between Trump's running mate JD Vance, a senator from Ohio, and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota.

Dane County, the location of Trump's first stop, is Wisconsin's fastest-growing county and an economic engine for the state, fueled by jobs in the healthcare and tech industries. It is also home to the University of Wisconsin.

Dane County's population grew by about 30,000 people between 2016 and 2020. It has gone up by another 13,000 since then, based on the most recent U.S. Census Bureau estimate.

That presents a challenge for Republicans, especially given that nearly 90% of registered voters in the county cast a ballot in 2020. President Joe Biden won 75% of the vote that year in Dane County, beating Trump by 181,000 votes in the county while carrying the state by fewer than 21,000. Hillary Clinton beat Trump in Dane County in 2016 by 47 points, and Trump won the state by less than a point.

Still, Dane County is home to the third-largest number of Republican voters of any county statewide.

""President Trump's appearance will be a big shot in the arm for demoralized conservatives here,"" the Dane County Republican Party Chairman Brandon Maly posted on X, the social media platform, when the visit was announced. He has said Trump must get at least 23% of the vote in Dane County to have a chance of winning statewide.

Democratic presidential candidates have long come to Dane County to hold massive rallies to fire up the base. Harris campaigned there on Sept. 20, holding a rally in Madison that attracted more than 10,000 people.

Waunakee, which bills itself as the ""only Waunakee in the world,"" is slightly more Republican than the county as a whole. In 2020, Trump got 36% of the vote there compared to less than 23% countywide.

Trump is expected to speak at Dane Manufacturing, a metal fabricator that has a long history of hosting Republican candidates and officeholders. In Milwaukee, Trump will speak at Discovery World, a science and technology museum along the shores of Lake Michigan."
China's Communist Party has ruled for 75 years. Will it make it to 100?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/china-communist-party-75-years-explainer-18b7ac70d6ea4de0987f7592f005e0c9,2024-10-01T02:36:44Z,"More than three decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of China retains a firm grip on power.

The powerful and feared organization has ruled the nation -- home to close to one-fifth of the world's population -- for 75 years, surpassing the 74-year Soviet era in Russia.

The party survived years of self-inflicted tumult after it took control in 1949. A major course correction in 1978 transformed the country into an industrial giant with an economy second in size only to the United States.

Party leaders now want to build an even stronger China to achieve what they call the ""rejuvenation"" of the nation by 2049, which would mark the centennial of communist rule.

Staying in power that long will depend on how they manage in an era of slower growth and intensifying competition with the United States, one that has raised the specter of a new cold war.

Mao Zedong, after declaring the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1, 1949, proved to be less adept at running a sprawling country than leading a revolution.

He invited intellectuals to criticize the party's rule in the Hundred Flowers Campaign in 1956, only to have many exiled to rural areas or imprisoned as protests about the government mounted.

The misguided polices of the Great Leap Forward, launched in 1958 to accelerate the industrialization of China, led to a devastating famine that killed tens of millions of people.

Then came the Cultural Revolution. Mao encouraged young Chinese to rise up against capitalist elements in 1966, sparking a brutal chaos in which intellectuals and teachers were beaten and publicly humiliated and sent to work in the countryside. Some were killed or driven to suicide.

It was only after Mao's death in 1976 that China set off on a new path that has unleashed the country's economic potential and lifted millions out of poverty.

During the Cold War, communism was associated with planned economies and democracy went with free markets.

The Chinese Communist Party has broken that mold. It has partially unleashed market forces while keeping at bay any democratic movement that could challenge its hold on power.

Western hopes that China would inevitably shift to democracy -- as many other Asian states did after prospering economically -- turned out to be wishful thinking.

The student-led protests that occupied Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989 were a turning point. After considerable internal debate, the party leadership under Deng Xiaoping sent in troops in a bloody end to the protests.

The message was clear: There would be economic liberalization but no political liberalization that could threaten the Communist Party's position.

The party has played up its importance to China's present and future as the economic boom years have given way to a phase of more moderate growth.

It has clamped down on dissent and other perceived threats to its rule. It has put renewed emphasis on the central role of the party and leader Xi Jinping in all matters and asserted stronger control over the economy, reining in the country's high-flying tech giants.

The shift has sparked fears among some workers, business owners and foreign investors that the party is restraining market forces just when the economy needs them to regain its footing.

Daniel Bell, a political theory expert at the University of Hong Kong, said that China's trajectory corresponds to the Marxist thought that a nation needs to go through a capitalist phase to develop the economy before transitioning to communism.

""There was a view that, you know, once China becomes capitalist, it's abandoning communism. But that was only meant to be temporary,"" said Bell, who outlined his thinking in a 2023 book, ""The Dean of Shandong.""

Party leaders have studied the end of the former Soviet Union and are determined to prevent a similar outcome in China.

But they face a new set of challenges in the coming quarter-century as the population ages and their economic and geopolitical ambitions put the country on a potential collision course with some of its neighbors and the world's reigning superpower, the United States."
Japan's central bank survey underpins optimism about growth,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/japan-economy-tankan-boj-inflation-growth-89fdbf4112aa7118b095bf2bb71ddfd5,2024-10-01T01:48:04Z,"TOKYO (AP) -- Business sentiment among Japan's large manufacturers stood unchanged in the latest quarter from the previous quarter, according to a closely watched survey called ""tankan"" released Tuesday.

The Bank of Japan survey put the benchmark index at plus-13 for the July-September quarter, the same from the previous survey conducted for April-June.

A positive number means more companies said they were optimistic about business conditions than those feeling pessimistic.

The index for large nonmanufacturers stood at plus-34, up from plus-33 the previous quarter.

The results were in line with analyst forecasts.

Japan's economic growth is thought to be on relatively solid ground, managing to grow despite pressures from a declining workforce, a weakening currency and deflationary pressures that previously dragged on for years.

But recent data show average wages are holding up or in some sectors rising, adding to market optimism. Tourism, which brings in foreign revenue, is booming, now that restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic were lifted.

The tankan is among the data being closely watched to show what the central bank might do on interest rates. The Bank of Japan ended negative interest rates in March and in July raised its short-term policy rate to 0.25%.

The Bank of Japan hopes to continue to raise rates if conditions appear to back the view that its 2% inflation target is being maintained.

The latest tankan showed that Japan's companies expect consumer prices to rise 2.4% a year from now, the same rate as they said in the survey three months ago.

Japan's economy, the world's fourth largest, grew at an annual rate of 2.9%, according to government data, as wage growth and consumer spending kept growth going, despite risks from slowdowns in the Chinese and U.S. economies.

Political change is also a factor. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida resigned in a planned move Tuesday before his likely successor Shigeru Ishiba takes office later in the day. Major economic policy changes are not expected, however."
China marks 75 years of Communist Party rule as economic challenges and security threats linger,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/china-communist-party-foundation-day-russia-south-china-sea-5f140a2c8db38029ea0c0f2769e9f619,2024-10-01T00:27:03Z,"BEIJING (AP) -- China is marking the 75th year of Communist Party rule as economic challenges and security threats linger over the massive state.

No festivities have been announced for the occasion Tuesday, save for a flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square. In recent decades, China has mounted military parades and displays of the country's economic might only at the turn of decades, such as for the 60th and 70th anniversaries.

The world's second largest economy has struggled to regain momentum after COVID-19.

A prolonged property slump led to a spillover effect on other parts of the economy, from construction to sales of home appliances. Last week, China announced a slew of measures to boost the economy, including lower interest rates and smaller down payment requirements for mortgages.

Party leader and head of state Xi Jinping has largely avoided overseas travel since the pandemic, while continuing with his purges at home of top officials considered insufficiently loyal or being suspected of corruption or personal indiscretions.

""The road ahead will not be smooth, there will definitely be difficulties and obstacles, and we may encounter major tests such as high winds and rough seas, or even stormy waves"" Xi warned during a banquet on the eve of the anniversary.

""We must be vigilant in times of peace, plan ahead, and rely closely on the entire Party, the entire army, and people of all ethnic groups across the country"" he said, ""no difficulties can stop the Chinese people from moving forward.""

The anniversary also comes as China is facing growing frictions with neighbors including Japan, South Korea and the Philippines over territorial claims and their close relationships with Beijing's chief rival, the United States.

The Communists under Mao Zedong seized power in 1949 amid a civil war with the Nationalists, also known as the KMT, led by Chiang Kai-shek, who shifted their political, economic and military power to the now self-governing island democracy of Taiwan.

Beijing continues to insist Taiwan must be annexed under Communist Party rule, by force if necessary, while the U.S. has provided arms to ensure its defense.

China, meanwhile, has involved itself in disputes over its claims to most of the South China Sea and uninhabited islands held by Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and other neighboring nations.

China's military buildup and its recent launch of a nuclear capable ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean have raised concerns about a possible conflict.

That deal has seemingly evaporated as Iran's foreign minister visits the kingdom on Tuesday to discuss efforts to halt Israel's incursions into Gaza and Lebanon.

""Our dialogue continues regarding the developments in the region to prevent the shameless crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon, in continuation of the crimes in Gaza,"" Iran Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a video broadcast on state media.

He added: ""Starting today, I'll begin a trip to the region, to Riyadh and other capitals, and we will strive for a collective movement from the countries of the region... to stop the brutal attacks in Lebanon.""

The Saudis share a longtime strategic partnership with the U.S. and are the largest purchaser of its weapons. But in recent years, they've had a political rapprochement with Iran.

9/11 FAMILIES URGE TRUMP, HARRIS TO OPPOSE SAUDI DEAL UNTIL KINGDOM ADMITS INVOLVEMENT IN TERROR ATTACK

Last week, Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, reaffirmed their neutrality in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Iran has warned that if ""Israel supporters"" intervene directly, their interests in the region would be targeted. That could mean missile strikes on their oil facilities.

Iran rained some 200 missiles down on Israel last week, many of which were intercepted by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with U.S. assistance.

""The Gulf states think it's unlikely that Iran will strike their oil facilities, but the Iranians are dropping hints they might from unofficial sources. It's a tool the Iranians have against the U.S. and the global economy,"" Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator close to the royal court, said.

In 2019, drones attacked Saudi Arabia's key refinery at Abqaiq, briefly shutting down around 5% of the world's oil supply. Those drones originated in Iran, according to U.S. intelligence.

Prior to Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Biden administration considered a proposed deal, akin to the Abraham Accords, a major priority. This deal aimed to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, including security guarantees and cooperation on civil nuclear matters. For months, the White House had been saying the deal was nearly done.

The prospect of a deal was largely blamed as a catalyst for the Hamas attacks.

OPINION: WHY SAUDI ARABIA MATTERS MORE THAN EVER TO THE US

""I don't think we were ever really that close,"" Robert Greenway, former senior director of the National Security Council, told Fox News Digital.

""We were closest probably in the waning days of the Trump administration, but we knew that that would be a second-term issue if there was to be one, and obviously that didn't play out. I don't know that the Biden-Harris administration ever took it that terribly seriously.""

Just before the Hamas attack, a group of 20 Democratic senators made clear their opposition to the treaty, voicing concerns over Saudi Arabia's human rights record and that a peaceful nuclear energy program might one day be converted to a military one to produce a nuclear weapon.

And Oct. 7 changed the Saudis' calculus: they now demand a plan for a Palestinian state.

""If anyone believes there was a chance of getting the House or Senate in an election year with virtually no majority, getting anything as controversial as a security treaty, with Saudi Arabia - permission for them to enrich with our blessing and support - I don't know if anyone credibly believes that that was ever possible.""

Former deputy national security adviser Victoria Coates was optimistic that the Saudis could be brought back into the fold.

""From what I'm hearing from both sides, it's when, not if,"" she said. ""There are various reasons you might want to wait to find out what the makeup of the Congress is going to be... you're going to need supportive majorities in the Senate to get [a civil nuclear agreement] through."""

"Hungary's Orban interrupted, accused of 'selling out' country to Russia, China during EU news conference",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hungarys-orban-interrupted-accused-selling-out-country-russia-china-eu-news-conference,2024-10-08T16:04:12Z,"During the disruption, he yelled accusations at Orban, questioning how much he had ""sold out"" Hungary.

An activist and municipal councilor for a Hungarian opposition party disrupted a news conference in Strasbourg, France, on Tuesday as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was laying out his plans for Hungary's six-month presidency of the European Union.

The activist, Márton Gyekiczki, interrupted Orbán as he was speaking about his opposition to immigration, running toward the podium where Orbán sat and throwing a stack of what appeared to be banknotes at the prime minister.

""How much did you sell out the country for? How much did you sell out the country for, Mr. Prime Minister?"" Gyekiczki yelled as the papers scattered. ""He sold out to Putin, he sold out to Xi Jinping!"" -- referring to the leaders of Russia and China.

TRUMP TOUTS EUROPEAN 'STRONGMAN' AS CLOSE ALLY DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: WHO IS VIKTOR ORBAN?

The disruption came as Orbán was set to address the European Parliament on Wednesday during Hungary's six-month rotating presidency of the bloc. His government has long been at odds with the EU over what it sees as his curtailing of democratic rights, and has increasingly come under fire for his close relations with autocracies like Russia and China.

Gyekiczki, the activist, who was taken to the ground by a security guard and led out of the room, is a member of Hungary's Democratic Coalition party and a local council member in a Budapest suburb.

The president of that party, former Prime Minister Ference Gyurcsány, later wrote on social media that he was ""proud"" of Gyekiczki for his actions.

""We will say it everywhere and always: Hungary has a traitorous government!"" he wrote.

Orbán is expected to receive a mixed reception in the EU parliament on Wednesday. Many lawmakers have pushed for his government to be deprived of EU funds over what they see as rule-of-law and corruption violations.

HUNGARY LAUNCHES EU PRESIDENCY WITH TRUMP-LIKE CALL TO 'MAKE EUROPE GREAT AGAIN'

Two years ago, the parliament declared that Hungary under Orbán had become ""a hybrid regime of electoral autocracy,"" taking it out of the community of democracies.

Yet Orbán this year successfully formed the Patriots for Europe group within the parliament, uniting far-right parties from around the continent to form the third-largest group in the EU legislature.

During the news conference on Tuesday, Orbán lamented what he sees as a declining EU economy and lagging competitiveness with the United States and China, saying that he saw that as ""the most serious challenge we have to face.""

He also argued against recently adopted EU tariffs on Chinese-produced electric vehicles, and railed against immigration which he said was resulting in the destruction of the EU's visa-free Schengen area as countries like Germany, Austria, Italy and Slovenia have introduced temporary border checks along their frontiers.

""These individual attempts will actually break up the Schengen system,"" Orbán said, adding that he proposed a regular ""Schengen Summit"" for member countries to meet and discuss border policy.

Responding to the disruption by the activist, Orbán offered ""a word of explanation for Hungarian political culture.""

""When a Hungarian politician tells another one that he is a scoundrel, all it means in our culture is that 'I disagree with you,'"" he said."
5 key takeaways from Kamala Harris' '60 Minutes' interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/5-key-takeaways-from-kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview,2024-10-08T15:03:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program.

Here are some standout moments from the Harris interview.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Whitaker asked Harris about the ongoing crises in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, with Israel under assault from Iranian proxies and Ukraine persevering in the fight against Russia's invasion. In her answers, Harris did not do much to distinguish her foreign policy from that of the current administration.

On Israel, Harris echoed Biden's call for the war with Hamas to end, though she acknowledged the Jewish nation's right to defend itself after the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, when terrorists slaughtered 1,200 people and took 250 captives back to Gaza.

""I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end,"" Harris said.

Whitaker pointed out that although the United States has handed billions of dollars to Israel in military aid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted the Biden-Harris administration's call for a cease-fire with Hamas. When asked if the U.S. holds no sway over Netanyahu, Harris dodged the question and stayed on message, emphasizing the current administration's diplomatic efforts.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" she said.

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

Whitaker pressed, ""but it seems Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.""

Harris declined to answer that point. ""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""

On Europe, Harris stuck with Biden's position that Ukraine must be involved in any resolution to the war with Russia.

""There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the U.N. charter participating in what that success looks like,"" she said.

In a definitive statement, Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war unless Ukrainian representatives were present. However, she was less specific on whether Ukraine should join NATO.

""Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression,"" Harris said. ""Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREET TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Whitaker confronted Harris on her apparent flip-flop on immigration, noting that she supported Biden's efforts to reverse Trump's strict policies even as a historic flood of illegal immigrants crossed the border. Now, the vice president has ""embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers,"" he said.

Whitaker asked, ""If that's the right answer, now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?""

Harris responded by pointing to congressional Republicans who backed out of a bipartisan agreement on a border security bill negotiated by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. ""Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed. And he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress kill the bill. Don't let it move forward,"" she said.

However, Whitaker pushed back on the vice president, observing that in the first three years of the Biden-Harris administration, border arrivals quadrupled and there was no action from Biden or Harris.

""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?""

Harris did not answer the question but asserted that her administration has offered solutions ""from day one, literally.""

""We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem,"" she said, again echoing Biden.

To fight inflation, Harris said she intends to ask Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries. She would expand the child tax credit to $6,000, give first-time homebuyers $25,000 in down payment assistance and offer generous assistance to people starting a small business.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that the total cost of her economic proposals would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

""How are you going to pay for that?"" asked Whitaker.

""Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it,"" Harris answered. ""But my plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.""

HARRIS SAYS WEALTHY AMERICANS, CORPORATIONS WILL PAY HIGHER TAXES TO FUND ECONOMIC PLAN

Whitaker pressed again. ""Pardon me, madam vice president. The question was, how are you going to pay for it?""

The Democratic candidate's answer was that the rich must ""pay their fair share in taxes.""

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations, and I plan on making that fair,"" Harris asserted.

Whitaker followed up again, stating, ""we're dealing with the real world here"" and observing that Congress has shown no inclination to raise taxes.

""I disagree with you,"" Harris responded. ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

""None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy,"" she continued. ""Let me tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that I am also a capitalist, and I know the limitations of government.""

After a discussion on foreign policy, Whitaker took ""a hard left turn"" and asked Harris about her recent admission that she is a gun owner.

""I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time,"" Harris said after he asked what kind of gun she owns. ""And, I mean, look, my background is in law enforcement, and so there you go.""

Harris served as the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004-2011 and was California's attorney general from 2011-2017 before she was elected to the U.S. Senate and later selected as Biden's 2020 running mate.

She told Whitaker she has fired her handgun ""at a shooting range.""

Though Harris had served in government for decades before becoming vice president, she remains a largely unknown figure in national politics. She did not run for president in the 2024 Democratic primary and only became a candidate two and a half months ago, when Biden decided to drop out of the race amid mounting pressure from Democrats concerned that he was too old to win.

""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you,"" Whitaker told Harris. They don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""

""It's an election, Bill,"" Harris replied. ""And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support."
Harris takes slim lead over Trump in new poll as voters view her as candidate of change,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-takes-slim-lead-over-trump-new-poll-voters-view-her-candidate-change,2024-10-08T12:30:58Z,"Reason senior editor Robby Soave and syndicated columnist Josh Hammer on the media interviews agreed to by Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton suggesting social media censorship.

Vice President Kamala Harris has taken a slight edge over former President Donald Trump in a new poll released Tuesday that looked into which candidate voters view as the candidate representing change. Trump, however, maintained his lead among male voters and has kept the trust of most voters on economic issues.

The latest New York Times/Sienna College national poll found that if the election were held today, 49% of respondents would vote for Harris while 46% would vote for Trump. It marks the first time Harris has led Trump in the Times/Sienna poll since President Biden dropped out in July.

Harris took a slim lead among respondents who saw the vice president, not Trump, as a break from the status quo, garnering 46% compared with 44% for the former president.

Harris' lead in this category was greater when broken down into non-White and younger voters, garnering 61% and 58%, respectively, compared to 29% of non-White and 34% of younger voters favoring Trump, according to the poll.

Despite the slight change for Harris, the poll found Trump still maintained the majority of voter trust on what they consider their most important issues, such as the economy, with 48% compared to 46% for Harris.

Trump is also leading Harris with male voters by 11 points, a group which also favored Trump over Biden in the 2020 election, according to the poll.

NORTH CAROLINA GOP FOCUSING ON 'HAND-TO-HAND POLITICAL COMBAT' TO RAMP UP GROUND GAME IN BATTLEGROUND STATE

While national polls are often a good indicator of the general mood among Americans, they don't always predict who will win elections, which often come down to important battleground states.

In the latest Fox News survey of registered voters in North Carolina, viewed as one such battleground state, Harris has a 2 percentage-point edge over Trump, 50% to 48%. A month earlier, Trump was ahead by 1 point (50% to 49%), for a 3-point shift in the presidential race.

Reporter's Notebook: All about the politics of disaster relief,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/politics-disaster-relief,2024-10-07T23:16:37Z,"Fox News' Chad Pergram reports on the politics of disaster relief as FEMA pushes back on the 'dangerous' criticism of their Hurricane Helene response.

Republicans are excoriating the Biden/Harris administration for how it responded to Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, Tennessee and other parts of the South. This is now about to be a double whammy as Hurricane Milton bears down on Florida.

It unfolds amid a tight presidential election. So the disaster response is now infused with politics in swing states like North Carolina and Georgia. There is also a competitive but not top-tier Senate race in Florida.

Storms can disrupt the typical electorate. The usual people who vote might not make it to the polls. It's hard to care about voting if you're low on food, lack electricity and can't even make it out of the holler in western North Carolina because Helene wrecked the road.

'IMMEDIATELY RECONVENE': SCOTT URGES SCHUMER TO RECALL SENATE AMID HELENE'S DEVASTATION

Pray tell, where should you vote in Tampa or Sarasota if your basement is swamped by Milton - after getting drenched when Helene spun through a few weeks ago? You were going to vote at the school down the street. But now it lacks power. You're now living at your sister's house inland. But you're not registered to vote there ...

You see what we're getting at.

Republicans are hammering the Biden/Harris administration for its response to the storm.

""It's like the DMV at industrial scale,"" said Republican vice presidential nominee and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, on Fox. ""It is incompetence of the highest order.""

""At the federal level, this has been a massive failure,"" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. ""When you talk to the people who are directly affected, they will tell you that this has been an abject failure. FEMA has lost sight of its core mission. The administration has not shown that they were prepared for this eventuality in this terrible disaster.""

""Kamala Harris has left them stranded. This is the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we've ever seen. Probably worse than Katrina. And that's hard to beat, right?"" asked former President Trump.

Storm responses are challenging. Hurricane Andrew was a powerful Category 5 storm that swept through Florida in August 1992. Former President George H.W. Bush's tepid response to Andrew slashed his support in Florida. ""Bush 41"" wound up narrowly winning Florida, besting former President Clinton by less than 2%. Bush won Florida by 22 points four years earlier. Moreover, the response to Hurricane Andrew raised questions about the competence of the administration weeks before the election. It's believed that cost Bush a few points nationwide.

When Clinton took office, he immediately beefed up FEMA to prepare and respond to other natural disasters.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

So, part of this tactic is the natural extension of Republicans to undercut the Biden/Harris administration at nearly every turn. This is another component of the GOP narrative that the administration can't handle the economy. Can't handle foreign policy. Can't handle the border.

Did someone say the border?

""We give $20 billion a year to FEMA. And unfortunately, they have drained everything dry,"" said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., on Fox Business. ""We spent $200 billion in Ukraine. We spent $220-$500 a month on our illegal aliens.""

This is where things get tricky.

FEMA is under the aegis of the Department of Homeland Security. DHS runs a program that sends money to cities besieged by the illegal migrant crisis. Some of the money goes for food and shelter for those in the country illegally. But it also helps those towns cope by addressing strains on their medical systems and other services.

Money for disaster recovery and migrant assistance constitute two separate line items in the DHS budget. Congress approved money for both these programs. In fact, some Republicans would prefer to spend more to help their communities grapple with an infusion of illegal immigration.

SPEAKER JOHNSON ADDRESSES CLAIMS FEMA DIVERTED FUNDS TO IMMIGRATION EFFORTS: 'AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTED'

About $640 million currently goes to assist these towns beset by an influx of illegal migrants. But some lawmakers would like that to spike to as much as $3 billion next year.

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., introduced legislation to halt the migrant assistance program. And Johnson blurred the line between FEMA disaster aid and migrants and the border.

""FEMA should be involved and the Federal Emergency Management Association. Their mission is to help people in times like this of natural disaster. Not to be engaged in using any pool of funding from any account for resettling illegal aliens who have come across the border,"" said Johnson on Fox.

Other Republicans believe this may be an opportunity to recalibrate spending overall. Keep in mind that many Republicans look askance at foreign aid to Ukraine.

""As an elected official, it's our responsibility to put Americans first. Whether you're in Florida, in my district or you're anywhere in the union, I think that it's important for us to prioritize Americans and restore hope and let them know they're not forgotten,"" said Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., on Fox.

But some Republicans compared issues with FEMA's response to how the administration addresses other subjects.

KJP SLAMMED AFTER HURRICANE HELENE OVER MIXED MESSAGES ON WHETHER FEMA RESOURCES USED FOR MIGRANTS

""This administration seems to have no problem finding money when they want to spend it on their priorities. When they need hundreds of billions of dollars to pay off student loans for graduate students and gender studies programs, they somehow find it. When it's trying to get helicopters to deliver food and water and cellular service and lifesaving medicine into these mountain valleys, they somehow can't seem to find the money,"" declared Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., on NBC.

FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell castigated Republicans for suggesting FEMA was focused on other issues rather than the storms.

""It's frankly ridiculous and just plain false. This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people,"" said Criswell on ABC.

Before leaving Washington, Congress green-lighted $20 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) as part of the interim spending plan to avoid a government shutdown. But Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas muddled matters when he said FEMA had enough funds to respond to Helene for ""immediate needs"" but not enough to get through ""the season.""

The ""season"" to which Mayorkas refers is the annual hurricane ""season."" It stretches through Nov. 30. Note that Mayorkas made this remark when there was the potential for another storm, but Milton hadn't yet formed in the Gulf of Mexico.

Some Republicans pounced on Mayorkas. But after considering the severity of Helene, it will likely draw down the DRF for ""immediate needs."" The key phrase here is ""immediate needs."" Milton will probably do the same. That's why Congress must likely tackle disaster relief in at least two tranches when it returns to session in November. Lawmakers will need to refill the DRF. And the price tags will start to roll in for Helene and Milton. That's to say nothing of outstanding disasters like Hurricane Beryl in Texas, tornadoes in Iowa, a typhoon on Guam and wildfires in Hawaii.

FEMA HAS FUNDS NEEDED FOR 'IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY,' DESPITE MAYORKAS' WARNING

However, Johnson is unwilling to summon lawmakers back to Washington to grapple with disasters.

""You don't just send estimates to the federal government. You send specific needs and requests based upon the actual damages. And that takes some time, especially with storms of this magnitude. So Congress will do its job,"" said Johnson on Fox.

So, lawmakers must first reload the DRF for future immediate needs, then mete out bigger chunks of change for Americans to cope with the impacts of Helene and Milton. The government funding deadline is Dec. 20. It's possible that the latter chunk of funding is folded into spending measures around Christmas.

But as for the politics? The election is fast approaching. The storms could impact voting this fall. And while Helene and Milton will certainly leave a mark meteorologically, they will probably leave a mark electorally, too."
"Harris says wealthy Americans, corporations will pay higher taxes to fund economic plan",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-says-wealthy-americans-corporations-will-pay-higher-taxes-to-fund-economic-plan,2024-10-07T18:36:59Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris told CBS ""60 Minutes"" in an interview set to air on Monday that she plans to pay for her economic plan by taxing the rich.

Vice President Kamala Harris plans to increase taxes on wealthy individuals and large corporations as part of her economic plan if elected in November, she said in a new interview.

Since becoming the Democratic Party's official nominee for president, Harris has said she will provide $25,000 housing subsidies for first-generation home buyers, implement $100 billion in tax credits for the manufacturing sector and increase small business tax credits by tenfold.

""My plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy,"" Harris told ""60 Minutes"" in a clip released on Monday.

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

""60 Minutes"" correspondent Bill Whitaker reminded Harris that the question was ""how are you going to pay for it?""

Harris quickly said that wealthy Americans would foot the bill.

""I'm going to make sure that the richest among us, who can afford it, pay their fair share in taxes,"" Harris said.

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations,"" Harris continued. ""I plan on making that fair.""

Whitaker shot back, ""But we're dealing with the real world here,"" and asked how that plan would get through Congress.

""You know, when you talk, quietly, with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I am talking about,"" Harris said.

""Cause their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about,"" Harris added. ""Their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses.""

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

Harris' opponent, former President Trump, was invited to appear on ""60 Minutes"" as well for its election interview special, but he declined.

Last month, Harris unveiled new small-business tax proposals last week aimed at reducing the cost burden related to starting a new business. Among the proposals was a substantial increase in the standard tax deduction for small-business startup costs, from $5,000 to $50,000. ""It's essentially a tax cut for starting a small business,"" the vice president said during a stump speech announcing the new proposal. ""We're going to help more small businesses and innovators get off the ground.""

Harris has simultaneously expressed support for raising marginal tax rates for both corporations and individuals, which conservative economists argued would work to diminish the benefit received by the tenfold increase in the startup deduction.

In addition to Harris' new tax proposals for small businesses, she also laid out her plan this week for taxing capital gains. She wants to increase it to 33%, whereas Biden reportedly wants the current rate, which is at 23.8%, to be nearly doubled, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Harris has also suggested support for increasing government spending to support families' child care needs, while also expanding the child tax credit, among other proposals.

With less than a month to go until Election Day in November, a new poll indicates Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Trump among self-identified Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada, two crucial southwestern battleground states.

But Trump has made gains with younger male Hispanic voters compared to four years ago, according to a pair of Suffolk University/USA Today surveys released on Monday.

According to the poll, Harris leads Trump 57%-38% among Hispanic voters in Arizona, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver both under 1% support.

""So far, Harris is falling short of the 24-26 point advantage that Joe Biden carried with Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada in 2020, according to the exit polls from those states,"" Suffolk University Political Research Center director David Paleologos highlighted. ""This Democratic shortfall is largely due to young Hispanic men.""

In both states, a majority of men under 50 years of age are choosing Trump over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 53%-40% among Hispanic men ages 18-34 in Nevada, and tops her 53%-39% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

In Arizona, the Republican presidential nominee leads the Democratic Party standard-bearer 51%-39% among Hispanic men ages 18-34, and 57%-37% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

TIGHTEST PRESIDENTIAL RACE SINCE 2000 - WITH ONE MONTH UNTIL ELECTION DAY

The economy and immigration were the top two issues on the minds of those questioned in the survey in both states.

Arizona and Nevada have referendums to protect access to abortion on the ballot in November - and the poll indicates majority support for the measures in both states.

Arizona and Nevada - along with Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin - had razor-thin margins in the 2020 presidential election that decided Biden's victory over Trump. And all seven states are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election in the race for the White House.

The latest surveys in Arizona and Nevada - as well as the other five swing states - indicate margin-of-error races between Harris and Trump.

"Kamala Harris should prosecute Big Pharma, not bail it out",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-harris-should-prosecute-big-pharma-not-bail-out,2024-10-07T13:15:43Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

With less than six weeks before the election, Vice President Kamala Harris has been striking a populist tone, especially when it comes to taking on Big Pharma in her stump speeches. At a recent campaign rally, she touted her tie-breaking vote to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which granted Medicare the ability ""to go toe-to-toe with Big Pharma and negotiate lower drug prices.""

And to great fanfare, just before the Democratic National Convention, the White House announced that the first round of those drug price negotiations would save taxpayers a cool $6 billion - a major win for the American taxpayer.

Yet at this very moment, the Biden-Harris administration is quietly pushing for a multi-billion-dollar bailout of one of the nation's largest and wealthiest drug companies - a bailout that would be funded by those same taxpayers.

WISCONSIN POLL SHOWS HARRIS LEADING TRUMP BY 4, FORMER PRESIDENT AHEAD ON KEY ISSUES

The proposed bailout revolves around a patent infringement lawsuit. Arbutus and Genevant Sciences, two small biotech companies, allege that Moderna stole their patented lipid nanoparticle technology, which proved critical in developing Moderna's mRNA vaccine for COVID-19.

Though the case is yet to be decided, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and Federal Circuit Court of Appeals have already determined Arbutus' patents to be valid, despite Moderna's attempt to invalidate the patents before the pandemic. Given the stakes of this case, court-ordered damages could reach $3 billion, according to some analysts.

While this may appear to many as an obscure issue of corporations battling it out over patent infringement, there are serious ramifications for taxpayers here as well.

In a rare statement of interest filing, Department of Justice officials recently argued that due to an obscure federal law dating back to World War I, Moderna is excused from any patent infringement that may have occurred during Operation Warp Speed, the historic federal campaign to support COVID-19 vaccine development. If that's the case, the lion's share of the financial penalty for Moderna's potential wrongdoing will fall on U.S. taxpayers.

The law, known as Section 1498, essentially states that the government will compensate an inventor for patent infringement if the technology in question is ""used or manufactured by or for the United States.""

In times of great national need, the government may decide they need niche technology at a scale that the original patent-holding manufacturer can't provide. The law absolves the larger manufacturer from having to worry about licensing the patent from the original patent-holder or deal with the patent-holder taking them to court for infringement.

Put more simply, Section 1498 is similar to eminent domain, but rather than letting the government seize private land, it allows the government to seize patented inventions in emergencies and retroactively compensate the patent holders.

Here's where the DOJ's argument falls short, as Moderna's infringement clearly should not be covered by Section 1498. The government never asked them to infringe on the intellectual property of anyone else and never authorized widespread production of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine by other companies due to manufacturing capacity issues.

And critically, the vaccines in question weren't used exclusively or even primarily by the U.S. government - meaning military service members or other federal employees - but were instead distributed to regular Americans like you and me.

Yet at this very moment, the Biden-Harris administration is quietly pushing for a multi-billion-dollar bailout of one of the nation's largest and wealthiest drug companies - a bailout that would be funded by those same taxpayers.

""By or for"" government use has always been understood to mean that the U.S. government is the end user of the product in question - for instance, a patented technology that's appropriated for U.S. military use - not that it's merely a purchaser. Objectively, the U.S. government was merely one buyer among many purchasers of the vaccines - including many foreign governments and other foreign state-owned companies.

If the court overseeing the case accepts the DOJ's interpretation of Section 1498, it will set a precedent that companies that merely sell to the government, among other customers, are immune from patent infringement lawsuits. That result would be disastrous for our economy and a boon to wrongdoers.

Patents encourage innovation and risk-taking by enabling anyone with a novel idea to turn it into a real-world product - without bigger, entrenched rivals stealing it. Allowing huge corporations to essentially steal patented technology from small upstarts is the opposite of standing up for the little guy. It'd greatly disincentivize investments in research and development.

Harris has a strong history of standing up for the ""little guy"" going back to her early years as a prosecutor and San Francisco District attorney. The vice president should continue that legacy and make clear that in a Harris administration, large corporations will be held accountable if found responsible - a winning message in the final campaign stretch."
Blue Philly working class voters start leaning towards Trump ahead of election: 'People actually love him',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/blue-philly-working-class-voters-start-leaning-towards-trump-ahead-election-people-actually-love-him,2024-10-07T11:17:30Z,"Working-class Philadelphia Democrats may be planning to vote for former President Trump in November.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Wednesday about growing trends among poorer wards and districts in the Pennsylvania city to shift towards the Republican Party despite years of being solidly blue.

One example the report cited included 27-year-old Gabriel Lopez who registered as a Democrat and voted for Hillary Clinton for his first election in 2016. Since then, he changed his registration to Republican and voiced his support for Trump.

""Democrats keep saying [Trump] is going to bring down the economy, but he was already president for four years, and taxes were lower,"" Lopez said. ""We're tired of the same politics. We got a different type of guy, and the people actually love him.""

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

The article added, ""Lopez embodies one of Democrats' biggest problems in Pennsylvania: working-class voters in Philadelphia, a once reliable voting bloc for the party, have drifted right in recent years. And they've been disproportionately affected by rising prices over the last several years, an issue many blame Democrats for.""

Although Philadelphia, which holds 20% of the state's Democratic voters, may be crucial for Vice President Kamala Harris to win the state, the Inquirer reported the city lost the most Democratic voters out of any city in the 2020 election.

The trend was most pronounced in poorer, less-educated areas with majority-Latino neighborhoods showing the most movement, likely concerned about the economy.

Retired truck driver and registered Democrat Jim Kohn listed that as his top issue.

""When Trump was president, everything was cheaper,"" Kohn said. ""Now, everything is so sky-high.""

Other Democrats in the area remained optimistic about Harris' chances, though some understood the growing support for Trump.

""Many of us have people in our families who have gone to jail, or gone to schools that have failed us. We're not trustful of the government,"" Álvarez Febo, a Democrat who plans to vote for Harris, said. ""Then you have someone like Trump, who is a liar, and for some people, it's like, 'you know something? He's an honest representation of what we feel.'""

""They're saying Kamala is going to save our democracy,"" Febo added. ""That means very little for people who can't keep the lights on.""

Some Republicans, by contrast, were very optimistic about a potential political shift in the city.

""When I first started in politics in 1978, the managerial class was Republican -- no one votes the way their bosses vote,"" 45th Ward GOP Leader Charlie O'Connor said. ""Now, most people in the managerial class vote Democratic and no one is voting the way their boss is. So it's been a flip. Most of the bosses are Democrats and the Democratic Party has become the party of the upper middle class.""

Pennsylvania is considered one of the most competitive states for this presidential election. A Fox News survey found Harris and Trump tied at 49% among likely voters in the state. Trump previously won Pennsylvania in the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton but lost the state in 2020 to President Biden."
Lake rips Biden-Harris 'double whammy' policies affecting Arizonans : 'Driven us over the cliff',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lake-rips-biden-harris-double-whammy-policies-affecting-arizonans-driven-us-over-the-cliff,2024-10-07T10:21:22Z,"PHOENIX, Ariz. - Arizona GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake told Fox News Digital that illegal immigration has disproportionately hammered residents of her state which she says has created a ""double whammy"" that will result in GOP wins in the state in November.

""I think most Americans think that they have driven us right over the edge, over the cliff,"" Lake told Fox News Digital about the policies of the Biden-Harris administration. ""And we're hoping that we can pull this back come November and that's what we plan to do. But our polling shows that the economy is really affecting everybody. The border is affecting everybody.""

Lake explained to Fox News Digital that the current administration's border policies have disproportionately hurt Arizona particularly when it comes to housing costs.

""It's basic supply and demand,"" Lake said. ""21 million people coming in, even if you take the estimate that Joe Biden and Kamala are giving, which is 10 million, they've got to live somewhere. They're living in homes and apartments and hotels and these are taking away housing opportunities for Americans and also jacking up the prices as well. Because right now, when you have a very limited supply of housing, which we do, we have not built enough homes and apartments in the past 20 years to keep up with the demand. So now all of a sudden, you add 21 million people, you've got a supply and demand issue. You got you don't have enough supply and you have a lot of demand.""

KARI LAKE SHREDS VP HARRIS' 'DESPICABLE' SOUTHERN BORDER VISIT: JUST TO MAKE THE 'MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAPPY'

Lake continued, ""We know that these people that are pouring across our country illegally, that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are bringing in hand-holding and saying, yes, please come in and we will supply you housing, federally subsidized housing, which means you and I are paying for it. And we will give you an ID card with thousands of dollars a month to pay for your food. They don't have living expenses like the American people do. The American people are barely getting by because living expenses have gone up so they can then afford to take these jobs making less than the going rate, which takes Americans salaries and hourly wages and depresses them or pushes them down. So it's a double whammy and it's really affecting Arizona particularly hard.""

On inflation, Lake pointed to data showing that Phoenix was at one point the hardest hit city in the country.

""I talk to more Arizonans than anybody in the whole country,"" Lake told Fox News Digital. ""I have a better relationship with the people of Arizona, I think, than anybody in the country and they're struggling. You know, it kills me to see families and people who are retiring or retirees, Arizona used to be an affordable state it's not so much anymore, who are telling me now, Kari, I've never had to go to a food bank in my life. As a matter of fact, I used to donate to food banks. Now I'm finding myself there every couple of weeks just to make ends meet. I can't even afford the basics. It breaks my heart because the people of this state are incredible, hard working people.""

FLASHBACK: ARIZONA DEM SENATE CANDIDATE CALLED TRUMP VOTERS 'DUMB': 'WORST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD'

""They don't deserve this and they don't want to be asking for a handout, but they're working as hard as they ever have. Some of them are doing two jobs and there's not enough hours in the day. They can't work any harder than they already are and they're still not making ends meet. So it's very distressing for the people and it's distressing for me because I really, truly love the people of the state.""

Lake, who is running for Senate against Dem. Rep. Ruben Gallego who she says is responsible for supporting the Harris-Biden immigration and inflation record, told Fox News Digital that she believes Republicans will have success in November as a result of those policies.

""Every main issue that we're facing as a country somehow seems to kind of come right through Arizona and this is why I feel so comfortable that we're going to win this because, well, first of all, we're registering voters left to right,"" Lake said.

""People are saying, yep, we're voting, we're going to become a Republican. People who've never been a Republican before are now registered Republicans...We're calling people who haven't voted in a number of elections, people who maybe skipped the last 4 or 5 elections. I guess they are called low propensity voters and we're asking, are you going to vote? And they're saying, 'Hell, yes, I'm going to vote. Absolutely, I'm going to vote. I'm struggling right now. This is the first election I voted in a number of elections.' But this one really matters. I think it's our last election. If we don't get this right as a free America."""

Ruben Gallego and labeling him as ""radical as they come"" after a resurfaced interview of him disparaging Trump voters.

""Isn't that terrible?"" Lake said in response to Fox News Digital reporting of a comment made by Gallego in 2016 where he said that Trump voters were ""dumb"" and the ""worst people in the world.""

""He's been lying about who he is,"" Lake added. ""He's trying to paint himself as a moderate, which is it's laughable if it wasn't so dangerous.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Gallego ""bullied"" moderate Sen. Kyrsten Sinema out of the race ""because she wasn't liberal enough.""

KARI LAKE SHREDS VP HARRIS' 'DESPICABLE' SOUTHERN BORDER VISIT: JUST TO MAKE THE 'MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAPPY'

""Now he is doing all these ads trying to say he's a moderate when, in fact, he's voted to spend our federal dollars, our tax dollars, our money, supporting sanctuary cities and states. He's voted against securing our border every step of the way. He's for an open border America. He's voted to defund the police. He actually co-sponsored the George Floyd legislation, which would have defunded the police nationwide.""

Lake went on to tell Fox News Digital that Gallego has ""never batted an eyelash"" when it comes to spending bills and has not been strong enough defending women's sports.

""He wants biological men to participate in women's athletics.,"" Lake said. ""That means it's an end for girls sports. Anybody out there who played sports? I did for a little bit. It's an end. I mean, if you have to compete with biological men, what's the purpose of having girls sports?""

ENIGMATIC VOTER GROUP COULD SPLIT TICKET FOR TRUMP, DEM SENATE CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA

Lake added, ""It's absolutely crazy and he's as radical as they come.""

Gallego and Lake will both be attempting to sway independent voters, especially in Maricopa County, the largest county in the state, where independents make up a third of the electorate. Lake told Fox News Digital she is optimistic she can win votes from Arizonans who aren't Republicans.

""I do believe that independents are with me, I think we're doing pretty well, our polling is showing that we're building on the independent vote,"" Lake said. ""And I think a lot of Democrats, while he [Gallego] hates Trump voters and he hates Republicans. I don't hate Democrats. I actually believe that disaffected Democrats are going to help us turn the corner.""

""They're realizing, looking at Kamala Harris and Ruben Gallego, and they're saying, wait a minute, this isn't the Democrat Party that I signed up for years ago, the old Democrat Party used to care about the working class. The old Democrat Party wanted a strong economy for everybody. This Democrat Party is a bunch of globalists, and they are for, they want to spend more money helping people coming here illegally than they do people who are American citizens.""

While the Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Gallego leading Lake by about 7 points, Lake told Fox News Digital she is confident the race is much closer and says her internal polling shows that she is within the margin of error.

""We have to go into it acting like we're ten down, but we're not ten down,"" Lake said. ""This is a very tight race. I'm proud of that, considering, as I said, he spent 75 million. He's been outspending us massively and the fact that this is such a tight race is incredible. Chuck Schumer is in a panic about Arizona. He's dumping 5 million bucks a week into Arizona.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Democrats are in a ""tailspin"" in Arizona because their efforts to make the election about abortion have not been fruitful because most voters are focused on other issues like the economy.

Lake also criticized Gallego over his record before he entered politics, including his involvement with a bank that worked with illegal immigrants, a harassment claim against him by a 20-year-old intern while he worked at city hall, and his time working for an ambulance company that was being investigated for fraud.

""The people of Arizona know me and they trust me and I love the people of the state, Lake said. ""I want to represent all of them, including people who maybe don't even vote for me. If you choose not to vote for me, I hope I can earn your vote, but I still want to represent you and I want to do a great job for you in Washington, D.C. We need decent, honest people back to D.C. and Ruben Gallego was not honest before he got into politics.""

He has also been outspokenly critical of the Biden administration for allegedly appeasing Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei after Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel last October, particularly through avenues such as the return to the Iran nuclear deal and readiness to pump billions of dollars into Iran's cash-starved economy.

On a similar note, Bartiromo implied the upcoming election may have a significant foreign policy implication in the region.

To that end, Pahlavi replied, ""I'm not isolating Washington only, I'm talking about Europe as well. If you are focused yet again on whether or not we can appease this regime and cut a deal with them and negotiate with them and, in a way, expect a behavior change from this regime, that simply means that we have yet to understand the DNA and nature of the system, as opposed to, saying our best allies are the people of Iran.""

Democratic strategist James Carville said Saturday that the presidential contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump was a ""long way from decided.""

Carville joined CNN's Michael Smerconish, who pressed the Democratic strategist on why Harris wasn't ahead if the economy was doing well, referencing Carville's famed phrase, ""it's the economy, stupid.""

""You know, she's slightly ahead, and it's not the election. These things tend to break one way or the other at the end. There are seven swing states. The least likely result is they break 4-3. But I can't stop the commentariat from saying it's going to be neck-and-neck, and it's going to come down to this. I think it will break at the end. I think someone will carry swing states 5-2 or 6-1. Whoever does that will do well in the House and do well in the Senate. But this thing is a long way from decided,"" Carville responded.

Former Trump campaign adviser David Urban also joined Carville and Smerconish and said that the race is going to be tight, specifically in Pennsylvania.

He cited the state's electorate and said that he's heard from a lot of voters who think Harris hasn't made her pitch in Pennsylvania yet.

Kurdish official warns US: 'now is not the time' to pull forces out of Iraq',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kurdish-special-representative-talks-about-us-plan-withdraw-from-iraq,2024-10-06T08:21:49Z,"National security analyst Rebecca Grant joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the attack on the U.S. airbase in Iraq and why she believes Biden is nearing war with Iran as tensions escalate.

As the U.S. mulls over a plan to withdraw troops from Iraq, its Kurdish allies have a message: Don't forget us.

""This is not the time to reduce coalition forces in Iraq,"" Treefa Aziz, the Kurdistan Regional Government's special representative to the U.S., told Fox News Digital.

""Extremist groups like ISIS and armed militias continue to pose a serious threat to the people of Iraq and the Kurdistan Region.""

The U.S. announced plans to shrink the U.S. ""footprint"" in Iraq and end the current mission of coalition forces - including the Kurds - to fight ISIS, but declined to say how many of the 2,500 troops currently stationed there would remain.

""A decade ago, Kurdish Peshmerga forces worked alongside U.S. troops to defeat ISIS and continue to actively combat ISIS remnants to prevent a resurgence of terror today,"" Aziz said. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) ""has been a reliable security partner for the United States and remains ready to enhance cooperation.""

But now, if Baghdad is pushing the U.S. out of Iraq, the U.S. could feel it must honor that request or risk making another enemy in the Middle East. The KRG says it would be ""willing and able"" to host U.S. coalition forces in its territory.

The current mission is now set to end by September 2025, with a plan to keep the number of forces on the Iraqi side to back up the 900 U.S. troops in Syria until at least 2026.

News of a plan that could amount to a significant drawdown of U.S. forces called to mind 2019, when former President Donald Trump announced plans to pull out of Syria and the Kurds felt abandoned by a partner they had fought alongside for years - leaving them open to an attack by Turkish forces.

PENTAGON PLANS TO SHRINK US 'FOOTPRINT' IN IRAQ

Trump, at the time, left the Kurds with a warning to their longtime enemies: ""I have told Turkey that if they do anything outside of what we would think is humane . . . they could suffer the wrath of an extremely decimated economy.""

The U.S. relationship with the Kurds - an indigenous group of daring fighters whose quest for their own formal state has been unsuccessful - spans back decades.

When the Turks denied the U.S. passage into Iraq for the invasion in 2003, Iraqi Kurds helped the U.S. overthrow Saddam Hussein.

The Kurds have fought with U.S. coalition forces since they reentered Iraq in 2014 to fight ISIS, and the U.S. pledged arms support and humanitarian aid.

The group faces attacks from terror groups on all sides. And as Iran increasingly encroaches on the Iraqi government, Baghdad has the KRG in a choke-hold, officials say.

US, IRAQ TEAM UP TO KILL 15 ISIS OPERATIVES

""There is growing concern regarding efforts to weaken the federal system in Iraq. The constitutional framework, which is designed to ensure shared governance, is disregarded,"" one Kurdish official said.

""The continued suspension of oil exports from the Kurdistan region has placed significant economic strain. More than a year and half later, we have yet to see the resumption of these exports.""

The KRG has been trying to work with the Iraqis on a power-sharing agreement with no real results.

""Some of these actions appear to align with external influences rather than the broader national interest,"" the official said, referring to Iranian influence. ""With the assistance of our allies, we believe these issues can be resolvable through constructive dialogue and cooperation.""

The KRG is also asking the U.S. government to ""honor its commitment"" included in the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to ""provide the KRG with a comprehensive air defense system.

The law required the Department of Defense to submit and implement a plan for providing the Iraqi security forces and Kurdistan Region with air defenses by July 2024.

""As a steadfast U.S. ally that is regularly targeted by extremist violence, the KRG requires assurances that it will be protected from all threats, both internal and external,"" said Aziz.

Gen. Michael Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, told the House Armed Services Committee in March that ISIS-K, which launched a horrific attack in Moscow earlier this year, ""retains the capability and the will to attack U.S. and Western interests abroad in as little as six months with little to no warning."""
"Latinos shifting to Trump because they have 'internalized racism,' journalist claims",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/latinos-shifting-trump-because-have-internalized-racism-journalist-claims,2024-10-05T21:09:19Z,"Paolo Ramos argues in her new book that Latinos are shifting toward former President Trump because of internalized racism stemming from colonization.

Journalist and MSNBC contributor Paola Ramos, daughter of Jorge Ramos, blamed ""internalized racism"" for why Latinos are leaving the Democratic Party and supporting former President Trump.

Ramos appeared on PBS' ""Amanpour & Company"" this week to address the trend covered in her new book, ""Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means.""

Trump appears to be outperforming his 2020 support among Latinos who prefer the Republican over Vice President Kamala Harris on handling the economy and immigration.

The Democratic Party's advantage with these voters is shrinking, according to NBC News, whose poll last week found the Democrats' edge is at its lowest level in the past four presidential election cycles.

MSNBC GUEST CLAIMS LATINOS 'WANT TO BE WHITE' WHILE DISCUSSING THEIR SHIFT TOWARD GOP

In discussions with Trump-supporting Latinos for her book, Ramos said she found that ""tribalism, traditionalism, and political trauma"" were the three driving forces behind this growing trend.

""Really understanding the sort of racial baggage that I believe a lot of Latinos, including myself, and a lot of us are carrying from Latin America. What it means to sort of been colonized for so many years, the weight of colonization, that, in of itself, I believe, creates a lot of internalized racism, a lot of colorism, that then manifests in American politics in so many ways,"" Ramos began.

""And that's then how you can explain the fact that even someone like Donald Trump feels so comfortable going to the Bronx, talking to a group of Black Latinos, and Latino Trump supporters, because he believes that he can sort of tap into a racial and ethnic grievance that is very familiar,"" she continued.

Ramos told USA Today that traditionalism and trauma also play into the trend.

""There's traditionalism which is just breaking down what centuries of colonization have done to us and has led us to be so fixated on certain gender norms and sexual norms and then also leads us to this slippery slope of admiring things like Christian nationalism and then the trauma of this sort of admiration and a lot of Latinos flirting with the strongman rule and where that comes from,"" she said.

""And what I said to you when we asked a question was, Latinos want to be White. They want to be with the cool kids,"" she said.

Hinojosa went on to say that those voters could cost Harris the election.

""But those numbers? They could cost Kamala Harris the election. Everything that I've been saying that Latinos could push her over the top, these are the numbers that could also take her down,"" she said.

Vice President Kamala Harris currently has a 12-point lead among registered Hispanic voters, according to the latest Fox News poll.

Kamala Harris' support with Arab and Muslim communities in Michigan is 'tenuous': Democratic strategist,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-support-arab-muslim-communities-michigan-tenuous-democratic-strategist,2024-10-05T16:59:38Z,"Political commentator Ameshia Cross warned that Vice President Harris is facing warning signs among Arab and Muslim communities, especially in Michigan.

Political commentator and Democratic strategist Ameshia Cross warned that Vice President Harris is facing warning signs among Arab and Muslim communities, especially in key battleground states like Michigan.

""It's very tenuous at this point,"" Cross said of Harris' support among the Arab community on CNN Friday. ""I think that what we saw over the summer and prior to that with the campus uprisings across the country, we heard from young people who are very concerned, but also saw that certain college presidents lost their jobs and we've seen the community over and over again, specifically the uncommitted vote, call out where President Biden as well as Vice President Harris are on this issue.""

Some Harris allies have also signaled concern at Harris' support in Michigan, with Democratic Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin telling donors that Harris is ""underwater"" with voters in Michigan, per audio obtained by Axios.

""I think that at this point there has to be especially a concern in Michigan because you have such a large population of Arab voters,"" she said.

""But in addition to that, we've seen this really affect younger voters and their preferences as well,"" Cross continued, also advising Harris that she should ""take a very clear stance on what will happen, how the U.S. will continue to move forward, are we in support of watching thousands of innocent Palestinians continue to die in this war?""

Some recent polls also indicate that former President Donald Trump may be closing in on Harris in the key battleground states of both Michigan and neighboring Wisconsin. Harris received 48% of support among likely Michigan voters in a New York Times/Siena College poll this week, while Trump garnered 47% support in the poll -- effectively locking the pair in a tie well within the poll's margin of error.

'Panic buying begins': TikTok users show port strike fears sparked toilet paper and grocery rush,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/port-strikes-prompt-panic-buying-across-us-social-media-trends-show,2024-10-05T11:11:42Z,"Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg said Thursday that the dockworkers' strikes could have a real impact on the U.S. economy the longer they go on and said the issue needed to be resolved.

U.S. port strikes prompted panic buying of food and other goods nationwide this week, according to social media trends.

Unionized dockworkers from the International Longshoremen's Association went on strike to fight for higher pay after their contract with the U.S. Maritime Alliance expired Monday night.

The strike, which has been halted after workers reached a tentative agreement on a 62% wage increase, blocked some containers of food and other goods from entering the country, causing some Americans to take to TikTok to document their shopping experiences.

""Panic buying begins in Virginia amid the port shutdown,"" said TikTok user @nicolewilliams559 who filmed the long line at her local grocery store. ""BJ's Wholesale almost out of toilet paper and water as of 10 a.m.""

BALTIMORE RESTAURANT OWNER SAYS PORT STRIKE IS ALREADY IMPACTING BUSINESS: 'IT REALLY HURTS'

""Don't panic because the ports are closed,"" she told her followers, ""because guess what people have done here? All the toilet paper is gone and the paper towels, again. Do you know why? People are panicking. Guess what? It's made in the United States. You're going to get it. There is shipping in the United States within our country.""

Kailee, a mother on TikTok, took to the platform to share her experience of going to multiple stores to find the correct formula for her baby.

""I didn't think anything of the port strike,"" she said. ""I knew we were going to be affected, but not to this level.""

Another mother on TikTok said parents like her are crying because there is not enough formula for their children due to the stockpiling.

""Moms, I understand you are stressing out about this formula shortage, but you need to be considerate of others,"" TikTok user @dpags1234 pleaded. ""Us moms should be supporting other moms. I'm seeing moms buy 20 plus cans of formula when stores are now putting limits on formula purchases, which they should. You buying 20 plus cans is leaving us moms with nothing.""

Other users documented their trips to the grocery store to stock up in fears of potential food shortages.

Fox News Digital connected with Mahoney Asset Management President Ken Mahoney who explained the panic buying phenomenon.

""There almost seems to be a phenomenon at grocery stores that shelves stay full, even if those things are not going to be bought, so people do not panic and begin to think there is a shortage,"" he explained.

""In this case, those shelves may not actually be full because there is a shortage and that can lead people to thinking only for themselves and hoarding a ton of products (that they may not even need) just in case,"" he continued. ""Once there is an idea in people's head, there is scarcity, or there is going to be, that is when irrational behavior may start like buying all the bananas at the grocery store for example.""

While many were so worried, CEO and co-founder of Oxygen Financial Ted Jenkin told Fox News Digital that Americans didn't need to hit the panic button just yet.

""For everyday items, Americans don't need to hit the panic button day one,"" he explained, ""However, if the strike last(ed) a couple of weeks or stretch(ed) out for a period of 30 days, people could see a major spike in the prices of seafood, alcohol, and bananas. Cell phones, computers, and auto parts (would) also be at risk for supply as well.""

Jenkin explained that most holiday goods have already been shipped from overseas as some retailers ""stocked up anticipating that this strike was possible.""

""Some companies have already shifted their container shipments to West Coast ports, which shouldn't hurt the holiday supply chain, but consumers could see slightly higher prices due to the increased shipping costs,"" he said."
"Texas residents express frustration with the economy, trust Trump more than Harris",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/texas-residents-express-frustration-economy-trust-trump-more-than-harris,2024-10-05T09:05:44Z,"Residents in Houston, Texas revealed their preferred candidate to boost the economy in conversations with Fox News Digital.

Fox News Digital spoke with residents just south of Houston, Texas this week about the economy and who they trust more between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to boost the economy as president.

After shopping at Costco, local residents expressed frustration with current overall costs and the economy as a whole, both on and off camera.

""All the prices have gone up,"" Melissa told Fox News Digital.

""No, it's not doing well at all,"" said another resident, originally from Egypt.

Ralph said the economy has resulted in increased costs for his family, stating, ""I think inflation is out of control. Housing and interest rates are out of control. Grocery trips have doubled. And a good grocery trip used to be like 150-125. Now an average grocery trip is now 250-300.""

Locals also shared who they feel will best handle the economy as president.

""When Trump was in office, you know, things were doing well,"" said Mark.

Ralph said he ""definitely"" trusts Trump more to tackle the economy.

""I don't think Kamala even knows what's going on. I think she's a puppet,"" he said. ""He's got a proven track record, hoping he gets back in and rescuing this Harris economy.""

Another resident also said she trusts the former president more: ""Trump, because he's the only businessman that's capable of running our country.""

Mark cited Trump's time in office compared to the current Biden-Harris administration as a reason for trusting the former president.

""Trump because of what he did the last time, who was in office and what the current administration, what's happened with the current administration over the past four years,"" he said. ""If it's not broke, don't fix it. You know, they tried to fix it. So here we are today.""

No Republican presidential candidate has lost Texas since 1976, but the state has become increasingly competitive in recent elections. Trump won it by less than six points in 2020, a sharp contrast from just 12 years ago when Mitt Romney carried the state by nearly 16.

The economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in the presidential election.

A September Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

While the nation's economic recovery from the pandemic continues, inflation remains a leading concern among Americans.

The former president's up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, and favored by 7 points in an ABC News Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only 5 points in the Fox News poll, and just 2 points in the AP/NORC survey.

Harris has touted what she calls the ""opportunity economy"" and said her administration will crack down on price gouging and also lower taxes for middle-class Americans. Trump has pointed to economic performance under his administration as successful and that a return to office would bring back those days.

The Harris ticket was buoyed on Friday by a strong September jobs report. Also, striking U.S. dockworkers returned to work Friday after reaching a tentative agreement with employers on an improved wage offer."

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 76 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Trump has held six news conferences where he took questions from the media since the beginning of August, including another on Friday after meeting with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp about hurricane relief efforts.

President Biden also held a news conference in the White House press briefing room on Friday, where he joked about getting back into the 2024 race.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey last month at a star-studded campaign event. This week she taped an interview on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

"Trump can win on these 3 key issues, Michigan voters tell Fox",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-can-win-three-key-issues-michigan-voters-tell-fox,2024-10-04T17:40:00Z,"Trump supporters in Saginaw, Michigan, told Fox News Digital the top issues Trump should hit as he seeks to win the critical swing state.

Michigan voters attending former President Donald Trump's Saginaw rally Thursday told Fox News Digital that the former president needs to focus on the economy to win the critical swing state, particularly job creation and curbing inflation.

""Opening up the pipelines to get the jobs back,"" one voter who attended Trump's rally on the campus of Saginaw Valley State University said when asked which issue the former president needs to focus on to win Michigan.

The comments come as Trump made yet another visit to the crucial swing state of Michigan, a state that could play a decisive role in determining who wins November's election. It also marked the second time the former president visited mid-Michigan in just a few weeks, a blue collar area of the state where the campaign believes it can make inroads with voters in what promises to be a close race.

TRUMP'S 2ND TERM FOREIGN POLICY LIKELY TO FOCUS ON 'STRENGTH' AND 'DETERRENCE': EXPERT

Vice President Kamala Harris is set to visit the same area of the state Friday, signifying the importance of Michigan as the clock nears the end of a dramatic election season.

Polls show Michigan as a toss up as of Wednesday, with the Real Clear Politics Polling average giving Harris a thin lead of just 0.7 points in the state. However, polls also showed Trump trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Biden in Michigan by 5.3 and 5.7 points respectively, numbers that turned out much more favorable to Trump on election day.

Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016 before dropping it to Biden in another close race in 2020, but voters in mid-Michigan believe Trump's focus on the economy should help put him over the top in 2024.

""Bring inflation down and safety and security in the state of Michigan,"" one voter told Fox News Digital.

""Illegal border crossings and the economy,"" another voter said. ""Keeping jobs in America, lowering inflation.""

However, other voters signaled that Trump could win on a range of issues, including national security and reducing crime in inner cities.

""Our national security does come first. But if the people at home, if they can't make ends meet, they're living in misery, that's just as important,"" a voter told Fox News Digital. ""Being truthful to the American people, which he has been.""

""Focusing on the inner cities. Putting together ways to decrease the violence,"" another voter said.

Meanwhile, one voter who said she was at the rally to support Trump said that the former president could lead the charge in helping Michigan residents see the issue of abortion differently.

""I'd like to ask everybody to pitch in and help save Harry and the Natives. It's a special restaurant, a very special place. People love it. It's been around a long time. Like a really long time. But it's fallen prey to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden's economy,"" Trump told owner Harry MacArthur in a pre-recorded message Friday on ""Fox & Friends.""

""We have to keep the good ones open, especially when it comes to Florida. Florida is a very, very special place, and that's a very, very great restaurant. So Harry and the Natives, keep it going. We love it. And you're going to be around for a long time.""

'ECONOMY WAY BETTER UNDER TRUMP': BLACK VOTERS SHARE IF THEY WERE BETTER OFF 4 YEARS AGO

Co-host Steve Doocy hosted Friday's show from the packed restaurant in Hobe Sound after MacArthur wrote on Facebook he would have to shut down unless something changed by October 12.

The community, however, rallied behind MacArthur by supporting a GoFundMe set up by his son, Wyatt.

MacArthur called the response from Trump and the community ""overwhelming.""

""Turns out everybody cares,"" he said.

The restaurant has been in MacArthur's family for 72 years. Although the business was originally run by his parents, MacArthur reopened the business as Harry and the Natives after his father died in the 1980s.

MacArthur's business was close to bankruptcy in 2021, but after a ""Breakfast with Friends"" segment, the business was able to hold on. But the financial struggle was not over.

Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick squared off in their first debate Thursday evening, less than five weeks ahead of what is expected to be one of the most closely watched races this election cycle.

Casey and McCormick took the debate stage Thursday at 8 p.m. in Harrisburg, where the two traded barbs over issues such as the economy and inflation, immigration, abortion. The race, which is rated as ""leans Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report, is expected to be one of the tightest Senate races across the country, with Casey himself acknowledging earlier this year that it will be a ""close, tough race.""

Casey has long been a Pennsylvania Democratic stalwart, first winning his election to the U.S. Senate in 2007. The Casey name also has deep roots in the state, with Bob Casey Sr., the senator's father, serving as the Keystone State's governor from 1987 to 1995, following years of serving in various other elected roles.

McCormick is an Army combat veteran and former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, who served as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security as well as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under former President George W. Bush's administration. Former President Donald Trump endorsed McCormick in April, lauding him as a ""a good man"" who ""wants to run a good ship.""

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY

The Senate race comes as the federal election spotlights Pennsylvania once again as a key battleground state that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential election. Former President Donald Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while President Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.

As the pair squared off for the first of two debates ahead of Nov. 5, Fox News Digital compiled the top five moments of Thursday's event.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

Casey and McCormick both weighed in on the federal election, including Casey lauding Harris following his staunch support of Biden before the president ultimately dropped out of the 2024 race as concerns about his mental acuity and age mounted over the summer.

""From your perspective, who is the better candidate for Pennsylvania? Biden or Harris?"" moderator and ABC27 anchor Dennis Owens asked Casey.

""I think Vice President Harris, who's running a strong campaign, I think she'll carry Pennsylvania. It's going to be very close, just like the Senate race will be close. But she's running a strong campaign. But the people of our state have to make two basic decisions - in addition to other statewide races. They have decided in the presidential race, and they have to decide our race, and this race is very clear,"" Casey responded.

When asked whether he believes Biden or Harris would be a better president for Pennsylvania voters, Casey brushed off delivering a direct answer.

""Oh, I don't know, Dennis. I mean, we'll never know the answer to that, but the voters are gonna make a decision,"" he said.

McCormick, on the other hand, was asked if he could offer one example where he does not agree with Trump after slamming Casey during the debate for overwhelmingly voting with Biden over the last three and a half years.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

""[Trump] recently said that he wanted to get rid of the ban on SALT taxes, which Sen. Casey supported, too"" McCormick responded. ""Listen, that's a that's a tax break for millionaires in New York and California at the expense of PA taxpayers. So I wouldn't support that.""

""But listen, Senator Casey stood next to Joe Biden when he could hardly finish a sentence. We saw this on the debate stage, he said 'he's ready to go,'"" McCormick continued, referring to Casey's support of Biden remaining in the presidential race until Biden ultimately dropped out. ""Then Sen. Casey said, 'Kamala Harris is great. You're going to love her when you get to know her.' This is a woman who, in the last few years, says she wanted to ban fracking, legalize illegal immigration, give them federal benefits, take away our guns, defund the police. This is her position, so she's flip-flopped on everything, and Bob Casey standing there by her.""

Both candidates accused the other of ""lies"" throughout the debate, including McCormick touting a new website called CaseyLies.com, and Casey accusing McCormick of misrepresenting himself as a Pennsylvanian.

""For your viewers tonight, I have a website that's been established today, it's just been launched, CaseyLies.com. You can go and see the actual facts by third-party sources of all the things he's saying. There will be lies throughout. But you should ask yourself, 'Why is a senator with an 18-year track record, who should be able to run on his record, running his entire campaign with a negative set of attacks on me, most of them lies?'"" McCormick said towards the start of the debate.

McCormick claimed that Casey often launched ""lies"" at him during the debate because he ""doesn't have a track record"" in the Senate to run on.

Casey shot back during the debate that McCormick has misrepresented himself as a full-fledged Pennsylvanian.

""We've heard a couple of times tonight about telling lies, but probably the biggest lie told in this whole election, that probably most Pennsylvanians have never heard a bigger lie, was the lie when my opponent said he lived in Pennsylvania, when he was living in Connecticut. The Associated Press on August the 14th, 2023, did a story that proved that he was living in Connecticut,"" Casey said.

McCormick defended that he was born in Pennsylvania and has spent ""the majority of my life"" there, but also lived in Connecticut for years when he served as CEO of Bridgewater Associates.

PENNSYLVANIA SURVEY FINDS HARRIS LEADING TRUMP NARROWLY, IDENTIFIES HER 'BIGGEST WEAKNESS,' POLLSTER SAYS

The economy is among the top concerns for voters in Pennsylvania, as well as the nation at large, with both candidates outlining how they would tackle spiraling inflation if re-elected or elected to the Senate, and what they believe is behind the rise in consumers' costs.

""Prices are too high, especially when you go to the grocery store to buy food or household items, items that people need every week, or at least every other week. And these big conglomerates, these big corporations, rig those prices and jack them up to levels we've never seen, all while they're getting record profits,"" Casey said, while defending his efforts targeting corporations he has accused of ""greedflation.""

So-called greedflation is understood as corporations allegedly exploiting inflation woes by increasing prices on consumers to produce greater profits.

""We can take it on by passing a price gouging bill to go after those companies, hold them accountable,"" Casey said.

The Democratic senator also addressed his campaign against ""shrinkflation,"" which he explained as corporations shrinking products for consumers while not lowering prices.

""We did a report on shrinkflation, which covered a lot of companies around the country. And if that's happening with regard to a Pennsylvania company or any other company around the country, they should be held accountable. When they take a product, shrink the contents of the product, or what's in a bag, and don't shrink the price, that's deceptive. That's ripping people off,"" he said, adding that such companies should be held legally accountable.

McCormick shot back that higher costs on Americans in recent years is due to ""out of control spending"" at the hands of Casey and other Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and President Biden.

""When you've spent your entire life in public service, elected office, 30 years, you're like a hammer looking for a nail. The cause of inflation is the policies, the out-of-control spending of Biden, Harris and Casey. Bob Casey voted 100% of the time for that $5 trillion of new spending. The experts at the time, Larry Summers, the San Francisco Fed, said this would create inflation,"" McCormick said.

""Bob Casey doesn't understand how the economy works. That's why he's trying to do all this economic voodoo stuff with price controls,"" he later charged.

Casey and McCormick were both grilled about their current abortion stances during the debate, as abortion once again sits atop many voters' list of election concerns following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Casey positioned himself as a pro-life Democrat earlier in his career, but he voted to codify abortion protections nationwide following the overturning of Roe.

""In 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned a 49-year right, it overturned Roe v. Wade, I think everyone had to make a decision, including senators. I made a decision to support the Women's Health Protection Act. I don't support Republican efforts to ban abortion across the country,"" Casey said.

BATTLEGROUND STATE DEM DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM DEFUND MOVEMENT, BUT POLITICAL RECORD SHOWS DIFFERENT STORY

McCormick was questioned about his remarks in 2022 that he supports rare exceptions for abortion, such as when the health of the mother is at risk, and has since said that he supports additional exceptions for abortion.

""This is an extremely polarizing issue. As you know, I have six daughters, so this is something we spend time talking about. I believe this should be a state's right. I believe states should decide. Pennsylvania has had a law. It's been supported by Democrats and Republicans, like was signed into law by the Senator's father, Governor Casey. I support the three exceptions. I would not favor an abortion ban of any kind,"" McCormick responded.

Casey recently came under fire from a Pennsylvania sheriff who slammed the Democratic senator's border policies for the influx of fentanyl into the U.S., which the dad said had led to his son's death.

""We can't bring back the people we've lost. But we can get rid of the weak politicians like Bob Casey who let it happen,"" Blair County Sheriff Jim Ott said in a recent McCormick campaign ad.

Casey was asked about the sheriff's remarks during his debate Thursday.

""Mr. Casey, the Blair County Sheriff, blames you for the fentanyl death of his son, saying you have not done enough to secure the border. What is your response to that,"" Owens asked.

""I met so many families across the state, and whether it's a sheriff in Blair County or a mom in Allegheny County, Janet that I met, who talked about her daughter, Brianna, this is an awful, awful tragedy for those families. That's why we need to invest in the strategies that we know work. [McCormick] won't do that, because he's weak in the face of the political pressure from his own party. . . . We can solve this problem by investing in the technology, hiring thousands more Border Patrol, so we can inspect every single vehicle coming across the border,"" he said.

Amid the immigration debate, McCormick blamed the Biden-Harris administration and Casey for the immigration crisis at the southern border.

""The border crisis is the direct result of the weakness of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Bob Casey supported them every second. What chutzpah to run an ad on how tough he is on the border, when he voted against funding for the Border Patrol. He ran an ad in front of the wall that he voted against. He voted for sanctuary cities, he voted for federal benefits for illegal immigrants. And the fentanyl crisis that's come across our border is the direct result of the weakness of Bob Casey not standing up to these terrible cartels,"" McCormick argued.

The pair have agreed to another debate, next taking the same stage in Philadelphia on Oct. 15."

The panel will ""offer a warning about the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy and the rule of law,"" a source connected to the event recently told CNN.

WORKING CLASS WILL COME HOME TO HARRIS, RALLYGOERS IN POSTINDUSTRIAL PENNSYLVANIANS SAY

The aim of the chat is to convince voters of ""the need for independents, moderates, and Republicans to stop him from getting back in office,"" the source added.

The women-led program will be hosted by liberal super-PAC Democracy First in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania on Oct. 9, and is reportedly the first of many that will feature the four women speaking to voters in multiple battleground states.

Cheney, Hutchison, and Matthews have endorsed Harris for president. Griffin has not, though the media personality is a staunch critic of Trump on ""The View"" and in her role as a CNN political commentator.

The event comes as Trump and Harris are neck and neck in battleground states, with the race being especially close in Pennsylvania.

'ABUSE OF POWER': HOUSE GOP OPENS PROBE INTO UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

Recent Fox News polling in Pennsylvania finds Harris only two points ahead of Trump among registered voters in the state, while they are tied at 49% among likely voters.

""Pennsylvania is not breaking open and shouldn't be expected to,"" says Democratic Pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News surveys alongside Republican Daron Shaw. ""Both candidates have a little way to go to consolidate their bases and whoever does a better job there could determine who wins the state.""

According to the survey, the economy is the top issue for Pennsylvanians, with 71% of voters having a negative view of it. Trump has a six-point advantage over Harris on the issue, while she is viewed far more favorably on abortion.

Port strike longshoremen union boss linked to murdered mobster in 'farce' racketeering case he beat at trial,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/port-strike-longshoremen-union-boss-linked-murdered-mobster-farce-racketeering-case-he-beat-at-trial,2024-10-04T13:40:45Z,"FOX Business' Cheryl Casone previews the September jobs report, break downs the tentative agreement with the International Longshoremen's Association and discusses the hold on Biden's student loan forgiveness plan.

Harold Daggett, the president of the International Longshoremen's Association, which went on a brief strike this week in a labor dispute that could have created a shipping crisis across the U.S., was once cleared of federal racketeering charges in connection with alleged mafia ties to the same union.

Daggett's attorney, his cousin George Daggett, said the 2005 charges were politically motivated and based on weak evidence.

""This trial was a farce,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""People say to me, 'You did a great job.' And I tell them a law school student could've won that case. It was actually generated by the Waterfront Commission in New York, and they hated the union.""

The Justice Department failed to convict - but the case had deadly results. One of the co-defendants, a reputed Genovese family captain named Larry Ricci, disappeared mid-trial and was later found dead in the trunk of a car outside the Huck Finn Diner in Union, New Jersey, 20 miles west of New York City.

DOCKWORKERS' UNION REACHES TENTATIVE AGREEMENT, WILL SUSPEND PORT STRIKE UNTIL JANUARY

""He's either been abducted -- that is unlikely because he'd be far too difficult a person to keep hostage -- or killed,"" Ricci's attorney Martin Schmukler told the court after he vanished mid-trial, The Associated Press reported at the time. He was later acquitted in absentia.

The commission, at the time a joint oversight operation between the states of New York and New Jersey, pressured federal prosecutors to bring charges it couldn't prove, George Daggett told Fox News Digital.

This trial was a farce. People say to me, 'You did a great job.' And I tell them a law school student could've won that case. It was actually generated by the Waterfront Commission in New York, and they hated the union.

-- George Daggett, cousin and lawyer of ILA President Harold Daggett

Harold Daggett denied the criminal accusations and said he was a victim of mob extortion. He testified that another mobster, George Barone, put a gun to his head and threatened to massacre his family.

MOBSTERS CHARGED IN INTERNATIONAL PLOT TO CONTROL NEW YORK GARBAGE TRUCK INDUSTRY

""I was so nervous, I urinated all over myself,"" he testified at the time, according to a New York Post report. In a separate deposition, he denied knowing Barone was a Genovese ""soldier,"" court documents show.

Prosecutors had alleged that Daggett had ties to the Genovese crime family as far back as 2000, and the union has long been accused of handing no-show jobs to mobsters' relatives and providing kickbacks.

In exchange for union contracts, the mob was supposed to protect the careers and salaries of corrupt ILA officials, prosecutors alleged.

UNION LEADER SLAMS 'MONEY CRAZY' SHIPPING COMPANIES FOR REFUSING TO 'SHARE' 'BILLIONS' EARNED DURING PANDEMIC

The Justice Department couldn't convince jurors that the defendants were guilty of a crime.

George Daggett, the attorney, said the case began after his cousin asked a Catholic priest for financial advice and had $18 million in union funds placed under the supervision of the same money manager who worked with Our Lady of the Lake Church in Sparta, New Jersey.

""So at the trial, every time a mobster's name was mentioned, the government had a big board, and they made a circle, [and] every time a mobster was mentioned, they put his picture up on this big board,"" he said. ""The government's case ended, and I took Father Cassidy's picture and I put it in the middle of all those mobsters. So that's the kind of trial it was.""

Although the case had to do with allegations of extortion and interference with commerce, prosecutors asked their first witness how many people he'd killed, Daggett said.

""You knew for the government it was all downhill after that,"" he said.

After Ricci's disappearance, his attorney continued to work on his behalf at trial and clear his name.

DESANTIS TAKES MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS AS 'UNACCEPTABLE' STRIKE THREATENS PRODUCT SUPPLY

""What happened was it was not a good fact-pattern for the government, but the Waterfront Commission was pushing so hard that the eastern district said OK,"" Daggett told Fox News Digital. ""Larry Ricci lost his life because, I guess, people thought that everybody was going to be guilty. There was no way [the verdict] could've been guilty.""

Another co-defendant, Albert Cernadas pleaded guilty, but jurors went on to find Daggett, Ricci and Arthur Coffey, another ILA executive, not guilty at trial.

No one has been charged with Riccis' death, although federal prosecutors said they overheard on wiretaps a New Jersey mobster discussing the retrieval of the murder weapon with his son. That man, Michael Coppola, was sent to prison in another RICO case, which involved ILA kickbacks, identity fraud and the 1977 murder of a man named John ""Johnny Cokes"" Lardiere.

Prosecutors have also hinted that Ricci's murder opened a path for other suspected mobsters to corruptly profit off of the ILA, according to court documents.

Harold Daggett became the union's president in 2011. He has been purported to drive a yacht and a luxe Bentley car, live in a sprawling mansion in Sparta, New Jersey, and brought home more than $900,000 in union pay last year - $728,000 for being union president, and another $173,000 for his past role in local 1804-1, which he left in 2011, FOX Business reported.

The ILA, which represents dock workers on the East and Gulf Coasts, went on strike this week in a dispute over what the union calls unfair pay against a backdrop of steep inflation, a rising minimum wage that has outpaced union raises, and the threat of losing human jobs to automation.

The union was demanding concessions from the U.S. Maritime Alliance, or USMX, before the sides reached a deal late Thursday.

The ILA, which represents 45,000 U.S. workers at ports along the East and Gulf Coasts, said the sides reached a provisional wage agreement that extends the current contract until Jan. 15, 2025.

""Things were rough back then [in 1977, when] we went on strike for 80 cents,"" Harold Daggett told FOX Business Tuesday. ""The companies only made like $5 to 10 million, but since COVID and before COVID 'til now, they're making billions and billions of dollars. It's a whole different story, but they don't want to share it. They'd rather see a fully automated terminal right here on the East Coast so they can make more money. They're money crazy.""

The strike could have crippled the U.S. supply chain and cost the country's economy more than $4. billion a day, according to one JPMorgan analysis."
Bruce Springsteen endorses Kamala Harris in new Instagram video: 'Vision of America',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/bruce-springsteen-endorses-kamala-harris-new-instagram-video-vision-america,2024-10-04T11:39:42Z,"Bruce Springsteen announced he would be voting for Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz in November for ""one of the most consequential elections in our nation's history.""

""Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually, and emotionally divided as it does then at this moment. It doesn't have to be this way,"" Springsteen said in an Instagram video Thursday. ""The common values, the shared stories that make us a great and united nation are waiting to be rediscovered and retold once again. Now that will take time, hard work, intelligence, faith and women and men with the national good, guiding their hearts.""

The ""Born in the USA"" singer attacked former President Trump as ""the most dangerous candidate for President in my lifetime"" with a ""disdain for the sanctity of our constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law, and the sanctity of the peaceful transfer of power.""

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, BARACK OBAMA LAUNCH PODCAST TOGETHER

""On the other hand, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are committed to a vision of this country that respects and includes everyone regardless of class, religion, race, your political point of view or sexual identity, and they want to grow our economy in a way that benefits all, not just the few like me on top. That's the vision of America I've been consistently writing about for 55 years now,"" Springsteen said.

Springsteen acknowledged ""everybody sees things different"" and that he respects other choices but stood by his.

""That's why come November 5th, I'll be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,"" he closed.

He joined several other singers such as Taylor Swift who have publicly supported Harris ahead of the November election.

Springsteen has been openly supportive of Democratic candidates in the past and frequently attacked Trump.

In 2020, he said, ""I believe that our current president is a threat to our democracy. He simply makes any kind of reform that much harder. I don't know if our democracy could stand another four years of his custodianship.""

Springsteen later provided a voiceover as well as his song ""My Hometown"" for a pro-Joe Biden ad.

""We are rudderless and joyless. We have lost the cultural aspects of society that make America great. We have lost our mojo, our fun, our happiness, our cheering on of others,"" Springsteen said in the 2020 ad. ""The shared experience of humanity that makes it all worth it. The challenges and the triumph that we shared and celebrated. The unique can-do spirit that America has always been known for. We are lost. We've lost so much in so short a time.

Disapproval mounts both at home and abroad as US avoids direct action against Houthi rebels,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/disapproval-mounts-home-abroad-us-avoids-direct-action-against-houthi-rebels,2024-10-04T08:09:52Z,"Fox News senior strategic analyst Ret. Gen. Jack Keane joins 'Fox Report' to discuss the escalating tensions in the Middle East amid fears of a wider war.

While much of the world has eyes on Israel's battles with Hezbollah and Hamas, the U.S. Navy has its sights set on another of Iran's proxies, the Yemeni Houthi rebels.

With a mission to keep international waterways at peace, the Navy now finds itself fending off attacks from the shadowy gang of pirates who have gone from arming themselves with assault rifles, pickup trucks and motorboats - to a seemingly unending supply of drones, missiles and other weaponry.

The Houthis often attack unarmed Western ships carrying goods through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden - while the U.S. has responded in kind with drone attacks on Yemen.

ISRAELI AIR FORCE STRIKES HOUTHI TARGETS IN YEMEN WITH 'EXTENSIVE' OPERATION

That's led to perilous waters along a trade route that typically sees some $1 trillion in goods pass through it, as well as shipments of aid to war-torn Sudan and the Yemeni people.

And as the attacks continue, some experts argue the U.S. response has not been strong enough to deter the Houthis from inflicting billions of dollars worth of damage to the global economy.

""The U.S. response has been ineffective,"" Can Kasapoglu, a Turkey-based Hudson Institute fellow who specializes in Middle East political-military affairs, told Fox News Digital.

""We have very limited intelligence about [the Houthis] and they are in a different part of the world, in a distant corner of the Middle East. But that corner also happens to be right next to a choke point on global trade... The Houthis are the most daring of the Iranian proxy network. And the U.S. has never gone into a preemptive phase where they target the Houthi leadership.""

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

The U.S. has responded to attacks with air and missile defense efforts, drone and missile interceptions - only engaging the Houthis once an attack is imminent, said Kasapoglu.

""We never saw a high-yield targeted killing campaign by the United States, for instance, Israel killed [Hezbollah leader] Hassan Nasrallah. Or just like Israel went after, for instance, the higher, high-level Iranian Revolutionary Guards generals, so this is what is missing - the U.S. acting against critical leadership.""

In addition to destroying goods destined for the West, the regular Houthi attacks drive up insurance costs: premiums for some shot up tenfold. They force some ships to travel the long way - down around the Horn of Africa, which can add $1 million in fuel costs for a round trip.

""They are launching relatively low-cost weapon systems, and inflicting major economic damage on the West on behalf of Iran. This is a very lucrative business,"" said Kasapoglu.

One argument for restraint could be the cost of action: Houthi drones are estimated to cost a few thousand dollars each. The Naval missiles the U.S. fires back at them can run around $2 million a shot.

Houthi attacks ramped up after Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel, targeting 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones over the past year.

They've seized one vessel and sunk two and killed a total of four sailors. A U.S.-led series of airstrikes in May killed at least 16 people, the rebels said.

BIDEN ADMIN NEEDS 'MORE AGGRESSIVE' PLAN TO TAKE ON HOUTHIS

On Tuesday, the rebel group claimed it shot down a multimillion-dollar, U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper drone flying near Yemen. The U.S. acknowledged losing one of the drones, which costs around $30 million apiece.

In January, the Iran-backed militias killed three U.S. service members and injured 40 others in an attack on a U.S. base in Jordan. The U.S. responded forcefully to that attack with a barrage of airstrikes on 85 targets across Iraq and Syria.

""That response proved to be effective, and I think that we could do more of that certainly - take that approach,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Schwartz, former security coordinator of the Israel-Palestinian Authority.

Since the Houthis seized the country's north and its capital of Sanaa in 2014, the U.S. military has seen Reapers shot down in Yemen in 2017, 2019, 2023 and 2024. The U.S. military acknowledged the Houthis shot down two MQ-9s in September.

The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel. In response, Israel Defense Forces launched aggressive retaliatory strikes in Yemen's key port city of Hodeida.

The rebels have maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel's campaign in Gaza against Hamas. But many of the ships they attack have little connection to the conflict - some were even bound for Iran.

BIDEN SAYS HE WOULD NOT BACK ISRAELI STRIKE ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR SITES

Last month, they attacked the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion, which was carrying 1 million barrels of oil in the Red Sea.

And last week, Houthi rebels fired half a dozen ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. All were intercepted by Navy destroyers, a U.S. official said Friday.

""This gets resolved when we finish our dealings with Iran, whatever that looks like in the long term,"" said Seth Krummrich, a retired Army colonel and former chief of staff at Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT).

Sources say the U.S. lacks a will to put boots on the ground to fight the Houthis. Central to the Biden administration's global strategy is a concern over escalating tensions that could lead to a full-scale confrontation with Iran - a nation that, by many estimates, is only weeks away from having the capability to build a nuclear bomb.

""The Israelis have the will to fight the Houthis, but they have limited capability, and they're also engaged with two wars going on right now, so it necessitates American intervention if the West really wants to stop them,"" said Kasapoglu.

US FORCES DESTROY HOUTHI WEAPONS

""Avoiding escalation is an obsession right now. It is a psychological case, not a political case. And it is imprisoning American military capabilities.""

Krummrich argued that the Pentagon ""has been staring at the Houthi problem long enough to understand that there is a limit to what you're going to be able to do without putting boots on the ground.""

""That would be like a giant sponge. It can absorb an endless amount of our resources,"" he said. ""But the Houthis are also smart. They launch and then retreat quickly... if they stay outside of our rules of engagement, they will be less likely to be struck.""

But others say there is more to be done that does not amount to ground forces.

""Yemen has proven time and time again that they're willing to absorb a lot of lethal activity from the U.S. and the coalition and still attack vessels, still attack Israel,"" said Schwartz.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

""There's this fear of escalation, doing something that's so provocative that we're going to have a broader war. Yemen is at war with the United States from their perspective, right? Just like Lebanese Hezbollah is at war and has been with Israel, and the same with Hamas prior to Oct. 7.""

""We overestimate our concern in terms of a broadening conflict, because at the end of the day, the Houthis in particular, they're not a viable military force,"" Schwartz went on.

""We could be much more aggressive in terms of our military response to the Houthis and find an overwhelming response that falls well short of getting the U.S. mired in some type of major conflict."""
"New poll reveals Trump has significant lead on immigration, border security in key battleground state",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-poll-reveals-trump-significant-lead-immigration-border-security-key-battleground-state,2024-10-04T08:09:41Z,"Economist Steve Moore comments on the border crisis and illegal immigration on 'Fox Report.'

Former President Donald Trump holds a firm lead in a key state over Vice President Kamala Harris on the question of how to handle immigration -- as the border crisis remains a top issue for voters.

A new poll released this week from Marquette Law School finds Harris leading Trump overall in Wisconsin by 52-48%.

But when it comes to immigration and border security, Trump dominates. Of voters, 49% favor Trump while just 37% favor Harris, with 8% saying they'd be about the same, and 6% saying neither are good on the issue.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

Trump holds a similar 12 point lead on handling the war between Israel-Hamas, while Harris has an 11 point gap on handling Medicare & Social Security and a 17 point lead on abortion.

Of the issues polled, immigration was near the top of the issues, with 15% of voters saying it was their most important issue, the same number who said abortion, and only behind the economy -- which was top issue for 37% of voters.

The poll is the latest indicator that Harris still has a fair way to go in convincing some voters that she is the better candidate on a topic that has dominated the headlines and remains a top issue for voters. Wisconsin, along with states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona could be election deciders in the election on Nov 5.

Harris was put in charge of handling root causes of migration to the southern border in early 2021 as border numbers began to skyrocket. She was eventually dubbed the ""border czar"" by media outlets and critics -- although the White House rejected that title.

HARRIS SHIFTS KEY POSITIONS ON BORDER, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AS CAMPAIGN PROMISES 'PRAGMATIC' APPROACH

Republicans have hammered Harris on the border, saying it was the rolling back of Trump-era policies that led to the record numbers at the border. They have also pointed to her embrace of left-wing positions in her 2019 presidential bid. Since then, her campaign says her views have been shaped by the current administration, including on decriminalizing illegal crossings and closing immigration detention centers.

""Harris can never be forgiven for her erasing our border, and she must never be allowed to become president of the United States,"" Trump said in Wisconsin on Sunday.

Harris has sought to present herself as better situated to handle the border. Her campaign has noted a recent drop in border encounters since President Biden signed a presidential proclamation in June limiting asylum entries. She has also thrown her support behind a bipartisan border security bill that would place similar limits on asylum and provide additional funding and detention beds.

Conservatives said that the bill would enshrine high border numbers, but Harris accused Trump of blocking the bill for political purposes. She did so again on a trip to the southern border in Arizona last week.

""He picked up the phone and calls some friends in Congress and said, stop the bill. Because, you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem,"" she said. ""And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games."""
Harris claims ad quoting her 2019 vow to ban fracking is 'mischaracterization' to make people 'afraid' of her,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-claims-ad-quoting-her-2019-vow-ban-fracking-mischaracterization-make-people-afraid-her,2024-10-03T23:33:00Z,"The 'Fox & Friends Weekend' hosts react to a resurfaced video of Kamala Harris saying she would 'put an end to fracking once and for all.'

Vice President Kamala Harris argued this week that an ad showing a clip of her past rhetoric about fracking is misleading and ""intended to make people afraid of my presidency.""

CBS Pittsburgh's Jon Delano spoke with Harris in an interview on Tuesday, challenging her to clarify her evolving stance on fracking, one of many key issues where she has been accused of flip-flopping for political gain.

""I wanted to ask you, there's a political ad on TV from a 2019 climate hall town meeting that you had, in which you basically said, quote, 'There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,' unquote,"" the interviewer said. ""The ad claims that if you are elected president you will ban fracking and you will cost Pennsylvania over 300,000 jobs. Have you changed your view on fracking, and if so, why?""

HARRIS DODGING FLIP-FLOP ATTACKS AS FACELESS SURROGATES FLIP KEY POSITIONS: 'PLAYING POLITICS'

""So let me start by saying that that ad, as you described it, is absolutely a mischaracterization, that I think is intended to make people afraid of my presidency,"" Harris said.

""Let me be absolutely clear, as I've been when I said it back in 2020, I will not ban fracking. I did not as vice president. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to open up more fracking leases,"" she added, referencing her role as vice president in getting the so-called Inflation Reduction Act through the deadlocked Senate.

In 2020, Harris was asked about fracking during her vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence, but did not reveal a reversal of her stated 2019 opposition to fracking, instead simply saying that Biden would not ban fracking as president.

""Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that,"" Harris said.

""I will repeat and the American people know that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact,"" she added during another portion of the debate.

CNN FACT CHECKER HITS KAMALA HARRIS FOR CLAIMING SHE 'MADE CLEAR' IN 2020 SHE WOULDN'T BAN FRACKING

On Tuesday, Harris said, ""My perspective on this is grounded in a number of things, including that we don't have to ban fracking to do the work that we can do to also invest in a clean energy economy.""

She then made multiple promises to American voters.

""I'm going to bring jobs back to rural communities. I'm going to make sure that we invest in those communities that have done the kind of work that you have in mind when you talk about Pittsburgh, when you talk about the greater aspect of Pennsylvania,"" she pledged. ""And I'm going to keep doing that work.""

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., tells ""One Nation"" that security failures regarding former President Trump are a ""scandal of the highest order.""

More than 400 national security and foreign policy officials, ex-Cabinet members, retired military officers and Gold Star families endorsed former President Trump on Thursday.

In an open letter organized by former National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien and former NSC Chief of Staff Alex Gray, the signatories condemn the ""repeated failures"" of the Biden-Harris administration's foreign policy and urged Americans to re-elect Trump.

""From a world at peace under President Trump, we are closer to a third world war than ever before under the Biden-Harris Administration,"" the letter states. ""With multiple escalating wars around the world, an open border that allows terrorists to flood into the American homeland, and malign actors like China operating unabated, U.S. national security has been profoundly damaged by the failed policies of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.""

The endorsement was signed by several prominent officials from the Trump administration, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Attorney General Bill Barr, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and former 2024 Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, and many more.

Eleven family members of the 13 American troops killed at Abbey Gate at Kabul's airport during the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan also signed the letter, which praised Trump's foreign policy record in contrast to Biden's controversial actions.

""When President Trump took office, the war in Afghanistan had dragged on for almost 16 years. By February 2020, a peace agreement was reached, ensuring no American soldier was killed in combat until the end of the Trump Administration. This agreement held strong because the Taliban understood President Trump's resolve and U.S. forces were prepared to ensure their compliance,"" the letter reads.

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

""The botched withdrawal from Afghanistan under the Biden-Harris Administration in 2021, led to the unnecessary deaths of thirteen brave American troops at Abbey Gate and left untold billions of dollars of high grade military equipment to the Taliban, making it the most well-armed terror organization in the world.""

Additionally, 40 retired U.S. ambassadors, 75 retired senior military officers and several hundred officials from previous Republican administrations signed the letter, praising Trump's diplomatic efforts on cease-fire agreements between Turkey and Kurdish fighters in Syria and the Abraham Accords. The letter refers to Trump as a ""peacemaker.""

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

""Securing peace is in the greatest tradition of American foreign policy and the Judeo-Christian principles upon which our nation was founded,"" the letter continues before quoting from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew.

Another signatory, Dr. Jerry Hendrix, former director of the Secretary of the Navy's Advisory Panel, said it ""wasn't a hard decision"" to attach his name to the letter.

Tuesday night's vice-presidential debate offered a refreshing change from the combative tone that has plagued our political discourse over the past eight years.

For many viewers, it was a relief to witness a civil exchange between two candidates who, surprisingly, seemed to respect one another. Sen. JD Vance showcased his skills as both an orator and debater, garnering a more favorable opinion from many voters.

On the other hand, Gov. Tim Walz, while appearing somewhat nervous and lackluster, managed to connect with viewers through his likability and relatability. The unfortunate reality, however, is that neither candidate did enough to change any votes.

So, what can we take away from this debate?

Despite various pundits highlighting the strengths of the two vice presidential candidates, Tuesday night's debate ultimately had little impact on undecided voters. While Walz's performance had its successes, his nervous start and notable gaffes left much to be desired. In the end, both candidates offered a little something for everyone -- but for those still weighing their options, there were no compelling reasons to change their minds.

Voters are understandably anxious about the future, and both candidates have already tapped into this concern -- Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz highlighting the threats to democracy and Trump and Vance focused on the difficulties we face with the economy and immigration.

Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg says port strikes could have real impact on economy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/transportation-secretary-pete-buttigieg-says-port-strikes-could-have-real-impact-economy,2024-10-03T18:10:06Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Thursday that the port strikes could have a real impact on the economy during an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

""The longer this goes, the more economic impact you're going to see. Look, if you just think about the pace of ocean shipping, obviously something you're expecting to get overnight isn't something you're sending in an ocean liner. But it doesn't take long for this to really have an impact. Our supply chains are all interconnected,"" Buttigieg told host Willie Geist.

The International Longshoreman's Association (ILA) began its first strike since 1977 after its six-year contract with the U.S. Maritime Alliance (USMX), which represents port employers, expired Monday night.

""A lot of the retailers, the stores, they did see that this might be coming. This is an issue we've been tracking for months. And so some of them rerouted to the West Coast or they frontloaded their orders and got more things into the warehouses earlier this year,"" he added.

US SHOPPERS START TO 'STOCK UP' ON ESSENTIALS AS PORT STRIKES PRESSURE PRICES TO GO 'HIGHER THAN EVER'

Buttigieg explained that the dockworkers' union was negotiating for better wages because shipping companies have had their profits increase by ""about 350%"" over the last eight years. He said the wages of the workers have only gone up about 15%.

""They're negotiating for better wages and other issues, and they have not been able to come to terms, them and the ocean carriers and ports, in order to reach a new contract. That has resulted in this strike, the work stoppage,"" he said.

""It's a big issue, this needs to get resolved,"" the transportation secretary added. ""We've been in touch with the different parties urging them to bridge their differences, in particular urging these ocean carriers, which again, have become extremely profitable in recent years to put forward an offer that is enough to bring the union back to the table and get this hammered out.""

The ongoing union dockworkers' strike has left several U.S. ports on the East and Gulf Coasts at a standstill for days, halting trade at the hubs that collectively handle about half of U.S. imports.

Major retail and business associations are sounding the alarm over the impact the work stoppage could have on the broader economy, and new data shows which companies have shipped the most goods into the affected ports over the past year.

The companies that imported the most volume into East Coast and Gulf Coast ports from September 2023 to September 2024 are General Motors, Walmart, LG Electronics, Mercedes Benz and Ikea, according to the latest data from ImportGenius shared with FOX Business."
"Voters in critical Michigan county focused on economy, candidate character as 2024 race tightens",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/voters-critical-michigan-county-focused-economy-candidate-character-2024-race-tightens,2024-10-03T18:04:18Z,"Voters in Kent County, Michigan, a swing county in one of the most critical swing states, told Fox News Digital about the issues weighing on their mind and whom they support in the upcoming election.

Voters in Kent County, Michigan, could play a large role in determining who wins November's presidential election, but many voters in the area are still undecided about their choice.

""I think there is too much division in his country. I think people on the left and people on the right hate each other a lot and I don't think that's right,"" said one Kent County voter, who told Fox News Digital he is still undecided.

The comments come as Kent County, which includes Michigan's second-largest city of Grand Rapids and much of the surrounding area, figures to play an outsized role in November.

While Michigan is well-known as one of the seven key swing states in the upcoming election, Kent County figures to be one of the key counties. Holding over 6% of the state's population, the county has traditionally been known as a conservative haven.

TRUMP TAKES NFL, NBA TO TASK ABOUT KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM

However, that trend has started to reverse itself in recent years, starting when former President Barack Obama was able to capture the county in 2008. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, won the county during his presidential bid in 2012, while former President Donald Trump took Kent County in 2016. It went back to Democrats in 2020, when President Biden was able to capture this important part of Michigan.

This year's race promises to feature Kent County again, though some voters there remain unconvinced by the candidates.

""Something which stood out to me about Trump is that he didn't bring us into any wars,"" one undecided voter said before noting that he believed Vice President Kamala Harris' ""stance is a lot clearer on LGBTQ rights.""

Immigration stood out as an issue to some Kent County voters, with one telling Fox News Digital the issue was a matter of human rights.

""People having the rights to be in our country and the rights to health care,"" said0 the voter, who indicated he was voting for Harris.

""Hopefully she can bring down housing costs and pretty much just inflation for young people like myself,"" he added. ""Trying to buy a house, trying to get loans and cars and things like that is very important for people of my age.""

However, another voter disagreed on the economy, arguing Trump is the right candidate to lead the country forward.

""I believe that a person who has run a company, that's been in business, can do a better job than a lifelong politician in terms of making decisions,"" the voter said.

That voter also indicated support for Trump on foreign policy, arguing he garnered the respect of world leaders.

""I think he was not afraid to stand up for what he felt is right,"" he said. ""I think other world leaders took note of that.""

Another voter, who indicated foreign policy was a key issue, disagreed.

""One candidate gets it and the other doesn't,"" the voter, who indicated support for Harris, told Fox News Digital of the reason he is voting for Harris.

""She understands the importance of our standing on the global stage, international politics, and our national security. I don't think Trump understands that,"" the voter continued.

Yet others had more trouble picking a candidate, most notably because of the divisive nature of modern politics.

""One day I'll go one way and another day I'll go another way,"" one undecided voter told Fox News Digital.

""It's hard to take her seriously, nothing sticks out about her,"" she said on Harris, while also noting that he finds it ""very hard to believe"" that someone as rich as Trump "" could care about people that don't have any money.""

The voter also deducted points from Trump because of the ""tone of his voice.""

""The name calling, I don't particularly care for that,"" the voter said."

Sherrod Brown on his Inflation Reduction Act vote in a new ad that's part of a $25 million new buy ahead of Election Day.

The 30-second ad spot, which will run on television and digitally, opens with a single mother from Versailles, Ohio, saying she can't believe the current prices for groceries.

""It's a lot tougher to provide for my kids with the Democrats' inflation,"" the woman, Carla, says. ""Sherrod Brown's only made things worse. Brown supported Kamala, not us, and voted for her radical Inflation Act, and now prices are at a 40-year-high. Bernie Moreno will fight to lower prices and stop inflation. That's why I trust Bernie Moreno to help Ohio families.""

The ad, first obtained by Fox News Digital in advance of its planned roll out, also includes the message on screen: ""Sherrod Brown voted for Kamala's Inflation Act.""

It was paid for by Bernie Moreno for Senate and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

""Hardworking Ohioans are suffering under the record-high inflation created by Kamala Harris and Sherrod Brown,"" Moreno said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""While he claims to fight for Ohio, families are unable to afford basic necessities. In November, we will send him packing and get our economy back on track.""

Moreno's campaign told Fox News Digital that the ad is part of an additional $25 million in spending. It comes just 33 days before the Nov. 5 election. Early voting in Ohio starts Oct. 8.

The contest is on track to be the most expensive Senate race this cycle, with $310.4 million in spending from both campaigns as of August, according to Axios.

As of August, Moreno shelled out $158.4 million and Brown spent $152 million, Axios reported.

Brown's campaign announced Wednesday it will report raising nearly $31 million in the third quarter.

Fox News has labeled the race between Moreno and Brown as a toss-up.

Fox News Digital reached out to Brown's campaign and congressional office for comment about the new ad but did not immediately hear back.

Ohio is center stage on the presidential ticket this cycle with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, as former President Trump's vice presidential running mate. Moreno ran against Vance in the 2022 GOP Republican primary for Senate, which Vance won, and has supported the Trump-Vance bid for the White House.

In August 2023, on the one-year anniversary of President Biden signing his Inflation Reduction Act into law, Brown's campaign issued a statement championing the legislation as having included ""key priorities Brown fought for to save Ohioans money, crack down on Wall Street stock buybacks, and attract investment and good-paying jobs to Ohio.""

""The Inflation Reduction Act is already saving Ohioans money at the pharmacy counter and spurring Ohio to lead the country in manufacturing the technology of the future - and those cost savings and Ohio jobs will only grow in the coming years,"" Brown said in a statement at the time.

As of August 2024, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) in the Midwest - which includes Ohio - rose by 2.6% over the last 12 months.

"Biden will 'wreck' US economy by failing to intervene in dockworkers' port strike, GOP leader warns",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-wreck-u-s-economy-failing-intervene-dockworkers-port-strike-gop-leader-warns,2024-10-03T15:26:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., slammed President Biden for failing to intervene in the dockworkers' port strike, expressing concern over the impact it will have on American families who are already struggling with crippling inflation.

Scalise accused Biden of potentially allowing the strike to ""wreck"" the U.S. economy during ""Fox & Friends,"" arguing that consumers will struggle even more with rising costs as the International Longshoremen's Association's (ILA) strike drags on.

PORT STRIKE WILL BRING ANOTHER HIT TO FARMERS, SAYS FORMER TRUMP OFFICIAL

""The president said we're just going to let it go on and wreck the economy,"" Scalise told Lawrence Jones. ""We're losing over $5 billion a day and costs are going to start going up even higher on families who are already struggling under the Biden-Harris inflation economy. Food on the shelves is going to become more scarce.""

Although Biden could invoke the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act to intervene in the strike, he has insisted against taking action. Under that law, Biden could enact an 80-day ""cooling off"" period for negotiations to resume while workers are back at work.

The ILA, which represents 45,000 dockworkers, began its first strike since 1977 after its six-year contract with the U.S. Maritime Alliance (USMX), which represents port employers, expired Monday night.

The 36 ports impacted by the strike on the Gulf and East coasts handle 55% of all U.S. container traffic and large volumes of exports, including about half of U.S. pork and almost three-quarters of U.S. poultry. About half of all imported fruits and vegetables come through these ports as well. In pharmaceuticals, nine out of 10 imports and seven out of 10 exports are being disrupted.

Negotiations between the ILA and USMX have been deadlocked thus far over the union's demands related to wage hikes and compensation, as well as protection from automation at ports.

Scalise argued that Congress would not support a ban on automation despite demands from the ILA.

""When we're competing globally, we're not just competing one city against another,"" he said. ""You've got ports all around the world that are heavily automated, and they still have humans, by the way, who actually run the devices. These automated devices aren't running themselves, but they're already making with overtime over $200,000 a year, in some cases, and they want to shut the economy down to get more.""

THE TAFT-HARTLEY ACT: WHY BIDEN COULD USE THIS LABOR TO PREEMPT A PORT STRIKE

""Who pays for this? And this will add even more to inflation,"" he continued. ""There are a lot of families making 50,000 a year that are saying please stop adding to the costs, and Biden and Harris won't do anything because they want to see those prices keep going.""

Meanwhile, the president has faced fierce scrutiny for spending numerous days at the beach while the nation faces implications of the strike along with various other crises - the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and surging violence in the Middle East.

""We see Joe Biden on the beach. He comes to the White House whenever he wants to,"" Jones said. ""Kamala Harris is on the campaign trail. The Cabinet members are just on the Sunday shows as allies of Kamala Harris. You're in leadership of our government, but who's running the country right now?""

""It's a really scary thought,"" Scalise responded. ""When you look at some of the bills we passed, we passed bills to secure the southern border. Joe Biden came out, said he's against it. Kamala Harris said she's against it. We have bills to produce our own American energy, so we don't need to give Iran and Russia billions of dollars a month. President Biden and Kamala Harris oppose that, so... you see a clear divide. The country is going to speak really loudly on this.""

""I think JD Vance said it best at the debate the other night,"" he continued. ""Kamala Harris talks about what you do on the first day. Kamala Harris's first day was 1,400 days ago, and look at the results. The world's on fire. Americans can't drive to go to the grocery store, let alone put food on the table."""
"Virginia Senate debate: Clinton ex-running mate Kaine, GOP challenger Cao spar on immigration, DEI in military",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-senate-debate-clinton-ex-running-mate-kaine-gop-challenger-cao-spar-immigration-dei-military,2024-10-03T13:08:23Z,"Virginia Gov. Glen Youngkin joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the 2024 election as early voting starts in the key swing state.

U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican challenger Hung Cao clashed on the debate stage Wednesday night on a range of issues including immigration, education and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the military.

Kaine, who previously served as governor of Virginia and was Hillary Clinton's vice presidential running mate in 2016, made his case during the hourlong showdown at Norfolk State University on why he should keep his seat in the upper chamber of Congress. The only debate of the campaign focused on national issues and matters that resonate in Virginia and the coastal city of Norfolk, which is home to the country's largest Navy base.

Cao, a 25-year Navy veteran endorsed by former President Donald Trump, criticized COVID vaccine mandates for service members and the Biden-Harris administration's botched Afghanistan withdrawal when asked about the military's collective failure to recently meet recruiting goals. He also criticized DEI efforts.

""When you're using a drag queen to recruit for the Navy, that's not the people we want,"" Cao said. ""What we need is alpha males and alpha females who are going to rip out their own guts, eat them and ask for seconds. Those are the young men and women that are going to win wars.""

VIRGINIA SCHOOL BOARD TO PAY 'WRONGFULLY FIRED' TEACHER WHO REFUSED TO USE STUDENT'S PREFERRED PRONOUNS

Kaine, who is on the Senate Armed Services Committee, responded by saying that railing at DEI ""is a red herring"" and the real challenge is informing more Americans about the benefits of the military when only about 1% of the population serves in the armed forces. ""We need to do a better job of talking about the G.I. Bill and other benefits as well as the tremendous leadership training that you get in the military,"" Kaine said.

Cao, meanwhile, brought up the G.I. Bill when challenging Kaine on student loan forgiveness. The incumbent Democrat had praised the Biden administration for having forgiven ""the loans of more than a million public servants in thanks for the public service they provide, whether it's in the military, whether it's teaching, whether it's working as a frontline health professional or working for a local or state government.""

The moderator then posed a question to Cao on how the Republican candidate would ease the burden, noting that the U.S. Department of Education reports more than a million Virginians owe a collective $43 billion in federal student debt as of last October, impacting their ability to contribute to the state's economy.

""If you're struggling to pay for your school, then get a G.I. Bill,"" Cao said. ""That means go out and serve in the military. You'll get a stipend as well as tuition. We need to fix education, and we need to do it now. But here's the thing with people like Senator Kaine, you've been an officer for 30 years in various offices, in the U.S. Senate for 12. Why have you not fixed it yet?""

VIRGINIA FAA CONTRACTOR ALLEGEDLY SPIED FOR IRAN, SHARED PRIVATE INFO ON US AIRPORTS, ENERGY INDUSTRY: DOJ

Kaine responded by saying Virginia ""was named the best state for a child to be raised in the United States"" and ""the best managed state and the best state to do business"" when he was governor from 2006 to 2010.

""Oh, again, he says what he's going to do,"" Cao shot back. ""Honestly, of the 227 bills that Senator Kaine has proposed, only three of them made it through... That's a 99% failure rate.""

""Check the tape on that. That's completely wrong,"" Kaine insisted.

However, Cao retorted, ""There's two truths in the world, okay? Never walk into a target store wearing a red shirt and never go against an Asian when it comes to math. Trust me.""

""He's got a 99% failure rate,"" Cao added. ""If I just had 99% failure rate, and I defused bombs, I wouldn't be here right now.""

The moderator also pressed Cao, whose family fled Vietnam during the 1970s, on whether he supports the mass deportation of ""all undocumented immigrants.""

""When Vietnam fell, we had nowhere to go, and America had brought us in and my parents waited in line for seven years. We all did for seven years to get our citizenship. The last thing that my dad had [hung] over his bed when he passed away two years ago was his naturalization certificate. I love this country so much that I wrote a blank check - up to including my life - to defend it for 25 years in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia and other parts of the world,"" Cao said. ""Here's my thing to anybody who wants to come here, don't ask for an American dream. If you're not willing to be American laws and embrace the American culture, because I did.""

""If you come here illegally, then you need to leave, especially if you're a violent crime person,"" Cao said, citing new Immigration and Customs Enforcement data provided to lawmakers last week.

""There are 13,000 convicted murderers and 16,000 convicted rapists that came across under their watch. That's unacceptable. We need to protect Americans every single day,"" Cao said.

""If you came here illegally, you've basically screwed up the whole system,"" Cao said. ""You can't jump the line - I mean, you go to Costco and jump the line, what do you think is going to happen? You can't come here and expect the American dream if you're not willing to obey the American laws and embrace the American culture.""

""Deport anybody that's committing crimes right now,"" he added. ""That's the first thing we need. Secure the border.""

Kaine said he never supported mass amnesty but believes it would ""devastate the economy"" to deport the 10 million illegal immigrants who crossed the border during the Biden-Harris administration - a figure the moderator cited and the Democratic candidate echoed. He also slammed former President Donald Trump for asking Republicans to oppose the last congressional border deal.

""We recently negotiated a very tough border deal that would have put a lot of resources on the border to stop illegal immigration,"" Kaine said. ""President Trump asked for Republicans to oppose it, even though it was supported by the border control union.""

Another subject was Trump's proposal to place more tariffs on imported goods.

""What we need to do is not tax our industry here,"" Cao said. ""What we need to do is tax other countries bringing in goods.""

Kaine criticized Trump's proposal. ""The Trump tariffs would be a massive tax that would cause prices on all of these items that are imported to go up,"" Kaine said. ""On that, I differ strongly from my opponent.""

With Kaine's seat considered solidly Democratic, the race has not seen the kind of dead-heat polling as the national presidential contest or the high-stakes drama of other Senate races such as those in Montana and Ohio, where Democratic incumbents face tough re-election bids, according to The Associated Press.

Trump has endorsed Cao, and political scientists say his path to victory is narrow given Virginia's moderate electorate, aversion to Trump in 2020 and Kaine's salience with voters, according to the AP.

Kaine won his last race in 2018 by 16 percentage points, although he said he was preparing for a tough race this year. The most recent Republican from Virginia to hold a U.S. Senate seat was the late John Warner, a centrist with an independent streak who last won in 2002.

The failed policies of the Biden-Harris administration gave America 40-year-high inflation, labor unrest, and now potentially the costliest strike in American history. By directing its 45,000 members to walk off the job, the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) union is crippling eastern seaboard ports and costing $5 billion per day.

In October 2021, I warned that the tax-and-spend agenda of the Biden-Harris administration would set an inflationary fire and torch Americans' finances, resulting in labor unrest. By the fall of 2023, we had the largest auto strike in history as the United Auto Workers (UAW) demanded higher wages to counter their losses from inflation.

While the UAW strike was disruptive to the auto industry, it didn't cause severe economic harm or noticeably impact the consumer. The ILA walk-off is an order of magnitude worse, with the potential for severe disruptions to the economy if it lasts more than just a few days.

BALTIMORE RESTAURANT OWNER SAYS PORT STRIKE IS ALREADY IMPACTING BUSINESS: 'IT REALLY HURTS'

The 36 ports on the Gulf and East coasts handle 55% of all U.S. container traffic and large volumes of exports, including about half of U.S. pork and almost three-quarters of U.S. poultry. About half of all imported fruits and vegetables come through these ports as well. In pharmaceuticals, nine out of 10 imports and seven out of 10 exports are being disrupted.

In short, America's international trade has been severely hamstrung, with consumers and businesses alike about to get hit hard if this labor dispute isn't resolved quickly.

The primary reason for this and other labor unrest over the last three years has been the stratospheric rise in the cost of living, which stems directly from mismanagement by the Biden-Harris administration.

Biden and Harris pushed for runaway federal deficits, fueled with newly created money from the Federal Reserve, destroyed one-fifth of the dollar's value in less than four years. It also caused violent fluctuations in interest rates for everything from mortgages to credit cards.

The result has been a cost-of-living crisis with homeownership affordability plunging to some of the lowest levels on record, while families pay over $300 billion annually just in interest on their outstanding credit card balances. Despite the average American's weekly paycheck being larger than ever before, it buys less than it did just four years ago.

But the plunge in the dollar's purchasing power has hit businesses every bit as hard as consumers, and the Biden-Harris administration's own data proves it. Prices paid by firms and by customers have both increased 20% since January 2021, meaning businesses have merely passed on their cost increases to consumers.

Inflation has massively increased both the cost of living and the cost of doing business, leaving no winners but government. So, while workers are demanding higher wages to combat today's sky-high cost of living, management is desperate to control increases in the cost of doing business -- and that includes labor costs. With such tight margins, any pay increases to workers will result in higher prices for customers.

But that didn't stop the Biden-Harris administration from weighing in and siding with the strikers, citing growth in corporate profits as somehow indicative of management's misbehavior. Corporate profits have increased in the same sense that families' paychecks have increased, but both buy less, on average, than they did four years ago because of the hidden tax of inflation.

Of all the politicians in Washington, D.C., Vice President Kamala Harris owns a disproportionate amount of the blame for inflation over the last four years. Not only was she the biggest cheerleader of the president's big-government agenda, but she also cast the tie-breaking vote on trillions of dollars in inflationary federal deficit spending.

What's particularly worrisome is that Harris hasn't learned from her mistakes. She's doubling down instead, proposing more of the same economic malfeasance that got America into this mess. If public policy continues down the path of the last three-and-a-half years, it will mean more inflation, more labor unrest, and evermore disruptive strikes."
Elite colleges shocked to discover students 'don't know how' to read hooks: 'My jaw dropped',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/elite-colleges-shocked-discover-students-dont-know-how-read-hooks-my-jaw-dropped,2024-10-03T11:12:31Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Several university professors expressed concerns to The Atlantic about students who come to college unable to read full-length books.

Assistant editor Rose Horowitch spoke to several teachers from elite schools like Columbia, Georgetown and Stanford, who each described the phenomenon of students being overwhelmed by the prospect of reading entire books.

Columbia University humanities professor Nicholas Dames described feeling ""bewildered"" when a first-year student told him that she had never been required to read a full book at her public high school.

""My jaw dropped,"" Dames said.

COLLEGE ADMISSIONS EXPERT SENDS SHOCKING MESSAGE ABOUT IVY LEAGUE PRESTIGE: 'IS IT WORTH THE INVESTMENT?'

Some professors do find a few students up to the task but described them as ""now more exceptions"" rather than the rule, with others ""shutting down"" when facing difficult texts.

""Daniel Shore, the chair of Georgetown's English department, told me that his students have trouble staying focused on even a sonnet,"" Horowitch wrote.

""It's not that they don't want to do the reading,"" she said. ""It's that they don't know how. Middle and high schools have stopped asking them to.""

Horowitch reported how a recent EdWeek Research Center survey of about 300 third-to-eighth-grade educators found ""only 17 percent said they primarily teach whole texts"" with nearly 25 percent saying whole books themselves are no longer the focus in their curriculum.

While private schools are not immune to this issue, the problem is more prominent with students who attended public schools, where standardized test prep is blamed.

""Private schools, which produce a disproportionate share of elite college students, seem to have been slower to shift away from reading complete volumes -- leading to what Dames describes as a disconcerting reading-skills gap among incoming freshmen,"" Horowitch wrote.

In response, colleges have been reducing their reading load, albeit with some additions for diversity.

""The Columbia instructors who determine the Lit Hum curriculum decided to trim the reading list for the current school year. (It had been growing in recent years, even while students struggled with the reading, as new books by non-White authors were added.),"" Horowitch wrote.

Psychologists told her they suspected the abundance of social media apps like TikTok and YouTube have overtaken recreational reading.

""It's changed expectations about what's worthy of attention,"" Daniel Willingham, a psychologist at UVA, said. ""Being bored has become unnatural.""

Another reason, Horowitch suggested, was the state of the economy with students more concerned over jobs rather than reading for fun.

""Some experts I spoke with attributed the decline of book reading to a shift in values rather than in skill sets. Students can still read books, they argue -- they're just choosing not to. Students today are far more concerned about their job prospects than they were in the past,"" she wrote.

Though professors have willingly begun scaling back their curriculum in favor of shorter texts or excerpts, many still mourned the loss of cultural enrichment that comes from reading.

""A lot of contemporary ideas of empathy are built on identification, identity politics,"" UC Berkeley English professor Victoria Kahn said. ""Reading is more complicated than that, so it enlarges your sympathies."""
"Metal detectorists stumble across 1,000-year-old Viking 'wallet' full of treasure: 'Highly unusual'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/metal-detectorists-stumble-1000-year-old-viking-wallet-full-treasure-highly-unusual,2024-10-03T10:15:00Z,"Fifty skeletons from the 9th and 10th centuries were found during an excavation in Åsum, Denmark, west of Copenhagen, according to the Museum of Odense. (Credit: Reuters)

British historians recently announced the remarkable discovery of a 1,000-year-old Viking ""wallet,"" thanks to two curious metal detectorists.

Manx National Heritage, an organization based on the Isle of Man, announced the discovery in a Sept. 30 press release. In a statement, the organization explained that the coins were actually uncovered in May.

Two metal detectorists, John Crowe and David O'Hare, found the treasure hoard while searching private land on the island. The findings consist of 36 silver coins minted between 1000 and 1065, when Vikings were known to inhabit the Isle of Man.

""The majority [of the coins] were minted during the reign of Edward the Confessor (AD 1042-1066) with the English kings Aethelred II (AD 978-1016) and Canute (AD 1016-1035) also represented,"" the press release noted.

Canute, also known as Cnut, was a Viking ruler who united the kingdoms of England and Denmark.

""There are various English mints represented, including York, London, Lincoln, Cambridge, Hastings, Ipswich and Exeter,"" the statement added. ""The Irish coins date from the middle of decades of AD 1000 and were all minted in Dublin. They feature the profile of King Sihtric Silkbeard who served as Norse King of Dublin from AD 989 to 1036.""

Dr. Kristin Bornholdt Collins, a researcher, noted the discovery could be likened to a wallet due to the variety of currencies.

""The new hoard might be compared to a wallet containing all kinds of credit cards, notes and coins, perhaps of different nationalities, such as when you prepare to travel overseas, and shows the variety of currencies available to an Irish Sea trader or inhabitants of Man in this period,"" she explained.

""Combined, the hoards provide a rare chance to study the contents side by side, right down to the detail of the dies used to strike the coins,"" the expert added. ""Having this much closely dated comparative material from separate finds is highly unusual.""

Historians believe the hoard was abandoned around 1070. Experts say the treasure sheds light on the trade history of the time.

""The geographical range of mints represented in this hoard illustrates a vibrant and mobile economy, with traders and cash moving through Ireland and England, via the Isle of Man, for an extended period throughout the Viking era,"" Manx National Heritage said in its release.

Allison Fox, a curator for Manx National Heritage, said the discovery provides information about the history of the island, which is known to harbor priceless Viking artifacts.

""This is a wonderful find which helps further our understanding of the complex Viking Age economy in the Isle of Man, where more Viking Age silver has been discovered per square kilometre than in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales,"" she noted."
"Politico: Vance's beard a sign of 'aggression' to women, Walz's 'saucer' eyes showed his 'passion'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/politico-vances-beard-sign-aggression-women-walzs-saucer-eyes-showed-his-passion,2024-10-03T00:07:43Z,"Fox News contributor Joe Concha joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss why he believes the CBS moderators were biased against JD Vance and his reaction to an ABC anchor comparing Tim Walz's performance to President Biden's.

Female voters who watched the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate on Tuesday may have viewed Ohio Sen. JD Vance's beard as a sign of toxic masculinity, according to one body language expert.

Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, faced off against Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at the Tuesday night debate, sparring for 90 minutes on a wide range of issues including immigration, the economy and abortion.

Former FBI agent and body language expert Joe Navarro analyzed each candidate's body language at the event for Politico Magazine, giving his opinion about how they presented themselves on stage.

The first thing Navarro noticed was Vance's facial hair. He claimed the ""masculine"" trait could turn off female voters.

VANCE OOZED CONFIDENCE COMPARED TO JITTERY WALZ, BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT SAYS: 'CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP'

""As POLITICO Magazine has noted before, Vance is the first White House wannabe to wear facial hair in 80 years. Our appearance is fundamental to our body language, and research indicates that voters see beards as (surprise, surprise) more masculine,"" Navarro wrote. ""That can be positive to some, reading as strength and competence. But to others, especially women, it can be negative, conveying aggression and opposition to feminist ideals.""

Navarro isn't the only media commentator to associate the Republican ticket with negative perceptions of masculinity. Since the Harris-Walz ticket emerged, several journalists, including MSNBC contributor Katty Kay, have argued that Republicans appeal to men with a more ""macho,"" what they consider, outdated version of masculinity.

MSNBC host Jen Psaki and The Washington Post's Catherine Rampell have also made the case that the Democratic ticket appeals to men who are more ""supportive"" of women.

While critiquing Vance's beard, Navarro praised Walz for his bugged-eyed expression throughout the debate, saying it ""showed his passion"" on the issues.

""When Walz felt especially passionate about something, he'd open his eyes wide as saucers. Eye-popping can sometimes be a sign of surprise, but for Walz, it simply revealed his emotional intensity,"" Navarro wrote. ""Early humans would have made such facial gestures to communicate strong emotions, like 'danger is close.' For Walz, it gave extra weight to his feelings and held our gaze.""

The body language expert spoke positively about how Vance used his hands to convey emotion and leadership during the debate, but claimed a ""little frown"" by the Republican at one point showed where his ""weaknesses lie.""

""When Walz brought up Project 2025, Vance exhibited a little tell that carried a big message: a slight squinting of the eyes and a small frown. Clearly, this was a sore subject,"" Navarro wrote.

""We have to guard against such behaviors in high-stakes interchanges like negotiations or, say, vice-presidential debates -- they reveal to your opponent what topics you want to avoid and where your weaknesses lie,"" he wrote.

At the same time, Navarro gave credit to Walz for frowning to show his disapproval while Vance was speaking.

""During a disagreement over democracy, he furrowed his glabella forcefully at what Vance was saying. Then he held his eyebrows like that, in tension, for some time. While Vance had the floor, this was a way for Walz to silently say, 'No way, that's not right, and I am going to challenge you on this,'"" he wrote.

The only negative assessment of Walz was about his finger-wagging at the camera.

""[H]e pointed at the camera with his index finger, like Uncle Sam in those old 'I Want You' posters. It was a bold, almost accusatory gesture -- which made it great for the poster, but can come across as almost hostile. Our brains immediately perceive a point as 'calling us out' -- in other words, as threatening. Walz wanted our attention there, and he certainly got it,"" Navarro wrote.

Both candidates displayed ""Midwestern politeness"" by tilting their heads and turning their bodies toward the other while speaking, the expert said."
"Chinese Communist Party marks 75 years of rule as economic, security threats persist",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/chinese-communist-party-marks-75-years-rule-economic-security-threats-persist,2024-10-02T18:42:08Z,"Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Chinese head of state Xi Jinping on the anniversary, noting that Russia was the first country to recognize the People's Republic of China 75 years ago. Xi said he would continue to expand cooperation between the two nations.

China is marking the 75th year of Communist Party rule as economic challenges and security threats linger over the massive state.

No festivities have been announced for the 75th anniversary on Tuesday, save for a flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square, with an honor guard marching from the entrance of the sprawling palace that in past centuries was the home of Chinese emperors.

The entirely state-controlled media ran constant reports on China's economic progress and social stability, with no mention of challenges ranging from a declining birth rate to the disruption in supply chains that has harmed the largely export-driven economy.

TRUMP-ENDORSED HOUSE CANDIDATE SOUNDS ALARM ON CHINA'S GROWING INFLUENCE IN BATTLEGROUND STATE

Commemorations were also held in the former British colony of Hong Kong and Portugal's former territory of Macao, both of which returned to Chinese sovereignty in the late 1990s in a key indication of Beijing's determination to overcome what it has called a ""Century of Humiliation.""

In recent decades, China has mounted military parades and displays of the country's economic might only at the turn of decades, such as for the 60th and 70th anniversaries.

The world's second largest economy has struggled to regain momentum after the COVID-19 pandemic.

A prolonged property slump led to a spillover effect on other parts of the economy, from construction to sales of home appliances. Last week, China announced a slew of measures to boost the economy, including lower interest rates and smaller down payment requirements for mortgages.

Party leader and head of state Xi Jinping has largely avoided overseas travel since the pandemic, while continuing with his purges at home of top officials considered insufficiently loyal or being suspected of corruption or personal indiscretions.

""The road ahead will not be smooth, there will definitely be difficulties and obstacles, and we may encounter major tests such as high winds and rough seas, or even stormy waves,"" Xi warned during a banquet on the eve of the anniversary.

""We must be vigilant in times of peace, plan ahead, and rely closely on the entire Party, the entire army, and people of all ethnic groups across the country"" he said, ""no difficulties can stop the Chinese people from moving forward.""

The anniversary also comes as China is facing growing frictions with neighbors including Japan, South Korea and the Philippines over territorial claims and their close relationships with Beijing's chief rival, the United States.

The Communists under Mao Zedong seized power in 1949 amid a civil war with the Nationalists, also known as the KMT, led by Chiang Kai-shek, who shifted their political, economic and military power to the now self-governing island democracy of Taiwan.

Beijing continues to insist Taiwan must be annexed under Communist Party rule, by force if necessary, while the U.S. has provided arms to ensure its defense.

China, meanwhile, has involved itself in disputes over its claims to most of the South China Sea and uninhabited islands held by Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and other neighboring nations.

China's military buildup and its recent launch of a nuclear capable ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean have raised concerns about a possible conflict.

At home, Xi has made himself effectively leader for life by ending term limits and extending his power over key government and party bodies. China allows no competitive elections and the party retains near total control over the media that informs its 1.4 billion people.

Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Xi on the anniversary and the subsequent establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties, noting that Russia was the first country to recognize the People's Republic of China 75 years ago, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

Xi reaffirmed their close ties, saying China would continue to expand ""all-round pragmatic cooperation"" between the two nations."
Harris dodges answering whether athletes should stand during national anthem in unearthed interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-dodges-answering-whether-athletes-should-stand-during-national-anthem-unearthed-interview,2024-10-02T18:10:54Z,"FOX News contributor Joe Concha responds to a Harvard board's unanimous vote to keep President Claudine Gay following her antisemitism testimony and controversy over LeBron James sitting during the national anthem to avoid being a 'distraction.'

Vice President Kamala Harris sidestepped answering directly whether she believes athletes should stand for the national anthem during an unearthed 2016 interview, instead delivering a rambling response that is currently receiving backlash on social media ahead of the general election.

While serving as attorney general of California, Harris joined PBS reporter David Nazar to discuss her Senate run and campaign platforms on issues such as criminal justice reform, the Black Lives Matter movement and the economy in California. During the discussion, Nazar pressed Harris if she believes athletes should stand for the national anthem.

""Should folks stand for the national anthem?"" Nazar asked in the interview, which was published in October 2016.

Harris' response focused on Americans' rights protected in the Constitution, and did not include a direct answer on whether athletes should stand for ""The Star-Spangled Banner.""

""We are all, and should be, treated as equals. We articulated those principles in our Constitution. And part of what we decided is what makes a fair and just and noble society in a democracy, a true democracy, is freedom of religion, freedom, right, of association, freedom to organize, First Amendment,"" she responded.

""So, that is part of who we are as a country, and I will defend it to the core, which is that we give people, certain choices in this country.""

PRO ATHLETES WHO STOOD FOR NATIONAL ANTHEM AMID FEVER PITCH TO SUPPORT SOCIAL JUSTICE INITIATIVES

In 2016, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick became the first NFL player to kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism. The form of protest, which began in Harris' backyard of San Francisco, soon spread to other sports leagues and athletes.

Athletes such as Megan Rapinoe knelt for the anthem ahead of soccer games in 2016, while Bruce Maxwell became the first Major League Baseball athlete to kneel during the national anthem in 2017.

TRUMP TAKES NFL, NBA TO TASK ABOUT KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM

The form of protest hit a fever pitch in 2020 following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis during an interaction with police. Scores of athletes knelt ahead of games that year during the anthem, while the NBA unveiled a court painted with ""Black Lives Matter"" amid social justice protests that year, and some Olympians took a knee during the Tokyo Games.

The protests were slammed by conservatives in the U.S., including former President Trump, who ripped the athletes for politicizing games.

TRUMP GIVES TWO-WORD RESPONSE IN REACTION TO NFL PLAYERS KNEELING BEFORE THANKSGIVING DAY GAME

""I think it's been horrible for basketball. Look at the basketball ratings. They're down to very low numbers. People are angry about it. They don't realize.... They have enough politics with guys like me. They don't need more as they're driving down... going up for the shot. They don't need it. There's a nastiness about the NBA about the way it was done too. So I think the NBA is in trouble. It's in big trouble. Bigger trouble than they understand,"" Trump said in 2020.

Trump also posted to X, then Twitter, that kneeling for the national anthem is ""a sign of great disrespect for our Country and our Flag,"" saying the ""game is over"" for him when he spots an athlete kneeling.

Harris' unearthed interview was criticized on social media this week, with OutKick founder Clay Travis saying Harris delivered a ""long jumble of nothingness.""

COLIN KAEPERNICK PROTEST FALLOUT SHOWED 'REALLY HOW A LOT OF THE WHITE PEOPLE SEE US,' NFL LEGEND SAYS

Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment on the 2016 interview, but did not immediately receive a response.

Harris defended athletes who knelt during the anthem in 2017, after she was elected senator, saying they should not be ""threatened or bullied"" for the protest.

""Let's speak the truth that when Americans demand recognition that their lives matter, or kneel to call attention to injustice, that that is an expression of free speech, protected by our Constitution, and they should not be threatened or bullied,"" Harris said during an event in Atlanta, the Hill reported at the time.

""When we sing 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' we rightly think about the brave men and women from all backgrounds who proudly defend the freedom of those they may never meet and people who will never know their names.

""He was good,"" he said. ""I mean, he was too slick, maybe, but... he certainly was not the kind of despicable character that we've kind of seen clips of."" Deutsch described the debate as a ""draw"" up until the discussion of the 2020 election and Trump's refusal to concede defeat: ""I think that that was disqualifying,""

""I think that's disqualifying in the election, if you can't say that,"" he continued. ""I mean, I think that that's -- the issue, that whenever I get into debates with anybody, I go, well, democracy, duh, kind of on the docket.""

The frequent MSNBC guest also weighed in on criticisms that the debate was boring, which he said will be a ""referendum"" on what people want going forward.

""I think the big theme of this thing was that it was very congenial, and it was not a blood sport,"" he said. ""It was not UFC. It was more like boxing. And if the American public -- your intuition says, well, the American public is ready for that, they want that, but then I kind of said to myself, is there this sick, twisted thing that people are addicted to the sick entertainment value of Donald Trump, and that they were kind of disappointed?""

""I was enjoying it, but they were disappointed: 'No, that's no fun. Are we going to go back to that?' Now, my better angels in me say, no, people are ready for that. But it's an interesting question,"" he added.

Deutsch concluded, arguing Vance's good performance is going to ""bother"" Trump, as he showed Americans he was the ""better"" candidate.

""Donald Trump, you're going to see, he's going to be very dismissive of JD Vance in the coming weeks, but Donald Trump is not happy this morning because JD Vance showed himself to be a superior candidate,"" he said."
"WATCH: Voters react in real time to key Vance-Walz debate moments on immigration, democracy, abortion",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/watch-voters-react-real-time-key-vance-walz-debate-moments-immigration-democracy-abortion,2024-10-02T16:27:52Z,"Fox News Digital ranks the top five memorable moments from the 2024 Vice Presidential Debate between Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz.

A Fox News Digital focus group of Republicans, Democrats and independents reacted to key moments from the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate between Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night, offering real-time responses to the candidates' statements.

In a focus group hosted by Lee Carter, participants across the political spectrum used dials showing their favorable, unfavorable or neutral responses to Vance and Walz. Their reactions gave insights into how the voters who will help decide the election felt about the demeanor, character and policies of the two men, one of whom will be the next vice president.

Here are some of the most significant voter reactions from Tuesday night's focus group.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

Vance's argument that the U.S. needed to ""stop the bleeding"" at the border during Tuesday's debate elicited a mixed response from voters.

Vance received mixed responses when he said, ""Before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding... we have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.""

While Republican views of Vance's answers had an immediate positive response, Democratic viewers of the debate went in an opposite direction, the dials showed. Independents, meanwhile, hovered around a neutral response to Vance's answer.

Voters began to see Vance's response in a more positive light when he touched on former President Trump's border policies, arguing that the next administration should return to handling the border similar to how Trump did during his four years in office.

Democrats and independents reacted moderately-to-highly favorable to Walz's rejoinder on the migrant crisis and his criticism of the Trump administration.

Walz touted the bipartisan immigration bill that Trump pushed to kill earlier this year and defended Kamala Harris' record in California on the issue. Republicans were unfavorable to Walz but independents and Democrats gave him high marks throughout his answer.

""Pass the bill, she'll sign it,"" Walz said.

Republican, Democrat and independent voters reacted differently when Vance stated that he and Trump support ""clean air, clean water"" when climate change was brought up at the debate.

""Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say, Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer,"" Vance said.

The Fox News Debate Dial showed support among independents and Democrats dipping downward when Vance made that statement. Support among Republicans remained fairly consistent.

But support among independent viewers began to rise again when Vance referenced how Democrats bring up carbon emissions when discussing climate change.

""This idea that carbon emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true,"" Vance said. ""Well, if you believe that, what would you -- would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to restore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.""

One of Walz's most difficult moments at the debate received poor to middling reviews across the board from the focus group.

Moderators confronted Walz on his prior claim that he was present at the Tiananmen Square protests in Hong Kong in 1989, when he didn't travel to Asia until later that year. Walz gave a meandering answer that showed sub-par responses from Democrats, Republicans and independents almost throughout his entire comment, which didn't directly address the discrepancy.

At one point, he admitted he could be a ""knucklehead."" He eventually admitted he'd misspoke.

Walz's support among Republicans dipped to its lowest point - under 10% - when he said former President Donald Trump would have benefited from participating in one of his China trips, arguing Trump would never have befriended Chinese President Xi Jinping.

DISGRACED EX-CBS NEW ANCHOR DAN RATHER SAYS OLD NETWORK LOOKING TO AVOID 'BLOWBACK' ABC RECEIVED

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming public resources in Springfield, Ohio.

Independent and Republican voters disapproved of the interjection, but independent voters dipped significantly when Vance began explaining his stance.

Independents were mixed, while Republicans were highly favorable of Vance saying he was ""wrong"" about Trump in the past when confronted about his past criticism of his running mate.

""Sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the president, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record,"" Vance said.

When Walz was asked whether he supports abortion up until the ninth month as Minnesota is one of the least restrictive states for abortion, he responded, ""That's not what the bill says.""

While Republican voters dipped significantly as Walz spoke, independent and Democratic voters stayed mostly in the approval zone.

""What we did is restore Roe v. Wade, we made sure that we put women in charge of their health care,"" Walz said.

Independents dipped slightly in approval while Democratic voters shot up during his statement. The two eventually evened out and stayed in the approval zone.

""This is a basic human right,"" he later said.

The independent voters stayed slightly under the Democratic approval line, as Republicans significantly disapproved.

Vance received a positive reaction across the board from Democrats, Republicans and Independents when he told Walz he was sorry his son was once a witness to a shooting.

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that,"" the senator told Walz.

Independents gave Vance an immediate low rating when he said he was focused on the future after Walz asked him if Trump lost the 2020 election.

Republicans on the Fox News Debate Dial had been unimpressed with Walz's line of questioning and the dial went down, with the approval staying generally the same with Vance's answers, but the dials for independents and Democrats took a sharp dive as Vance brushed off the question. It dove the sharpest among independents.

Liberal media pundits repeatedly played and discussed the clip in the debate's aftermath, saying it was one of Walz's strongest moments in a night that Vance otherwise controlled.

A majority of the 13 columnists and contributors polled by The New York Times agreed that JD Vance won the debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night.

Multiple New York Times columnists, including Binyamin Appelbaum, said that Vance was overall effective in his presentation on the debate stage. Seven of the columnists and contributors said that Vance defeated Walz in the debate, with two saying that the face-off was a draw and three writers concluding that Walz won.

""He made Trumpism sound polite, calm and coherent,"" Appelbaum said of Vance.

GOP LAWMAKERS, LEADERS REACT TO VANCE, WALZ DEBATE: 'SPITTING COLD, HARD TRUTH'

""Vance was far nimbler than the nervous Tim Walz, especially in the first half of the debate.

""Walz won,"" Times columnist Charles M. Blow wrote. ""You could tell that he was a teacher, because he clearly did his homework. Anyone afraid that Vance would roll over him could breathe easily.""

Newsletter writer Matt Labash said that ""Nobody truly dominated.""

""But I'm giving the slight edge to Walz, since Vance embarrassingly soft-pedaled Jan. 6 and Trump posted this to Truth Social during the debate: 'More Notes!

Other writers said that the debate outcome was more even.

Contributing Times Opinion writer Jane Coaston wrote that ""Vance seemed smoother and more practiced, but 'won' is a very strong term here.""

Times columnist Gail Collins said that the debate was a ""draw"" because ""Walz was so bad in much of his delivery. Vance was a much more forceful speaker while spewing lies on everything from abortion to Biden's foreign policy.""

Contributing Times opinion writer Peter Wehner said that Vance proved he was ""sharp and in command and ... an excellent debater.""

""At times he tried too hard to appear likable; I came away more convinced that he's a hollow man, radioactive and incendiary one day, conciliatory and agreeable the next,"" Wehner said. ""But the 'good Vance' did a lot to repair his tattered image.""

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital, ""Senator JD Vance completely dominated the debate and showed why we need to return President Trump to the White House."" He added that Trump's vice presidential nominee ""gave clear answers how the Trump-Vance ticket will turn around our economy, secure our southern border, make our streets safe once again, and restore peace in the Middle East.""

Cheung continued by saying that Vance ""exposed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for being failed, radical leftists who are all slogans with zero substance.""

""He called out Kamala Harris for destroying our southern border. He called out Harris for creating the record inflation making life unaffordable for millions of Americans. And he called out Harris for enabling Iran, leading to the current attacks on Israel,"" the spokesman added.

One of Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance's biggest debate moments was when he explained his complete reversal of feelings about his running mate.

Vance was asked at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate on Tuesday how he went from calling Trump potentially ""America's Hitler"" and an ""idiot"" to joining the former president's 2024 ticket.

""Sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the president, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump.

Republican audience approval surged past 80% and at one point even over 90%, maintaining solid support throughout Vance's statement.

""There were a lot of things on the border, on tariffs, for example, where I think that we could have done so much more if the Republican Congress and the Democrats in Congress had been a little bit better about how they govern the country. They were so obsessed with impeaching Donald Trump, they couldn't actually govern,"" Vance said.

JD Vance of Ohio, stated that he and former President Trump support ""clean air, clean water"" while responding to a question on the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate stage about climate change, the Fox News Debate Dial showed.

""Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say, Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer,"" Vance said.

The Fox News Debate Dial showed support among independents and Democrats dipping downward when Vance made that statement. Support among Republicans remained fairly consistent.

But support among independent viewers began to rise again when Vance referenced how Democrats bring up carbon emissions when discussing climate change.

""This idea that carbon emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true,"" Vance said. ""Well, if you believe that, what would you -- would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.""

TIM WALZ: THE SOLUTION IS TO 'MOVE FORWARD' WITH IDEA THAT 'CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL'

The dial for independents remained flat as Vance moved into criticizing Kamala Harris on energy policy. Support among Democrats took a dive by contrast.

""What have Kamala Harris policies actually lead to more energy production in China, more manufacturing overseas, more doing business in some of the dirtiest parts of the entire world,"" Vance said. ""When I say that, I mean the amount of carbon emissions they're doing per unit of economic output. So, if we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water, the best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people. And unfortunately, Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite.""

CBS News host Nora O'Donnell began her question by noting how more than 160 were dead and hundreds more were missing in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.

""Scientists say climate change makes these hurricanes larger, stronger and more deadly because of the historic rainfall,"" she said. ""Senator Vance, according to CBS news polling, 7 in 10 Americans and more than 60% of Republicans under the age of 45 favor the U.S. taking steps to try and reduce climate change. Senator, what responsibility would the Trump administration have to try and reduce the impact of climate change?""

Vance began his response by recognizing the hurricane as ""an unbelievable, unspeakable human tragedy"" and recalling a photograph of grandparents and a six-year-old child on a roof that later collapsed, causing those people to lose their lives. ""I'm sure Governor Waltz joins me and saying, our hearts go out to those innocent people, our prayers go out to them,"" Vance said. ""And we want as robust and aggressive as a federal response as we can get to save as many lives as possible. And then, of course, afterwards to help the people in those communities rebuild.""

"11 Tennessee factory workers swept away in Helene floodwaters, company responds to evacuation decision",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/11-tennessee-factory-workers-swept-away-helene-floodwaters-company-responds-evacuation-decision,2024-10-02T12:49:13Z,"Fox News chief Washington correspondent Mike Emanuel looks at the federal response to Hurricane Helene on 'Special Report.'

Employees forced to work at a Tennessee plastics factory are recounting the day historic flooding took over their parking lot and caused the power to go out. Once the plant shut down, and they were sent home, several of the workers did not make it.

Floodwaters swept 11 people away, and only five were rescued. Two of them are confirmed dead and part of the death toll across the affected states that passed 150 Tuesday, The Associated Press reported.

""We were all talking to the supervisors and telling everybody, 'Look, we don't need to be here,'"" Impact Plastic employee Zinna Adkins told WJHL. ""Our phone alerts were saying we need to flee the areas. And they never said anything about it. And supervisors didn't tell us that we could go.""

Management of the company founded in 1987 and the factory located in Erwin sent out a statement to local media on Monday that ""expressed sympathy for the missing and deceased employees and one contractor.""

""At no time were employees told that they would be fired if they left the facility,"" the statement continued.

Impact Plastics says while most employees left immediately following dismissal, ""some remained on or near the premises for unknown reasons.""

Jacob Ingram, a mold changer at the plastics factory, filmed himself and four others waiting for rescue as bobbing vehicles floated by. He later posted the videos on on Facebook with the caption, ""Just wanna say im lucky to be alive."" Videos of the helicopter rescue were posted on social media later on Saturday.

""They should've evacuated when we got the flash flood warnings, and when they saw the parking lot,"" Ingram said to the Knoxville News Sentinel. ""We asked them if we should evacuate, and they told us not yet, it wasn't bad enough.""

The two confirmed dead at the Tennessee plastics factory are Mexican citizens, Lisa Sherman-Nikolaus, executive director at Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition told the AP. She said many of the victims' families have started online fundraisers to cover funeral costs and other expenses.

Beware Kamala's 'fair share' lie on taxes,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/beware-kamalas-fair-share-lie-taxes,2024-10-02T09:14:13Z,"As Vice President Kamala Harris tries to articulate her economic plans, it is clear that she intends to continue to spend more money, and in doing so, also wants to raise taxes, at least for some Americans.

Her attempt at an explanation includes one tired refrain, a carry-over from the Biden-Harris agenda: the wealthy aren't paying their fair share and we need to get them to pay more.

What the wealthy pay in taxes cannot be characterized as fair, but not in the way that Harris explains.

According to Treasury data, federal income taxes account for about half of government revenue. Of those federal income taxes, per the Tax Foundation, about half of taxpayers paid around 98% of that total.

IRS MIGHT TAKE MORE OF YOUR MONEY UNDER KAMALA HARRIS

As you dig into the numbers, they become even more ""unfair.""

The National Taxpayers Union Foundation's data from 2021 showed that the top 1% of earners made 26.3% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), yet they paid 45.8% of federal income taxes. One percent of the people paying almost 46% of taxes is definitely not fair, but Harris wants more.

When the data is expanded, the top 10% of earners had 52.6% of AGI, but paid 75.8% of federal income taxes.

The bottom 50% of earners had 10.4% of AGI, but only paid just more than 2.3% of federal income taxes.

HERE'S WHAT KAMALA HARRIS' TAX ARMAGEDDON WILL COST YOU AND THE US ECONOMY

And, somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% of U.S. households pay no federal income taxes at all.

Those who pay abundantly for the federal government and its ""services"" are berated by Harris and friends that they aren't paying enough, which is then voted into being by the people who carry little to none of the federal income tax burden. That sounds... unfair.

What is also unfair is the creep of tax collections and overspending.

For FY 2024, the U.S. government is expected to take in, primarily from taxes, almost $5.1 trillion. That's an increase of around 47% from five years ago. It's a staggering amount, larger than the GDP of every country in the world, other than the U.S. and China. Yet, it's still not enough and the government plans to run a more than $2 trillion deficit on top of that. That's... unfair.

And, while we are talking about unfair taxes, let's not forget that the massive inflation that the Biden-Harris agenda unleashed upon all Americans, stealing their purchasing power, making the cost of everyday living a struggle, and putting the ability to invest and get ahead out of reach. As famed economist Milton Friedman once said, ""Inflation is the one form of taxation that can be imposed without legislation."" That sounds... unfair.

The government spends too much, and it takes too much, particularly from those who have been successful, painting achievement and success as a punishable offense and government dependence as a virtue. That doesn't sound American, that sounds socialist at best.

Yet, Harris will say that those who have done well need to be further penalized, while continuing to overspend and devalue the earnings of all Americans. And that's before layering on any of her ultra-destructive proposals on top of raising income taxes, which include higher capital gains taxes, unrealized gains taxes, and other economically illiterate and ruinous policies.

When it comes to the government, what is unfair is how much they are taxing productive Americans, how many Americans have no skin in the game, and how much government spending is creating a fiscal train wreck.

Calling out that unfairness needs to be done over and over again."
Top 5 clashes between Vance and Walz during debate showdown: 'Your mics are cut',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-5-clashes-between-vance-walz-during-debate-showdown-your-mics-cut,2024-10-02T08:11:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance took the same stage for their first and only vice presidential debate this election cycle on Tuesday evening, when the pair had a handful of fiery clashes over top voter concerns.

The CBS News Vice Presidential Debate showcased the two vice presidential candidates' platforms on issues such as the ongoing war raging in the Middle East, abortion laws and their respective tickets' economic records. Amid the 90-minute debate, Vance and Walz had a handful of clashes, including moderators turning off Vance's microphone.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

The CBS debate's rules included leaving microphones on for both candidates no matter who was speaking, breaking from the two presidential debates this cycle that muted microphones when a candidate was not speaking. The outlet, however, reserved the right to turn the microphones off if they felt it was warranted.

Moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell did mute the pair Tuesday when Vance spoke up to complain that the moderators were trying to fact-check him on his remarks regarding illegal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace,"" Vance said referring to about immigration issues in a city in his home state.

After Vance and Walz both delivered responses regarding immigration, Brennan told viewers that Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

Vance took issues with the on-air ""fact-check"" before he was muted.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS ADMITS FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP WAS BECAUSE CNN LET HIS STATEMENTS 'HANG' AT FIRST DEBATE

""The rules were that you were not going to fact-check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said. ""So there's an application called the CBP. One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in. Applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.""

Moderators tried to quiet Vance before cutting his and Walz's mics.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Margaret Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get to.""

Walz was forced to answer questions regarding his travel to China during Tuesday night's debate.

Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets, however, are now reporting that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""Look, I grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service,"" a visibly shaky Walz said. ""I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.""

""I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams. We would take baseball teams. We would take dancers. And we would go back and forth to China,"" Walz said, noting the trips were ""to try and learn.""

""Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, and I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect,"" Walz continued.

""And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Brennan pushed back, reminding Walz of the question and again asking him to explain the discrepancy.

""All I said on this was, as I got there that summer and misspoke on this,"" Walz said. ""So, I will just -- that's what I've said. So, I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests, went in and, from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance.""

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz claimed during the debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws after Roe v. Wade was overturned, sparking a clash with Vance.

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade,"" he said.

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Vance shot back that a Minnesota abortion law does not require doctors to save a baby who survives an abortion.

""First of all, governor, I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive, and there are a lot of people who should still be alive. And I certainly wish that she was. And maybe you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me. But as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion,"" he said.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""That's not true,"" Walz said.

""Choice or not option that is fundamentally barbaric,"" Vance continued.

The pair also sparred over immigration a handful of times throughout the debate, including Vance slamming Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of immigration.

""First of all, the gross majority of what we need to do to the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job,"" Vance said during a discussion on the Haitian migrant surge in Springfield, Ohio, and immigration overall.

""I've been to the southern border more than our 'border czar' Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.""

Vance continued by saying that, ""of course, additional resources would help,"" but that the issue is mostly about the Biden administration not empowering law enforcement to say ""if you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico"" and ""go back through proper channels.""

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION

""Now, Gov. Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield,"" Vance said. ""Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.

Walz repeatedly argued Trump shut down a Senate immigration bill earlier this year that he believes would have made strengthened border security.

""It is law enforcement that asked for the bill,"" Walz said. ""They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.

""On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.""

""This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then, you start to make a difference in this, and you start to adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.""

The pair of vice presidential candidates also sparred over the threat of censorship on Tuesday, as Walz pressed Vance on the 2020 election and Jan. 6, 2021.

""It's really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 years in this country. We are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election,"" Vance said after Walz cited Jan. 6, when Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol.

""We have to remember that for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections. Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board. But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor,"" Vance continued.

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

Walz countered that ""Jan. 6 was not Facebook ads.""

""This idea that there's censorship to stop people from doing, threatening to kill someone, threatening to do something, that's not that's not censorship. Censorship is book banning. We've seen that. We've seen that brought up,"" he continued.

Walz continued that Trump has repeatedly claimed he won the 2020 presidential election.

""Did he lose the 2020 election?"" Walz asked Vance of Trump during the last election cycle.

""Tim, I'm focused on the future,"" Vance replied. ""Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?""

""That is a damning non-answer,"" Walz said. ""I'm pretty shocked by this. He lost the election. This is not a debate, it's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world.""

""It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship,"" Vance shot back.

Reactions from conservatives on social media poured in during and following the first and only vice presidential debate on Tuesday night with the majority praising JD Vance for his performance.

""This was a massacre,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis posted on X. ""JD Vance absolutely destroyed Tim Walz.""

""JD Vance just won big,"" conservative commentator Charlie Kirk posted on X along with a video montage of facial reactions by the two candidates. ""And it wasn't even close.""

""As Governor, Walz implemented his far-left agenda in Minnesota, with soft-on-crime policies, authoritarian COVID lockdowns, and support for limitless abortion. As Vice President, he will expand his extremism beyond Minnesota as the unapologetic wingman for Kamala Harris.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

The Harris campaign released a statement following the debate expressing why it believes that Walz, not Vance, had the strongest night.

""Tonight, Governor Walz showed exactly why Vice President Harris picked him: he is a leader who cares about the issues that matter most to the American people,"" Harris-Walz Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement. ""In the debate, Americans got to see a real contrast: a straight talker focused on sharing real solutions, and a slick politician who spent the whole night defending Donald Trump's division and failures.""

""On every single issue - the economy, health care, foreign policy, reproductive freedom, gun violence - Governor Walz won. He spoke passionately about the Vice President's vision for a new way forward for the country. And in what was the most critical moment of the entire debate, which came in its final exchange, he stood up for our Constitution, while JD Vance admitted he'd put Trump ahead of the country.""

O'Malley Dillon continued, ""The choice facing the American people in November was on full display tonight: between charting a new way forward, or going backwards. Vice President Harris believes that the American people deserve to see her and Trump on the debate stage one more time. She will be in Atlanta on October 23 - Donald Trump should step up and face the voters.""

The Trump campaign said in a statement that Vance ""unequivocally won tonight's debate in dominating fashion"" in what was ""the best debate performance from any Vice-Presidential candidate in history.""

""Senator Vance spoke the truth, eloquently prosecuted the case against Kamala Harris' failed record, and effectively held Governor Tim Walz accountable for his lies on behalf of the Harris-Biden Administration,"" Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said. ""Senator Vance also perfectly articulated the Trump-Vance vision to make America safe again with their plan to launch the largest mass deportation operation in history; to make America strong again with a peace through strength foreign policy agenda; and to make America wealthy again by cutting taxes, unleashing American energy dominance, and ending inflation.""

""Tonight, Senator Vance proved why President Trump chose him as his running mate. Together, they make the strongest and most dynamic presidential ticket ever, and they are going to win on November 5th."""

JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz's performances at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

The largely civil and arguably quite informative debate between Democratic nominee Gov. Tim Walz and Republican nominee Sen. JD Vance on Tuesday night has underscored one thing. We need another presidential debate.

Both Walz and Vance stuck to familiar positions on the issues on the debate stage, whether it was on the economy, health care, energy or immigration. No new ground was broken, no dramatic changes in policy were unveiled.

Still, the debate, in my estimation, was very important for a fundamental reason: it was civil, it was informative, and it included a surprisingly high degree of bipartisanship that has been noticeably absent from the 2024 presidential race.

It is certain that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump watched the debate. And both, I am sure, concluded that their respective running mates did an excellent job in both underscoring their core positions as well as attacking their rivals.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

But most importantly, on Tuesday night there was a comment that I think both candidates underscored in their own way: That we can do better as Americans, we can solve our problems and provide leadership as people who disagree, and sometimes vigorously, but have a broader purpose beyond our narrow partisan concerns.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

This is not simply a homily. It's much more. It is a large-scale call for a different kind of politics, even if implicitly made by both candidates, it is a recognition of the extraordinary challenges we face, both domestically and internationally, in the wake of Iran's attack on Israel. And most of all, it underscores to me why both presidential candidates need to quickly accept the invitation of various news networks for another debate or more debates in the final 35 days of this campaign.

It's virtually certain that no minds were changed on Tuesday night.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

To be sure, the pundits will be vetting what the candidates said or didn't say about immigration and abortion. Two topics on which they disagree vehemently. But the two vice presidential candidates were largely repeating and underscoring what their respective nominees have said and believe.

The key now is for the media to focus on what the American people want and require as this extraordinary race comes down to the finish line. The two presidential campaigns need to face off, at least once, if not more times, to discuss and debate their positions on the issues with a greater degree of specificity and precision than they have done previously.

The 2024 presidential race is now an effective statistical tie. This is especially true when one looks at the seven key swing states in this election. There is a degree of uncertainty about precisely where the candidates stand on the important issues facing our country after a raucous presidential debate last month that was more personally divisive than it was informative.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

For us to make an informed choice as Americans, we need to replicate what happened on Tuesday night with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The two presidential candidates need to tell us, in programmatic terms, what they will do on the economy, immigration, crime, health care, energy and, of course, on foreign affairs, a critical topic which did not get anywhere near the attention it deserved and required.

The level of dissatisfaction of the American electorate with the candidates and with the political process cannot be overestimated. We saw what the American people deserve but have not received until now in this presidential election.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

Both vice presidential candidates were likable on Tuesday night. Vance had heretofore not been seen that way. On the debate stage, it was hard not to empathize with him, even if you disagreed with him. Likewise, Walz delivered as a likable everyman figure.

I came away from the presidential debate last month not wanting to have dinner with either Trump or Harris. After the V.P. debate, I wanted to get to know both candidates better.

My takeaway from Tuesday night is that, for virtually the first time in this election cycle, Vance and Walz quietly acknowledged that the electorate requires something more before Election Day. It's up to Trump and Harris to give it to them--in person--at least one more time, if not more."

JD Vance addresses the Iran Nuclear Deal during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democrat vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced off Tuesday night in their first -- and only -- debate, sparring over issues from foreign policy to border security; abortion to climate change; and introducing themselves and their records to the American people with just five weeks to Election Day.

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5th, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs, on a day that began with nearly 50,000 unionized dock workers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a tough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

As for a preemptive strike, Vance said ""it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe.""

""And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys,"" Vance said.

Walz fired back, slamming the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" while saying Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

But Vance fired back.

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years? And the answer is, your running mate -- not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, said he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves ""when was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border -- a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no. told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking; some of them, hopefully are at homes with their families; some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules,"" Vance said. ""The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris's wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, you know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies. I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

Walz pushed back, saying children have not been used as ""drug mules,"" and defending Harris, saying she was attorney general in California and ""prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drugs.""

Walz also hit Vance over claims he had made about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, saying he had demonized them.

""Look in Springfield Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans,"" Vance said.

At that point, moderators tried to correct Vance--but the GOP vice presidential nominee pushed back, reminding that the moderators said they would not fact-check the candidates.

The moderators said that many Haitian residents in Springfield, Ohio have legal temporary status. Vance jumped in to ""say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process and tying it to a Harris-backed process, the moderators spoke over him, sarcastically thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

""We have so much we have to get to, thank you so much for explaining the legal process,"" Margaret Brennan said before asking her co-moderator to ask the next question.

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American People's Trust back on this issue, where they frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options right now.""

Vance echoed Trump's view of abortion--supporting the Supreme Court's decision to return the issue of abortion back to the states, while supporting exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.

""The proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions,"" Vance said. ""Let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big a very diverse. And let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.""

Meanwhile, the moderators switched to questions of leadership -- with the moderators pressing Walz on whether he was actually in China for the Tiananmen Square protests, like he claimed.

A visibly nervous Walz attempted to explain the discrepancy, ultimately saying he ""misspoke"" and was not there until later that year.

And the question for Vance was about his past criticisms of Trump.

Vance said, at the time, he disliked Trump because he ""believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record.""

""Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take-home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans, a secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on. And yeah, when you screw up, when you misspeak, when you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people about it,"" Vance said.

Meanwhile, Vance offered his sympathies to Walz during the section of the debate focused on gun violence, when he learned that Walz's son had witnessed a shooting.

Walz said his 17-year-old son ""witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball.""

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting. I'm sorry about that -- Christ, have mercy,"" Vance said.

The two spoke about school shootings and their plans to solve gun violence.

""We have to make the doors locked better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger, and of course, we've got to increase school resource officers. Because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience,"" Vance said.

Walz said the conversation was a good start but had to go further.

""Even though they have a high gun ownership rate in the country, there are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment. And the idea to have some of these weapons out there, it just doesn't make any sense,"" he said.

And on another top issue this cycle: democracy.

Vance was pushed on his past comments, in which he said he would not have voted to certify the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021.

Vance fired back at the assertion that Trump could pose a ""threat to democracy,"" saying that he believes ""we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country.""

""But unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about. It is the threat of censorship. It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics. It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens,"" Vance said.

Walz redirected the discussion back to Jan. 6, 2021, blasting Trump and Republicans for allegedly denying the events of that day.

""I will tell you this, that when this is over, we need to shake hands this election and the winner needs to be the winner. This has got to stop. It's tearing our country apart,"" Walz said.

But Vance replied, saying it is ""really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th.""

""As we have done for 250 years in this country, we are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election. And of course, I hope that we win, and I think we're going to win,"" Vance said. ""But if Tim Walz is the next vice president, he'll have my prayers. He'll have my best wishes and he'll have my help whenever he wants it.""

But Vance reminded Americans that ""for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections.""

""Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board,"" Vance said. ""But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor.""

As the debate came to a close, Vance and Walz both promised voters a new direction for the United States.

""Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward,"" Walz said. ""She's bringing us a politics of joy. She's bringing real solutions for the middle class. And she's centering you at the heart of that, all the while asking everyone, join this movement. Make your voices heard.""

Vance also gave a message of change to the voters.

""We need change. We need a new direction. We need a president who has already done this once before and did it well. Please vote for Donald Trump,"" Vance said. ""And whether you vote for me or vote for Tim Walz, I just want to say I'm so proud to be doing this and I'm rooting for you.

Walz came into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating. Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable.

Heading into the debate, Vance had been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Both running mates get right back on the campaign trail on Wednesday in two of the key seven battleground states that will likely determine whether Harris or Trump succeed President Biden in the White House.

Vance holds campaign events in Auburn Hills and Marne, Michigan. And Walz takes part in a campaign bus tour swing through parts of central Pennsylvania which kicks off at the airport in Harrisburg, the state capital."

Tim Walz, D-Minn., discusses abortion access during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz claimed during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws following the overturning of Roe, despite doctors previously denouncing such a narrative as ""fearmongering.""

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe versus Wade,"" he said.

Walz joined Ohio Sen. JD Vance in New York City on Tuesday evening where the pair squared off on key voter issues this election cycle, including the economy, immigration and abortion.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022. Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Members of the Democratic Party, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have cited their deaths as evidence for the need to expand abortion access following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""Good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy is about saying a healthcare provider will only start providing that care when you're about to die?"" Harris said during an Atlanta campaign event last month, while citing Thurman's death.

OB-GYNs have since criticized the narrative as a misleading story that is being pushed by the media and Democrats.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton have also come out to say they don't believe Georgia laws had anything to do with Thurman's death, but was instead caused by alleged complications from abortion pills, as doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

HARRIS CALLS FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 'ROE' ABORTION BILL INTO FEDERAL LAW

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

As Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced off in the Vice Presidential debate in New York City Tuesday, both parties took to social media to express support for their candidate, with Democrats fact checking Vance on every point.

Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg claimed Walz was ""laying down facts"" and that Vance was ""unaware"" that the U.S. energy production was up.

""Remarkable to see JD Vance pretend to be unaware that US energy production is up and US manufacturing is up dramatically right now, much higher than under Trump. Glad Tim Walz is laying down the facts here,"" Buttigieg wrote on X.

David Plouffe, campaign manager and White House Senior Advisor for Barack Obama and Senior Advisor for Kamala Harris for President called out Vance and said Walz hit his strongest win during the immigration portion.

""Gov Walz dominating JD Vance on the immigration exchange with undecided voters in a western battleground state. Reminding these voters Donald Trump built only 2 percent of the wall and Mexico didn't pay a dime strongest moment of the debate,"" Plouffe wrote.

TIM WALZ REVISES NUMBER OF TIMES HE WENT TO CHINA

California Gov. Gavin Newsom also fact checked Vance and said if he and Donald Trump were elected, American families would pay a high cost.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Vance made ""false"" claims about the Middle East.

""Vance says Trump ""restored deterrence"" in the Middle East. Totally false. Iran and its proxies weren't shooting at U.S. troops UNTIL Trump became President,"" Murphy wrote.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer applauded Walz for ""standing up for American workers.""

""Michigan remembers what happened under Donald Trump. Hundreds of thousands of jobs were lost across all industries, including manufacturing. The Biden-Harris administration was critical to bringing jobs back to Michigan.""

Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., alleged that Trump and Vance's ""Project 2025 agenda will raise costs on Arizona families while giving more tax breaks and power to big corporations.""

""@KamalaHarris and @Tim_Walz will lower costs and build an economy that works for all Americans.""

Project 2025 refers to a set of conservative policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation and has turned into a right-wing-'boogeyman' style Democratic talking point and fodder for Trump critics.

Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., accused Vice President Kamala Harris of breaking the economy during a heated exchange on ""The Breakfast Club,"" where he sparred with hosts over her role in handling the current inflation plaguing the U.S.

A discussion on Tuesday's episode of the show devolved into a fiery exchange between the lawmaker and the hosts after he blamed Harris for the failed economic policies of the Biden administration.

""I would argue we're not really thriving right now. This inflation, which by the way was brought to us by Kamala Harris, has really slowed people down from being able to excel,"" Donalds said.

""She broke the tie that started this inflation that has hurt so many people in our country,"" Donalds said.

Guest-host Angela Rye dismissed Byron's argument as ""not true.""

""You sure you want to go there?"" the Florida Republican shot back, pulling out a pamphlet of ""facts"" from his suit jacket to back up his claim as Rye tried to speak over him.

Donalds argued that experts anticipated ""massive inflation"" if the American Rescue Plan was passed.

""That's what happened,"" he said.

""The problem we have in our economy today is that prices have gone up massively, wages adjusted for inflation is down, people's pocketbooks are hurting,"" he continued.

Donalds asked co-host DJ Envy, whether he would hire someone who broke a house to fix more houses.

When Rye wondered how his question was pertinent to the topic at hand, Donalds shot back, ""Chill, Angela.""

""Because I'm bringing facts...so now you don't want to do it anymore? C'mon Angela, that's not right. I want to have a fact-based conversation,"" Donalds said.

Donalds posted a clip of the exchange on X later Tuesday, writing ""Democrat economists warned her it would cause inflation. And it did...It caused 20+% inflation. It created a cost-of-living crisis. It crushed hardworking Americans. Kamala broke our economy.""

A new report disclosed that President Biden is feeling left out in the cold by the Democratic Party after going all in on Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.

According to the Monday NBC News report, Biden has mentioned to his allies his feeling that his accomplishments and legacy as president are being forgotten by the party, especially as Harris has tried to distance herself away from her boss' policies and forge her own political identity after replacing him on the Democratic presidential ticket.

""President Joe Biden has privately complained to allies that his name and his accomplishments have virtually disappeared from the national conversation and about how quickly the party that he has served for more than five decades appears to have moved on from him, according to six people familiar with his comments,"" the piece reported.

PELOSI DEMURS ON IF 'EVERYTHING IS OK' BETWEEN HER AND BIDEN: 'YOU'D HAVE TO ASK HIM'

According to these sources, the president has commented on Harris not mentioning him during recent campaign speeches, noting that he believes she should acknowledge his economic accomplishments while touting her own vision on the issue.

""Biden has noted at times that Vice President Kamala Harris... hasn't been mentioning him in her campaign speeches lately, including when she talks about an economy he believes his policies set on a positive trajectory, these people said,"" according to NBC.

Additionally, the sources told NBC that Biden ""was particularly stung"" by Harris' recent line during her debate with former President Trump in which she drew a stark distinction between her and her boss.

""Clearly, I am not Joe Biden. And I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country,"" the vice president said during the debate, drawing a stark contrast between her and Biden's policies, as Trump was trying to grill her over the current administration's record.

Those familiar with Biden's feelings on the matter acknowledged that he still wants Harris to win and ""that he plans to do whatever he can to help her,"" the report noted.

An anonymous senior Harris campaign official said that Biden ""always just says to her, 'The most important thing is that you win.'"" The official added, ""We have to tell people who she is and what she would do.""

They also noted, ""There wasn't a real interest in hearing about [Biden's] accomplishments when he was running. That's still the case.""

However, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates denied the claims made by these sources, telling the outlet, ""These uninformed claims are the polar opposite of the truth.""

""President Biden welcomes the strong response the American people are having to Vice President Harris' leadership and to policies that move us into the future, away from dangerous agendas from the past like MAGAnomics and abortion bans,"" Bates added.

The spokesperson doubled down on his rejection of these claims, telling Fox News Digital they are ""not"" true.

The sources have said that Biden understands the political reasoning behind shifting away from his record, though they noted it still ""frustrates him at times.""

""But while Biden is attuned to political realities, he also has expressed a range of emotions about his exit from the race -- from feeling his legacy rests on a Harris victory to anguishing over his imprint's vanishing from the national stage, according to the people familiar with his private comments,"" the article stated.

One source described his mixed emotions on the issue, stating, ""It's very complex.""

Another Harris campaign official defended Harris' pivot away from Biden, telling NBC, ""She has to become her own person. She needs to do that to win.""

Despite Biden's acceptance of Harris' candidacy, he maintains that he would have beaten Trump in November if he was still in the race. He told the co-hosts of ""The View"" last week that he was ""confident"" he could have beaten Trump and said he didn't sense an ""overwhelming reluctance"" about his re-election effort from fellow Democrats.

""I was confident I would beat Trump -- he's a loser,"" he declared.

Taylor Lorenz leaves Washington Post following her Biden 'war criminal' post controversy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/taylor-lorenz-leaves-washington-post-following-biden-war-criminal-controversy,2024-10-01T16:27:28Z,"Washington Post tech and online culture reporter Taylor Lorenz skewered Elon Musk's management of Twitter, calling ""disaster"" during a recent interview on BBC World News.

Reporter Taylor Lorenz announced she left The Washington Post on Tuesday after being absent for weeks following a viral controversy involving her calling President Biden a ""war criminal.""

Lorenz went viral in August after a screenshot obtained by the New York Post's Jon Levine appeared to show her calling President Biden a ""war criminal"" in an Instagram post while attending a White House event. Lorenz initially implied the caption was edited by someone else before admitting that she shared the post herself.

As part of the launch of her User Magazine Substack, she explained ""why I'm leaving legacy media,"" saying her type of reporting ""has become increasingly difficult to do in corporate media.""

The Post confirmed her exit.

WASHINGTON POST'S TAYLOR LORENZ SAYS BIDEN 'WAR CRIMINAL' POST WAS 'OBVIOUS MEME' AFTER CLAIMING IT WAS EDITED

""We are grateful for the work Taylor has produced at The Washington Post. She has resigned to pursue a career in independent journalism, and we wish her the best,"" a spokesperson for The Washington Post told Fox News Digital.

For several weeks, The Post remained mum about whether Lorenz had been suspended from the paper over the controversy. Lorenz had not had anything published since Aug. 7. A spokesperson from the paper previously said it was ""looking into"" Lorenz's post but did not provide any updates until Oct. 1, confirming Lorenz's exit from the paper.

WASHINGTON POST LOOKING INTO ALLEGATIONS TAYLOR LORENZ PUBLISHED INSTAGRAM POST CALLING BIDEN A 'WAR CRIMINAL'

Lorenz previously told Fox News Digital that she was on an overseas vacation and implied she would be back to work at The Post the week of Sept. 30.

Meanwhile, Lorenz has remained active via her personal Substack newsletter as well as her podcast, which is produced by Vox.

It remains unclear whether Lorenz was officially suspended over her Instagram post.

The controversy began when Lorenz attended the White House Creator Economy Conference last month, where Biden made an appearance.

In the viral image shared by Levine, a masked Lorenz was seen taking a selfie with Biden speaking in the background. Included was a caption that read ""War criminal"" with a frowny face.

Fox News Digital learned the post was made in an Instagram story specifically using the ""close friends"" feature as indicated by the green star icon, meaning it was not posted publicly and could only have been seen by a select group of Instagram users of her choosing.

WAPO REPORTER SUGGESTS WHITE HOUSE CENSOR 'MISINFORMATION' FROM TRUMP-MUSK INTERVIEW DURING PRESS BRIEFING

Lorenz initially denied the post's authenticity, replying to Levine, ""You people will fall for any dumba-- edit someone makes.""

However, not only did Lorenz later admit it was real, she insisted it was a joke.

""I literally never denied it was real,'"" Lorenz told one critic on X. She told another that it was an ""obvious meme.""

There had been speculation online that Lorenz was making an obscure reference to musician Lucy Dacus, who called former President Obama a ""war criminal"" on social media last year, also with a frowny face.

NPR previously reported that ""four people with direct knowledge"" of the post ""confirmed its authenticity.""

""Only about 7 people saw the actual close friends post (I have very few people on CF) and almost all are my normie non-media friends. So [I don't know] who this guy is talking about [to be honest],"" Lorenz reacted to NPR's reporting.

Biden has been repeatedly attacked by the far-left for his handling of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, with many deriding him as ""Genocide Joe"" for continuing to provide military aid to the Jewish State following the Oct. 7 terrorist attack.

"Queen Elizabeth II had 'form of bone cancer' before her death, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson claims",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/queen-elizabeth-ii-had-form-bone-cancer-before-her-death-former-prime-minister-boris-johnson-claims,2024-10-01T16:18:53Z,"Fox News host Martha MacCallum reflects on Queen Elizabeth II's life, her impact on the United Kingdom and the world.

Former United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson is revealing alleged private information about the death of Queen Elizabeth II.

Her Majesty, who passed away in September 2022, was battling ""a form of bone cancer,"" according to Johnson, and had known by the summer ""she was going.""

Official documents released after the queen's death confirmed the cause as old age. She was 96.

Johnson wrote about this in his forthcoming book, ""Unleashed,"" where he recounts his final interactions with the queen. In an excerpt obtained by the Daily Mail, Johnson wrote that he visited the queen at her Balmoral residence just two days before the U.K.'s longest reigning monarch died. Earlier that summer, Johnson had resigned from Parliament.

""Like all my 13 predecessors, I had come to spend the last hour of my premiership in the company of Queen Elizabeth II. The date was September 6, 2022, more than two months after I had resigned as prime minister, and under our ­system I had been required to stay on and mind the shop while the Conservative Party got on with choosing a new leader.

""It had been a rather frustrating summer,"" he wrote.

Once at Balmoral with his wife, Carrie, Johnson could sense lingering fatigue among the staff.

""Edward Young, her private secretary, tried to prepare me,"" Johnson wrote, according to the outlet. ""I had known for a year or more that she had a form of bone cancer, and her doctors were worried that at any time she could enter a sharp decline.""

Rumors that the queen battled myeloma, a bone marrow cancer, during the last years of her life have never been confirmed, although reported.

When reached for comment by Fox News Digital, Buckingham Palace said, ""We will not be offering guidance or comments on this, and this should not be seen as guidance of fact.""

Johnson wrote that Young told him the queen had ""gone down quite a bit over the summer."" When they met, Johnson wrote, ""she seemed pale and more stooped, and she had dark ­bruising on her hands and wrists, probably from drips or injections.""

""But her mind - as Edward had also said - was completely ­unimpaired by her illness, and from time to time in our ­conversation she still flashed that great white smile in its sudden mood-lifting beauty.""

Johnson wrote of his close relationship with the queen, admitting ""there was nothing I could not tell her."" He remembered lamenting about the COVID-19 pandemic, how it had impacted individuals and also the economy.

""'Oh well,'"" Johnson remembers the queen saying. ""'I suppose we will all just have to start again.'""

""I realized that she spoke with the historical knowledge of someone who had actually served in uniform in the Second World War, and whose first PM was Winston Churchill. She knew her kingdom was infinitely capable of rebounding and recovering. We just needed to get a grip, and get on with it,"" Johnson wrote, according to Daily Mail.

Johnson said that the queen's secretary later explained to him, ""she had known all ­summer that she was going, but was determined to hang on and do her last duty: to oversee the peaceful and orderly transition from one government to the next - and, I expect, to add another departing PM to her record-breaking tally."""
Some Biden 2020 voters say they don't know enough about Kamala Harris,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/some-biden-2020-voters-say-dont-know-enough-kamala-harris,2024-10-01T14:33:38Z,"Fox News contributor Mary Katharine Ham and Democratic strategist Tim Hogan analyze Vice President Kamala Harris' 'easy' interview with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle.

Some Biden 2020 voters still want to know more about Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the election, telling the New York Times that they don't know enough about the Democratic nominee's policies.

""I need to hear more from Kamala Harris in terms of what she wants to do. I hear a lot from Trump, and I agree with some of his policies, but I don't like his character. And I think I need to hear a little bit more from her for her to win my vote,"" Prince, a Democratic North Carolina voter, told the Times.

The New York Times spoke to 15 voters that voted for President Biden in 2020 in a Times Opinion focus group. While some said they still wanted more from Harris, by the end of the discussion, only three voters remained truly undecided between Harris and former President Trump.

""I don't know that there's much that Trump could say, because we already know what he's like. I think for Harris, if she came out with a more specific outline of some of her policies and if I heard some policies that aren't too good to be true, like the $25,000 home-buyer tax credit,"" a North Carolina Republican voter said.

72 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS YET TO DO A FORMAL PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE EMERGING AS DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

The third person who was undecided, a 35-year-old Independent voter from Georgia, said he wanted to know more about Harris' plan for immigration and her economic policies.

The voter also said that he would be more invested in the vice presidential debate and hopes Gov. Tim Walz will be able to talk about Harris' policies in more detail.

An Independent voter from Nevada said while she leaned more towards Harris, she pulled back a bit because she didn't ""know enough about her.""

However, at the end of the discussion, the voter did not say she remained undecided.

The New York Times' moderator of the discussion, Magie Omero, asked the group what they liked best and least about the vice president and the former president.

One Michigan voter said what he liked best about Harris was that she was not Trump. Another said Harris is smart and ""relatable."" Others likened Trump to a dictator, and many suggested he was ""self-centered.""

""I don't feel like she's had time to set herself apart from what Biden's been doing for the last four years. For the most part, she's run with a similar plan. I don't know that that's the best plan,"" one of the Republican voters from North Carolina said, responding to the question about what they like least about Harris.

Another Republican voter agreed and added, ""She gives the impression of a fresh perspective, but I don't think we've had enough time to actually get details as to what that perspective is.""

A Democratic Pennsylvania voter agreed with both Republicans and said they didn't know enough about Harris' agenda.

When asked if they were happy that Harris was the Democratic nominee, multiple people said they were not satisfied, as Harris is the current vice president.

""I'm not that satisfied. She has been the vice president for the past four years and not really implemented anything. I wish the economy were better, and I heard she was in charge of border issues. We could have done a little bit better for a Democratic candidate,"" one Wisconsin Democrat said. She also said Harris was ""wishy-washy."""
Fox News Power Rankings: Trump maintains lead on 2 top issues ahead of VP debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/power-rankings-trump-maintains-lead-two-top-issues-ahead-vp-debate,2024-10-01T13:08:36Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance are hours away from the first and only vice presidential debate.

As the latest Fox News Power Rankings reveal, Vance starts the evening with a lead on the economy and immigration, while Walz has an advantage on abortion.

Vice presidential hopefuls do not attract as much attention as their bosses when they debate, but as Fox News' Arnon Mishkin argued Monday, they have changed the direction of at least six elections in the last 50 years.

In most cases, these debates are won on policy. Voters are not as familiar with these nominees as they are with former President Donald Trump or even Vice President Kamala Harris, and they do not need to make their choice.

The smart play for these vice presidential candidates is to focus on the major issues at stake and how their administrations would solve them.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS TICKS UP AND SENATE REPUBLICANS TAKE CHARGE

That is especially true for Walz on the economy and immigration, since the Harris campaign continues to lag on those issues. Vance, meanwhile, has struggled with poor favorability ratings, so his challenge is to hammer the popular parts of the Trump agenda and avoid wading into the culture war trenches.

There are also style points up for grabs. Many voters will only ever see this debate in short clips on social media, so acting like a policy wonk is less likely than ever to get the job done.

Trump continues to hold an advantage on two of the top three issues in this campaign. He leads on the economy by nine points and immigration by 11.

Those numbers have barely budged since Harris and Trump debated. In August, when the Power Rankings last looked at the major issues, the former president led on the economy by eight and immigration by 13.

Harris is far out in front on abortion. She leads by 17 points on that issue, also a negligible movement since the last tracker (Harris +18).

This tracker includes polls from Fox News, Quinnipiac, CNN/SSRS, NBC News and the New York Times/Siena.

Trump lost a point in the horse race after his debate with Harris while the vice president gained one; these modest shifts mirrored those after the first debate in 2020.

Together, these results suggest that the cause of Trump's slight decline was style rather than substance.

Conversely, while Harris won the debate and held on to her advantage on abortion, she has not consistently closed the issues gap, particularly on immigration.

That is not ideal for her, given the economy (38%) and immigration (17%) are two of the top three issues for voters. A recent Fox News national survey showed those issues and abortion (16%) were the only three that a double-digit percentage of voters called their ""most important"" issue in deciding their vote.

According to the same survey, Harris has strong leads in issues outside the top three. That includes health care, helping the middle class and climate change. These are ""bread and butter"" issues that the left has relied on to drag out base voters in previous elections.

The Democratic candidate also has a lead in uniting the country and, as consistent with previous trackers, having the right temperament for the job.

The candidates are evenly divided on national security. Neither has an advantage in handling a crisis that puts the country at risk, being commander in chief or decisions about using nuclear weapons. Trump's temperament deficit should give Harris an opportunity to lead on some of these qualities, but that has not materialized.

ARNON MISHKIN: JD VANCE IS AN EXCELLENT DEBATER AND PRACTICES FOR THE DEBATE EVERY SUNDAY

Finally, voters prefer Trump on foreign policy. He has a six-point lead in handling the Israel/Hamas war and an eight-point lead on the Ukraine/Russia war.

Tuesday is debate night. Walz and Vance will face off at an event hosted by CBS News in New York City. Fox News will simulcast the debate with special coverage anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum at 8:20 p.m. ET.

Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate to be moderated by MacCallum and Baier in October.

Walz's debate performance expectations lowered ahead of showdown with Vance: 'Still largely untested',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/walzs-debate-performance-expectations-lowered-ahead-showdown-vance-still-largely-untested,2024-10-01T12:55:37Z,"A 'Fox News Live' political panel provided its expectations ahead of the vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz, as well as its views on the border issue.

Some Democratic allies of Gov. Tim Walz are concerned about how he will fare in the vice presidential debate between him and Sen. JD Vance, worrying that the Minnesota governor remains untested.

""We've never seen him on the national scale before,"" a Minnesota Democrat told Politico. The outlet reported that Vance hasn't been tested in a scenario like a debate, where he will face direct questioning and attacks from the other side.

Walz and Vance are set to clash on Tuesday during the first vice presidential debate, which will be moderated by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan.

""He can be very: 'That's it I'm done,'"" a Minnesota state lawmaker told the outlet. Politico reported that Walz shuts down conversations and gets defensive when he's asked to discuss ""missteps"" in private, and it noted Walz was ""still largely untested and has never faced the intense, direct questioning that Vance is sure to launch.""

HARRIS 2024 SENIOR CAMPAIGN ADVISER PREVIEWS UPCOMING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'TWO VERY DIFFERENT VISIONS'

""She did so strong. She's actually made it very difficult for Walz, because I don't see any way that he could match her level of intensity and humor,"" another ally of the Minnesota governor said, noting Vice President Kamala Harris' debate performance against former President Trump that received high media praise.

Harris' inner circle reportedly discussed Walz's habit of being ""gruff and brass,"" Politico reported, while they were vetting him.

According to the outlet, a Minnesota lawmaker recalled Walz saying ""'Alright, I've done all the answering I'm going to do. Meeting's over,'"" when he was asked about questions he didn't want to talk about.

A Democratic lawmaker described a call with Walz in 2020 amid the George Floyd riots, during which Walz reportedly ""signaled he was done with the conversation,"" after he was pressed on why he didn't call the National Guard in sooner.

""I don't think he hung up, but definitely that was it. The call was over,"" the Democratic lawmaker said.

""At times, he could be the exact opposite of what he usually is. That was one of them,"" the person told Politico.

Politico also reported that Walz struggled to explain Harris' economic agenda and kept repeating the words ""opportunity economy."" The report said it came off as vague to those in attendance.

MSNBC's Claire McCaskill, a former Democratic senator, said during an interview on Monday that expectations for the VP debates should be ""lowered.""

""I'm just a little worried about the expectations game at this point. I think people -- yes, J.D. Vance has said some really, I think, disqualifying things about women and how he views people and their role in life. But he will be articulate and he will be prepared and he will be better than Trump was,"" she said.

McCaskill said it would be a ""challenge"" for Walz to be able to counter Vance and ""stay really likable and relatable.""

""I just think we need to lower expectations a little bit, because then we can all be pleasantly surprised if I'm wrong and that Tim Walz just mops the floor with him the same way Kamala Harris mopped the floor with Donald Trump,"" McCaskill added.

Black voters across several states spoke with Fox News Digital about whether they were far better off 4 years ago under former President Trump. Voters from Atlanta, Chicago, and Detroit shared if their financial situations had improved or gotten worse since the Biden-Harris administration took over.

One Black man from Chicago said that he has been ""shaking"" under the current economy.

""[The economy has gotten] really moreso worse. A lot of stuff hasn't really been getting better,"" Emmanuel told Fox News Digital. ""Everything went up.""

""Inflation has been terrible. And the person that was in the office there, he wasn't really doing too much for us,"" Atlanta resident Marcellus said.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

""When Trump was in office, it was gas prices that were lower,"" he added.

However, several voters said because Harris has not served as president, led them to believe she still has a chance to prove herself.

""Kamala, from my understanding, has never really been in office as the president like that ... she has been vice president,"" said Porter, a student at Harold Washington College in Chicago.

Porter, who lived in the Windy City his entire life, said ""I would say that I would have no answer for that. But I believe that when Kamala is elected towards office, her policies and what she believes in will better fit my needs as a person.""

Anneliese, another Chicago resident, said that she ""was absolutely not better under the Trump presidency.""

""Well, I wasn't under Kamala's leadership as president. I was under her vice presidency, so she was never president. Some people also get that messed up,"" she said. ""Ever since Trump started running, I experienced a lot more ... racial discrimination, gender discrimination. And I can't speak to the Kamala presidency because she hasn't been president yet.""

In Atlanta, Tim, raised the fact that Harris has never served as president.

""That's a question that we don't know yet. Right? Kamala not even in office yet, so we can't speak on it,"" Tim said. ""We just want to speak from what we can see, we have experience living under. So I guess you won't have to just wait for Kamala and see what Trump did.""

'HE HAS A WAY OF CONNECTING WITH OUR PEOPLE': SOUTHSIDE CHICAGO RESIDENT BELIEVES TRUMP IS GAINING SUPPORT

Over in Michigan, Black voters weighed in on whether they were better off under either candidate, with one of them saying that Harris ""did not do anything.""

Ithmamqureshi told Fox News Digital that he was better off under Trump.""Obviously, life was better and all that,"" Ithmamqureshi, a student in Detroit and Hamtramck native, told Fox News Digital. ""The economy was better ... life was better. COVID did take a hit and change everything to the fullest. But I would say life was better before 2020.""

""I want be biased, but I want to say I think its time for history to be made. I just think that its going to be a woman president,"" Detroit resident Mandela said.

""Trump. Them [stimulus checks] was fire tho,"" east side Detroit resident Keandre said. ""Definitely, when Trump was in office, it was gas prices that were lower."""

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 72 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Trump held his third news conference since the beginning of August last month in California, taking the opportunity to roast his opponent's home state and hold forth on a number of topics, including crime, immigration and inflation.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey last month at a star-studded campaign event.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

""Real Time"" host Bill Maher appeared shocked by MSNBC's softball interview with Vice President Kamala Harris, taking a swipe at his recent guest Stephanie Ruhle.

She said 'Ok, I will answer your hardball questions.' So she went on MSNBC,"" Maher quipped during his opening monologue Friday night.

Ruhle appeared on ""Real Time"" just days before she landed the interview with the vice president where she defended Harris not answering tough policy questions.

""Kamala Harris is not running for perfect. She's running against Trump,"" Ruhle said to Maher. ""We have two choices. And so there are some things you might not know her answer to. And in 2024, unlike 2016 for a lot of the American people, we know exactly what Trump will do, who he is and the kind of threat he is to democracy.""

""What I didn't hear from her was divisive language,"" Ruhle told her MSNBC colleague Nicolle Wallace. ""Imagine if I was sitting against Donald Trump, imagine the language he would be using, please! And just the fact that we were talking about collaborative inclusivity -- I don't know. Vote for her or don't vote for her, but isn't it great to just have a positive conversation right now?""

Ruhle admitted that Harris didn't answer a question about how she would get the funding for her ambitious economic agenda without Congress, but quickly defended her by saying Trump would ""balloon"" the deficit ""significantly bigger than Vice President Harris will.""

She went on to say it's ""okay"" for Harris not to offer specifics about her policy proposals and shrugged off the non-answers as her simply being a ""politician.""

Crypto.com Sues SEC To Fight Gary Gensler's Ongoing Crypto Crackdown,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2024/10/08/cryptocom-sues-sec-to-fight-gary-genslers-ongoing-crypto-crackdown/,2024-10-08T23:01:36Z,"In a decisive move, cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following the agency's issuance of a Wells Notice, according to the legal filing. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent what the company describes as an unlawful expansion of the SEC's jurisdiction -- led by its chair, Gary Gensler, to include secondary market sales of cryptographically secured digital assets. A Wells Notice signals the SEC's intent to pursue formal enforcement action against a regulated party.

Rather than waiting for any formal action, Crypto.com is challenging what it considers a significant overreach by the SEC. In an official statement, the company explained: ""We are doing this to protect the future of the crypto industry in the U.S., joining peers who are defending themselves and taking action against a misguided federal agency acting beyond its authority under the law.""

In addition to its lawsuit, Crypto.com's affiliate, Crypto.com | Derivatives North America (CDNA), has filed a petition with both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC. The petition seeks clarification on whether certain cryptocurrency derivative products fall under the sole jurisdiction of the CFTC. Crypto.com explained that this action is part of a broader effort to bring regulatory certainty to the industry by encouraging joint rulemaking between the two agencies.

The declaratory lawsuit against the SEC is not an isolated event. Crypto.com joins other companies, such as ConsenSys, a leading Ethereum software and technology incubator company, in challenging the SEC's authority. Recent developments have amplified concerns about the regulator's conduct. In March, a federal judge ruled that the SEC had engaged in ""gross abuse of the power entrusted to it by Congress"" during its dispute with blockchain firm Digital Licensing (operating as DEBT Box). In that case, the judge criticized the SEC for acting in ""bad faith"" and ""deliberately perpetuating falsehoods"" in its efforts to secure an asset freeze against the company.

ConsenSys has also been involved in a legal challenge against the SEC. The company filed a lawsuit after being added to the SEC's list of crypto investigation targets. However, the case was dismissed by a Texas court after the SEC closed its Ethereum probe earlier in the year. The court ruled that, with no immediate threat from the SEC, the lawsuit was unwarranted. Despite this, ConsenSys' lawsuit underscores the ongoing tension between the SEC and the crypto industry over regulatory overreach.

ConsenSys has been pushing for a balanced regulatory framework to support blockchain growth and ensure U.S. leadership in Web3 innovation. Joe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of ConsenSys, emphasized the importance of regulatory clarity, warning that the SEC's ""reckless approach"" threatens the future of Ethereum and U.S. competitiveness in emerging technologies. Lubin also emphasized the importance of regulatory clarity for the future of Ethereum and U.S. technological leadership: ""Ethereum is a world-changing technology, and ether itself has the potential to be a significant driver of the U.S. economy of the future. Unlawful SEC regulation, however, threatens to jeopardize this potential and impedes the U.S.'s ability to use blockchain technology as the basis for countless new innovations and technologies -- even as other nations race ahead.""

Both ConsenSys and Crypto.com argue that unchecked SEC overreach risks undermining U.S. leadership in the digital economy, with their legal actions calling for a more appropriate regulatory approach from the SEC and Congress.

A key case in the ongoing regulatory battle between the crypto industry and the SEC is Ripple's legal fight over whether its XRP token constitutes a security. Ripple initially scored a partial victory in 2023 when a federal court ruled that XRP tokens, when sold to retail investors via exchanges, were not securities. However, the court did determine that institutional sales of XRP were unregistered securities, leading Ripple to pay a $125 million penalty -- far less than the $2 billion the SEC sought.

In October 2024, the SEC appealed the decision, reigniting the legal battle. In response, Ripple's Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, commented via X (formerly Twitter) the appeal is ""disappointing, but not surprising."" The appeal has already caused XRP's price to drop, and it may impact efforts like Bitwise's recent filing for the first spot XRP ETF, which now faces uncertain approval.

Ripple's case is pivotal in the broader fight against SEC overreach, as its outcome could further shape the regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S.

Crypto.com's lawsuit comes during Chair Gensler's increasingly controversial tenure concerning digital assets. His enforcement-driven approach, often labeled as ""regulation by enforcement,"" has sparked high-profile clashes with major crypto companies, including OpenSea, Ripple Labs, and now Crypto.com. Critics assert that Gensler's actions diverge from the SEC's mission to protect investors and ensure fair markets. Even members of the five-member commission agree.

Crypto.com's legal filing contends that the SEC has ""unilaterally expanded its jurisdiction beyond statutory limits."" The company challenges the SEC's classification of nearly all digital assets as securities, excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), even though these assets are ""sold in an identical manner"" to others the SEC seeks to regulate. Crypto.com emphasized that the SEC's rulemaking failed to undergo the required notice-and-comment process, labeling the SEC's approach as ""arbitrary and capricious.""

Crypto.com's lawsuit follows several high-profile legal challenges to the SEC's tactics. In the DEBT Box case, Chief District Judge Robert Shelby sanctioned the SEC for acting in ""bad faith"" and ""deliberately perpetuating falsehoods"" in an attempt to freeze the company's assets. While the sanctions didn't address the merits of the case, they underscored growing judicial concerns about the SEC's handling of digital assets.

Ripple's ongoing legal battle with the SEC also highlights this skepticism. Although Ripple initially won a partial victory in 2023 when the court ruled that XRP sales to retail investors were not securities, the SEC's appeal in 2024 has renewed the fight. Ripple's case, alongside Crypto.com's lawsuit, reflects broader resistance to what many see as the SEC's regulatory overreach.

Crypto.com, like ConsenSys and others, seeks judicial clarity to limit the SEC's expansive interpretation of its jurisdiction over digital assets. By suing preemptively, these companies hope to establish clearer rules for the industry and rein in the SEC's enforcement-driven approach. The rules -in the form of legislation -- that has yet to come from Congress.

One of the most significant outcomes of Crypto.com's lawsuit could be the judiciary's growing role in shaping the regulatory landscape for digital assets. Federal courts have already weighed in on key crypto cases, such as Ripple Labs, ConsenSys, and DEBT Box, scrutinizing the SEC's actions. The outcome of Crypto.com's case could set a crucial legal precedent, determining whether digital assets like the ""network tokens"" sold on its platform are securities under U.S. law.

Crypto.com's lawsuit marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing battle over crypto regulation. By challenging the SEC's authority, the company is not only defending its operations but also contributing to the broader push for regulatory clarity in the crypto space. As the company stated, ""We believe that security and compliance are the foundations of achieving mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, and all of what we do is done with safety, security, and compliance at the core.""

As the judiciary assumes a more central role in defining the future of digital assets, the stakes are high for both the SEC and the crypto industry. A favorable ruling for Crypto.com could restrict the SEC's ability to regulate secondary sales of digital assets, providing a significant boost to the industry. Conversely, a ruling in favor of the SEC could further empower the agency's enforcement-driven approach, leaving the industry with even more uncertainty."

The objective of the bigger-than-expected rate cut was to avert a recession, when a weaker-than-expected July jobs report officially triggered the Sahm Rule-a historical recession indicator that has a consistent 100% (well, almost) accuracy rate for every recession since the early 1970s. This gives rise to a few questions like:

The Federal Reserve launched its interest rate cut cycle on September 18, by aggressively slashing 50 basis points off benchmark rates, lowering the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%. The federal funds rate represents the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans to fulfill their reserve requirements. Banks are mandated by law to hold a reserve equal to a specific percentage of their deposits, referred to as the reserve requirement to ensure that bank is capable of meeting sudden withdrawals.

This is the first rate cut in four years since the Fed's emergency response to pandemic shutdowns in March 2020. Another half-percentage point reduction before this year-end is likely in the cards with an additional percentage-point cut anticipated in 2025.

The Fed raised interest rates from March 2022 to July 2023, to ease inflation that surged to the highest levels in more than four decades. In June 2022, inflation in the U.S. reached a whopping 9.1%, as prices and demand soared amid pandemic-disrupted supply constraints and unprecedented government stimulus programs that pumped about $5 trillion into the economy. When inflation shoots up, the Fed Reserve typically steps in to cool the inflation by raising interest rates and making borrowing more expensive. This brings down spending and demand thereby inflation.

The corollary to rising interest rates is an increase in borrowing costs for businesses as well, which in turn triggers cost-cutting, slowdown in expansion initiatives, layoffs and lesser new hires. This leads to an increase in the unemployment rate, which was 4.1% in September, up from 3.8% in the same month last year. A rise in unemployment rate alongside a slowdown in hiring has renewed recession concerns.

With the half-a-percentage cut, the Fed is hoping for a soft landing, a scenario in which the economy slows sufficiently to reduce inflation without entering a recession. The Fed's mandate is to restore price stability, while trying not to increase unemployment, even as its 2% inflation target appears within reach. Experts opine that a soft landing is plausible but far from guaranteed.

The current inflation rate is 2.5%, the lowest since February 2021, and lower than the long-term average of 3.28%. The fact that the Fed did not wait until the 2% inflation target was hit clearly shows where its priorities lie now-to avoid a recession.

Historically accurate and reliable recession indicators like the Sahm Rule are now facing skepticism because the pandemic has disrupted normal business activity and complicated forecasting efforts. The Sahm Rule, named after former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, states that a recession may happen when the three-month moving average of the national unemployment rate rises by 0.50 percentage points or more when compared to its low during the previous 12 months. The Sahm Rule has maintained an impressive accuracy rate of nearly 100% for every recession since the early 1970s. The only exception occurred in November 1976, when the rule was triggered without a corresponding or subsequent recession.

The Sahm Rule reading was 0.53% for July when the unemployment rate hit 4.3%. However, the rule's inventor Sahm herself rebutted the surge of catastrophic narratives, stating that ""I am not concerned that, at this moment, we are in a recession."" in an interview with Fortune. However, she also added later ""I think the recession odds, given what we're seeing in the labor market, are increasing."" While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was slightly dismissive of the Sahm Rule as more of a ""statistical regularity"" than an ""economic rule."" Sahm believes the rule shouldn't be dismissed as it's been very accurate over time and noted that ""recessions can build slowly, and then come quickly.""

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dipped from 4.3% in July to 4.2% in August and 4.1% in September showing improvements ahead of the upcoming elections in November. In September, the U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs exceeding estimates for 150,000 new jobs. The upbeat September jobs report should silence concerns about an impending disaster at least for now.

Nevertheless, unemployment rates will be a key data point to watch going forward. Any material rise in unemployment and fall in hiring may likely hit consumer spending, which has thus far been resilient because of strong wage gains. It is natural for people to cut back on spending when facing unemployment or the threat of losing a job.

High interest rates incentivize the consumer to save money, while lower interest rates tend to influence the consumer to borrow, spend and invest. Consumer spending is the main driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

Fed rate cuts are expected to be most impactful for credit cards that have variable interest rates. The previous Fed rate hike cycle has pushed the variable interest rates on credit cards close to all-time highs of above 21% currently, from around 14.6% in March 2022 when the rate hikes began. As the rate cut cycle unfolds, credit card rates will likely ease below 20%, offering some degree of relief for borrowers.

Mortgage rates for both 15-year and 30-year fixed loans are typically linked to Treasury yields and the overall economy, are likely to decrease slightly but are unlikely to return to the lows seen in the last decade. Currently, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage hovers around 6.2%. Experts predict these rates will remain between 6% and 6.5%, with the possibility of dipping below 6%. However, elevated home prices may still deter potential home buyers.

Auto loans are fixed with the average rate on a five-year new car loan being 6.8% in the second quarter, sharply higher than the 4% levels at the beginning of rate hikes. While the easing of rates may encourage car buyers who have pushed-out on purchases, the limiting factor could still be higher vehicle prices and lack of incentives for buyers.

The fixed nature of Federal student loan rates also means that a rate cut may have no impact on these borrowers, because these interest rates don't change over the loan term.

Savings rates have benefitted from the rate hike cycle. A high-yield savings account (HYSA) offers nearly 5% interest, while top interest rates from certificate of deposit (CD) instruments range from 4.00% to 5%. While these interest rates could decline, the opportunity still exists to secure a HYSA or CD before rates drop further.

A research study by Hartford Funds shows that 7 of the 11 Fed rate cutting periods from 1980 to 2024 were accompanied by recessions. While recession is not a desirable condition, how does it impact the stock market? Here are some interesting observations.

An analysis by Hartford Funds of 22 Fed rate-cutting cycles since 1928 revealed that the S&P 500 benchmark index on average outperformed government bonds and corporate bonds in the 12 months after the Fed started cutting interest rates. The average 12-month real return (after adjusting for inflation) from the date of first rate cut for U.S. stocks (represented by the S&P 500 index) has been 11% vs. 5% returns for government bonds and 6% returns for corporate bonds and 2% returns for cash.

The average returns of the stock market in the 22 rate cut cycles is even more impressive considering that in 16 out of 22 cycles the U.S. economy was already in a recession when the rate cuts were initiated or entered a recession within a 12 month period.

During the non-recessionary, rate-cut cycles the stock market returned a solid 17% on average (in the 12-month period after the first rate cut) vs. 2% for government bonds, 4% for corporate bonds and 3% for cash. In the event of a recessionary, rate-cut period, the stock market still returned a positive 8% on average vs. 7% for government and corporate bonds and 2 % for cash (in the 12-month period after the first rate cut.)

While these stock market returns seem solid, investors should remember that this is an average value for 22 rate cut cycles. The stock market suffered heavy losses too during recessionary periods. In 6 out of 22 rate cut cycles, stock market returns fluctuated widely between a negative 10% to negative 45%.

After the much touted ""great rotation"" into small-cap stocks, the focus is shifting to mid-cap stocks, because investors may be looking at a situation where small-caps may still be risky and large caps still too expensive. Until the Fed achieves the targeted soft landing, recession worries will continue to linger at the backdrop. Besides, the longer-for-higher interest rates have also triggered concerns about a slower-than-anticipated Fed rate easing cycle.

With stronger fundamentals (higher profitability and solid balance sheet) vs. small-caps and attractive valuations vs. large-caps, mid-caps seem better positioned to benefit from the present Fed rate cuts. Yet another solid reason for the pivot to mid-caps is the historical outperformance of mid-caps vs. large caps and small caps in the first 3 and 12 months subsequent to the first Fed rate cut. According to Goldman Sachs, the S&P 400 mid-cap index has been an outperformer since 1984 vs. the S&P 500 (large-caps) and Russell 2000 (small-caps) in the 3 and 12 months following the first Fed first rate cut. Presently, Goldman Sachs projects a 13% return for the S&P 400 index over the next 12 months.

Elf Beauty qualifies as a high growth beauty company, having grown sales and market share for 22 straight quarters, and averaging at least 20% sales growth per quarter. Over the past five years, Elf has expanded its top one/two positions from across eight segments in the color cosmetics category to 18 segments, which now account for over 80% of its Elf cosmetics sales. The company's ""Holy Grail"" approach centers on creating value versions of prestige products to align with consumer preferences. For reference, the average price point for Elf is about $6.50 vs. around $9.50 for legacy mass cosmetics brands and more than $20 for prestige brands. Elf's recent Bronzing Drops is comparable to a prestige product in the market at a third of the price. This strategy has helped solidify Elf's outperformance in the cosmetics category.

Solid market share gains: Elf Beauty's color cosmetics business continues to be a category outperformer. A 26% growth across track channels in the first quarter vs. a 1% decline for the category, has helped ELF grow its cosmetics market share to 12.3% presently. This represents a more than 2x increase from 5.7% market share in the same quarter three years ago. ELF expects to double its cosmetics market share again in a few years.

Shelf-space gains with Walmart, top share with Target, Opportunities at groceries, drug stores: With Target, a long-standing customer, Elf Cosmetics is the number one brand for six quarters in a row with its share rising from 13% to 21%. A 50% shelf space gain from 8 feet to 12 feet at Walmart is commendable, but still underpenetrated vs. legacy brands that have a 16 feet to 20 feet shelf space. The opportunities for expansion are attractive at Target, Walmart and Alta, alongside growth at grocery and drug stores, where ELF currently has a much smaller footprint.

Maximizing Brand Performance with Retail Partners: Elf proactively refreshes up to 20% of its retail assortment annually, leveraging insights from its digital business and beauty squad loyalty programs. This strategy has doubled its average sales per SKU over the past five years, making it a highly productive brand in terms of dollar sales per foot basis with retailers.

Growing Skincare business: Elf Beauty hopes to replicate the success in its cosmetics business across its skincare segment. For the latest first quarter, Elf SKIN grew 45% in track channels, vs. category growth of 1.4%. Elf SKIN has roughly 2% market share as of the first quarter vs. 14% share for the leading skin care brand. ELF's Naturium acquisition from last year should also help unlock growth in the skin category.

International expansion opportunities: International sales accounted for 16% of ELF's total first-quarter sales, up from 13% a year ago, but is still underpenetrated vs. global peers that have a 70% exposure to international sales. International expansion represents a key growth runway for ELF.

Upbeat Guidance: ELF recently raised guidance for fiscal 2025 (ending on March 31, 2025), now expecting adjusted EPS of $3.36 to $3.41, on sales of $1.28 billion to $1.30 billion, from prior expectations of $3.20 to $3.25 EPS on sales of $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion. The revised guidance compares more favorably with year-ago EPS of $3.18 on revenues of $1.02 billion.

ELF Stock Sell-off presents opportunity: Despite these positive developments, ELF stock trades way off its 52-week intra-day high of $221.83 reached in early March. After a couple of attempts in late June and mid July to recapture the highs of the year, the stock has fallen sharply amid concerns regarding the sustainability of its growth rates above 20%. However, it still has a Strong Buy rating from 16 Wall Street analysts.

Medpace is a full-service clinical contract research organization providing Phase I-IV clinical development services for the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Medpace calls itself as a CRO trusted by biotechs with a focus on small to mid-sized biopharma customers that represented more than 95% of its 2023 revenues. With an estimated 5% market share in the small and mid-sized biopharma space, Medpace sees an estimated core addressable biopharma CRO market of $28 billion.

Solid growth trends in revenue, profit: Top line has grown at a nearly 22% CAGR from $704.6 million in 2018 to $1.89 billion in 2023, while net income has grown four-fold from $73.2 million or $1.97/share in 2018 to $282.8 million or $8.88 per share in 2023.

Attractive Free Cash Flow characteristics: Medpace has attractive free cash flow (FCF) characteristics with FCF growing from $138.7 million in 2018 to $396.7 million in 2023. Ebitda-FCF conversion has remained above 100% since 2019.

Upbeat outlook: For 2024, revenue is expected to be between $2.125 billion and $2.175 billion, representing year-on-year growth of 12.7% to 15.3%. Net income is expected to be $361 million to $383 million or $11.24 per share to $11.93 per share and Ebitda to be $430.0 million to $460.0 million.

Concerns over cancellation appear baked into stock price now: While announcing second-quarter earnings results, the company cited some order cancellations that brought its book-to-bill ratio to 1.04 for the quarter vs. prior expectations for 1.2. Medpace also cautioned that the book-to-bill numbers could be flat to slightly higher sequentially in the third quarter. Some analysts downgraded the stock to a Hold/Neutral rating in late September citing weaker bookings growth coupled with cancellations as one of the reasons.

Are the concerns overrated? In the earnings call, Medpace said it does not see a prolonged pullback, or does not view the cancellations as a pattern that's going to continue. Besides, a book-to-bill of 1.04 for one quarter is not earth shattering, because it is still above 1, implying strong demand. Medpace sees the third quarter book-to-bill to be at 1.04 or slightly higher and in the first quarter the number was at 1.2. Also, Backlog as of June 30, 2024 was a solid $2.9 billion, up 13.7% year-on-year, and Medpace expects to convert about $1.585 billion of this backlog to revenue over the next twelve months. Medpace even raised its profit guidance for 2024 to show that it continues to anticipate industry-leading organic revenue growth and profitability despite the challenges in backlog growth. The backlog concerns appear to be priced into the MEDP stock that is already trading well below its mid-July highs of $459.77.

Upcoming catalyst: A key catalyst for the Medpace stock is the upcoming third-quarter earnings report, slated for release on October 21, after market close. Overall the MEDP stock has a moderate buy rating from analysts.

Skechers, dubbed as the comfort footwear giant, is a Fortune 500 company that makes lifestyle and performance footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. International sales represented more than 60% of its 2023 top line. The comfort footwear maker operates via wholesale and direct-to-consumer (DTC) business segments, with wholesale representing 56% of sales in 2023, and the rest coming from DTC.

Record second-quarter sales: Despite currency and supply chain headwinds, regulatory obstacles in India, and a lackluster 6/18 holiday in China, Skechers delivered record second-quarter sales of $2.16 billion, up 7.2% year over year driven by continued strength in its international DTC business and significant improvement in its domestic wholesale business.

Solid growth trends in revenue, profits: Skechers has grown sales from $5.2 billion in 2019 to $8 billion in 2023, and earnings per share from $2.25 to $3.49. Fiscal 2024 outlook is even better with sales expected between $8.88 billion and $8.98 billion and EPS expected to be $4.08 to $4.18.

Expanding margins: Skechers sells at affordable price points, yet gross margins have remained above 47% since 2019 exceeding 50% in 2023, while operating margins have been mostly in the mid-to-high single digits, with the exception of a drop to 2.9% in 2020. The margin story gets even better in the first half of 2024, with gross margins at 53.7% and operating margin at 11.5%.

One shoe does not fit all but Skechers fits all into one shoe: Considerable thought goes into the design of Skechers footwear to meet the needs of every walk of life. Under a partnership with John Deere, Skechers recently launched a footwear line for agricultural professionals, construction workers, and outdoor enthusiasts. Made of waterproof materials, the footwear line has interesting features like composite toe protection, nano carbon safety and Poron XRD metatarsal protection-Poron XRD being a flexible, lightweight, breathing foam, which hardens when impacted and forms a protective shell around the foot, absorbing up to 90% of the impact energy. Skechers has also integrated its slip-resistant and electrical hazard-rated technologies into the new offering.

Reasonably attractive valuation: Skechers stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 16.2x based on $4.08 eps guidance for 2024 (at the low end of the range). This is lower than its own five-year historical average of 21.2x. If the multiple re-rates to a conservative 19x (at the midpoint of the multiple range), it would still represent about 17% upside from current price levels. The footwear maker's expectations to achieve $10 billion in sales by 2026, also implies 13% upside potential from current stock levels, upon applying the current forward price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 1.13x. The stock may have 13%-17% upside potential from current levels.

The U.S. economy is currently not in a recession. The Fed rate easing cycle may likely achieve a soft landing of the economy, although there are no guarantees and historical evidence points otherwise, at least most of the time. Monthly Jobs data will continue to be a critical watch point. Even as recession fears linger, mid-cap stocks could be a preferred investment over large-cap or small-cap stocks, as mid-caps are at the confluence of reasonable valuations and stronger fundamentals. The mid-cap stocks highlighted in the article enjoy profitable growth with upbeat future prospects."
Pennsylvania 2024 Trump-Harris Polls: Harris Has Less Than 1-Point Lead In Polling Averages,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/08/pennsylvania-2024-trump-harris-polls-harris-has-less-than-1-point-lead-in-polling-averages/,2024-10-08T19:37:17Z,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are nearly tied in Pennsylvania, according to two new polls this week in the battleground state, where a win for either candidate could pave the way to the White House.

No Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948. If Harris wins Pennsylvania, and the trend of also winning Wisconsin and Michigan holds, she's all but certain to win the White House.

82%. That's the share of registered voters in Pennsylvania who said the economy is a major factor in their 2024 vote, followed by inflation at 78% and the state of democracy at 70%, according to the CBS/YouGov survey. The results are on par with the national electorate, according to a recent Pew Research survey of registered voters that found 81% of registered voters rate the economy as ""very important"" in the election.

Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Harris over her previous endorsement of a fracking ban -- Pennsylvania is the country's second-largest natural gas producer. ""Fracking? She's been against it for 12 years,"" Trump said during Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. Harris, who said during a 2019 CNN climate town hall while she was running for president ""there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,"" has said she's since changed her stance. During Tuesday's debate, she said she made ""very clear"" in 2020 that she's against a fracking ban, presumably referring to her vice presidential debate with Mike Pence, and noted the Inflation Reduction Act opened new gas leases -- reiterating a stance she took in a CNN interview last month. Harris didn't actually say she changed her own position on the issue during the 2020 debate -- instead she said then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden ""will not end fracking.""

Pennsylvania has a divided state legislature. The state's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, is widely popular in the state. Democrats also control the House, but Republicans hold the majority in the Senate.

Harris leads Trump in four of seven battleground states, while Trump is ahead in North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling averages that show margins of less than two points in all seven battleground states (Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin). If Trump maintains his leads in Arizona and Georgia, and wins North Carolina, as he's expected to, he would need just one of the ""Blue Wall"" states (Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin) to win the White House.

Walgreens Is The Latest Employer To Embrace Student Loan Benefits,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2024/10/08/walgreens-is-the-latest-employer-to-embrace-student-loan-benefits/,2024-10-08T18:18:19Z,"Plus, another 'September surge' in the job market, managers are willing to pay higher starting salaries for in-office personnel and how Marianne Markowitz climbed the financial corporate ladder.

Did you know that employers can match your student loan payments with contributions into your 401(k)? Thanks to Secure Act 2.0, which took effect January 1, employers can now offer extra retirement savings to young workers making student loan payments, even if the employee is not contributing to their retirement account on their own.

On Thursday, Walgreens became the latest large employer to embrace this benefit, offering it to the company's more than 300,000 employees. This means that Walgreens will match up to 4% of eligible pay for workers who are paying down student loans, even if they have not contributed directly to their 401(k) themselves.

Employees who've worked at Walgreens for one year and have completed 1,000 hours of work are eligible.

The program has been lauded as a win for young workers who have to choose between saving for retirement or paying off debt. At Walgreens, roughly 30% of the company's employees are facing financial debt from higher education, according to the company, including more than half of its pharmacists. On average, pharmacists have $170,000 of student debt, according to the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, making it one of the professions with the highest debt.

While other major employers--including Verizon, Kevin Hart-owned Hart House, Chipotle and Abbott Laboratories (a medical devices and healthcare company)--are offering the same benefit, its adoption has been slow, according to Bloomberg. The hesitance is largely due to employer's compliance and logistics concerns in its implementation, even after the IRS issued additional guidance in August.

As the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness plan moves through the courts, student loan 401(k) matching could be a major help to the 42.8 million Americans paying off student loan debt. But the key question remains: Just how many employers will implement it?

In other news, another hurricane is scheduled to make landfall in the south this week. To all of those in the path of Hurricane Milton, please listen to local officials and I hope you stay safe.

Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week!

Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter

A career financial expert, Marianne Markowitz is the founding CEO of First Women's Bank, a Chicago-based bank focused on serving women. Fresh off the heels of announcing the launch of the FWB Collective, a resource hub for women to launch their own businesses, I spoke with the First Women's Bank CEO to speak about her career in finance and focus on banking for women, working with small businesses, and what she learned working in both the private and public sectors. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Before starting First Women's Bank, you had some impressive stints as a risk and treasury manager in the private sector before heading up the Small Business Association. What did you find was the biggest pain point in the transition from private to public employers?

You know, it's interesting because I expected there to be more pain points than I actually experienced. Up until that point, the Small Business Administration (SBA) was the smallest organization I'd ever worked for--even Barack Obama's presidential campaign was larger. So as a federal agency, you were able to actually shape that agency, which was really interesting as an entrepreneurial-focused group. So I didn't experience that many pain points. Now, if I'd joined a much larger agency that would have been different! But the SBA is a unique agency in how it mirrors the private sector more because most of its partners are in the private sector, and works with over 4,000 banks.

Oh interesting! What's your advice to someone who may be considering a similar move, jumping into working with federal or government agencies?

There's a lot of doors into the public sector, so it's likely there is one that fits most people's backgrounds. I would say if you're inclined to serve at all, then it's a fit for you. It's all about service, and it's an amazing way to build a career. It's hard to explain, and you can't understand the scale of your impact when you're in the public sector (almost like you can't explain what it's like having a baby until you do!). You get to touch and impact so many lives with the work you do, it's an amazing place to build a future.

Between starting First Women's Bank and working in banking, you've had the experience of both being a founder but also climbing the corporate ladder. What is one thing you learned during that time that really helped you reach the C-Suite both as a CFO at the Obama presidential campaign and now as the founding CEO?

The next step is not only the one that is right above you. Sometimes I think we only see our careers linearly. But often moving side to side and gaining other experience will prepare you to move up, and it may not be the immediate channel that you see right ahead of you.

The other thing is sometimes, our work doesn't give us the opportunity or positions that we're ready for. Sometimes, it doesn't give us the opportunity to lead, or that's not part of your particular job at the time. So look outside your day job and find opportunities. We don't make the time to do that early enough in our career. Go find a nonprofit, get on a board, because when I look at a résumé I look at all of that. Where is the leadership in this résumé? It may not be in your position, but it happened because you did something that was really important to your job that aligned with your values outside of work.

Also, show up to the employee resource groups!

That's a good point -- leadership doesn't have to be in your job description to become a leader. What is one unique thing you look for in not only new hires, but women who come to the bank looking for funding or loans?

As women, we can often have disruptions in our career. We've got live events that we're balancing with that, and those disruptions can make for zig-zags in our résumés. That's something we really understand at First Women's Bank, and we give a lot of credit to the portability of experience and how we underwrite someone's ability to lead a business. It's something we really acknowledge, even if their career doesn't play out in a linear fashion. That's one way we really acknowledge and show up for women.

News from the world of work

September's jobs report smashed analyst expectations as 254,000 new jobs were added to the economy, according to the Labor Department, over 100,000 more than expected. The unemployment rate also dipped, falling to 4.1% from 4.2% in August. Revisions for June and July jobs reports also saw an increase of 72,000 jobs added over the summer.

The National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint Wednesday alleging that Amazon illegally refused to bargain with the union representing drivers hired by a contractor. Amazon, the complaint says, broke the law by terminating its contract with the contractor after the drivers unionized without first bargaining with the Teamsters union that represented them.

Retail, hospitality and food service managers are planning to hire more seasonal workers as the holiday season approaches. Current staff, they say, lack the skills and experience for seasonal demand--61% of surveyed managers by Axonify say the quality of applicants is worse this year.

Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet and Samsung Electronics topped Forbes' World's Best Employers 2024 list, a ranking of the best 850 companies to work for around the world. Though banking and financial services dominated this year's list, companies providing career development and upskilling opportunities climbed up the ranks.

Hiring managers are willing to pay in-office premiums: At least 66% of managers surveyed by Robert Half in its 2025 Salary Guide are willing to increase starting salaries for new hires willing to work in the office. Of those, over half are willing to bump starting salaries by 20% to come in four to five days a week.

That's down from expectations that both November and December Federal Open Market Committee meetings could see 0.5% cuts. Fixed income market expectations are tracked by the CME FedWatch Tool.

There was concern that the U.S. unemployment situation could weaken further. However, the Employment Situation Report for September showed clear improvement. Unemployment fell slightly for the second consecutive month to 4.1% and nonfarm payrolls rose 254,000. That's over 200,000 jobs added for the first time since May.

Now, the FOMC will see another jobs report on November 1 before its next meeting on November 6-7 and that data could change things. Inflation numbers will matter too. Nonetheless, for now, U.S. unemployment data is more positive than generally anticipated and inflation continues to trend lower.

This matters because if unemployment were to rise significantly, then the FOMC may be prompted to cut rates quite rapidly. That would be to try and reduce the risk of a recession. On the most recent data, a steep rise in unemployment is not happening.

Of course, inflation appears to be returning to the FOMC's 2% annual target, so that creates some momentum for less restrictive monetary policy. However, if the jobs market continues to appear robust, then there's perhaps a little less urgency for interest rate cuts.

The remaining scheduled FOMC interest rate decisions of 2024 are on November 7 and December 18. Currently, fixed income markets expect both to result in 0.25% interest rate cuts. That would leave short term interest rates at 4.25% to 4.5% by the end of 2024 or 0.5% lower than current levels. The risk of a slightly larger or smaller interest rate move is balanced, but currently further 0.5% cuts in 2024 are viewed as unlikely just as is the scenario of the FOMC choosing to hold rates steady at either meeting.

In two recent speeches, policymakers have signaled confidence in monetary policy and advocated for a more gradual approach to interest rate cuts.

New York Fed President John Williams said that: ""The current stance of monetary policy is really well positioned to both hopefully keep maintaining the strength that we have in the economy and the labour market, but also continuing to see that inflation comes back to 2 per cent,"" in an interview with the Financial Times on October 7.

St Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, said: ""My baseline outlook is for continued economic expansion over the next several quarters, supported by a gradual easing of monetary policy and accommodative financial conditions."" At a speech in New York on October 7.

There is still more key economic data to come before the FOMC's next scheduled meeting on November 6-7. Primarily, that's the jobs report for October and inflation reports for September.

So far, the jobs markets appears to be performing better than expected since the FOMC last met, and inflation continues to trend lower. If that economic outlook continues, then it appears likely the FOMC will cut interest rates at its two remaining meetings of 2024, but only by 0.25% at each, rather than the previously estimated 0.5%."
How CFOs Are Preparing For The Future Amid Election Uncertainty,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cfo/2024/10/08/how-cfos-are-preparing-for-the-future-amid-election-uncertainty/,2024-10-08T16:05:40Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget.

CFOs are taking on bigger leadership roles and more responsibility throughout the business world. A new IDC InfoBrief study commissioned by Billtrust that focuses on the order-to-cash area of business shows one area in which CFOs are leading: AI adoption.

The study surveyed several top leaders in businesses, which included some CFOs. Nearly nine in 10 respondents said CFOs are becoming more critical to their organizations because of the economic downturn and financial uncertainty, and almost as many said that digital transformation across the OTC process is critical to the survival of their businesses. More CFOs agreed that digital transformation is needed, and more are optimistic about generative AI's potential to bring some of that transformation. Two-thirds of CFOs said generative AI will have a large impact on their organization, as opposed to 59% of all people surveyed. And 44% of CFOs said generative AI will help them do their jobs faster, 9% more than the 35% of all surveyed positions.

These results show that it's time to let CFOs lead on generative AI. They've researched the possibilities and know what it can do. And as a virtue of their position and expertise, they know the financial and strategic options their companies should take to weather the current uncertainty. Companies that want to see the financial part of their business become more effective and efficient should give the CFO the respect the position is now commanding. A bonus: Other studies have shown that CFOs who are able to lead on company strategy tend to significantly outperform their peers.

Deloitte conducts a quarterly CFO survey and found in its latest results that 58% think next month's election will be at least very consequential to their organizations. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global and U.S. leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what this means for CFO planning in Q4 and beyond. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are still open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Last month, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs, a huge increase over economists' estimates of 150,000, according to government data released on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, an improvement of a tenth of a point over August. This level of job growth didn't just happen in September. The government revised its summertime job growth figures, adding 55,000 more jobs to July's total -- reaching 144,000 jobs -- and 17,000 more jobs to August, for a total of 159,000.

The upbeat job data also turned the stock market upwards on Friday, but markets came crashing down Monday afternoon as crude oil prices and government bond yields rose to multiweek highs. Monday was the anniversary of the current Israel and Hamas war in the Middle East, which has recently escalated to include Lebanon and Iran, and has sent defense stocks and oil prices up. The rise in bond yields has been somewhat unexpected, though some analysts have predicted it's in response to increasing oil prices, while others have predicted it's responding to the dwindling likelihood of another big interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets early next month.

According to CME FedWatch, 88.2% of economists now believe interest rates will be cut by a quarter percent, with the remaining 11.8% not expecting a rate cut at all. Forbes' Derek Saul talked with Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, an alternate member of the Open Market Committee, about what he'll be paying attention to as the Fed closes out the year. The unemployment rate going forward is important, he said. ""After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?""

Last week, organized labor seemingly notched another victory as 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association returned to work, reopening 36 East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports after a three-day strike. On Thursday, the U.S. Maritime Alliance offered a 62% wage increase over six years and extended the current union contract until January 15, 2025, to allow for further negotiation.

The contract extension means that the nation's ports will remain open for Q4 -- which includes the presidential election and the all-important holiday shopping season. But the new contract isn't even fully negotiated yet, so it's hard to say whether port workers will ultimately support it. Port workers wanted a 77% wage increase and a ban on many kinds of automation. There are no proposals made public from USMX on automation, and as Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly notes, it's a huge issue for the union. The cranes used to remove containers from cargo ships and move them to wherever they need to go next can be automated, meaning fewer people are needed to do the work. Union members are essentially negotiating for their job security -- at least for the time being.

Meanwhile, Boeing is back at the bargaining table with members of the International Association of Machinists union, though local news station KOMO reported negotiations appear to be at a standstill. More than 30,000 members of the union that work in the aerospace giant's factories have been off the job going on four weeks. In a note reported on by Quartz, analysts at Oxford Economics wrote the Boeing strike could impact GDP growth in Q4, similar to the aftermath of Hurricane Helene -- which caused a wide swath of devastation in the Carolinas and Florida.

The roller coaster ride for Nvidia stock continues, with the company surging to become the world's second most valuable, surpassing Microsoft, on Monday. At the close of markets on Monday, Nvidia was worth $3.132 trillion. Nvidia's stock and market capitalization has seen dramatic rises and falls in the last month and a half. After its most recent earnings report at the end of August -- in which the AI processor company delivered record earnings and smashed expectations -- its stock price tumbled because it didn't project as much growth in the next quarter as some might have wanted to see. But since then, relatively small events have caused Nvidia's stock to spike. At a Goldman Sachs conference in mid-September, CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Nvidia's soon-to-come Blackwell processors was ""so great,"" leading the stock value to pop 8%. And another leap in value came last week when Huang said on a CNBC interview that demand for the new chip was ""insane."" Monday's rally came courtesy of Super Micro Computer's announcement that sales for its liquid cooling products alongside Nvidia's GPUs were strong. This seems to be proof that the AI effect is still strong on markets. The sell off in August looked like investors were stepping back until they saw that Nvidia was worth the share price. But their behavior since then -- buying up the stock whenever there is any potentially positive news -- shows they are still overly eager about the technology's possibilities.

Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey showed that most people in the position view November's election as consequential to their organizations. Even if there weren't an election featuring two candidates with wildly differing policy ideas, there are a host of significant geopolitical and economic issues CFOs need to deal with. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what that might mean. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

Considering the state of U.S. politics, geopolitics and the economy, was there anything surprising about how CFOs responded to the survey?

Gallucci: There were some things that we pulled from the data that were interesting. For example, while CFOs are still very risk averse -- less than 15% said that this was a good time to take risk -- a lot of them were actually upbeat quarter-on-quarter around the capital markets. This data was collected before the rate cut, but there was a strong expectation [of one], and all signals indicated that rates will continue to trend downward in the next four quarters. That was a pivot over the last seven or eight quarters, as rates were rising, the capital markets were very inactive. When capital markets are inactive, there's less capital spending, there's less M&A.

More than half -- 58% -- said the election will be at least very consequential for their businesses. How does that impact how CFOs run their businesses and planning?

On the day-to-day running of the business, that particular stat has not shifted. In the longer term, a lot of scenario planning is happening. When you step back and think about where we might be from a policy perspective in six months to a year, it could look different from a tariff perspective. It could look different from a labor perspective.

CFOs more broadly have built into their psyche, [and] they approach their roles with an expectation that there will be shocks to the system that come from all angles: geopolitical shocks, certainly elections. [About] 45% of the world's GDP is electing a new leader this year. CFOs have built in an attribute of being agile and able to pivot. If you trace that back, you're going to go to the pandemic. That shock threw everybody for a loop. We haven't had a world pandemic in a hundred years, per se. [Consider] how that impacted business and supply chains, particularly things like semiconductors and computer chips, and being able to get that type of product. When you lob on top of that some of the geopolitical conflicts that we've been dealing with the last couple of years, all have contributed to a much more dynamic type of environment that chief financial officers across all industries and sectors have had to manage.

Do you think most CFOs have been expecting this wildly changing stock market, and are considering that when they're looking ahead?

Without question. They're looking at a whole host of factors in terms of making decisions around capital spending, M&A, new projects. [There is] a lot of variability in all those areas -- the economy, geopolitics, consumer spending -- which gets back to some of the data that we're taking in around being less risk averse, less bullish, et cetera. You put all these factors in a basket and then you have to make business decisions.

Let's take interest rates, for example. As the Fed was on a plan to raise interest rates to fight inflation, there was a lot of unpredictability: When is it going to peak? When is it going to top out? What we have right now is a little more clarity in terms of it's on the way down. They've stated that they want to get to somewhere around two point half percent and the FOMC rate. That gives a little more certainty towards CFOs in that particular area of the private markets. They can start to plan around that. Once you have clarity in a particular area and a sense that things have less unpredictability, you'll start to see some more actions on the part of corporates and CFOs, specifically, around things like M&A and capital spending.

Some of these big question marks will be figured out six months from now. We will have another president. That person will be in office and their economic policies could be stabilizing. How do you see CFOs responding to a similar survey then?

If you look historically post-election, there's a little more certainty in terms of where things will go in the near to medium term. It's hard to handicap what all that will look like. We'll continue to be in a descending rate capital market. With that, you'll see all indications are a much more robust capital market in the way of M&A and bond issues and whatnot.

History would tell you that there could be some type of bounce and there could be more optimism. There could be another geopolitical conflict that could send the markets into a tizzy. We're dealing with things like natural disasters throughout the globe, and that has an impact. I have to hedge with what we know and we don't know.

America The Tax Haven? Exploring The U.S. Trade Deficit,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/taxnotes/2024/10/08/america-the-tax-haven-exploring-the-us-trade-deficit/,2024-10-08T15:38:08Z,"In this episode of Tax Notes Talk, Professors Kenneth Austin and Hillel Nadler discuss the policies that they believe make the United States a tax haven, and the resulting effects on the economy.

Tax Notes Talk is a podcast produced by Tax Notes. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

David D. Stewart: Welcome to the podcast. I'm David Stewart, editor in chief of Tax Notes Today International. This week: just like haven.

Tax havens and financial secrecy are regular topics of discussion in the tax world. We've previously looked at tax havens from an international perspective, and you can find those episodes in the show notes. But today, we're turning the lens around and considering if the United States is a tax haven.

Here to talk more about this are two authors who have recently considered this topic in-depth in the pages of Tax Notes. Kenneth Austin is a retired Treasury economist, and an adjunct professor at American University's International School of Service, and Hillel Nadler is an assistant professor at Wayne State University School of Law.

David D. Stewart: Let's start off with the big question of why should we look at the United States as being a tax haven?

Hillel Nadler: Well, there are really two aspects to this. One is that, on the U.S. side, in terms of the U.S. tax burden on financial inflows, foreign investors can hold U.S. financial assets while paying minimal U.S. tax on the profits from those assets, so that's one aspect of it. The second aspect of America being a tax haven in this sense is that the U.S. has a unique financial secrecy position, which means that foreign investors can not only avoid paying tax to the U.S., or pay minimal tax to the U.S., but they can avoid paying tax in their home countries on their profits from U.S. financial assets.

David D. Stewart: In your article about this subject, you talked about this affecting the trade deficit. Could you explain that?

Kenneth Austin: Yeah. Basically, the way it works in today's world, and particularly for the U.S., our trade deficit is equal to how much money we borrow net from the rest of the world. When I say borrow, it's not exactly like we go down to the People's Bank of China and fill out a loan application. It's just that any foreigner, or I guess in the tax code, nonresident alien, can simply buy U.S. assets on, say, the bond market, stock market, deposit it in a bank.

That's lending internationally. It may not be to a particular individual, and the money may already have been borrowed. Say the U.S. Treasury sells a bond, and that bond is sold to an American, but that American sells it to a nonresident alien, then we are borrowing internationally. That will affect the exchange rates. And as we borrow, the exchange rate appreciates, which causes the U.S. trade deficit to grow.

David D. Stewart: How did we start going down this road?

Hillel Nadler: These provisions have accumulated over time. These provisions that offer favorable tax treatment to foreign investment, many of them made sense in a different exchange rate situation, when the United States' financial situation was different.

If you start by addressing each provision, one provision that's favorable to foreign investors in the United States is that capital gains from the sale of most U.S. investment assets, including stock buybacks by U.S. corporations, aren't taxed at all to foreign investors. They pay no U.S. tax on those. Then in the early 1930s, all the way back then, the U.S. Treasury actually tried to collect tax on capital gains of foreign investors. If you looked at the code then, there was no specific exemption. But doing that was difficult because, if the foreign investor didn't actually file a tax return, Treasury had no way of knowing what they had earned. And Treasury was also concerned about discouraging foreign investment.

Eventually, Congress responded by introducing what we currently have now, which is an exemption for capital gains for foreign investors. I think this historical episode, the following historical episode illustrates our point nicely, which was that the exemption was actually broadened in the 1960s, by adding what's known as the securities trading safe harbor, which says that capital gains of foreign investors would be exempt even if they're present in the United States, they're trading in the United States, or acting through a U.S. agent.

Previously, doing so would have been considered engaging in a trade or business in the U.S. and would have subjected the foreign investor to U.S. tax. But this change was made explicitly to encourage foreign investment in the U.S.

The context was this was in response to the then balance of payments crisis. At the time, the U.S. was trying to prop up the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates and wanted to encourage foreign investment inflows into the United States. They wanted to encourage investors to turn U.S. dollars into longer-term investments. That's just one example, but a lot of these provisions were specifically designed to attract foreign investment into the United States.

Kenneth Austin: May I interject one thing? I know this may sound rather picayune. But in English, the word ""investment"" has more than one meaning. And words have multiple definitions, eventually they lose meaning. Because I say one thing, you hear another. You can talk about a foreigner buying a share of GM, and we'll call that an investment in the stock market. What congressmen tend to hear is creating some form of productive capacity, like plant and equipment, and something especially with an employee parking lot. When really, what they've done is made a bank deposit in the U.S. and then used that bank deposit to buy a stock. No real productive capacity was created.

As long as you say the word ""investment,"" I think a lot of people, and particularly politicians, will hear, ""We're going to have bigger employee parking lots."" That's just not necessarily true. Most of the money that's come into the U.S. in the last 30 years has not built productive capacity. Yeah, we have some Honda factories, and BMW factories, etc. But overwhelmingly, the money has just gone into the banking system. It's bank deposits. A lot of it winds up just financing dodgy consumer debt.

David D. Stewart: Now, is the U.S. unique in the way that it treats these foreign inflows? You're mentioning this nontaxation of capital gains.

Hillel Nadler: The U.S. isn't unique in the way it treats foreign financial inflows. At least, not now. But in some ways, the U.S. has been a leader on this.

If you go back to the 1980s, the U.S. introduces this exemption for interest income on portfolio debt. If you're a foreign investor, you hold a U.S. issued bond, then the interest on that bond is going to be, in most cases, going to be exempt from tax in the U.S. At the time when this exemption was introduced, the U.S. was alone, but other countries wanted to follow suit with the U.S., and other major economies, and they were worried about losing capital flows to the U.S., so they followed suit and also abolished their taxes on interest paid to foreign investors.

David D. Stewart: Now you mentioned this Bretton Woods, the fixed exchange rates. Since the collapse of that, what have been the results of the U.S. treatment of foreign investments since then?

Kenneth Austin: Well, I would say that there's really two periods. When the Bretton Woods system first collapsed, most of the Western countries, the advanced countries, whatever we want to call them -- Europe, the U.S., Japan -- just gave up on trying to control their exchange rates. The Japanese backtracked on that and it became a problem. But we backed up on that. We just let currencies move against each other. The Europeans didn't like that, and that started a movement towards the European Union.

A lot of other countries continued to control their exchange rate. The way you do that is you buy and sell foreign currency. Particularly, the U.S. dollar was very valued because we had big financial markets. You can move your money in and out quickly. If you wanted to make your own currency more valuable, you would buy it and pay for it in dollars, but you needed dollars to do that. Or if you want to depreciate your currency so you could run a larger trade surplus or smaller deficit, then you bought foreign currency. The price of foreign currency would go up, and that would encourage your exporters to earn more of the more valuable foreign currency, and discourage imports. If the price of foreign currency went down, it had the opposite effect. It was less valuable to you as an exporter, and it was cheaper to buy foreign goods.

That was a way to control your trade balance. For a long time, that mostly worked. I don't want to go in too much detail here, but things started to change when we had the oil crises of the '70s, because a lot of countries in the Middle East that had not previously had a lot of money to invest, they just started buying U.S. dollars. We allowed that. We actually encouraged that. Then the Reagan administration came along, did a lot of huge tax cuts, tried to cut the budget expenditures, but we still had a huge deficit. We were issuing a lot of U.S. government bonds, and that attracted more. Our interest rates went very high. A lot of people bought dollars around the world. Then that gradually tapered off.

By the late 1990s, America actually had a small fiscal surplus. But then, something new started to happen. There was what was called the global savings glut. A lot of countries, particularly in Asia, were growing very rapidly, and they were saving more than they were investing, actually finding uses for those savings. When the Asian financial crisis came, a lot of money came to the U.S. It also came from Europe, which was trying to reduce its budget deficits. So it all came here. The U.S. current account deficit, which is the trade deficit with some extras thrown in, basically tripled within about two, three years. Now all this money flowing into U.S. financial markets blew up the dot-com bubble, and we had a recession in 2000, two, three years after the Asian financial crisis.

Normally, that would have caused the trade deficits to shrink. It just shrank for a little bit. And then it started growing, because the rest of the world needed a place to put their money and it came to the U.S. That financed a larger and larger trade deficit. Because there are basically two ways you can get foreign currency. You can earn it by exporting; you can borrow it. Whether you want to borrow it or not, if you borrowed it, it causes your currency to become more expensive on world markets. That encourages trade deficit, because more is coming in than is going out.

Actually, what'll happen almost immediately is that the amount that you're borrowing and your trade deficit will be equal. It's actually to the penny because the balance of payments is a double-entry bookkeeping system, and that's the way it has to work.

David D. Stewart: What is the negative to the U.S. economy of having a lot of this money coming in?

Kenneth Austin: Well, one thing is our financial system can't always handle it. We just had a huge amount of money came in in the first decade of the 21st century. All of a sudden, you're watching all these TV ads, ""Don't have to fill out paperwork, get our mortgage."" A lot of these mortgages were bad. All sorts of ridiculous things happened in U.S. financial markets because interest rates started to go really low. People became desperate to find something they could actually put their money in. That led to a lot of the abuses that caused the great financial crisis.

At the same time, all this money was raising the price of the U.S. dollar. It was just not profitable to invest in U.S. production facilities anymore, because things could always be made cheaper elsewhere, particularly in China, and this was the China shock. There's some economic work that actually said this China shock, all these people who got thrown out of work in what are now the swing states -- Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, all across the Midwest, the old Rust Belt -- a lot of these people, the children and grandchildren of New Deal Democrats, they voted Trump because somebody had to help. And if you look at the areas where that trade impact was the biggest, where the most jobs were lost, not only in the factories but in the surrounding towns that depended on the factories for the money that would be spent there, they were terribly harmed by this. It's very tangible, particularly to the people who lost their job.

David D. Stewart: Turning back to the tax policy underlying this, you mentioned the treatment of capital gains. Are there other things that the U.S. government is doing that are allowing inflowing dollars to escape taxation?

Hillel Nadler: Yeah. The basic structure of the U.S. tax code, especially as it relates to inbound investment, or inbound financial flows if you don't like to use the word ""investment,"" is that it's very favorable towards passive investment by foreign taxpayers.

Your listeners are probably familiar -- there are basically two different tax regimes that apply to foreign taxpayers: one that applies to passive investment income, and another that applies to active business profits from an active business in the United States. Very broadly, foreign taxpayers, if there's income that's derived from a U.S. trade or business, or in the lingo of the tax code, effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, then on that income, they're going to be subject to the same graduated tax rates that apply to U.S. taxpayers. When it comes to passive investment income, nominally, that type of income is subject to tax at a flat rate of 30 percent on the gross amount of U.S.-sourced passive investment income.

But when it comes to that passive investment income, there are large gaps in that flat rate tax. For one, as we mentioned, capital gains from the sale of most U.S. investment assets, other than real estate, aren't taxed at all because they're not considered U.S.-source income. Also, interest from U.S. bank deposits, and most importantly, from U.S. portfolio debt, bonds, most other debt instruments, are also going to be exempt from U.S. taxation. And these two categories, capital gains and portfolio interest, account for the majority of passive income earned by foreign investors in the United States, and they're exempt from U.S. tax.

Kenneth Austin: Yeah. This is a bit I'm going to tread here on the tax part. But you can think of, if I own a Treasury bond, at the end of the year, I'm going to have some interest and a 1099 form. If I sell that bond to a German resident, then they get the interest on that bond, but it's disappeared from the U.S. tax base. And they pay nothing. And the U.S. isn't necessarily going to share the information with the German government that your resident or citizen earned this income on a U.S. bond. It's very hard for them to get it, and we made that system deliberate. Your choice is, ""OK, I could buy a German bond, but I'm going to pay interest on it. If I buy an American bond, I won't."" I could voluntarily pay some German taxes, but I may not.

If you look at, for example, a lot of Europe, you can find 40, 50, 60 percent marginal interest rates there. In the U.S., the worst you could do is pay the 30 percent withholding, but you don't have to. It's a much better deal from the tax point of view to put your money in the U.S. That is a result of U.S. policies designed to bring that money in. I think you can discuss what the politics is, but a lot of congressmen really believe that that money coming in is investment, in the sense it creates jobs and employee parking lots, when really it's just a bank deposit. What happens to that money after it gets here is anybody's guess, particularly the bankers.

Hillel Nadler: Just to add another wrinkle there, it's not just the statutory provisions of the code that offer favorable treatment, U.S. tax treatment, to foreign investment. The U.S. also has a network of bilateral tax treaties, which also exempt a lot of passive foreign investment from U.S. tax. But if you look at where financial inflows are coming, it's not just from those treaty countries. It's also from jurisdictions with which the U.S. doesn't have those bilateral tax treaties.

And that's because the other leg of the U.S. status as a tax haven, which is that the U.S., or U.S. financial institutions, can offer financial secrecy to their clients in a way that other jurisdictions can't, or other major economies and financial centers can't because other major economies signed up for the common reporting standard, which is reciprocal and provides for the automatic exchange of information between different jurisdictions and different tax authorities.

The U.S. has FATCA, which it adopted unilaterally, which provides the U.S. with a lot of information about U.S. taxpayers, but doesn't provide the same information to other jurisdictions and to other tax authorities. The U.S. financial institutions aren't required to collect and the U.S. isn't required to share information with other countries, for example, about the identity of controlling persons or beneficial owners of certain entities that are used to hold passive investments. Foreign investors can avoid tax reporting to their own tax authorities by holding U.S. accounts through U.S. entities, like LLCs or trusts, and things like that.

Kenneth Austin: If you'd spoke to the lobbyists behind a lot of these provisions, they'd say, ""We're just trying to prevent double taxation."" Double taxation isn't the issue. It's zero taxation.

If all the foreign financiers who bought these Treasury bonds paid tax somewhere, the full amount, particularly to their home government maybe in Denmark, or Switzerland, or Germany, they'd keep more of it at home, they'd be less inclined to bring it to the U.S. But the U.S. says, ""Bring it here, and there won't be double taxation. There won't any taxation.""

In some ways, double taxation might be unfortunate. But remember, nobody is forced to put their money somewhere else. They could always just keep it at home and pay their own taxes. They made a choice. Now I think one country collecting the tax makes sense. But to exempt these interest or other portfolio income from all taxes is a bit ridiculous. Since it's not symmetrical, it attracts more of that money here, which triggers a higher U.S. trade deficit.

David D. Stewart: It sounds like the policy of trying to get more money in was very effective. Maybe too effective. How would we go about unwinding that and making the U.S. less of a tax haven?

Kenneth Austin: We could theoretically eliminate the trade deficit overnight, but that would be a terrible idea. We want the economy to adjust. We don't want to shock it. We would have to rebuild an awful lot of factories and companies that were destroyed in the last 30 years. That would take time. Maybe four years, maybe 10 years. It's a guess now; we haven't started that project. We would want to do this gradually. Just gradually unwind this. We don't know how fast it would go, but as we get a little bit of experience, we should be able to do that. As long as we are, as I say, we want to do this carefully. It's not something we do overnight.

But during that period, we're going to be rebuilding all of these companies, all of these factories, and that will create a lot of jobs. That transition period will be a period of prosperity.

I'll let Hillel talk about how he would wind it down.

Hillel Nadler: Sure. I think, for starters, reversing some of these exemptions, the current exemptions for portfolio interest, for example, would be a first step towards making U.S. financial assets and foreign financial inflows less attractive. Providing reciprocal exchange of information so that, even if these foreign investors aren't paying tax in the U.S., we can at least help ensure that they're paying tax to their home governments.

But I do want to caution, our argument isn't that the only reason investors are holding U.S. financial assets is because of favorable tax treatment. There are a lot of reasons why someone outside the U.S. might want to hold a U.S. asset. This goes into the status of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, and all sorts of other reasons why people might want to hold U.S. financial assets. We just think the tax treatment is part of the picture. If we're trying to reduce foreign financial inflows, part of the solution is to start thinking about reversing some of the favorable tax treatment that foreign investors get.

Kenneth Austin: There are other things we could do. A few years ago, I think it was 2018, there was a bill introduced into the U.S. Senate, the Baldwin-Hawley Bill. That would have introduced, I think, the market access charge -- I think Hillel calls it a transactions tax -- which was a small payment every time you converted another currency into the dollar. Unfortunately, the bill went nowhere, but it was the right approach.

The thing is, you can't reduce the trade deficit by imposing tariffs. It doesn't work. It just results in same trade deficit, just at a more appreciated dollar. What you have to do is attenuate the financial inflows. I think ideally, we might want to bring those to zero. Now lots of people would still own dollars abroad, but they just on net wouldn't be buying more. If you got to that point, U.S. current account deficit, which is, as I said, a larger definition of the trade deficit, would go to zero.

David D. Stewart: The issue of extra money coming into this country doesn't seem to be something that is talked about as a negative. Why is it that you're viewing this as a negative, but we don't generally hear that from other people discussing the issue of trade imbalances?

Kenneth Austin: That's a very good question I ask myself. I say, ""Why am I one of the few economists that wants to do this?"" I am a retired Treasury economist, and nobody wanted to talk about it.

But I think part of it is, among mainstream economists, there seems to be an ideological taboo against this. One reason is mainstream economists hate the idea of what used to be called capital controls. It's still actually called capital controls, although once again, it's not little factories flowing across the world. It's just bank deposits.

They keep saying, ""Oh, well this is investment."" And actually, some pretty good economists confuse this flow of bank deposits with, they say, ""Real, productive capacity."" New factories, new electrical generation facilities, ships, transport, all this stuff. It's not. It's bank deposit. But by this verbal ambiguity, they convince themselves of it.

But they do know that this is really a question of financial flow. In 2016 Alan Blinder, who I think is probably almost the definition of mainstream esteemed economists, wrote an op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal on five important facts about trade. He said, ""A trade deficit isn't so bad because we're getting real goods and services, and the rest of the world is just getting our IOUs"" of bonds, stocks, corporate bonds, treasury bonds. ""It's just paper. It's just paper. Is that so bad?""

Well, that is ridiculous in the sense that it's something worthy of ridicule. And for an economist of his stature to say that, I don't even know if it's plausible he believes it. It's an astonishing thing to say. But I can give you other examples of economists just twisting themselves in knots, not to acknowledge that the U.S., if we stop borrowing -- the one exception that I find is when the other party holds the White House, then everybody comes really worried about the budget deficit, and blames all the borrowing and the budget deficit for the trade deficit. But that's not necessarily true.

When these large trade deficits began in the late '90s, the U.S. actually had a small fiscal surplus. But the rest of the world had the global savings glut. They just had a lot of money that they couldn't use at home. So it came here.

David D. Stewart: Well, this has been fascinating. Ken, Hillel, thank you so much for being here."
There's No TikTok If It's 'A Tool Of Chinese Communist Propaganda',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/10/08/theres-no-tiktok-if-its-a-tool-of-chinese-communist-propaganda/,2024-10-08T15:11:58Z,"Bikes were ""as indispensable to a Chinese as a car to twentieth century Americans."" Those are the words of Fox Butterfield from Alive In the Bitter Sea, his 1982 book about communist-era China. Call Butterfield's account of just some of communism's myriad horrors essential reading when it comes to attaining a tangible grasp of how little communism associates with anything related to competition or prosperity.

As Butterfield went on to report, ""To buy a bike you also had to have a special bike purchase coupon"" that was exceedingly difficult to come by. Butterfield interviewed one factory worker who indicated that, ""out of every one hundred workers, only two were given these treasured certificates each year."" Such was brutal life amid the CCP's control of China's economy from the proverbial Commanding Heights.

The China of old came to mind while reading a recent Wall Street Journal column by the great Andy Kessler. He quoted Sen. Tom Cotton as saying that ""TikTok is a tool of Chinese Communist propaganda."" Let's just say they don't make cold warriors like they used to. Is Cotton aware of just how hideously cruel communism was, and much more important, how little production there is when governmental bodies (including the CCP) manage economic activity, when property is owned by them, and when people allegedly work according to their abilities and needs?

The questions about Cotton (along with a myriad of other TikTok critics in the commentariat) are asked mainly because communist rule is defined by unrelenting desperation. As was made apparent during the Soviet Union years for Russia, communist rule and its bitter fruits is the stuff of empty shelves, not to mention that if there's anything on the shelf, it's what no one wants. It's worth thinking about as Cotton and others of his ilk claim TikTok is but a puppet for the CCP. You mean the TikTok that is headquartered in Singapore and Los Angeles, and that is substantially owned by American investors?

If TikTok were a tool of any government, let alone a CCP the rule of which so awfully correlated with immense dysfunction, it's safe to say it would in no way be a global powerhouse. Evidence supporting this claim isn't just vivified by what economic life was like when the CCP arrogated to itself command-and-control powers, but also by the relative freedom of the U.S. economy that has logically gifted Americans (and the world) with the most dynamic, customer-leading businesses in the world.

It's just another reminder that TikTok's critics can't have it both ways. They can't make baseless claims about TikTok being a ""a tool"" of the CCP when it's remembered just how awful and inept commerce was when the CCP was actually running the Chinese economy. In short, if TikTok were ""a tool of Chinese Communist propaganda,"" it not only would have no voluntary users as is the case with all government-operated entities of any kind, it also wouldn't exist as evidenced by the scarcity of nearly every necessity when the CCP ran China."
Trump's Tax Plan Will Be Fine,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanlewis/2024/10/08/trumps-tax-plan-will-be-fine/,2024-10-08T14:53:15Z,"The Great Depression got started with the passage of the Smoot Hawley Tariff in the United States, by the Republican Party, which immediately set off a cascade of retaliatory tariffs worldwide. This alone did not cause the Great Depression, but it did cause the initial downturn. This was followed by a long string of bad decisions in reaction to that downturn, such as Republican Herbert Hoover's 1932 tax increase which took the top income tax rate from 25% to 63%.

After World War Two, the whole world came to recognize that the Trade War of 1930 was a major contributor to the Great Depression. At the 1944 meeting in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, they began a long postwar movement toward Free Trade, with a proposal for an International Trade Organization, to go along with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank also established at the same time. The ITO was not passed, but evolved into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which then became the World Trade Organization in 1995.

Conservatives thus have some trepidation when they see a move by presidential candidate Donald Trump, representing the Economic Nationalist wing that includes Patrick Buchanan, move again toward tariffs and restrictions on trade. The reasons for this are well known, and include the corrosive effects on the US's middle class since China entered the WTO in 2001; or arguments that the US, as a continental superpower, needs to retain a large measure of self-sufficiency in key industries including electronics.

Tariffs are taxes; basically, they are a variant of sales taxes. Trump's proposals, mirroring those of Patrick Buchanan, are for a single-rate across-the-board universal tariff of 10% or perhaps later 20%, instead of the troublesome item-by-item and country-by-country approach of the past. This is actually no different than most countries in the world already have, as a component of their value-added-tax -- also of 10%-20% -- which also applies to imports.

Nevertheless, more taxes typically have a negative economic effect. This is offset, in the Trump proposals, with lower taxes on business.

The Corporate Income Tax rate would be lowered to 20% from 21%; possibly to 15% for businesses making their products in the US. This is the right idea, but certainly very small. A reduction in the Corporate Income Tax rate to 15% for everyone would be more effective at boosting the economy, and is not that far from the 19% corporate income tax rate now enjoyed by Britain. When you add Corporate taxes in some States, it would mirror Britain's rate. Forty-four States have their own Corporate taxes; the rate in Alaska, Illinois, Minnesota and New Jersey is nine percent or higher.

Much of the rest of Trump's tax proposals consist of extending his 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act -- which led to a noticeably stronger economy, particularly among the lower income brackets. Some tax technicians think that this would lead to some disastrous decline in revenue, compared to if the tax cuts were allowed to expire; but this assumes that these taxes would, in 2027, produce a much higher revenue/GDP figure than the exact same taxes produced before the reform, in 2016. The Congressional Budget Office thinks that revenue from the Individual Income Tax will reach 9.8% of GDP in 2027, with the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts -- a whopping 18% higher than the 8.3% actually received in 2016, before the TCJA, and a figure that has never been exceeded except for two years (2000 and 2022), when tax revenues were momentarily boosted by capital gains from huge stock market rises the year earlier. Not gonna happen.

My impression is that the smallish reductions in corporate tax rates would not provide much of an advantage, compared to the potential drag from higher tariffs, especially if they are matched with higher tariffs on US goods from other countries worldwide.

The best and easiest way to produce an economic advantage would be to eliminate all capital gains taxes. To this we could eliminate double-taxation of corporate income via dividends, which should be tax-free. An important distortion between debt and equity financing should be ameliorated by making corporate income taxable before interest, known as the ""VAT base."" Along with this, interest income should be untaxed at the personal level.

The main argument against eliminating capital gains taxes might be the categorization of some forms of income as capital gains. This is particularly true of investment funds. Income from fund management should be taxed as regular business income, when it is realized. This mirrors the tax treatment of employee stock options today, which are subject to the regular personal income tax (not capital gains) when they are exercised.

Many of the more successful countries in the world do not tax capital gains. These include Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Belgium, Germany, Malaysia, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Switzerland. It used to include Japan, which did not tax capital gains until 1989.

Trump also introduced the idea of a 60% flat-rate tariff on Chinese imports. Besides potentially providing relief for US workers from international wage competition, this is motivated by geopolitical concerns, with supply lines for key military and other industries compromised by dependence on Chinese and Taiwanese sources. Implementing such a plan would increase the need for more business and growth-friendly tax reductions elsewhere to compensate.

Trump even floated the idea of eliminating the Income Tax altogether, and replacing it with the Tariff as a revenue source. This was actually the regular state of affairs in the United States before the Sixteenth Amendment was passed in 1913. There was no Income Tax.

But, the Federal government was much smaller then. Today, a more realistic idea is to replace the Income Tax with a VAT, which is an indirect tax that resembles both the retail sales tax and various Flat Tax income tax proposals that have been made since the 1980s.

Since the flat-rate tariff is already an inherent part of the VAT found in most countries worldwide, I think Trump is testing the waters for a much more important reform -- eliminating the Federal Income Tax altogether, both Individual and Corporate, including a full repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment, and replacing it with a VAT, with a rate of probably around 15%.

For many decades, we've avoided the VAT because we don't want to have an income tax and VAT together, like high-tax European socialist governments. But, adopting a VAT is the best way to replace the income tax.

This resembles the ""FairTax"" national sales tax proposal popular among conservatives, but would be much better in my view. The VAT is a proven and effective system worldwide, while retail sales tax rates above 10% have been problematic. Replacing the problematic and destructive Income Tax with a VAT is actually the solution offered by President George W. Bush's economic advisor Lawrence Lindsey, in his 2013 book The Growth Experiment Revisited.

In the nineteenth century, the United States had high tariffs, domestic excise taxes (sales taxes), and no income tax. It was the most successful country of that century."
Inflation Reduction Act 2 Years Later: Building Clean Electricity Faster Than Ever,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/10/08/inflation-reduction-act-2-years-later-building-clean-electricity-faster-than-ever/,2024-10-08T14:27:54Z,"In August 2022, when the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, it became the most significant investment in climate that the United States has ever made, making long-term, transformational investments in clean energy deployment, manufacturing, electric vehicles and buildings, and targeted investments to support communities disproportionately impacted by our energy system.

America's electricity sector is the IRA's cornerstone, making up 30-44% of the bill's expected economy-wide emissions reductions. Now, two years after the IRA's passage, signs of progress are emerging.

Before the IRA passed, clean electricity incentives were caught in a cycle of short-term extensions and expirations, creating enormous clean energy industry uncertainty. The IRA invested in the clean energy industry's long-term economic health by creating a decade's worth of certainty for electricity providers, developers, and investors solidifying that clean energy was the better deal for electricity consumers, shareholders, and the planet.

The IRA owes its name to the era of rising prices in which it passed. Global fossil fuel price volatility and supply chain constraints were driving up inflation and interest rates. With clean energy costs largely coming as upfront capital expenditures, the industry was in a period of moderating growth when the bill passed.

Key policies included extension and expansion of clean electricity tax credits, providing up to 60% off the cost of clean energy for ten years, the creation of manufacturing tax credits that bring clean energy manufacturing to the U.S., and billions of dollars to grant and loan programs to make sure upfront funding is there for projects that will save money in the long-term.

The effect of the IRA has only just begun to show up in clean energy deployment. While the first half of 2023 was still relatively slow on installs of solar, wind, and energy storage, 2023 ended with a new record of over 35 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity added, and the first half of 2024 saw a 91% increase over installs in the first half of 2023 at 19 GW. Not only were installations in the higher than 2023, but they were 10 GW higher than average of the previous five years. The U.S. Energy Information Agency expects a total of 59 GW of wind, solar and energy storage to come online in 2024. The growth in renewable energy installations is only expected to rise, with planned projects reported to the EIA overwhelmingly comprised of wind, solar, and batteries in coming years.

Since 2021, utility plans have also become increasingly bullish on adding new clean energy. An RMI analysis of 121 utilities representing 48% of U.S. electricity demand showed utilities are now planning to add 34% more wind and solar than they were as of August 2022. Unfortunately, plans to add gas have also increased, as utilities respond to rising electricity demand while they work to modernize their planning assumptions. Utilities don't need to rush to gas, however, as good planning and procurement practices can help utilities meet growing demand with cleaner and cheaper resources.

The IRA extended support for clean electricity across the whole sector, but publicly owned and non-profit electricity providers saw some of the most significant changes. First, tax credits that were previously inaccessible due to lack of tax liability were converted to direct pay, so non-profit entities could take direct advantage.

Rural electric cooperatives in particular are set to receive significant direct funding. Rural electric cooperatives provide electricity to 42 million people across 56% of the nation's landmass. They serve a disproportionately low-income segment of the population, but lag behind the rest of the nation in moving away from coal power, with 30% of their electricity coming from coal in 2022 compared to 19% nationwide. However, the IRA breathed new life into these non-profit utilities, setting aside $9.7 billion in funds to help cooperatives reduce emissions and install clean energy projects.

The first round of funding announcements into this program were made in September, with $7.3 billion awarded to 16 utilities across 23 states, leveraging an additional $29 billion in private investment. These funds are expected to support 10 GW of new clean energy projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from rural electric cooperatives by 43.6 million tons each year, or about 30% of cooperatives current annual emissions. Projects are also expected to reduce electricity rates substantially compared to a continued reliance on fossil energy, according to several of the awardees.

The IRA didn't stop at driving new clean energy investment - it sought to create a positive feedback loop between the clean energy transition and the health of American manufacturing via a new set of tax credits that can be earned by producing components that go into clean energy projects.

Since the bill's passage, manufacturing facility announcements rolled in, with over $112 billion in investment slated for batteries, electric vehicles, solar, and wind. Batteries are by far the largest share of investment at 68%, shared between batteries for the electric grid and for electric vehicles which utilize slightly different chemistries. However, solar manufacturing boasts no small stake with $14 billion in announcements, which will continue to abate supply chain delays that have lingered after the pandemic.

The power of the IRA does not lie in its direct investment alone. The bill's clean energy provisions also enabled state action with four states implementing 100% clean energy targets for the first time in 2023. Minnesota and Michigan passed legislation requiring 100% of electricity sales to come from clean sources by 2040, while the New Jersey governor signed an executive order requiring 100% clean electricity by 2035. Delaware, too, passed clean energy legislation, requiring a 100% clean economy by 2050.

While interest in clean energy from states, utilities, and investors has increased, many bottlenecks remain, namely in interconnection queues, or the projects waiting to connect to the grid. Research by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that at the end of 2022, over 2,000 GW clean projects were waiting to connect, and at the end of 2023, that number had skyrocketed to over 2500 GW. Overall U.S. energy capacity is about 1,400 GW, meaning significantly more projects are waiting to connect to the grid than are currently connected.

Reforms by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aim to shorten these wait times and reduce costs, but regional approaches have shown that much more can be done in the effort to connect clean energy projects as quickly as possible. For example, Texas uses an approach to interconnection that avoids lengthy studies and costly upgrades across the transmission grid any time a project wants to connect.

This has reduced Texas' timeline to connect projects compared to other regions by 2.5 or more years, and shows why the state is predicted to add 35% of all solar projects and 44% of all battery projects this year, despite only producing 13% of the nation's electricity.

Further improvements to transmission planning, bolstered by recent FERC action, are also expected to prepare the grid to handle more clean energy, faster, but short-term actions like upgrading existing infrastructure to carry more electricity on the transmission pathways we already have can help meet our current needs.

The investment approach of the IRA is not enough to bring electricity sector emissions down to zero - it was never expected to do so. However, it has created tailwinds, bringing industry forward and creating momentum far into the future. Now, it's time to focus on the next piece of the puzzle and make sure the momentum translates into clean power."
China Bets On Massive Blockchain Infrastructure,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/08/china-bets-on-massive-blockchain-infrastructure/,2024-10-08T14:16:02Z,"In October 2019 Chinese President Xi Jinping noted: ""We must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies, clarify the main direction, increase investment, and accelerate the development of blockchain technology."" according to the study in the Journal of Physics: Conference Series.

The speech resolved the uncertainty of blockchain technology development in China and delivered a strong signal that the central government will support and devote more resources to this area according to a study published in Research in International Business and Finance journal. Following this, the Communist Party of China made a decision, recognizing data as an equal factor of production alongside traditional inputs like labor and capital.

A key component of China's blockchain strategy is the Blockchain-Based Service Network launched in 2020. According to a CoinDesk report from March 2021, BSN offers a government-controlled framework for blockchain developers, supporting applications built on multiple blockchain networks. The system provides two versions: one for users inside China and another for international developers.

Notably, the domestic version allows authorities to censor or delete entire blockchains if deemed necessary, with CEO Yifan He of Red Date, the company behind BSN, stating, ""If they do something wrong we can delete the whole chain,"" as reported by Coindesk.

In March 2021, the Chinese government formally incorporated blockchain development into its national strategy with the approval of the ""14th Five-Year Plan"" (2021-2025). This plan includes blockchain industry development initiatives for 29 provinces and cities across the country. This push aims to enhance China's global competitiveness in critical economic sectors through what officials term ""Chinese-style blockchain"" - blockchain without cryptocurrencies, according to a research article published in the Big Data & Society journal.

The Chinese city of Shanghai issued an implementation plan on July 31, 2023 to promote the development of its urban blockchain digital infrastructure system for the period of 2023-2025. The plan aims to strengthen blockchain applications in Shanghai's economy and governance, supporting municipal affairs and coordinating resources in the Yangtze River Delta to create an international blockchain hub according to an article on Cointelegraph.

The government views blockchain through the lens of 'state techno-solutionism,' a technological tool to boost national competitiveness and modernize agriculture. This approach aligns with broader national goals, including what Chinese officials refer to as the 'rejuvenation' of the nation. Such a perspective stands in contrast to the Western cypherpunk blockchain movement's vision of decentralization and freedom from governmental and corporate control according to the article in Big Data & Society journal.

According to various news on the Chinese government website, the country is integrating blockchain technology into various sectors. Among these, in 2024 China uses blockchain to propel its foreign trade, in social and economic development, the digital trade sector, and the creation of new information infrastructure. Additionally, courts at all levels are exploring the use of blockchain to improve judicial processes. This integration is happening alongside other advanced technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and big data analytics.

In May 2023, China established a national blockchain research center with the goal of training at least 500,000 blockchain professionals for the country. For comparison, there are currently only about 26,000 active blockchain developers worldwide, according to data from the Developer Report website.

In August 2023, at the Hangzhou Summit, officials unveiled a blockchain-powered data exchange platform. The Hangzhou Data Exchange uses distributed ledger technology to enable enterprise IT data trading, providing a system for immutable and traceable transactions, according to a report by China News Network. Over 300 enterprises, including Alibaba Cloud and Huawei, participated in its debut.

In December 2023, China's Ministry of Public Security launched RealDID, a blockchain-based platform to verify the real-name identities of China's 1.4 billion citizens. This system aims to provide a form of ""pseudonymity"" where users can register and log in to websites using DID addresses and private keys, keeping their real identities hidden from other users and businesses. However, the government retains the ability to link these digital identities to real individuals when necessary, according to a report by CoinDesk.

On March 30, 2024, China launched its national key R&D program for an ultra-large-scale blockchain infrastructure platform for the Belt and Road Initiative - China's global strategy to expand its economic and political influence through improved trade routes and infrastructure across Asia, Europe, and Africa.

The Belt and Road Initiative, estimated to cost between $1-8 trillion, is one of the largest economic development projects in history. It includes the ""Information Silk Road,"" a digital dimension comprising deep-sea internet cables and satellites. This digital infrastructure overlays the physical BRI corridors, creating a foundation for advanced software-based services, including blockchain applications. The integration of physical and digital elements positions the BRI as a comprehensive system of land, sea, and space connectivity, potentially revolutionizing global trade and economic cooperation, according to Wolfgang Lehmacher's study published in the Port Technology International journal.

""The time is now to view geopolitics through the lens of blockchain technology,"" writes anti-financial crime expert Douglas McCalmont in his LinkedIn post. He notes that ""China will soon maintain a powerful and insular global (parallel) economy to challenge all things US.""

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has issued guidelines encouraging social capital investment in innovative agricultural technology enterprises, with a specific focus on key agricultural technology research and blockchain application promotion.

The agricultural sector implements social credit systems in rural areas using blockchain technology. For instance, in 2020, Qingyuan, Guangdong province, introduced a blockchain-based system called ""Persimmon Points"", according to a study published in the Big Data & Society journal. This system allows participants to earn points for ""positive actions"" and lose points for perceived negative behaviors, with the data transparently recorded on a public blockchain.

Another example is the GoGoChicken project, a collaboration between local governments and a blockchain technology company, uses blockchain and IoT devices to record and monitor the entire chicken production process, from breeding to sales. Positioned as a poverty alleviation tool, the project caters to safety-conscious urban consumers willing to pay premium prices for traceable food products. However, the article in Big Data & Society journal raises questions about the project's potential impact on farmers' data control and empowerment. The study argues that ""Blockchain fortifies the extraction and exploitation of data, granting businesses greater access and control over information belonging to vulnerable groups.""

China's rapid advancement in blockchain technology has raised concerns in the United States, leading to legislative action. According to a report by CoinDesk, in November 2023, U.S. lawmakers introduced the CLARITY Act, proposing to bar federal government officials from doing business with China-based blockchain firms and using China-based blockchains. The bill prohibits transactions with iFinex (Tether's parent company), The Spartan Network, and The Conflux Network. It aims to prevent foreign access to national security intelligence and private information. The Act also directs U.S. agencies to develop a plan addressing risks from China's blockchain technologies.

China's approach to blockchain technology demonstrates a strategic duality. On the mainland, Beijing has banned global crypto networks while developing and promoting versions of next-generation monetary technology that provide greater control to the Chinese Communist Party's government. Meanwhile, through Hong Kong, China maintains a presence in global crypto markets, leveraging the city's special administrative status as a financial gateway. This two-pronged approach allows China to take advantage of blockchain's potential while maintaining tight control over its financial systems on the mainland.

As noted in the article by Ben Schreckinger in POLITICO, this strategy enables China to ""exert internal financial controls on the mainland while impeding capital flight to bet on the potential of global crypto networks to disrupt money and finance."" Schreckinger further observes: ""Inside China, Beijing will be able to keep the world's biggest population and second-largest economy running on financial networks it designs and controls (and push trading partners to join them) -- without giving up its ambitions to make China a player in the more unruly crypto networks used elsewhere."""
14 Attorneys General Sue TikTok As Its Future In The U.S. Is On The Line,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandralevine/2024/10/08/attorneys-general-sue-tiktok-ban/,2024-10-08T14:07:59Z,"ipartisan attorneys general from more than a dozen states and Washington are suing TikTok in separate but coordinated complaints alleging TikTok is a deliberately addictive platform that is psychologically harming and financially exploiting kids.

The suits were filed by attorneys general in New York, California, New Jersey, Oregon, Mississippi, Kentucky, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Vermont, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Washington state and Washington D.C.

At least one of those lawsuits, from D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, takes aim at problematic ways that money changes hands on TikTok, alleging the app is running an ""unlicensed virtual currency system"" that has made its popular livestream feature the equivalent of ""a virtual strip club"" for teens. The complaint, filed in D.C. Superior Court, cites and quotes the Forbes investigation ""How TikTok Live Became 'A Strip Club Filled With 15-Year-Olds,'"" along with internal TikTok materials that support it. The district accuses the company of violating consumer protection and money transmission laws by making false or misleading statements about how safe the platform is for young users, and it's demanding a jury trial.

""TikTok's platform, designed to be dangerously addictive, inflicts immense damage on an entire generation of young people,"" Schwalb said in a statement. ""In addition to prioritizing its profits over the health of children, TikTok's unregulated and illegal virtual economy allows the darkest, most depraved corners of society to prey upon vulnerable victims.""

After the state of Utah sued TikTok on similar grounds in June, company spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement: ""TikTok has industry-leading policies and measures to help protect the safety and well-being of teens. Creators must be at least 18 years old before they can go live, and their account must meet a follower requirement. We immediately revoke access to features if we find accounts that do not meet our age requirements."" (The follower requirement means that only users with an audience of more than 1,000 can go live.)

TikTok's future in the United States remains in limbo after President Joe Biden signed a law earlier this year that will ban the app nationwide come January over national security concerns -- unless its China-based parent, ByteDance, sells TikTok to an American owner. TikTok and ByteDance subsequently filed a lawsuit challenging that law, as did a cohort of TikTok creators, calling it unconstitutional and a move to simply shutter a platform used by 170 million Americans. Just last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington heard their arguments against a looming shutdown (both sides asked the court to issue a ruling by December 6, so the losing party can appeal). But against the backdrop of this high stakes legal fight in the Capitol, which could see a foreign-owned social media app barred from this country for the first time ever, states have steadily been building their own arsenal against TikTok. A bipartisan group of attorneys general launched an investigation into TikTok's alleged harms to underage users back in 2022. And after many months of individual states jockeying for internal TikTok documents in their respective probes, the new lawsuits filed today reveal some of the early results of that work.

Child safety and mental health concerns related to social media are now well-known and well-documented, so much so that schools across the country have started banning smartphones from their classrooms and campuses. More overlooked are the ways that minors are earning and spending money on these platforms, and the potential dangers that can create.

TikTokers regularly earn and spend money through TikTok Live: Those watching the broadcasts can use real money to purchase TikTok coins, which can then be used to buy and send digital TikTok gifts directly to those hosting livestreams, who can redeem them for actual cash.

TikTok policies state that users must be 18 or older to go live, and that those under 16 are blocked from hosting livestreams altogether. But like every major social media platform, TikTok has struggled to verify the ages of its users, making it easy for them to gain access and freely use Live and its monetization features. Forbes reporting has brought to light the ways they have been misused to lure young girls into performing suggestive, and potentially illegal, acts for adult men on TikTok Live -- one of the key issues highlighted in the D.C. attorney general's complaint.

""The company knows that Live is unsafe, exploiting children financially and sexually,"" the filing says. ""Operating in part like a virtual strip club, Live provides young streamers with a performance stage, and allows other users to entice streamers into sexual acts in exchange for virtual money.""

In one TikTok Live detailed in the Forbes investigation, a 14-year-old in a bralette fielded requests from strangers on a 2,000-person broadcast, some offering ""$35 for a flash,"" asking to see her feet and telling her they'd send money to her Cash App. ""You're paying my bills,"" the young girl told viewers.

In another, a teen slowly cut off her shirt with a pair of scissors as an audience of 3,000 egged her on. ""IF U DO THE BLACK PART IM GONNA SEND TIKTOK LIVE 35.000 TIKTOK COINS (400$),"" one commenter wrote, urging her to snip her bra. On other TikTok streams, often filmed from girls' bedrooms and bathrooms, they were offered financial rewards if they'd kiss each other or spread their legs for the camera.

The D.C. filing describes TikTok's ""virtual economy"" as ""similar to a casino that facilitates the exchange of money for poker chips."" It says that the fact that TikTok gifts -- which include hearts, ice cream cones and lollipops -- look like ""plush toys"" and ""cute, colorful animated emojis reminiscent of cartoons and Disney characters,"" they distract children and parents from how much money is being exchanged and the reality of what may be going on (a tactic it calls ""currency confusion"").

""Despite TikTok's representations, it has knowingly created a system on Live that allows youth who view live streams to be taken advantage of financially and youth who live stream themselves to be sexually exploited by adults on the platform,"" the complaint says.

It also alleges that despite TikTok offering a mechanism for people to send money to each other and facilitating ""billions of dollars in transactions,"" it is not licensed to do so, as is required by district and federal laws. It argues TikTok should be registered with the district's Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking, and the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which work to ensure that payment platforms are adequately protecting users from illegal activity like sexual exploitation, drug trafficking and money laundering.

""By not registering as a money transmitter, TikTok not only masks criminal activity on the app from regulators, but also tricks its most vulnerable and unsuspecting users into using its platform for monetary transactions without sufficient safeguards,"" the complaint says. ""At no time has TikTok clearly told users -- many of whom TikTok knows are children -- that TikTok Live is littered with known criminals and that TikTok knows users are at heightened risk of fraud and other financial crimes.""

TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
This $1 Billion Michigan RIA Shuns Alternatives In Favor Of Dividend Stocks,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2024/10/08/this-1-billion-michigan-ria-shuns-alternatives-in-favor-of-dividend-stocks/,2024-10-08T13:51:33Z,"Background: Steinberg graduated from Michigan State University in 1984 with a degree in accounting and began his career specializing in tax preparation and planning at Deloitte. He went back to law school at the University of Michigan and then worked for a couple years as an estate-planning attorney for Honigman, Detroit's largest law firm. In 1993, he started as an advisor with many of his early clients being former colleagues from the law firm. Steinberg eventually started Blue Chip Partners in 2004 and brought on his longtime partner, Daniel Seder, a year later. Today the firm has 33 employees servicing roughly 800 clients.

Building Relationships: Blue Chip Partners has positioned itself to do the whole range of planning for clients -- from investments to taxes to estate planning -- all under one roof, with different subsidiaries of the business to help specialize in each segment. The firm also focuses on educating clients through a very active social media presence and even has its own podcast.

Competitive Edge: Steinberg says excellent employee hiring and retention as a pillar of the firm's success. Prospective hires all take the Caliper Profile assessment, a rigorous personality test designed to predict future job performance. This not only allows the team to hire from outside the business, but also to find 'team players' such as former college athletes, for instance, who understand the importance of working together or not winning every game of a match, says Steinberg.

Investment Philosophy/Strategy: Blue Chip uses an independent investment department of which the primary equity portfolio strategy is dividend growth. Instead of an ETF- or mutual fund-heavy model, the team's core approach to equities is investing in companies that have a track record of paying and growing dividends. ""Every time a company raises their dividend we will send clients an email... because clients own individual stocks in their portfolio they have higher risk tolerance,"" says Steinberg. ""These companies have a track record, so in down markets clients are still getting positive emails that they raised their dividend and that helps their confidence."" In terms of asset allocation, Blue Chip generally favors a 70/30 allocation of equities with the rest a mix cash and fixed income. ""We tend to be more plain vanilla on fixed income, with some ETFs and lower cost mutual funds,"" says Steinberg. ""Trying to get too smart with bonds just doesn't work -- that portion of a client's portfolio should be defensive."" When it comes to alternatives, the firm has very limited exposure: ""We have chosen to keep things simple from a client standpoint.""

Investment Outlook: ""Unless one party sweeps the election and gets rid of the filibuster, we're unlikely to see dramatic changes that will have an effect on the market,"" says Steinberg. He and his team remain optimistic about the direction of the economy as inflation is likely to continue to moderate, though they don't anticipate interest rates to come down too quickly. ""Personally, I was surprised they did 50 basis points,"" says Steinberg. ""I thought with the presidential election they would maybe be a bit more conservative.""

Best Advice: ""You're going to have snow storms, but snow melts and things will continue to do well,"" Steinberg often tells clients. He recalls early in his career, he once called up a client to congratulate him for his portfolio losing less than the market during a downturn: ""He told me, 'Never tell a client they're doing well when they are losing money.'"""
From Small Town Kansas Advisor To Managing $86 Billion For Clients In Over 30 States,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2024/10/08/from-small-town-kansas-advisor-to-managing-86-billion-for-clients-in-over-30-states/,2024-10-08T13:51:08Z,"Background: Marty Bicknell grew up in a small town in southeastern Kansas called Pittsburg. Though he was at first studying pre-law while attending nearby Pittsburg State University, Bicknell landed an internship at a small, single practitioner Edward Jones location, where he fell in love with the business. After graduating in 1991, he moved to Kansas City and got a job with wirehouse A.G. Edwards, where he worked for more than 15 years. He founded Mariner in 2006 with seven other partners on the idea that operate according to the fiduciary standard, which stipulates that advisors must work in a clients best interest, rather than the ""suitability"" standard used by many wirehouse brokers, which requires products must be suitable even if they are high cost. Bicknell says that during the financial crisis his team was able to triple in size by recruiting high-quality people who were leaving bigger firms. Mariner has also been active with M&A deals, buying about 50 small RIA practices since 2012 alone. Today, the firm has grown to 1,800 advisors and 120 locations across more than 30 states, serving roughly 45,000 clients from all over the country.

Building Relationships: ""One of the most overused words in our industry is holistic planning,"" says Bicknell. ""In order for us to truly be holistic the service and talent has to be in-house, so culture, client experience and deliverables are cohesive and not spliced together."" He points to Mariner's long list of in-house offerings including such things as owning their own trust and insurance companies, a boutique investment bank for closely held business owners and dedicated institutional offerings for retirement plans. ""At this size, we have the ability to serve all client segments,"" he adds.

Investment Philosophy/Strategy: ""Our philosophy is to create access -- so if there's a unique or exclusive strategy we want to utilize our size and skill to get access to those for clients,"" says Bicknell. From an equity and fixed income standpoint, his firm likes to allocate mass affluent client portfolios into ETFs in order to bring down expenses and allow for easy access. Once a client portfolio has more than a couple million dollars, however, Mariner likes to use in-house equity and fixed income strategies primarily geared towards limiting client expenses. A majority of the firm's client base are also invested in alternatives such as private equity or real estate, making up anywhere between 10% and 30% of portfolios.

Investment Outlook: ""In general, even with the market near all-time highs, we're still very constructive with our investments,"" says Bicknell. He remains optimistic going into 2025, adding that the market and the economy are in a good place. ""We always think there could be some short term volatility, which may present short-lived buying opportunities,"" he adds. ""With a Federal Reserve that is reducing rates, the over-talked about recession has never come: All of those things bode well for companies in general and therefore the economy.""

Best Advice: The key to success is bringing in and training young talent, says Bicknell. He points out that for every acquisition Mariner makes, he and his partners may talk to a dozen or more firms in the process. In what is a hugely fragmented space, learning about your peers can be a big advantage: ""The leading firms in the industry are the ones who understand the need to invest in next-gen, rather than being cost-conscious,"" says Bicknell."
FamilyOfficeHK BrandVoice: Hong Kong: Key Link Between Mainland China And The Middle East,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/familyofficehk/2024/10/08/hong-kong-key-link-between-mainland-china-and-the-middle-east/,2024-10-08T12:46:03Z,"Hong Kong stands to benefit from strengthening Sino-Arab ties, drawing family offices and investors from the Middle East.

The global balance of economic power is undeniably tilting eastward as the strengthening ties between China and the Arab states are a testament to this seismic shift. This deepening cooperation extends beyond two-way trade to encompass a multifaceted partnership reaching political, cultural and technological dimensions.

During the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in May 2024, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to step up the building of a China-Arab community with a shared future. The effort was fortified when Premier Li Qiang visited the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) and Saudi Arabia in September 2024 when Li urged enterprises to seize new investment opportunities as partnership with China entered a crucial historical juncture.

In the past two decades, the trade volume between China and Arab states surged from US$36.7 billion in 2004 to US$398 billion in 2023. This exponential growth reflects the deepening economic integration between the two regions, underpinned by shared interests, complementary strengths and a collective vision for a prosperous future.

At the forefront of this transformation stands Hong Kong, a unique and strategic jurisdiction that bridges the East and West, empowering Middle Eastern investors to capitalize on China's rise.

""China is Saudi Arabia's first economic partner. Trade between the Kingdom and China is equivalent to 90% of the total trade of the G7 countries,"" Saudi Minister of Investment Khalid Al-Falih says. The ties between the two countries have gradually grown beyond trade.

China built the Haramain High-Speed Railway that links Makkah and Madinah in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the Arab states are important partners to China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative, and this solidifying partnership aligns with other significant national rejuvenation policies in the Middle East, such as Saudi Vision 2030. Under which, energy-transition investment into Chinese companies in areas including electric vehicles, batteries, energy storage, renewables and industrial technology has been focused on by Saudi investors.

The latest China-Arab States Cooperation Forum also agreed to set up 10 joint laboratories covering fields such as life and health, artificial intelligence, green tech and agriculture. China is leveraging its existing institutions for training satellite management and other aerospace projects. For example, China is set to help Oman build its first satellite.

These are but a fraction of the breadth and depth of the evolving partnership between China and the Arab world, covering key high-tech and strategic sectors that present significant investment opportunities for Middle Eastern investors looking to access China's growth potential through Hong Kong.

At the heart of this dynamic landscape stands Hong Kong, a city with a GDP surpassing US$380 billion in 2023 and the world's 10th largest trading economy. It is China's largest source of overseas direct investment, as well as the leading international asset management hub, and the largest cross-border private wealth management and hedge fund center in Asia.

The city is uniquely positioned to serve as a conduit between the Middle East and mainland China's vast opportunities. Strategically located at the mainland's southern doorstep, Hong Kong's status as the gateway to China and the Greater Bay Area is reinforced by its world-class infrastructure, including the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and the high-speed rail link to Guangzhou.

Beyond its geographic advantages, Hong Kong's distinct governance framework under the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle, coupled with its robust legal and financial institutions, endows the city with a unique competitive edge.

It is home to the world's largest offshore hub in renminbi (RMB) settlement, allowing businesses convenient access to a wide variety of RMB services from banks and financial institutions. The city's free market economy, low taxation and international orientation make it an attractive destination for Middle Eastern businesses and family offices seeking to establish a foothold in China and the broader Asia-Pacific region.

The bilingual international city has also emerged as a crucial Middle East connector, serving as a vital link between the two regions in areas such as trade, investment and cultural exchange.

Between 2017 and 2021, Hong Kong and the U.A.E. enjoyed an annual average growth of 4.1%, and about 9.5% of the buoyant and growing trade between the U.A.E. and mainland China was routed through Hong Kong in 2021.

Hong Kong also boasts the highest number of ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) in Asia and a long-standing tradition of family wealth management, providing a compelling ecosystem for Middle Eastern family offices to thrive.

As of 2023, there were around 2,700 single-family offices in Hong Kong, with over half of them set up by UHNWIs with wealth of US$50 million or above. The city is actively working to attract at least 200 more single-family offices by 2025, with the Middle East region remaining a key target market in its strategic vision to cement its status as Asia's single-family office hub.

Moreover, Hong Kong's development advantages as a crucial node in China's Belt and Road Initiative have further solidified its position as an indispensable conduit between the Middle East and the world's second-largest economy.

By leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages, Middle Eastern businesses and family offices can position themselves at the forefront of this dynamic regional transformation."
Markets In The Balance: Election Impact Hinges On Sweep Or Gridlock,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreyschulze/2024/10/08/markets-in-the-balance-election-impact-hinges-on-sweep-or-gridlock/,2024-10-08T12:40:55Z,"I write about financial market trends and recession risk indicators.

With a month to go before election day, the presidential race remains tight with Kamala Harris maintaining a slight lead over Donald Trump. Based on the prediction markets, the two most likely outcomes are either a Republican sweep or a Harris presidency with a divided government. This is due to races for the Senate favoring the Republicans.

Different presidential and congressional configurations will dictate how much legislation can be passed and ultimately how much an effect politics will have on stocks and the economy. A sweep scenario can lead to drastic changes in tax and spending policies. With a divided government, regulation and trade policy will come into play, because those are the areas where the president can act unilaterally.

Taxes

The new president will face a unique tax situation because major elements of the TCJA, the Trump tax cuts, are sunsetting in 2025. If nothing is done, almost every taxpayer will see a higher average tax rate. This should act as an incentive from both sides of the aisle to negotiate and extend some of these expiring provisions.

Kamala Harris recently released tax proposals to dramatically increase the tax rates on corporations and high-income households while leaving most Americans taxes unchanged, promising to protect households making under $400,000 from higher taxes. Her tax goals are unlikely to become reality, however, unless the Democrats retain control of the Senate and flip the House of Representatives.

Meanwhile Donald Trump would likely prioritize extension of the TCJA, including reinstating individual provisions that expired, including business depreciation allowances such as immediate expensing for equipment, property and research and development.

Regulation

From a regulatory standpoint, Harris is focused on prescription drugs, more affordable housing, a higher minimum wage, lower grocery costs and a supportive stance toward clean energy. She has also talked about accelerating Medicare negotiations on more drugs and cracking down on pharmacy benefit managers, creating more risk in health care.

Trump significantly dialed back regulation in his first term. Most of the former president's efforts on the deregulation front will likely be focused on labor, education, the environment and health care, with a slowdown in the transition to EVs. Energy production and fracking in particular should increase. A potential negative, at least from a labor market perspective, is more stringent immigration policies, which could hurt labor-intensive companies.

It's worth noting, however, that the expected election outcomes due to regulation are usually very different from what ends up occurring. The consensus thought energy would thrive under the Trump administration, yet it was one of the worst-performing sectors in his four years. Under Obama, health care was expected to be a tough sector, but it performed well on a relative basis. So, it's important not to read too much into higher regulation and what the impacts will be for these sectors.

Trade

Harris is expected to mostly maintain the status quo on trade policy from the Biden administration. Changes are expected to be more surgical compared to the broad brush approach Trump has discussed. Harris would likely remain firm on China to protect industries like solar and semiconductors.

From a Trump perspective, we expect a repeat of what we saw under his first term. He is proposing two types of tariffs: a 10% across the board tariff on all imported goods and increases on Chinese tariffs to 60%. According to a Tax Foundation analysis, a 10% tariff and retaliation from U.S. trading partners would be expected to contract the economy by 1%. From a trade perspective, equities would face more headwinds under Trump while a Harris win would continue the status quo.

Fiscal Spending

The most bipartisan view right now is that government spending will keep growing. Neither candidate wants to rein in spending. Deficits are forecast to be in the 6%-7% of GDP range for the foreseeable future and potentially even higher in a sweep scenario where more legislation gets passed. Harris would prioritize spending on health care, housing, childcare, clean energy and infrastructure.

Trump is expected to keep spending focused on defense and infrastructure. The fiscal thrust from a Republican administration will come in the form of tax cuts, while the Democrats will likely lead with more spending. We expect such policies to boost the economy in either scenario.

Impacts of a Trump Victory

In aggregate, we view a second Trump presidency under a sweep scenario as net positive for equities. The expectation is for a more favorable corporate tax regime and less of a regulatory burden, both of which should boost corporate profits. Conversely, there is the potential for increased tariffs and retaliation from U.S. trade partners. A gridlock scenario where the House is under Democratic control would be mildly negative as fewer provisions of expiring tax legislation would get extended.

We view U.S. stocks as best placed under Trump, with banks and capital markets, as well as the oil and gas complex, well positioned due to lighter regulation. Aerospace and defense is also likely going to benefit as well as biopharmaceuticals.

Impacts of a Harris Victory

We see a Harris win as mildly negative to equities should she preside over a divided Congress. It will be more of a headwind to the markets should we see a Democratic sweep as she will then be able to implement higher taxes on corporations and high-income individuals, as well as push a more ambitious regulatory agenda. However, tax credits for low-income individuals would provide an offset, creating an economic boost to this segment of the economy.

Tighter regulation could weigh on biopharmaceuticals, banks, capital markets, energy as well as mega cap technology. Areas to be bullish about under Harris would be consumer discretionary, specifically restaurants & leisure, home building and building products.

It's easy to categorize each candidate as bullish or bearish, but markets have gone up regardless of the party in control. In our view, economic momentum will be a bigger driver of equities over the medium to long term."
"Author Post: Live, Work, and Play at Sea: Fast Internet Revolutionizes Cruise Life",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbooksauthors/2024/10/08/live-work-and-play-at-sea-fast-internet-revolutionizes-cruise-life/,2024-10-08T12:09:08Z,"The world changed in 2020 with the pandemic. We all had to find a way to change the way we worked. ""Zoom meetings"" became the standard, our wardrobes evolved to focus on comfort, and our time with family became important again.

Fast-forward a few years, and we are beginning to see how we might have appreciated the pandemic work environment: working wherever and whenever we wanted to.

Since then, our lives have become our top priority, and smart companies have learned to wrap their companies around their employees' lives, as opposed to the traditional work environment where employees suit up and cube up in a vast office universe.

When traveling on Royal Caribbean's Jewel of the Seas last year in the North Atlantic, probably one of the most remote places on the planet, I was surprised to discover that they had high-speed internet.

I could do Zoom calls, podcasts, and interviews. They installed the new ""Starlink,"" developed by Elon Musk's firm Space X. It is a low-orbit, freakishly fast satellite. Typically, satellite internet is not very responsive, slow, and frustrating. Anyone who has tried to use the internet in the past knows exactly what I am referring to. It's expensive, and you can't get it to work properly, so you just give up after a few too many coffees and swear words.

The cruise lines seem to be doubling down.

I reached out to Royal Caribbean for their thoughts on the matter, and it seems they are going 'all in' to a universe of high-speed internet. ""Seamless connectivity has been a game changer in the onboard guest experience,"" said Martha Poulter, SVP and Chief Information Officer of Royal Caribbean Group. ""Starlink enables us to provide high-speed internet across our fleet so that our guests can be connected, no matter where they sail with us.""

This innovation begs the question- is Starlink a tech shift that could transform the way we work to a whole new level? With Starlink, anyone can use the internet for business or pleasurethe world. Are we on the verge of being able to work ""whenever"" and ""wherever"" we want, including the North Atlantic Sea?

The book Start. Scale. Exit. Repeat. discusses how tech shifts can transform the world and how that shift can impact humanity. Tech shifts happen all the time. We saw how internet access in the 90s connected the world, how broadband created online cloud computing, and how the internet enabled a sharing economy with companies like Airbnb connecting renters with homeowners.

Today, we are seeing AI transform industries. The advent of high-speed internet anywhere by SpaceX and similar startups will unleash another paradigm shift: Live, Work, and Play anywhere in the world.

Today, you can book a cruise and continue to work at your company. Hammer out a few deals and hit the afternoon cocktail hour overlooking the icebergs in Alaska.

I was impressed with the speed of the internet, but I have to admit I was also frustrated with the lack of privacy needed to conduct my meetings. I would usually be found in the suite lounge doing meetings and podcasts, only to find other like-minded workaholics punching keys on their laptops and doing video meetings. At one point, I even tried to find space in the closed casino, but too many people were walking by and giving me strange faces.

My room wasn't that much better, as my wife and kids really didn't want me working there. In the near future, I predict cruise companies will begin to build some office infrastructure to allow people to work at sea, extending the time people can spend on a cruise ship.

The idea that youally work at sea prompted my wife and decideision to purchase a condo on a ship called Storylines MV Narrative, due to launch in 2027.

The ship comes fully equipped with all the amenities you would expect with a cruise ship: restaurants, a gym, and a theater, but it also includes private and shared offices in a facility dedicated to remote workers. Think of it like a ""We Work"" at sea. The ship is not a typical cruise ship but a residential ship -- a mobile lifestyle where your home travels with you all over the globe.

The notion that we need to work in an office from 9 to 5 has gone out the window with the pandemic. Now, the notion that we need to live in one location has changed with the advent of the internet everywhere on the planet.

At Storylines, they think about the importance of living and working at sea. ""There are many workspaces onboard, including meeting rooms, office spaces, the recording studio, hobby and makers center, artist studio, the medical lab, and more,"" says Alister Punton, the CEO of Storylines.

Storylines is committed to installing the most advanced internet available, making it possible to work at any location on the globe. ""Starlink is high on our list of suppliers. We are working towards providing at-home, at-work levels of connection for all the ship's residents, which will be provided utilizing a combination of methods, including LEO, VSAT & MBB.""

The ship, which tends to attract retirees, also appeals to families and entrepreneurs who want to live a traveling lifestyle while still building wealth.

My wife and I plan to travel three to six months yearly. Along with connecting with a community of fellow travelers and exploring the world, I see it as a unique opportunity to advance my mission of speaking globally about helping entrepreneurs start, scale, and exit their companies."

Forbes Daily: Nvidia Overtakes Microsoft As Market Cap Hits $3.19 Trillion,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/10/08/forbes-daily-nvidia-overtakes-microsoft-as-market-cap-hits-319-trillion/,2024-10-08T11:57:16Z,"When inflation spiked in the wake of the pandemic in 2021 and 2022, the Federal Reserve was ""behind the curve"" in its response, one official from the central bank told Forbes.

Forbes recently spoke with Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and an alternate member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which votes on the target federal funds rate. The Fed began hiking rates in March 2022, and then raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to over 5% -- the fastest interest rate increase in four decades.

Looking ahead to the second half of the decade, Goolsbee is keeping a close eye on growth in productivity, which he said would support an expanding economy without inflation.

Despite losses for its big tech peers, Nvidia's stock rallied Monday, leading it to eclipse Microsoft as the second-largest company in the world amid the AI boom. Nvidia registered its highest market cap since August at $3.19 trillion, trailing only Apple, valued at $3.4 trillion.

Influencers are touting egg donation as a cash cow to millions of followers on the internet. But while social media is helping to destigmatize fertility problems and procedures, some donor-conceived people and experts say the vast majority of content that lures donors with big payouts is doing more harm than good.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 suffered their worst days since early September following two new hurdles for investors that threaten to increase the cost of doing business and cut into profit margins. Crude oil prices and government bond yields, which influence borrowing costs as many loans are benchmarked against Treasury notes, both moved to multiweek highs Monday.

Andreessen Horowitz cofounder Ben Horowitz tweeted that he and his wife will make a ""significant"" donation to Vice President Kamala Harris, a notable reversal of his previous support for former President Donald Trump. Still, Horowitz said Harris' campaign has yet to formally state its intentions with their tech policies and that the ""Biden Administration has been exceptionally destructive on tech policy across the industry.""

Vice President Kamala Harris defended her economic plan in an interview with 60 Minutes on Monday, predicting Congress will go along with paying for her agenda, as the nominee has already called for an ""opportunity economy"" focused on the middle class and released plans that include lowering grocery and prescription drug prices and addressing the housing crisis. Harris' economic plan would increase the federal deficit by $3.5 trillion through 2035, according to an estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

One of Donald Trump's prized properties, the landmark building 40 Wall Street, now appears underwater. The remaining 35 years on Trump's leasehold in the Financial District tower is worth about $116 million, which is $2 million less than the estimated $118 million Trump owes on his mortgage, according to a Forbes analysis.

The Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge brought by social network X on Monday, after the Elon Musk-owned company sued the federal government for forcing it to turn over information about former President Donald Trump to Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team. Prosecutors asked the company, formerly known as Twitter, to sign a non-disclosure agreement barring them from informing Trump or his associates about the warrant.

As Hurricane Milton, now a Category 4 storm, is slated to make landfall in Florida this week, major U.S. airlines are issuing travel waivers allowing passengers flying in or out of impacted airports to rebook without paying the fare difference.

The Supreme Court's new term kicked off Monday, and the justices are slated to hear cases on major issues like guns, transgender rights, vaping and environmental impact studies. The nation's highest court is likely to add a number of other key cases to its docket, including former President Donald Trump's criminal cases and challenges to the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness relief efforts.

TOPLINE Phoenix Capital Group, founded in 2019, says it's an oil and gas company, specializing in acquiring mineral rights and drilling independently. But its core competency seems to be raising funds from yield-hungry investors.

Mostly through advertising run on conservative radio shows like The Sean Hannity Show and webinars which it holds daily, founder Adam Ferrari reports that Phoenix has so far raised $700 million of a planned $750 million private high yield bond offering. Some 95% of its sales, says Matt Willer, head of Capital Markets, are to people above the age of 55, with half of the funds coming from 401(k)s and IRAs.

Phoenix is one of a growing number of little-known financial firms taking advantage of Congress's Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2012, which enabled companies to more easily sell unregistered securities, otherwise known as private placements, directly to individual investors.

From 2009 through 2020, $15 trillion of so-called Reg D offerings were sold, according to a 2023 study by SLCG Economic Consulting. During the same time period, fully SEC registered offerings, of stocks, bonds and ETFs trading on exchanges, tallied $16.4 trillion in sales.

As the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) movement gained traction, many banks and large institutional investors began withdrawing from fossil fuels, citing environmental concerns. This opened a window for sellers of unregistered securities, especially those with enticing offerings like Phoenix and its oil bonds yielding as much as 13%.

WHY IT MATTERS ""The private placement market is booming, offering a fast track for companies to raise capital,"" says Forbes senior reporter Brandon Kochkodin. ""Phoenix Capital Group has tapped into this trend, drawing mom-and-pop investors to its debt with promises of high yields and the opportunity to create 'generational wealth.' Yet, a recent deal between Phoenix and Fortress Investment Group, a Wall Street behemoth, suggests that smaller investors might not be getting paid enough interest for the risk they're taking.""

A lack of response, or ""ghosting,"" can be frustrating in the workplace, especially when it comes from your boss. First, assess whether their absence is out of character, and if so, give them leeway. Ensure your communication is concise and prioritized, establish regular check-ins and keep a detailed record of your communication attempts. If the behavior becomes a chronic issue, consider seeking advice on potential solutions from a mentor or senior leader.

Data Revisions Reveal: Consumers Have More Spending Power Than We Thought,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2024/10/08/data-revisions-reveal-consumers-have-more-spending-power-than-we-thought/,2024-10-08T11:37:42Z,"Consumers are in better financial shape than we had previously realized, according to revisions of critical information about U.S. incomes, spending and saving. Savings, in particular, are much higher than we had known.

Like virtually all of our economic data, early releases are best-estimates from incomplete information. The numbers are collected from surveys of consumers, businesses and governments. Over time, the statistical agencies get better data. I previously explained the process in relation to employment data. (The information on income, spending and savings comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis as part of the National Income and Products Accounts.)

The biggest change in our understanding regards savings, 78% higher than previous estimates. Savings is a relatively soft estimate, one we cannot take to the bank, so to speak. But whether the true number is a bit higher or lower than the latest estimate, it's still very good.

The data revision showed more income than earlier estimates, but only a little more spending. Savings is the difference between the estimate of disposable income and the estimate of consumer expenditures. That's an important point: savings is not measured directly. It's simply the residual between income and expenditures. The calculation starts with a very big number (income) and then subtracts another very big number (spending). The result is a small number (savings) which critically depends on the accuracy of those two big numbers. Some small errors in the big numbers can make a very large difference in the small number.

Here's why this matters a great deal for the current economic outlook. Most people got substantial stimulus checks during the pandemic, in 2020 and early 2021. And most of the money was saved. This is the typical pattern of surprise income, explained in a pathbreaking book by Milton Friedman back in 1957. He wrote that spending is driven by ""permanent income,"" what a person expects financial resources to be on a long-term basis. Suppose someone gets big winnings from a lottery ticket. There may be a small splurge after the happy event, but the consumer will spread most the expenditures out over a long period.

The chart above shows the month-by-month savings (income less expenditures). Income jumped up sharply with the stimulus checks, and most of it went into savings. Consumers would likely spend the money gradually in the following years. This was a commonplace belief among us economists and one that we got right.

To judge how the savings would impact future spending, many economists calculated ""excess savings."" We looked at the path of savings before the pandemic and projected it into the future as if nothing happened. Then we subtracted this trend savings from actual savings and called the result excess savings. We accumulated it month by month as savings exceeded the trend, then reduced the cumulative excess savings as consumers spent more than they otherwise would have, bringing savings below trend.

Before the recent data revision, excess savings was thought to be coming down briskly, meaning that it would run out some time in 2025. After that, consumers would be likely to tighten their belts, reducing their discretionary spending. Now, however, the recent consumption path looks like it could go on for four or five more years.

However, it bears repeating that savings is not measured with high accuracy. And different economists have calculated excess savings using different assumptions about the underlying trend. Finally, the pandemic and related economic changes may have altered the trend that consumers wish to be on. So this optimistic take on the outlook for consumer spending should be taken cautiously.

The best data we have at this point clearly points to solid consumer spending in the aggregate. News reports will continue to feature a family with financial difficulties, as total income can grow even though some people struggle with falling income. But the overall economy is driven by the aggregates, and they look good."
Inflation Reduction Act Two Years Later: Building Clean Electricity Faster Than Ever,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/10/08/inflation-reduction-act-two-years-later-building-clean-electricity-faster-than-ever/,2024-10-08T11:22:17Z,"This is the fourth article in a series exploring the Inflation Reduction Act's impact after two years. The first summarizes its total impact, the second details historic industry investment, the third tracks a clean manufacturing boom.

In August 2022, when the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, it became the most significant investment in climate that the United States has ever made, making long-term, transformational investments in clean energy deployment, manufacturing, electric vehicles and buildings, and targeted investments to support communities disproportionately impacted by our energy system.

America's electricity sector is the IRA's cornerstone, making up 30-44% of the bill's expected economy-wide emissions reductions. Now, two years after the IRA's passage, signs of progress are emerging.

Before the IRA passed, clean electricity incentives were caught in a cycle of short-term extensions and expirations, creating enormous clean energy industry uncertainty. The IRA invested in the clean energy industry's long-term economic health by creating a decade's worth of certainty for electricity providers, developers, and investors solidifying that clean energy was the better deal for electricity consumers, shareholders, and the planet.

The IRA owes its name to the era of rising prices in which it passed. Global fossil fuel price volatility and supply chain constraints were driving up inflation and interest rates. With clean energy costs largely coming as upfront capital expenditures, the industry was in a period of moderating growth when the bill passed.

Key policies included extension and expansion of clean electricity tax credits, providing up to 60% off the cost of clean energy for ten years, the creation of manufacturing tax credits that bring clean energy manufacturing to the U.S., and billions of dollars to grant and loan programs to make sure upfront funding is there for projects that will save money in the long-term.

A New Energy Era

The effect of the IRA has only just begun to show up in clean energy deployment. While the first half of 2023 was still relatively slow on installs of solar, wind, and energy storage, 2023 ended with a new record of over 35 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity added, and the first half of 2024 saw a 91% increase over installs in the first half of 2023 at 19 GW. Not only were installations in the higher than 2023, but they were 10 GW higher than average of the previous five years. The U.S. Energy Information Agency expects a total of 59 GW of wind, solar and energy storage to come online in 2024. The growth in renewable energy installations is only expected to rise, with planned projects reported to the EIA overwhelmingly comprised of wind, solar, and batteries in coming years.

Since 2021, utility plans have also become increasingly bullish on adding new clean energy. An RMI analysis of 121 utilities representing 48% of U.S. electricity demand showed utilities are now planning to add 34% more wind and solar than they were as of August 2022. Unfortunately, plans to add gas have also increased, as utilities respond to rising electricity demand while they work to modernize their planning assumptions. Utilities don't need to rush to gas, however, as good planning and procurement practices can help utilities meet growing demand with cleaner and cheaper resources.

The IRA extended support for clean electricity across the whole sector, but publicly owned and non-profit electricity providers saw some of the most significant changes. First, tax credits that were previously inaccessible due to lack of tax liability were converted to direct pay, so non-profit entities could take direct advantage.

Rural electric cooperatives in particular are set to receive significant direct funding. Rural electric cooperatives provide electricity to 42 million people across 56% of the nation's landmass. They serve a disproportionately low-income segment of the population, but lag behind the rest of the nation in moving away from coal power, with 30% of their electricity coming from coal in 2022 compared to 19% nationwide. However, the IRA breathed new life into these non-profit utilities, setting aside $9.7 billion in funds to help cooperatives reduce emissions and install clean energy projects.

The first round of funding announcements into this program were made in September, with $7.3 billion awarded to 16 utilities across 23 states, leveraging an additional $29 billion in private investment. These funds are expected to support 10 GW of new clean energy projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from rural electric cooperatives by 43.6 million tons each year, or about 30% of cooperatives current annual emissions. Projects are also expected to reduce electricity rates substantially compared to a continued reliance on fossil energy, according to several of the awardees.

Clean Electricity for Everyone

The IRA didn't stop at driving new clean energy investment - it sought to create a positive feedback loop between the clean energy transition and the health of American manufacturing via a new set of tax credits that can be earned by producing components that go into clean energy projects.

Since the bill's passage, manufacturing facility announcements rolled in, with over $112 billion in investment slated for batteries, electric vehicles, solar, and wind. Batteries are by far the largest share of investment at 68%, shared between batteries for the electric grid and for electric vehicles which utilize slightly different chemistries. However, solar manufacturing boasts no small stake with $14 billion in announcements, which will continue to abate supply chain delays that have lingered after the pandemic.

The power of the IRA does not lie in its direct investment alone. The bill's clean energy provisions also enabled state action with four states implementing 100% clean energy targets for the first time in 2023. Minnesota and Michigan passed legislation requiring 100% of electricity sales to come from clean sources by 2040, while the New Jersey governor signed an executive order requiring 100% clean electricity by 2035. Delaware, too, passed clean energy legislation, requiring a 100% clean economy by 2050.

While interest in clean energy from states, utilities, and investors has increased, many bottlenecks remain, namely in interconnection queues, or the projects waiting to connect to the grid. Research by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that at the end of 2022, over 2,000 GW clean projects were waiting to connect, and at the end of 2023, that number had skyrocketed to over 2500 GW. Overall U.S. energy capacity is about 1,400 GW, meaning significantly more projects are waiting to connect to the grid than are currently connected.

Reforms by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aim to shorten these wait times and reduce costs, but regional approaches have shown that much more can be done in the effort to connect clean energy projects as quickly as possible. For example, Texas uses an approach to interconnection that avoids lengthy studies and costly upgrades across the transmission grid any time a project wants to connect.

This has reduced Texas' timeline to connect projects compared to other regions by 2.5 or more years, and shows why the state is predicted to add 35% of all solar projects and 44% of all battery projects this year, despite only producing 13% of the nation's electricity.

Further improvements to transmission planning, bolstered by recent FERC action, are also expected to prepare the grid to handle more clean energy, faster, but short-term actions like upgrading existing infrastructure to carry more electricity on the transmission pathways we already have can help meet our current needs.

A Clean Power Future

The investment approach of the IRA is not enough to bring electricity sector emissions down to zero - it was never expected to do so. However, it has created tailwinds, bringing industry forward and creating momentum far into the future. Now, it's time to focus on the next piece of the puzzle and make sure the momentum translates into clean power."
"Coinbase's Base Leads The Race To Become The ""Broadband"" Of Web3",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/08/coinbases-base-leads-the-race-to-become-the-broadband-of-web3/,2024-10-08T11:02:21Z,"For the casual observer, the unstoppable rise of blockchain and associated Web3 technologies seems serene, but like a swan there's always a lot going on under the surface - and I can't remember a time of more momentous movement than right now. Today, blockchain faces its ""broadband moment"", as increased adoption and use cases drive the demand for speed and capacity that's an order of magnitude higher than what came before.

This isn't a gradual, gentle evolution, and it's not the result of pan-industry collaboration, either. When you get up close and personal, it's a fierce and sometimes bitter rivalry between a range of Layer-2 (L2) networks. These L2s are designed to overcome the technical and performance limitations of underlying L1s like Solana and Ethereum. Whether they admit it or not, they are all competing to become the de facto standard; the ""broadband for the decentralized web"".

The battle to become the ""L2 that rules them all"" is yet to be decided, but we have a new contender for the crown - Coinbase, a company that combines an impeccable pedigree in blockchain with superb technical expertise. With its new solution, Base, Coinbase has thrust itself into the vanguard to become the broadband of Web3. And into the money. Per Yahoo Finance, Coinbase achieved a significant milestone in its diversification strategy last quarter, with its Base blockchain generating $56 million in revenue.

Like its competitors, Base is designed to solve issues surrounding scalability and security, but it also promises to tap into a massive sum of liquidity that stands to change the nature of the crypto markets forever. Alongside some other powerful developments, and with the support of the memecoin community, Base may just be the player that' overhauls the entire decentralized landscape and brings Web3 to a worldwide audience.

As the biggest crypto exchange in the US, Coinbase needs little by way of introduction, but market dominance in one area does not necessarily translate into L2 leadership. So what is Base, and sets it apart in a crowded - some might say far-too crowded - landscape? Well, to quote Jennifer Aniston: here comes the science bit.

Base is an Ethereum L2 blockchain that specifically focuses on security, stability, and scalability for the benefit of ecosystem builders. With Base, developers can launch literally any EVM codebase and proceed to onramp liquidity and users directly from the entirety of the Ethereum ecosystem.

$130 billion worth of assets from Coinbase and associated, interoperable chains. What makes Base so flexible is the fact that it is built out of the OP (Optimism) Stack. The OP Stack is designed to make Optimism (and now Base) as close and equivalent as possible to Ethereum itself, unlocking maximum compatibility for existing Ethereum developers. This manifests as a series of modules across various consensus, execution and settlement layers that all work together to form a massive, interoperable, and secure blockchain ecosystem.

That might all sound like Base is mostly relevant to those unsung backroom guys and gals of the blockchain industry, but it's actually incredibly significant for all of us, the ultimate end users of Web3. Sure, every L2 talks about interoperability - it's what Layer-2s are for, after all - but Base takes this to the next level, making it simple for developers to deploy services, access a massive well of liquidity, and ensure seamless interoperability with most of the major services already trusted in the Web3 space.

Jesse Pollak, the creator of Base and a key figure at Coinbase, has been quite vocal recently about the future of Base and its broader impact on the blockchain ecosystem. In one of his recent remarks, Pollak highlighted that Base is about building ""an open global economy,"" where the goal is to bring millions of people and decentralized applications (dApps) into the on-chain world. He believes that integrating Coinbase on-chain is essential to realizing this vision, which will help increase economic freedom globally. Pollak also mentioned that despite the challenges ahead, Base has already seen significant community engagement with users creating Twitter accounts, memes, and launching new projects on the platform, underscoring the excitement surrounding this new ecosystem.

If Base competed solely on integrations and interoperability, it would be a strong challenger in the L2 ecosystem. But these alone don't explain its incredibly rapid adoption, which has seen

Base hitting (and smashing) milestones at breakneck speed.Base has repeatedly hit new highs for daily transactions, most recently setting the record with more than 5 million transactions on a single day. There's also the fact that Base has a whopping TVL of $1.92 billion worth of assets, placing it as the #6 biggest chain overall, and well ahead of major competitors like Polygon and even Optimism (which, of course, uses the same base-layer technology).

Size isn't everything, of course. For the ordinary end user, whether they be an institution or individual, speed is every bit as important. Here again, Base boasts impressive credentials for the title of ""broadband of Web3"". As Brian Armstrong himself has championed, Base has gotten its transactions to under one second for finality along with just $0.01 for fees. Considering that Base is also truly global and has no regional restrictions, he claims that this transcends the capabilities of all existing international payment rails.

Meanwhile, in a further leap for Web3 innovation, Armstrong announced recently that, for the first time in history, Artificial Intelligence had used the Base blockchain to send a cryptocurrency transaction. ""AI agents cannot get bank accounts, but they can get crypto wallets,"" said Armstrong ""They can now use USDC on Base to transact with humans, merchants, or other AIs. Those transactions are instant, global, and free."" What this signals is a new space in the cryptocurrency industry that facilitates AI-powered automated trading, a development that stands to revolutionize how these markets are managed.

This is precisely why there are multiple, promising ventures specifically building on Base to leverage its cutting edge benefits. Projects like PropyKeys, which offers users an unprecedented opportunity for anyone to mint an NFT representing a digital address that corresponds to a tangible, real-world property. Speaking to PropyKeys CEO, Nina Fabbri, she said that ""Propykeys is built on Base because of their excellent leadership and commitment to bringing the world onchain. Their innovative approach and dedication to decentralization make them the perfect partner for our mission to revolutionize the real estate industry.""

In addition to multiple enterprise focused projects and revolutions in AI trading, Base has also established itself as a haven for cutting edge memecoin activity.

Jesse Pollak, head of Base and Coinbase wallet, envisions meme coins playing a significant role in onboarding new users to Base, suggesting that these culturally-driven projects will be a major driver of growth for the protocol.

Already, we have seen multiple projects launch and thrive in this ecosystem. Take for example the current leader in Base memecoins, BRETT, a project inspired by a character from Matt Furie's ""Boy's Club"" comic series and depicted as a laid-back, video game-loving figure. After its launch in February of 2024 BRETT quickly rose to prominence and has become one of the largest memecoins by capitalization in the entire market.

There's also Basenji (BENJI), themed after the popular dog breed. The BENJI token aims to follow in the footsteps of other, previously successful dog-themed memecoins, all while bringing its own utility through this domain partnership. Beyond examples like these, the Base blockchain is host to a wide array of other memecoin projects, with names like Mumu, Base God, and Toshi. This is because Base's near-instant transactions and extremely low fees make trading these assets - which have evolved from in-jokes to become crucial entry points to the world of Web3 - more attractive than on virtually any other network.

Ultimately, it's the collision of interoperability, technical innovation, speed and Coinbase's huge clout and connections that are positioning Base as the leader in the race to become the broadband of Web3. And that's to say nothing of the huge community of users and developers that Coinbase brings to the table, which makes it such a powerful player in this hyper-competitive spaceThe battle for Layer-2 hegemony is far from over, but the speed with which Base has established itself as the clear leader puts it firmly among the favorites to emerge the winner."
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: October 8, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-10-08-24/,2024-10-08T10:58:18Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are decreasing. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can put some money aside? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are known for paying teensy interest rates. But it's easy to find rates 10x higher if you know where to look. For instance, online banks and credit unions often pay much higher rates than brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you spot a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.23%, Curinos says. APY, or annual percentage yield, reflects the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts typically pay substantially higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the catch is you may have to jump through some hoops for the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.89%. You'll be in good shape if you can get an account offering a rate close to 4.89%. Last week at this time, the best rate was 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's about the same as last week's APY.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
Starbucks Stock: Path To $190,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/08/starbucks-stock-path-to-190/,2024-10-08T10:09:38Z,"Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is adding a new beverage The Pecan Crunch Oatmilk latte to its lineup, and it has been garnering good reviews. What makes this drink different from other seasonal favorites? This beverage boasts a pecan pie-inspired flavor, evoking the nostalgia of Thanksgiving. It aims to bridge the gap between the everyday routines of the fall season and the festive indulgences of the upcoming holiday season. This beverage has the potential to become a landmark product for the company, illustrating the impact a single, game-changing offering can have on a brand's trajectory. As exemplified by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), whose iconic products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, etc, have cultivated a devoted following and solidified the company's market position. Starbucks can also replicate this success, establishing a signature offering that resonates with consumers, fosters brand loyalty, and drives business growth.

Could Starbucks stock grow 2x in the next few years from the roughly $97 level it is at currently? Does this sound a bit ridiculous? Consider this - Starbucks' stock was trading at around $126 per share, almost 1.3x the current value in July 2021. We examine a scenario in this note where SBUX stock doubles from current levels, considering three key metrics: revenues, net margins, and price-to-earnings multiple.

Does SBUX stock look attractive now?

Overall, the performance of SBUX stock with respect to the index over the last 3-year period has been lackluster. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -13% in 2022, and -1% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could SBUX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? We have revised our Starbucks' Valuation to $97 per share, based on a $3.58 expected EPS and a 27.1x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2024 - almost in line with the current market price.

Snapshot of Current Scenario

Starbucks' Revenues grew from $29 billion in 2021 to $36 billion in 2023 as the company's strength in digital orders helped it rebound quickly from the pandemic setback. The company saw strength in both U.S. business and growth in the International segment during this period. However, the company's sales have been taking a hit in FY 2024 so far. The company's total sales, inclusive of new stores, were down 1% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $9.1 billion in the third quarter (ended June 30), while its global comparable sales declined 3%. Starbucks faced significant external pressures, including eroding consumer confidence, elevated inflation, and disappointing growth in China, which comprises almost one-fifth of the company's business.

How Can An Iconic Product Improve Sales?

A flagship product can potentially boost foot traffic, enhancing comparable sales opportunities. During the recent third quarter ended June, Starbucks' global comparable store sales declined by 3%, primarily driven by a 2% decline in the U.S. and a 7% decline internationally. However, when compared to a similar period before the pandemic (Q3 2019) - when Starbucks was thriving thanks to exponential growth in China, innovation in products, and global coffee alliances with the likes of Nestlé - the company's comparable sales grew 6%, driven by a 7% growth in the Americas and 5% growth in China and Asia Pacific.

An uptick in foot traffic can revitalize customer loyalty for Starbucks, bolstered by its successful rewards program. Starbucks Rewards launched over a decade and a half ago - reported 33.8 million 90-day active rewards members in the U.S. as of June 30, an increase of 7% year-over-year (also up 2% quarter-over-quarter from Q2 2024). Nonetheless, comparative analysis reveals an opportunity for further growth. For perspective, SBUX's peer Chipotle (NYSE: CMG) rewards program, introduced in Q1 2019, has surpassed Starbucks' membership numbers, with 40 million members as of Q2 2024.

Starbucks is the world's largest coffee chain. It boasts an extensive network of nearly 39,500 global stores, with over 18,000 located in North America. The company's growth momentum remains strong, with 526 net new store openings in Q3 (of which 141 were in North America). For FY 2024, the company has planned a total of 580 new stores added, with renovations planned in more than 800 stores in North America. This strategic expansion is poised to fuel revenue growth, solidifying Starbucks' market position and driving future profitability.

Margins Could Improve Going Forward

Starbucks' net margins (net income, or profits after expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) fell from levels of over 14% in 2021 to about 10% in 2022 amid increasing operating costs and increased promotional activities. Nevertheless, the company's net margins grew to about 11.5% in 2023 due to sales growth and in-store operational efficiencies. At present, the coffee king's Q3 2024 net margins came in at 11.6% (down 90 basis points y-o-y), and earnings per share dropped 6% y-o-y to $0.93. Despite near-term challenges, we remain upbeat on Starbucks' prospects, anticipating a margin rebound to historical levels driven by the company's transformative turnaround strategy. CEO Brian Niccol outlined a US-focused turnaround plan centered on four key areas: barista empowerment for consistent quality, timely delivery of high-quality offerings, revitalizing the community coffee house experience, and highlighting Starbucks' unique story, including its Costa Rican coffee farm and innovation hub.

Consumers are also willing to pay for the products they deem premium, based on Starbucks' high gross margin (~67%) which gives the business room to absorb higher input costs while still being profitable. Starbucks has consistently been able to raise prices throughout the inflationary environment in the U.S. - and most loyal customers still come in despite higher pricing and inflationary pressures - demonstrating the strength of its business.

Impact on Starbucks' Valuation?

The Pecan Crunch latte's financial impact will be directly tied to its availability. While seasonal releases yield quarterly gains, a permanent menu addition would likely foster sustained revenue growth.

If we assume revenue growth of roughly 1.26x between 2023 and 2027 with margins growing from 11.5% in 2023 to about 21% in 2026, a roughly 2x increase, this would mean that its net income could grow from about $4.1 billion in 2023 ($3.58 per share) to about $9.5 billion (about $8.29 per share). Good times make it easier to imagine even better times - and when that happens, investors could begin to see Starbucks in a more favorable light, re-assessing the company's recovery path. For example, if Starbucks' investors assign a multiple of 23x following its stronger growth trajectory, this could translate into a stock price of about $190 per share by the end of 2027, assuming earnings of $8.29 per share. What about the time horizon for this positive-return scenario? While our example illustrates this for a 2027 timeline, in practice, it won't make much difference whether it takes three years or four. If the turnaround takes hold, with Starbucks improving its revenues and margins, we could see meaningful gains in the stock. This is a huge business and Starbucks has valuable know-how in a competitive market. Our analysis suggests that a win will be at hand - it just may not be quick and may require patience.

Hyatt Hotels: Further Upside Potential After 15% YTD Growth?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/08/hyatt-hotels-further-upside-potential-after-15-ytd-growth/,2024-10-08T09:03:00Z,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation stock (NYSE: H) has gained close to 15% since the beginning of 2024 while its rival Hilton stock is up about 27% over the same period. There are a couple of trends driving the recent price appreciation. Travel demand has remained robust, despite concerns about the global economy. Over Q2 2024, Hyatt saw its comparable system-wide revenue per available room increase by 4.7% year-over-year (down from 5.5% y-o-y growth in Q1 2024), driven by higher occupancy levels and average room rates. The company's operations in Asia remain the biggest drivers of growth, as greater outbound travel from Greater China to markets including Japan, Thailand, and South Korea drives growth. Moreover, the U.S. business also increased from group and business travel. Looking ahead, the hotel operator expects system-wide revenue per available room of 3.0% to 4.0% y-o-y in FY 2024. It also anticipates a 5.5% to 6.0% increase in net room growth. In addition, the company's adjusted EBITDA is expected to land in a range of $1.10 billion to 1.14 billion in FY 2024 compared to $1.03 billion in FY 2023.

Admirably, H stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 29% in 2021, -6% in 2022, and 45% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could H see a strong jump?

Hyatt primarily makes money from fee-based revenue, licensing, and other services, allowing third-party owners and franchisees to use Hyatt's brand and intellectual property. In Q2 2024, the company added 18 new hotels and 3,251 rooms to its portfolio. The company has seen its pipeline grow 9% y-o-y to a record 130K rooms. Hyatt had previously estimated that it would derive over 80% of its earnings via fees by 2025. For this year, the company is guiding for fee-based revenues of $1.1 billion to $1.13 billion.

Hyatt has also been increasingly focused on deal-making activity, with deals in recent years including the Mr & Mrs Smith booking platform, offering direct booking access to a select collection of boutique and luxury properties, and its 2021 deal for Apple Leisure Group, a luxury resort-management services, travel, and hospitality company. Recently, Hyatt completed the sale of its 1,641-room Hyatt Regency Orlando and adjacent 45 acres of land to affiliates of RIDA Development Corporation and an Ares Management Real Estate fund for approximately $1.07 billion, while retaining a long-term management agreement under the Hyatt Regency brand. Hyatt also entered into an agreement to pay $150 million for 21 Standard International properties, and another $185 million to acquire an additional 30 new projects in the Standard International pipeline over time for a total value of $335 million. This acquisition along with the sale of the Hyatt Regency Orlando is part of the company's capital allocation strategy to sell owned hotels and reinvest in asset-light platforms to accelerate growth.

While the increasing pivot to fee-based businesses, a focus on more premium properties, and a strong and growing travel market should help Hyatt in the long run, we think the stock is fairly priced at current levels. At the current market price of about $150 per share, Hyatt trades at roughly 33x projected 2024 earnings, which aligns compared to peers. We value H stock at about $144 per share, which is almost in line with the current market price. See our analysis on Hyatt Valuation: Is H Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for more details on Hyatt's valuation and how it compares with peers.

Mortgage Rates 8 October 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-08-10-24/,2024-10-08T08:59:49Z,"Bank Rate was held at 5% in September by the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steadying interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Good news on inflation and interest rates has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy. We will know more in its Autumn Budget on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.44%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.34% and 4.19% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 3.39%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 3.79% and 3.68% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.57%, with the best in this category priced at 5.29%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stands at 7.23%, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 October there were 6,645 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,460 on 1 September. The number has been steadily growing as the market improves. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

Halifax's latest house price report (published 7 October) reported that the value of the average home was 4.7% higher in September than the previous year, while Nationwide building society's latest report (published 30 September) put annual house price inflation at 3.7%. Both lenders say it's the strongest annual growth they have seen since November 2022.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, also reported five consecutive months of rises. It found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before, although on a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."
SAP BrandVoice: How GenAI Boosts Productivity In The Construction Industry,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2024/10/08/how-genai-boosts-productivity-in-the-construction-industry/,2024-10-08T04:06:43Z,"The construction industry accounts for 14.2% of global GDP. But as other industries have steadily grown their productivity in the last few decades, construction productivity has been stuck in the mud.

Between 1970 and 2020, as aggregate productivity for the U.S. economy doubled, labor productivity in the U.S. construction sector declined an average of 1% a year. Some estimates put this at $30 billion to $40 billion in losses. Meanwhile, schedule and cost overruns are the norm.

Just 8.5% of megaprojects ($1 billion or more) meet or exceed their time and budget expectations, according to one study. On top of all of that, skilled labor is growing scarce as older workers leave the industry and fewer young people enter its ranks.

While other industries have embraced the digital world to improve efficiency and performance, construction has historically been slow to adopt technology, says Dr. David Jason Gerber, director of the M.S. in Advanced Design and Construction program at University of Southern California.

It's not hard to understand why. After all, you can't digitize concrete. Construction is a low-margin, materials-based, physical labor-intensive field.

But AI could spur construction's digital transformation. The industry has accumulated decades' worth of data that, with the help of AI-driven analysis, could be tapped to boost construction productivity, prevent schedule overruns, improve cost-effectiveness, bridge labor gaps, and reduce risks. In a recent study, 92% of construction companies said they were already using or intend to use AI.

The application of generative AI specifically could be a turning point for the industry -- particularly as construction projects grow more complex and demand continues to increase.

While generative AI isn't the only AI tool to solve the construction industry's productivity challenges, its ability to use large language models (LLM) to create new text and images through a natural language interface makes it a good fit for construction, from planning to jobsite execution.

Jose Luis Bianco, who leads McKinsey's engineering and construction work in North America, estimates that AI and gen AI together can unlock value of up to $18 billion for home builders alone (about 10% of industry revenues).

A recent article in Engineering News-Record listed several promising gen AI applications, including AI assistants or ""co-pilots"" that help employees perform tasks and quickly gather information, high-speed content generation for drafting contracts, and specialized tools to aid in decision-making, from lot selection to pricing.

Let's examine other ways generative AI can help the construction industry improve productivity.

Construction firms manage vast, complex supply chains and networks of trade partners. By analyzing data on supplier performance, quality control, and project requirements, gen AI can identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies so construction companies can proactively address issues, streamline operations, and ensure timely project completion.

When facing material shortages or delayed deliveries, for example, gen AI might suggest alternative suppliers based on past collaborations or supplier quality, to keep work flowing.

Turner Construction last fall demonstrated a gen AI tool that automates contract drafting, a huge productivity tool for a company with 30,000 trade contractor deals (those contractors who supply labor and materials for a project) every year. The tool uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand requirements, automatically generate text for statements of work or master services agreements, and speed up the overall procurement process.

Nearly one in four construction workers in the U.S. are 55 or older, according to the Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) trade association. Meanwhile, an estimated 9 million construction workers are likely to leave the industry in 2024. The US construction industry will need an estimated 501,000 additional workers on top of the normal pace of hiring in 2024 to meet demand (and another 454,000 in 2025), according to a proprietary model from ABC.

Gen AI could help get new hires up to speed much more quickly through the deployment of digital assistants for junior project managers. By interacting with existing systems and data, these assistants can answer queries, offer suggestions, and provide step-by-step instructions in real-time.

Suffolk Construction, for instance, plans to roll out the co-pilot built into its collaboration software to find information and answer questions for workers in the field.

Co-pilots could also take on tedious tasks, boosting construction productivity. Gilbane, one of the largest privately-held real estate development and construction companies in the U.S., has been conducting gen AI proofs of concept that helps its people make the best use of their time with super-fast document retrieval.

Construction projects involve multiple parties engaged in a wide range of discrete activities, and keeping everyone on the same page -- literally -- remains a challenge. It's not uncommon to use paper blueprints, drawings and specs, and when plans change, they may not have access to the most recent information.

Many in the industry have shifted to using building information modeling (BIM) systems, whereby a digital twin of the built asset is created and managed. However, updating the digital twin can be laborious, as can pulling information from the BIM, which may contain hundreds of terabytes of data.

Gen AI can help by updating the digital twin with data gathered from AI-powered cameras and sensors, and comparing it with original plans. For example, it might find important information within the data lake of the digital twin, or even send alerts when, say, piping is scheduled for the following week, but the materials are running behind.

Once the project is complete, construction firms could use gen AI to take all the data in the BIM and package it up as a digital manual, including links to warranties and troubleshooting information.

Scheduling has historically been the purview of industry pros using traditional project planning tools -- and years of experience -- to build out their schedules in a linear fashion. They usually produce a single schedule since exploring alternatives would be too time-consuming and costly.

Project scheduling could be done more quickly and accurately using AI algorithms to analyze historical company data, project requirements, and resource availability. These tools could quickly develop multiple scheduling options and run ""what-if"" analyses to explore how changes in variables (e.g., number of cranes used) impacts timelines and costs. Such automation and optimization could yield significant time and cost savings.

Building the schedule, though, is only half the battle. Adjusting it based on changing conditions is the other. LLMs can be used to assess project risks, considering factors like weather, labor availability, and supply chain disruptions.

These models can also continuously monitor a project's progress and make changes to schedules in real-time. If a task is delayed or completed early, the algorithm can automatically reschedule dependent tasks to optimize project timelines.

Keeping on top of complex, confusing and frequently changing building codes is another construction productivity drain gen AI is particularly well suited to solve. Regulations vary by jurisdiction, year, and project type. They often include exceptions and can be challenging to interpret.

Some vendors are introducing AI-powered building codes co-pilots to answer building code queries such as how many exits are required for a restaurant and minimum ceiling height for a habitable room. Gen AI could also be used to analyze building schemes and blueprints to identify elements that don't meet standards, enabling early corrections and adjustments.

Once building is underway, gen AI could also help in the execution phase to keep projects on track by monitoring progress versus plan, spotting potential delays, and recommending steps to avoid or recover from such issues. Some startups already offer drones and hard hat or crane-mounted cameras to capture information on a project's status during execution phase. Gen AI can then compare the data gathered on-site to original plans to flag problems, like deviations from plans to minimize rework or delays.

Construction businesses face multiple hurdles when it comes to taking advantage of gen AI, most of which are centered on the industry's low levels of tech adoption to date. This is combined with a propensity to favor short-term cost concerns over long-term tech investment benefits.

Nonetheless, with some of the biggest industry players moving forward with gen AI, it's increasingly less of an option to sit on the sidelines. Here's how construction businesses can get the best results and better productivity with the emerging tech:

Gen AI has great potential to enable a new wave of productivity and efficiency within the construction industry and could well be a key driver in some long-overdue digitization and data integration and governance. As more industry players experiment with and adopt the technology, the pressure is on others to adopt as well.

At Clark Construction, Mathur says company leaders are convinced that a proactive approach to gen AI adoption is critical to continued competitive advantage.

""The real risk is to not invest and be left behind,"" Gerber says."
"Ghost Rockets, ASAT Tests Create ""A Ticking Time Bomb"" For Astronauts",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinholdenplatt/2024/10/07/ghost-rockets-asat-tests-create-a-ticking-time-bomb-for-astronauts/,2024-10-08T02:38:04Z,"Decades of shooting rockets into orbit, interspersed with the firing off of anti-satellite missiles to shatter spacecraft circling the globe, are surrounding Earth with ever-moving minefields that will threaten spacefarers and space stations into the future.

Ghost rocket stages that revolve at 28,000 kilometres per hour, and missile shards from exploded ASATs, collectively form ""a ticking time bomb"" imperilling human spaceflight and the satellite constellations that ring the planet, says Darren McKnight, Senior Technical Fellow at the world-leading orbital mapping firm LeoLabs.

Dr. McKnight, one of the planet's foremost spacecraft trackers, told me in an interview he is set to sketch out urgent solutions to these escalating dangers at the upcoming meeting of the International Astronautical Congress, which opens next week in Milan. Vanguard space scholars around the world, like McKnight, flock to the yearly gathering of the IAC to map out strategies to safeguard the future for the entire spaceflight sector.

The author of a remarkable series of studies on space debris and its potential to trigger catastrophic collisions, McKnight heads the science team at the Silicon Valley-based LeoLabs, which operates a global web of phased array radars that scan low Earth orbit (LEO) while charting more than 20,000 objects in flight - from abandoned rockets to the clouds of ASAT shrapnel that circumnavigate the globe.

LeoLabs combines cutting-edge radar imagery with predictive AI tools to model imminent orbiting threats, and notifies satellite operators and other space players of high-probability smash-ups waiting in the wings.

The outfit's founder and Chief Operating Officer, Dan Ceperley, issued an ominous oracle on LeoLab's website, warning of the ""inevitability of a disaster in low Earth orbit"" due to clouds of missile shards and clusters of derelict rockets that are spinning around the globe.

He says while LeoLabs tracks tens of thousands of space objects that measure at least 10 centimeters, it is so far technically unable to map countless smaller fragments, resulting from earlier explosions, that have spread out across the orbital plane that the International Space Station flies through.

With this proliferation of rogue debris, he says,""This grim reality means that collisions are not a question of if but when.""

""Potential disasters in LEO,"" Dr. Ceperley predicts, range from an astronaut being blasted by ""lethal, small debris"" to an ""operational payload attacked by an adversary.""

His ""Guide To Disasters In Low Earth Orbit"" cautions that minuscule shards in orbit - measuring less than one centimeter - could be deadly to aeronauts spacewalking outside the International Space Station or floating outside their space capsules.

""Any size fragment above a few millimeters is likely lethal to astronauts,"" says Ceperley, who holds a doctorate in engineering from the University of California, Berkeley.

The world caught a glimpse of this peril when a tiny chip of shrapnel ripped a 5 mm hole in the robotic Canadarm2 positioned outside the ISS. ""Put simply,"" he says, ""what we can't see has the potential to kill us.""

Yet Darren McKnight says the jettisoned rocket stages that stalk the higher reaches of low Earth orbit might present the greatest threats to future space missions - both human and robotic.

At the height of the first Space Race and Cold War I, he says, the twin superpowers routinely cast off their spent upper stages in orbit, and never forged an agreement on dismantling this space obstacle course.

Like specters from the past haunting the modern celestial world, two of these colossal rocket bodies - one Soviet and one American - came within 500 meters of crashing into each other in June of 2022, even as Moscow and Washington sparred 800 kilometers below over Russia's invasion of democratic Ukraine.

The clash would have been cataclysmic, McKnight says, spewing debris ""over many hundreds of kilometers"" and creating deathly daggers of shrapnel that would ""linger for centuries,"" posing a risk to space capsules and satellites for generations.

The Kremlin-lofted Zenit rocket involved in the narrowly avoided crash, he adds, was just one of 18 identical phantom Russian spacecraft that still plague the high-risk graveyard that whirls around the planet.

All 18 have been placed on a space Most Wanted List, part of ""the top 50 objects"" that LeoLabs says should be captured and removed from LEO.

The space superpowers' rogue rockets present such an overwhelming threat to human exploration just above the Earth's atmosphere that all the world's space agencies should begin acting now to remove these hazards, says Ian Christensen, a senior director at the Washington-based Secure World Foundation. The Foundation is a vanguard think tank that aims to secure peace across the super-terrestrial sphere by uniting with scholars, statesmen and spacecraft operators across the continents to reach that goal.

Christensen, who teamed up with LeoLabs' McKnight to help stage a space summit in New Zealand earlier this year focused on ultimately ridding orbit of spectral spacecraft, told me in an interview that many space scholars have concluded that perhaps ""only a major debris-generating collision would stimulate true international resolve and commitment for debris remediation missions.""

""The biggest diplomatic challenge,"" he adds, ""is convincing the three major spacefaring countries (the United States, Russia, and China), who are responsible for 90% of the risk, to begin remediating their own large debris objects,"" especially the deserted rockets that crisscross orbital zones 800-1000 kilometers above the globe.

A onetime researcher at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, Christensen says space agencies in the UK, Japan and Europe that are spearheading precursor missions to active debris removal flights are far ahead of the space superpowers that have cast away their spacecraft in the heavens.

In a new study that he co-authored with McKnight, to be presented at the International Astronautical Congress, Christensen says unleashing the potential of the unfolding Space Race II will depend on a collective, global drive to clear the high-traffic orbital zones of the detritus of Space Race I.

A massive barricade blocking that goal, he says, is that there is now ""no economic incentive to remove debris [and] no economic incentive to really avoid creating debris.""

But that might be about to see a sea change, he predicts: ""With the space economy forecast to grow to over $1 trillion by 2040, ADR [Active Debris Removal missions] should in theory be affordable.""

Both Christensen and McKnight have lauded the introduction in the United States Senate of the ORBITS Act, which aims ""To establish a demonstration program for the active remediation of orbital debris,"" and would provide an initial fund of $150,000,000 to conduct tech demos on deorbiting the most dangerous space objects.

The bill has never been voted on in the House of Representatives, yet McKnight told me LeoLabs is urging its passage, while pressing the White House to back the legislation.

Meanwhile, McKnight says he has joined forces with space scholars around the world to craft a cluster of cutting-edge studies to be unveiled at the Milan IAC convention.

The most fascinating experiment, jointly conducted by McKnight, two astronomers at the University of Bern, and scientists at MAXAR, which operates a fleet of advanced observation satellites, focused on capturing images of five massive rocket stages and their flightpaths through orbit.

Each partner in the experiment gathered incredible imagery of the rockets, in part to determine each spacecraft's ""tumble rate"" and suitability to be captured by a future space tug and deorbited. MAXAR's photographs of one candidate spacecraft are super-high-resolution, and could enable the team to sculpt a precise digital twin of the rocket to simulate a future capture mission.

Their advances in precisely charting and modeling these abandoned spacecraft ""could be very useful for operationalizing ADR [deorbiting missions] soon,"" the American and Swiss researchers say.

Meanwhile, Jeffrey Manber, one of the NewSpace sector's leading tech visionaries, says he's perfecting futuristic blueprints to recover cast-off rockets and save them from being crashed into the Antarctic seas.

Manber, President of International and Space Stations at Voyager Space, which is designing Starlab, the most technologically advanced space station set to be launched before the ISS is decommissioned six years from now, told me he aims to begin converting these rescued rockets into station modules across the 2030s.

With breakthroughs in developing orbital transfer vehicles and space robotics, he says, Voyager could begin sending out droid-piloted recovery teams to capture these ejected spacecraft and transform them into orbital habitats and science labs within the next decade.

Voyager has already received $217 million from NASA under a Space Act Agreement to develop an independent orbital outpost, but he says there will actually be a series of Starlab stations in times ahead. Starlab 3, he adds, could become the first floating factory run by robots, which will redesign spent stages into space stations ""for low Earth orbit and around the Moon."""
What To Know About Kamala Harris' Economic Agenda As She Claims Congress Will Pay For It,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/07/what-to-know-about-kamala-harris-economic-agenda-as-she-claims-congress-will-pay-for-it/,2024-10-08T01:20:44Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris defended her economic plan in an interview with ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, predicting Congress will go along with paying for her agenda, as the nominee has already called for an ""opportunity economy"" focused on the middle class and released plans that include lowering grocery and prescription drug prices and addressing the housing crisis.

Harris was asked about how she'd pay for her economic plan in her ""60 Minutes"" interview on Monday, with correspondent Bill Whitaker noting that while she wants to make the richest Americans pay more taxes, ""We're dealing with the real world here."" Harris expressed optimism that Congress will be willing to pass her economic agenda, arguing, ""When you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about, 'cause their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about."" The vice president disagreed with Whitaker saying Congress ""has shown no inclination"" to back her economic plans, saying she knows ""the limitations of government"" and claiming, ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

$3.5 trillion. That's how much Harris' economic plan would increase the federal deficit by through 2035, according to an estimate released Monday by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget -- still far smaller than the $7.5 trillion Trump's plan would cost. The organization noted its estimate is subject to a ""wide range of uncertainty,"" and actual figures could range anywhere from not having any impact on the deficit to costing $8.1 trillion at most.

""I am a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets,"" Harris declared at a September event hosted by the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, pushing back against her opponent Trump's attacks classifying Harris as a ""communist.""

Harris told CNN host Dana Bash in an August interview that her priority on ""Day One"" as president would be to start implementing her economic agenda. The vice president said one of her ""highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class,"" arguing that while she believes the Biden administration has done ""good work"" on the economy, ""there's more to do.""

Harris' economic policy agenda is largely in line with Biden's economic platform, with some tweaks to emphasize causes that are more important to her, like the child tax credit. ""Same values, different vision,"" a Harris aide told The Guardian. ""She's not moving far away from him on substance, she will highlight the ones that matter most to her."" The initial plans from Harris' campaign also suggest the vice president plans to be more aggressive in her policy approaches than Biden, however, as polls have suggested voters hold dim views of how the president has handled the economy. While Biden has also opposed price gouging, Harris' proposal to enable the FTC and U.S. attorneys to go after companies that hike up prices goes beyond what the president has proposed, Politico notes, and her proposed $40 million investment in the housing crisis is double the amount the Biden administration spent.

Harris' economic agenda so far hasn't gone fully in depth about her proposals, which The New York Times reports is by design. The Times reported before Harris unveiled her agenda that the Harris campaign has adopted a ""strategic vagueness"" for her economic proposals, believing that being more of a ""blank slate"" will help ward off attacks and attract more support from business groups.

Trump's economic agenda is largely focused on raising tariffs on imported goods, which Harris has said she opposes. The ex-president has also called for cutting taxes and regulations in hopes of lowering inflation, including lowering the corporate tax rate, and has encouraged increasing oil production in order to lower energy prices. In addition to his ""no tax on tips"" proposal that Harris has also endorsed, Trump has called for ending taxes on Social Security benefits, which Harris has not yet responded to. Experts believe the ex-president's proposal could speed up Social Security and Medicare becoming insolvent, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projecting exempting taxes on benefits would result in Social Security and Medicare receiving $1.6 trillion less in revenue between 2026 and 2035. The Trump campaign opposed reports of Harris' economic proposals in September, with spokesperson Steven Cheung saying in a statement, ""Kamala Harris can't hide from her disastrous record of skyrocketing inflation ... Americans are struggling under the Biden-Harris economy, and now she wants to gaslight them into believing her bald-faced lies.""

41%. That's the share of voters who trust Harris more to handle the economy, according to an Associated Press/NORC poll conducted Sept. 12-16, versus 43% who trust Trump more. While Trump still maintains a narrow lead, recent polling has broadly shown voters are warming up to Harris on the economy, with polls on who voters prefer on the issue going from being strongly in Trump's favor to more of a toss up. A Washington Post analysis of five recent polls found that while Trump still leads on the economy by an average of six points, that's narrowed from a 12-point lead that the ex-president held against Biden before the president dropped out of the race.

Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in July after Biden stepped down suddenly from the presidential race, following weeks of pressure over mounting concerns about his mental fitness. While the vice president has quickly garnered Democrats' support and risen in the polls, Harris released few concrete policy proposals in the first few weeks of her campaign -- drawing some criticism as a result. The vice president has made releasing a platform on economic proposals her first priority, delivering a speech earlier in August laying out her economic platform that marked the most substantive remarks she had given on policy so far. Her focus on the economy comes as polling has repeatedly shown it's the most important issue to voters in this election cycle, with the vice president hoping to attract support amid low approval ratings for Biden's handling of the economy. Harris' August 16 speech also came days after news that inflation fell in July to its lowest point in more than three years, with federal data showing inflation at 2.9% in July, the first time it's been below 3% since March 2021."
Update On Interest Rates: Is The Federal Reserve Shooting Blanks?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2024/10/07/update-on-interest-rates-is-the-federal-reserve-shooting-blanks/,2024-10-08T00:18:28Z,"The Federal Funds Rate (FFR), set by the Federal Reserve - the interest rate that everyone obsesses over - is a strange creature. It is not what it may seem, or what many people assume it to be.

The FFR is really more like a polite suggestion to banks which may or may not decide to go along. The suggestion applies only to a very narrow category of loans that may or may not happen, and which, if they do happen, involve transfers of funds that remain entirely within the closed system of reserve accounts deep inside the Fed itself. The motivation for these transactions is generally regulatory rather than economic. They are designed to ensure compliance with the Fed's reserve requirements. The FFR does not apply to any real loans to businesses or consumers.

Nevertheless, this peculiar inside game involving the manipulation of an ultra-short-term target does seem to drive changes in the broad interest rate regime that regulates the flow of credit in the real economy. The FFR typically appears to push economically important long-term interest rates to sync up, directionally. Over the last 5 years, the yields on 10 year Treasury bonds moved in lockstep with Federal Reserve interest rate targets. The correlation was 92%. The same was true for rates on 30 year fixed-rate mortgages, which showed a correlation of 94% with the FFR.

This might suggest that the Federal Reserve does indeed wield a powerful and precise instrument for influencing important long term rates - the foundational myth upon which the Fed's credibility rests. In the previous column, the hollowness of this myth was detailed. The Fed's ability to influence the real economy has been grossly oversold. Instead, we have a kind of confidence game where the Fed's power is a matter of faith - as long as we believe in it, the illusion will retain its power.

Until recently that belief has been strong. It has caused the syncing process to extend to the stock market itself. The market has shown extreme sensitivity to Fed announcements, possible announcements, redacted minutes, the phraseology of the leadership in various press encounters - resulting in a pronounced clustering of stock returns around the days when the Federal Open Market Committee meets.

This is extraordinary. There are only eight regularly scheduled FOMC meetings a year. If those eight days are removed, the gains of the S&P 500 on the other 347 days of the year are severely diminished.

[Note that this effect only appeared in the Greenspan years, where - arguably -- an important shift in Fed communications policies emerged, aimed more explicitly at influencing the financial markets. Of course, this was never part of the Fed's mandate, and there are many who view this innovative new mission with skepticism.]

Is this healthy? Is it sustainable? And what happens if Faith at some point falters? These are weighty questions. And at the moment, a smidgen of doubt may be emerging, following the recent long-awaited cut in the FFR target.

On September 16, Jerome Powell announced a 50 basis point reduction in the Fed Funds target rate, as described in a previous column. It was the first cut in more than four years. It was seen as an ""emphatic"" trend reversal, and the signal of a shift to monetary easing that will see interest rates begin to drop across the board, presumably providing a stimulant to a softening economy.

But this time the markets didn't follow the Fed's ""suggestion."" Real interest rates in the real economy rose, rapidly and substantially. The yields on the 10-year Treasury bond climbed 40 basis points, closing above the significant 4% mark today (October 7).

Interest rates on 30-year Fixed mortgages were up 58 basis points (as of October 4).

Consider the disconnect.

The Federal Reserve dropped its target rate by 50 bps, and yet market-based benchmark rates increased by more or less the same amount. The ""spread"" between the policy rate and the market rate over this three-week period widened by a full percentage point. Spread across the $25 trillion U.S. economy, and the $46 trillion bond market, that is a huge discrepancy.

There is a lesson here. The Fed's power to move the credit market is not automatic, as many people assume. Yes, it is likely that in time the market rates will begun to track downward. But the truth may have blinked through the illusion here. Is this causation, or just correlation? The Federal Reserve and the financial markets may both reach a similar conclusion, but that does not validate the efficacy of the Fed's policy moves. Certainly for the moment what is in display is the independence of the markets in declining to immediately accept the new easing regime.

This is not actually that unusual. Over the last year the correlation of the Treasury bond yields with the FFR was just 34% (a far cry from the 5-year averages). Since the FFR was fixed at 5.25% over that period, this means that the Treasury yields were bouncing around quite a bit, reflecting the market's changing views on the probability and importance of various future events (recessions, soft landings, Fed policy changes) - rather than chaining themselves to the Fed target.

And in the year before that (Oct 2022-Oct 2023), as the Fed was cranking up the target rate, correlations between the FFR and both the 10-year Treasury yield and the 30-year mortgage rates were lower still, around 20% - which means that the relationship was quite weak indeed.

A full percentage point of ""adverse"" reaction from the financial markets against the Fed's suggestion is, well, at least a little bit shocking. This is one more chink in the Fed's armor, even if the rates do eventually converge. It is starting to seem like the Fed's chief asset -- its credibility - may be at greater risk than it has been. Even the sober citizens who edit the Washington Post are worried. ""The Federal Reserve's greatest resource is its credibility. People have to believe..."" If belief falters, ""the central bank won't survive."" True, the Post's concern here was focused on questions about personal transactions by Fed officials, but the modes of impairment that can threaten the public's faith in the institution are multifarious. Public confidence in the Federal Reserve today is at or near an all-time low, and these small signals of the market's disdain for the Fed's intentions should not be discounted."
Hemp Advocates Ask Court To Block California Hemp THC Ban,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajherrington/2024/10/07/hemp-advocates-ask-court-to-block-california-hemp-thc-ban/,2024-10-07T21:01:19Z,"A national hemp industry group and businesses including the company founded by weed icons Cheech and Chong last week filed a petition to block California's ban on hemp products with detectable amounts of THC. The petition for a temporary restraining order to block enforcement of the hemp THC ban was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court as part of lawsuit filed last month by the U.S. Hemp Roundtable and hemp consumer goods companies including Cheech and Chong's Global Holdings.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled the emergency regulations from the California Department of Health (CDPH) last month after a hemp products regulations bill failed to gain the approval of state lawmakers earlier this summer. The regulations, which ban consumable hemp products with any detectable amount of delta-9 THC or other intoxicating cannabinoids such as delta-8 THC, went into effect on September 23. The regulations also limit consumable hemp products to five servings per package and require retailers to sell such products only to consumers aged 21 and up.

Hemp advocates immediately balked at the emergency regulations, saying they would threaten the emerging hemp industry and harm patients who use hemp cannabinoid products therapeutically. On September 24 the U.S Hemp Roundtable filed a complaint to block enforcement of the new rules, joined by co-plaintiffs Cheech and Chong's Global Holdings, the company owned by legendary marijuana comedy duo Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong, as well as Juicetiva, Blaze Life, Boldt Runners, Lucky to be Beverage and Sunflora. On Friday, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to block enforcement of the emergency regulations while the case is heard by the court.

""If allowed to remain in effect, the Emergency Regulations will eliminate nearly every ingestible hemp product currently for sale in California, including the vast majority of nonintoxicating products,"" the petition maintains. ""Many small businesses will have to close operations immediately with millions in losses. Relief is thus warranted because the Emergency Regulations are substantially unlawful and have in any event been adopted by drastically unlawful means.""

The petition notes that state regulators have failed to fully implement and enforce hemp regulatory legislation that was passed three years ago. Additionally, the legislature this summer declined to adopt a hemp regulatory bill (AB 2223) favored by Newsom.

""The Department [of Public Health] had nearly three years since 2021 to address the issues in these Emergency Regulations, which were fully known to the Department and the California Legislature,"" the TRO request reads. ""As recently as a few weeks ago, the California Legislature refused to pass AB 2223...which would have enacted similar provisions.""

The court filing maintains that the ban on any detectable amount of THC will cripple the hemp industry. The regulation is at odds with 2018 federal legislation that legalized hemp and hemp products containing no more than 0.3% THC by weight. The rule prohibits many non-intoxicating products, including CBD products popular with many consumers.

""This draconian regulation alone will essentially devastate an emerging industry that consists largely of small business owners,"" the petition argues. ""It's akin to requiring candy to stop containing sugar...starting tomorrow.""

Jonathan Miller, general counsel for the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, said that the plaintiffs in the case would like to see the court approve the temporary restraining and eventually make it permanent.

""We are hopeful that the Court will temporarily block - and then ultimately, permanently enjoin - Governor Newsom's misguided efforts to devastate hemp farmers, business and product consumers in California,"" Miller said in an October 4 statement from the industry group. ""It's high time that the Governor abandon this punitive effort and sit down with all stakeholders to appropriately address his stated mission: to develop a robust regulatory regime that promotes health and safety and keeps hemp products out of the hands of minors.""

""This is not just about California,"" Miller told online cannabis news source Marijuana Moment. ""California is the largest state in our union. It's the fifth-largest economy in the world. It is where the birth of legal cannabis happened in this country, and so it makes this decision ever more important.""

A hearing on the TRO petition is scheduled for Thursday, according to information from the U.S. Hemp Roundtable."
U.S. Equities Surge In Best Election Year Since 1936,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/07/us-equities-surge-in-best-election-year-since-1936/,2024-10-07T20:24:59Z,"As we approach the final stretch of 2024, much of the nation's focus is on the upcoming U.S. presidential election. But while the political landscape remains uncertain, the markets are painting a different picture. September, traditionally a sluggish month for global equities, delivered an unexpected surge.

The S&P 500 gained 2.02%, marking its strongest September since 2013. This brought its year-to-date return to 22.08%, making 2024 the best presidential election year for stocks in almost 90 years (more on that later).

Bitcoin has been another standout performer. Once viewed with skepticism by traditional investors, the digital currency posted a nearly 8% gain last month, bringing its year-to-date growth to an astonishing 51%. With the Federal Reserve adopting a dovish stance, the U.S. dollar has weakened, prompting investors to seek alternative assets like Bitcoin and gold as hedges against inflation and uncertainty.

Election years often bring volatility as markets grapple with the uncertainty surrounding potential changes in leadership, but 2024 has proven to be an outlier. Central bank easing has provided a powerful tailwind, helping to stabilize markets and lift stocks higher, despite lingering concerns over who will occupy the White House next year.

In fact, 2024 is shaping up to be the best presidential election year for stocks in nearly 90 years. By the end of September, the S&P 500 had risen more than 22%, the highest return during an election year since 1936. Investors have embraced the Fed's commitment to looser monetary policy, which has kept market sentiment buoyant despite the political backdrop.

Beneath the surface of these impressive market gains, however, lies a more complex picture of the U.S. economy. It's a tale of two sectors: while services continue to thrive, manufacturing is struggling.

The U.S. services sector -- which accounts for nearly 80% of the country's GDP -- has now expanded for 20 consecutive months. New orders continue to grow, driven by steady consumer demand and a reduction in interest rates, which has made borrowing more affordable for businesses and households alike, according to S&P Global. Despite some moderation from the 14-month high we saw in August, the sector looks strong, providing a foundation for economic stability.

In contrast, the manufacturing sector is showing signs of strain. The end of the third quarter saw manufacturing dip deeper into contraction territory. Slowing demand, both domestically and internationally, has weighed heavily on the sector, and many analysts are pointing to broader economic challenges as the cause. The uncertain outcome of the upcoming election has only added to the unease, as companies hold off on major investments until they have a clearer sense of the country's political direction.

In addition to domestic economic concerns, several external factors threaten to disrupt the positive momentum we've seen in the markets.

Hurricane Helene, for instance, serves as a reminder of the unpredictable risks posed by Mother Nature. The storm caused what could amount to $34 billion in total economic losses, with insured damages expected to exceed $6 billion.

The recent resolution of the dockworker strike at East Coast and Gulf ports -- a potential ""man-made disaster,"" according to President Joe Biden -- is a welcome development, but its impact will likely linger. The strike, which disrupted one of the busiest shipping periods of the year, created a huge backlog of goods waiting to be processed. Major retailers like Walmart, Ikea and Home Depot, which rely heavily on these ports for imported goods, were among the hardest hit.

As operations resume, shipping giants such as Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have warned that freight costs are likely to rise as a result of the delays. While the strike itself has ended (for now), the fallout could affect supply chains well into the fourth quarter, particularly as retailers ramp up for the holiday season.

Despite these challenges, there's still reason for optimism as we head into the holiday season. Adobe is forecasting a record $240.8 billion in online holiday sales, an 8.4% increase over 2023. Electronics and apparel are expected to be the standout categories, driven by deep discounts as retailers aim to move inventory.

As we move into the final quarter of 2024, there's much to be hopeful about. Central bank easing has provided a strong foundation for market growth, and the holiday season promises to deliver robust consumer spending.

At U.S. Global Investors, we believe in taking a long-term view. While the short-term outlook remains favorable, it's essential to stay diversified and prepared for whatever the future may hold. As always, our focus is on helping investors navigate both the opportunities and challenges ahead."
"Markets Are ""On Fire"" Since September Jobs Report. Will They Continue?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2024/10/07/markets-are-on-fire-since-september-jobs-report-will-they-continue/,2024-10-07T20:24:49Z,"On September 6 the jobs report came in weak at 142,000 new jobs. This report was well below expectations, unemployment rose from 4.1% to 4.2% and markets plummeted on the news. Economists proclaimed the beginning of the end with major stock indices falling 2% to 3%. The Vix index, indicating volatility and market nervousness, rose sharply. The outlook among many was bleak and, irrespective of Fed interest cuts on the horizon, many economic ""experts"" began voicing concerns of a recession. Those comments were overblown. The US economy is nowhere near a recession. At least now.

By contrast, on October 4 a new jobs report came out that was red ""hot"". Jobs increased by 254,000, soundly beating expectations, and major market indices soared by 1% to 2%. Since the September 6 dip, major indices have been soaring. The S&P 500 has increased 6.45%, while others such as the QQQ (+8.76%) and the Russell 1000 Growth (+8.43%) have done much better. Leading the pack has been the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR) which came in at 12.99%. (Note: Past performance is no guarantee or guide to future performance).

This performance has continued the strong year-to-date (YTD) results. The table below shows that, thus far, this has been a banner year. YTD the S&P 500 is +21.86%, with the Russell 1000 Growth (IWF) +24.10% and the Nasdaq QQQ +19.51%. The Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR) is continuing its strong year from 2023 (57.41%) with a current YTD performance in 2024 of 38% (Note: past performance is no guide to future performance).

What should investors take from these results? In retrospect, the strong negative response from the September, 6, 2024 negative jobs report was an overreaction on the downside. The economic situation for the US was not nearly as bleak as market pundits expressed. To be fair, neither is the strong jobs report on September 6, 2024 as good as many deem it to be. Many of the 245,000 jobs created in the month of September are from government, social services and healthcare. More importantly, the US workforce is old. Very, very old. 75m baby boomers will be at or past retirement age by the year 2030. As many as 25 to 30m working baby boomers, 1/3 of whom now work past retirement age, (well up from 20 years ago) will be retiring within the next 5-10 years. Further, online estimates suggest 300,000 jobs are being outsourced overseas each year. My data from a Capital IQ search of top public IT firms, suggests it is much, much higher. The US is losing high wage IT jobs to places based primarily in India and Eastern Europe. We are losing low wage bookkeeping and call center jobs to places based primarily in Philippines and Vietnam. Many low wage jobs in the US are also being picked up by illegal immigrants working for cash dollars.

Are these labor issues major concerns for the US economy in the next 5-10 years? Absolutely. The US labor force currently only produces approximately 1m new jobs per year. Losing 5 million jobs over the next year, under normal circumstances would be devastating, let alone, 20m to 30m jobs. The US labor force is currently creating non productive jobs in government and social services. As a country, we may soon find ourselves with less than 1/2 of our adults in the labor market. This means fewer Americans will need to perform the heavy lifting to support the rest of us.

Fortunately, purely by coincidence, AI may save the day. The productive capabilities of AI means that we as a population will need fewer workers to provide the same level of productivity as before. Smart robots will enter the workplace and provide more efficient delivery mechanisms than humans. In an environment with a growing population this displacement of humans would be a problem. The US has the opposite issue. The productive capabilities of AI and robotics will be a game changer for many industries, particularly in IT, Healthcare, Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary. We will also see innovative nuclear energy solutions to power our data centers. These innovative, disruptive, entrepreneurial solutions have the ability to arrive just as our aging population needs it most.

Will AI and robotics benefit all companies? Absolutely not. Just as companies such as Nvidia, Applovin and Arista Networks (among others) have begun reaping benefits associated with AI, their competitors have suffered. A declining labor force does not necessarily imply a dip in the stock market.

We believe that the next few years will continue to widen the gap between winners and losers. The stakes have never been higher. Brick and mortar, bureaucratic stores such as Walmart, Target and Home Depot and Telecommunication companies such as AT&T continue to lose hundreds of thousands of jobs, other entrepreneurial companies will grow their ventures and reap strong rewards. Major change to our labor force is guaranteed within the next 5-10 years. But all is not lost. Far from it. We simply need visionaries at the top to help us lead the way.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please refer to the below disclosures:"
Dow Suffers Worst Day In A Month As Rising Bond Yields A New Wrench For Investors,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/07/dow-suffers-worst-day-in-a-month-as-rising-bond-yields-a-new-wrench-for-investors/,2024-10-07T20:11:19Z,"Stocks tumbled Monday as the market digested new risks complicating the benefits of the much-awaited interest rate cuts on the equity market.

The recent rise in bond yields comes as a relative surprise compared to expectations for the bond market after the Federal Reserve rolled out a big 50 basis-point rate cut Sept. 18. Treasury yields serve as a rough proxy for fixed income investors' expectations for monetary policy, and, considering the consensus view that the Fed will keep bringing interest rates down, climbing government bond yields do not align with that view. The 10-year Treasury yield is often used as the baseline for loans such as mortgages, meaning some borrowing costs are actually higher now than they were prior to the Fed's cut. Bond yields also shot up Friday after the U.S. reported far stronger September job growth than expected. ""The bond market is becoming less skeptical on the soft landing outcome,"" explained Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson in a Monday note to clients.

Though higher bond yields can evoke bad memories for equity investors -- see the 2022 unraveling as the inflation crisis deepened -- it's not necessarily a bad omen for stocks. The 10-year is down a full percentage point over the last year and about 0.4 percentage points over the last six months. And yields are rising because the U.S. economy looks stronger than anticipated, a potential boon for earnings growth, with Wilson noting the increased odds of a soft landing ""should support more cyclical leadership in equities."" Over the weekend, Goldman Sachs strategists led by David Kostin raised their year-end price target for the S&P from 5,600 to 6,000 and its 12-month target from 6,000 to 6,300, indicating 5% and 10% further upside, respectively, citing the ""steady macro outlook.""

""Our job's to be worried about everything,"" Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and an alternate member of the Fed's rate-setting committee, told Forbes last week when asked about how new shocks like higher oil prices may impact the trajectory of monetary policy."
Trump's Tariffs Can't Pay For His Many Promises,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2024/10/07/trumps-tariffs-cant-pay-for-his-many-promises/,2024-10-07T19:54:13Z,"GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump's tariffs would raise a lot of money -- $2.8 trillion over 10 years, according to the Tax Policy Center. But even that would fall far short of paying for all the ambitious ideas he claims it would fund. Indeed, his campaign promises likely would add trillions of dollars to the federal debt.

At various times in the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump has said his tariff revenues would replace the income tax, finance an unspecified child care initiative, create a US sovereign wealth fund, eliminate the federal budget deficit, and even begin to pay down the $28 trillion public debt.

Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has her own list of costly promises that appear to be only partially offset by proposed tax hikes. But Trump's tariff revenue would fall far short of paying for all his promises, though it is impossible to know since they mostly are unspecified.

And Trump would inevitably be caught in the same fiscal trap that so many other policymakers have faced: Once you use revenues to pay for new programs or tax cuts, those funds are no longer available to reduce deficits. More often than not, the result is even higher deficits and debt.

Indeed, The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that Trump's campaign proposals would increase the federal debt by $7.5 trillion over the next decade.

How Much Would Tariffs Raise?

While the former president has pitched many different tariff plans over the course of the campaign, TPC analyzed one version he promotes often, a 10 percent tax on all goods imported into the US and a 60 percent levy on Chinese imports. It would raise about $3.7 trillion in gross tariff revenues over the next decade.

But the tariffs would increase net federal revenues by much less -- about $2.8 trillion. That's because they'd significantly raise prices of imported goods, which would mostly be passed on to consumers. The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates to offset those price increases. But that likely would reduce profits of US corporations and incomes of US workers, lower projected corporate and individual tax revenues, and offset nearly $1 trillion of increased tariff revenue.

How would Trump spend the added revenue?

Could tariffs replace the income tax? Not even close. They'd replace only about 8 percent of the $34 trillion in federal individual income tax revenue the Congressional Budget Office expects the Treasury to collect over the next decade. They'd even fall short of paying the $4 trillion cost of extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Could they fund other tax cuts?. Trump has promised many other tax cuts, including exemptions for tip income, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits, repealing the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent for some companies and 15 percent for others. All of those ideas would cost at least an additional $4 trillion, $1.2 trillion more than the income his tariffs would generate.

Could tariffs pay down the national debt? The public debt currently is about $28 trillion and CBO expects it to rise to $50 trillion by 2034. CBO projects the 2025 deficit will approach $2 trillion. By themselves, Trump's tariffs would lower this year's deficit by about $200 billion, or roughly 10 percent. They'd barely make a dent in the projected debt.

How about financing a sovereign wealth fund? Trump has provided no details on his idea to create a US government investment fund, but has promised it would be the biggest in the world. Currently, that honor belongs to Saudi Arabia, with a fund it values at about $925 billion. Trump could create a comparable US investment fund with about one-third of his tariff revenue. But that would leave less than $2 trillion for all his other initiatives.

Could tariffs fund child care? Trump has not specified what child-related programs he supports. But his running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) has endorsed a $5,000 Child Tax Credit (CTC) for all parents, regardless of income, which could pay for services such as child care. While Trump has not publicly commented on the plan, it is at least a hint of what his administration could do.

A Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calculator estimates a Vance-like credit would cost roughly $2.7 trillion over a decade, almost exactly what Trump's tariffs would raise. But that would leave almost nothing for his other initiatives.

Of course, Trump could try to raise more money with even higher tariff rates. But at some point, tariff-driven price increases will shrink demand for imports so much that tariff revenues would no longer offset the decline in corporate and individual income taxes caused by a slowing US economy.

Trump's use of tariff revenue to finance his many ambitious promises feels a bit like the stage magician who appears to be pulling countless rabbits out of a top hat. He's not the first politician to try that trick. But never forget, it is all an illusion."
"A Blockbuster Jobs Report Shifts The Narrative Amid Labor Disputes, Hurricane Destruction And A Close Election",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenamcgregor/2024/10/07/a-blockbuster-jobs-report-shifts-the-narrative-amid-labor-disputes-and-a-close-election/,2024-10-07T19:45:21Z,"This week's Future of Work Summit examines the fallout from Amazon'a RTO push, the challenges of leading through disaster and a conversation about AI and work with Handshake's Valerie Capers Workman.

This is the published version of Forbes' Future of Work newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief human resources officers and other talent managers on disruptive technologies, managing the workforce and trends in the remote work debate. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Monday!

ctober is here, and the sprint to the end of the year is fraught with distractions, disasters and disengagement that will be challenging for anyone managing workplaces and teams. A tight, polarizing election has workers unsettled and anxious -- and could drive more conflict in the office. An escalating crisis in the Middle East brings increasing tensions over geopolitical issues, uncertainty about planning ahead and more concerns for employees with family in the region.

Add the devastation of a massive hurricane across the Southeast, and it's been an unparalleled season of disruption for many leaders and workplaces. Hurricane Helene has disrupted operations at a quartz mine in western North Carolina, washing out roads and cutting power to an area critical to semiconductor manufacturing. Some employers across the region are working hard to help workers struggling without power, water or even homes -- while others in Tennessee face inquiries from the state Bureau of Investigation over allegations that they ignored warnings about Helene and required employees to report to work, leading to deaths and missing workers. Asheville, which had prospered with an influx of remote workers, entrepreneurs and new business owners, now faces an unprecedented challenge to rebuild.

Amid all the chaos is the human cost -- and a humanitarian crisis. Disaster relief is inherently hard to execute well, and the people leading it will need support. If you want to help, my colleague Kelly Phillips Erb has a rundown over what you need to know about tax deductible donations and where to donate. Read on for more in today's newsletter about how Amazon's RTO push remains in the headlines, Friday's blockbuster jobs report and an interview with Handshake's chief talent engagement officer about AI and jobs.

September job growth shattered economists' predictions, as U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs last month, according to nonfarm payrolls data released Friday by the Labor Department. It was the biggest month for jobs growth since March, sprinting past average economist estimates of 150,000 and prompting the unemployment rate to dip to 4.1%, compared to projections of 4.2%, where it stood in August. Investors cheered the news with big stock gains Friday.

Striking dockworkers and port employers reached a tentative agreement Thursday, ending a strike that began earlier in the week and lifting concerns over the potential impact to the U.S. economy. The tentative agreement includes a 62% wage increase over six years, according to the Wall Street Journal, and will temporarily relieve Democrats fearful of the strike's impact on the November election. The big issue still up for negotiation? Automation, as workers remain concerned about the potential for layoffs and fewer jobs for humans in the future.

The fallout over Amazon's decision to require full-time office work has remained in the headlines even several weeks after the tech giant made the announcement. Dell has since mandated that salespeople come back to the office five days a week, while McKinsey is also reportedly asking staff to be onsite more often. Will the trend continue? Contributor Ann Kowal Smith sees Amazon's move as the ""canary in the coal mine for a dangerous problem,"" noting ""the relationship between employers and employees has become one based on power, not mutual respect and collaboration."" Meanwhile, contributor Ryan Anderson suggests the continued disappointment leaders feel in one-size-fits-all hybrid policies could mean a different approach would be better for workplace flexibility.

The most sweeping attempt so far to regulate artificial intelligence, a California bill that could have set a precedent for other laws, was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom last week. ""I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public,"" Newsom said, according to the New York Times. If the California bill had been signed into law, writes Forbes contributor Owen Tedford, it would have predominantly focused on improving AI safety, with businesses that create large AI models required to perform safety tests and publicly disclose how they'd prevent the models from being manipulated. Tedford examines what could come next, suggesting the bill could be changed and reintroduced in future sessions.

Forbes caught up with Valerie Capers Workman, chief talent engagement officer at student careers platform Handshake, about how AI is shifting jobs as we know them, a recent book she published and addressing the gender divide in AI. Excerpts from our conversation have been edited for length and clarity.

How is AI changing jobs?

I'm going to use my son as an example. He entered school in 2018-2019, he was going to be a data scientist. Data science was the career: You're going to get a job the second you hit junior year, you're going to be flooded with internships and you're going to be employed. Enter A.I. The ability of A.I. to take on so much of the preliminary data science work [means] you need to be a masters or PhD in data science to skip over what A.I. can do. [He realized] 'I need to go back to school.' He is now applying to universities for artificial intelligence master's degrees. He loves having the skill set, but A.I. enables more companies to do what he was doing.

What message did you want to share in your book?

The most important concept that I was raising is that the requirement to be superhuman; the requirements of EQ are more important in the age of AI than all the pundits are saying. My point is, yes, you can get an entry level job, but you're not moving up without the EQ, without the combination of AI plus liberal arts skills, the critical thinking skills, you're going to stay right there. The ability to move and progress in your career? You're going to have to do both.

[""AI skills""] are the ability to ask great questions and understand whether or not you've got a great answer and then utilize that answer to do the work you're doing. The ability to ask great questions? That requires critical thinking skills, language skills, reading comprehension skills, historical context, ethical understanding and understanding of biases. Generative AI is what is going to differentiate the general workforce from the executive workforce track, if you will. I think it was a COO from BlackRock who said [they want] to hire finance or tech employees who have liberal arts or history majors? That's what I'm talking about.

If you're hiring, how do you assess that AI skill?

If I'm interviewing someone on my team, I'd ask them: 'I have this issue. Give me an AI prompt that will help me. Give me a prompt that you would use to help me finish this project for me in five days.'

Are you pulling on the right threads to understand what types of questions you need to ask? If I find someone who knows how to frame a question, I can train you how to do that better. I can't train you how to think.

Do companies have a responsibility to retrain their people who work in fields where jobs will be replaced, such as customer service?

That's a great societal question.

What is the responsibility of the employer to reskill its current workforce if a set of roles can now be done by AI? I like to put it this way: The companies that understand how to repurpose their workforce for the higher order skills that need to be done by humans -- that can't be done by A.I. -- are the companies that are going to win.

We're hearing more about how women are not developing the AI skills at the same pace and could get left behind. What can be done to help with this?

In higher education, they need to have required courses, period. Just required. It cannot be optional because women are not taking the AI courses at the same rate as their male counterparts. It can't be optional. ... The societal issues that caused them to run away from a phrase like prompt engineering go all the way back to when they were in third grade. So, required courses.

Same thing with employers. Training should not be optional. ... You're going to leave people behind who don't think that certain courses apply to them. AI courses apply to everyone. They should be mandatory. You can solve a lot of societal anomalies and inequities just by making the playing field even for everyone without having people required to opt in.

Last week's jobs report was a big one, prompting a stock market rally and causing the odds of another interest rate cut in the coming months to fall.

176,000: How many more jobs than expected the U.S. nonfarm labor force grew by from July to September, according to the Labor Department. September's 254,000 nonfarm payroll additions, the highest total in six months, were 104,000 more than economist forecasts, while the government upwardly revised July and August's payroll growth by 55,000 and 17,000, respectively.

83.8%: Prime-age labor force participation, or people working or looking for work, is near multi-decade highs

""The labor market isn't on the brink of collapse and still has the potential to deliver surprises, however its ability to sustain momentum without further support from the Federal Reserve is not guaranteed."" -- Cory Stahle, economist for Indeed Hiring Lab, in a statement

Cheaper Chevrolet Silverado EVs With More Range For 2025,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2024/10/07/cheaper-chevrolet-silverado-evs-with-more-range-for-2025/,2024-10-07T19:45:12Z,"The third quarter of 2024 was a landmark for General Motors EV sales. After nearly 3 years of struggling to actually build and deliver its new Ultium platform based electric vehicles, the automaker had its best quarter yet. Among the models that are slowly starting to gain some traction in the marketplace is the Chevrolet Silverado EV. For model year 2025, Chevrolet is finally expanding the availability of new trim levels for the electric pickup and building more affordable variants with more range.

Chevrolet started low volume deliveries of the 4WT work truck variant of the Silverado about a year ago and finally launched the first consumer model, the RST in late spring of this year. Unfortunately, those work trucks were only being delivered to fleets and the RST had a price tag of over $96,000. For that price though, it did offer the longest range of any electric truck on the market with 440 miles for the RST and 450 miles for the 4WT.

For 2025, availability is improving and the new LT trim level is finally available with an even lower priced version of the work truck due sometime during the model year starting at $57,095. Range is also improved across the board by as much as 9%. According to Chevrolet spokesman Sean Szymkowski, GM engineers have ""optimized everything."" This includes ""improved motors, magnets, and inverters all contribute to better coast down and overall efficiency gains that improve range.""

The longest range Silverado, the Work Truck with the Max Range battery now goes 492-miles on a charge and the rest of the lineup does great as well:

Annoyingly, GM doesn't like to talk about the actual capacity of its EV batteries. For the Silverado, they are simply referred to as standard, extended and max range. However, it appears that nothing has changed in the battery, so based on the EPA fuel economy data file, the max range pack with 24 modules should have about 209-kWh of usable energy. The max range pack is available in the work truck and RST.

The LT is only available with the extended range pack which is believed to have a 20-module configuration and should have a capacity of around 168-kWh. The work trucks with both of these batteries have longer range estimates, because these trucks have less equipment and weigh several hundred pounds less than the LT or RST.

The standard range work truck won't be available until later in the model year, and doesn't have a range estimate yet. At $57,095 including delivery, the standard range work truck matches the price point of the standard Ford F-150 Lightning Pro which only has a range of 240 miles. If Chevrolet steps down the capacity by another 4 modules to 16 (removing 2 more modules from each of the two layers of the battery, the capacity is likely to be approximately 138-kWh which is still more than 131-kWh in the Lightning's extended battery.

That will probably yield a range of over 300 miles and with the reduced weight of the battery it could hit 340-350. That would be more than even the longest range Lighting, making this lowest cost Silverado a significantly better value. If it hits that 300 mile range, that standard work truck will also be more than $20,000 than the least expensive dual motor Cybertruck that might offer similar performance.

The price of the max range RST does go up by about $1,400 for 2025 but the LT starting at $75,1195 will probably be the sweet spot for most retail customers since it comes in under the $80,000 cap for federal tax credits. These electric trucks certainly still aren't exactly affordable, but when factoring in those credits, the prices start to get a lot closer to the gas trucks while still having enough range that even when towing a big trailer you'll probably hit close to 200 miles between charges. The consumer oriented LT also undercuts the dual motor Cybertruck by about $5,000

Ford certainly has its work cut out for it now that it has delayed its next generation electric truck until 2027. Ram is due to launch its electric truck by the end of the year which should offer similar range to the Chevrolet, but with an as yet unknown price point."
California Law On GenAI Continues To Advance,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2024/10/07/california-law-on-genai-continues-to-advance/,2024-10-07T19:32:28Z,"When it comes to state-by-state efforts to regulate artificial intelligence and related new technologies, there's probably no state more advanced than the state of California.

That's not surprising, given that California is the only U.S. state thus far to enact its own version of the European General Data Protection Rule that gives a broad spectrum of data rights to individual users of software and systems. The California Consumer Privacy Act or CCPA is often cited along with the GDPR in the myriad of instances when people are talking about shielding personal data from abuse.

But California has been pioneering, too, in the way that it addresses rules for AI/ML systems beyond just the use of personal data.

Some of the recent bills that have been passed (or failed to pass) the state house illustrate what California is doing to try to be proactive as the host of Silicon Valley, and the largest state economy in the country.

The Kerfuffle Over SB 1047

Most recently, Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill called SB 1047 that was made to enact guardrails for AI systems that makers would have to put in place.

Ultimately, Newsom suggested that SB 1047 is ""not the best approach to protecting the public from real threats posed by the technology.""

Digging deeper, you can see that prior to Newsom's veto decision, the bill was becoming incredibly controversial, as in a letter sent by California state senator Scott Weiner to people at Y Combinator and Andreessen Horowitz.

In the missive, Weiner contends that these parties had made ""inflammatory"" statements containing ""misinformation."" The senator writes:

""While I always appreciate engagement and constructive feedback on any bill I author, I also ask that those engaging be accurate in their characterization of those bills. Unfortunately, various statements by YC and a16z about SB 1047 are inaccurate, including some highly inflammatory distortions, e.g., that SB 1047 will send model developers to prison for failing to anticipate harms from their AI systems (false), that SB 1047 will effectively ban open source releases (false), and that SB 1047 will cause technology companies and startups to relocate to other states because only developers located in California will be covered (false).""

Later, Weiner called YC's statements on the bill ""irresponsible,"" suggesting that the firm asserted that ""creating a penalty of perjury would mean that AI software developers could go to jail simply for failing to anticipate misuse of their software."" This, he wrote, is ""absolutely untrue"" and ""a scare tactic"" that would have a chilling effect on the industry.

Read the rest of the letter for all of Weiner's arguments on claims by detractors of the bill.

With that kind of discussion in play, it's perhaps not surprising that SB 1047 failed to pass. However, Other California legislation has been put in place, and it will have an effect in policing the use of AI in business.

Data Set Formats For Artificial Intelligence Projects: AB 1013

This legislation, which goes into effect on the first day of 2026. requires systems or software makers to deliver a summary of Information on the data sets that were used for GenAI systems. These include the sources or owners of the data sets, information on purchase or licensing, transparency on processing or modification to data sets, and whether any of the information falls under the CCPA.

Promoting accurate descriptions of systems in this way could be fairly useful in making sure that the use of AI and systems is transparent.

""California's new AI law underscores the importance of AI developers maintaining a data provenance record that traces the lineage of data used to train AI systems and taking steps to be transparent about how they develop AI, including through trust centers on websites,"" writes Arsen Kourinian at Mayer Brown in Los Angeles regarding the legislation. ""Developers should consider adopting technology that automates this process in order to operate at scale. Moreover, companies that integrate their AI offerings with a foundation model should consider the impact of this new law because it could apply to developers that fine-tune or retrain AI systems or services.""

AI in Healthcare: Disclosure to Citizens

This next California law is industry-specific to healthcare. However, it represents that effort to let people know when AI is being used in decisions that affect their lives.

In the Assembly Bill 3030, on artificial intelligence and healthcare services, the creators of the law point out that the Medical Practice Act already establishes regulation of information for medical processes. Further:

""This bill would require a health facility, clinic, physicians, office, or office of a group practice that uses generative artificial intelligence to generate written or verbal, patient communications pertaining to generative patient clinical information as defined to ensure that this communications include both a disclaimer that indicates to the patient that communication was generated by generative, artificial intelligence as specified and two clear instructions describing how patient may contact the human healthcare provider...""

Essentially, these types of rules give people the tools to respond when they are subject to the influence of AI in processes involving their own healthcare.

All of California's trail-blazing notwithstanding, critics just ask whether companies can just go out of state, and house their operations elsewhere, to avoid having to comply with these directives.

Still, this kind of work is crucial to showing how regulation of AI systems may work in the years to come.

So anyone with an interest in this kind of thing should keep an eye out as California continues to move forward."
Immigration In America: Stats And Facts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/legal/immigration-law/immigration-stats-and-facts/,2024-10-07T17:01:23Z,"The American dream has long attracted people from throughout the world to the land of prosperity. Let's take a look at who is migrating to America, when they've come and where they're going.

Immigration is part of the history of America. In fact, in 1890, immigrants made up 14.8% of the U.S. population. This remains the year with the largest share of immigrants in recorded history.

U.S. immigration laws have tightened considerably since the 1890s when there was virtually no check on migration. However, America remains a top destination for foreign-born individuals. Today, immigrants make up an increasing share of the population. In fact, in 1970, immigrants accounted for 4.7% of the population but now account for 15.6%.

Mexico is one of the closest neighbors to the U.S., so it likely comes as no surprise that a large percentage of migrants come from Mexico. Still, their share of the overall population has decreased. In 2010, the Mexican share of the immigrant population was 29%, but that number was down to 23% by 2022.

India, China, the Philippines and El Salvador also saw many residents traveling to the United States. These countries represent the next largest origin groups after Mexico, accounting for 6%, 5%, 4%, and 3% of immigrants respectively.

Prior to 2007, more Hispanics than Asians immigrated to the United States each year. However, between 2009 and 2018, Asians began arriving in larger numbers. Based on region of birth, Asians made up 28% of all immigrants in 2022.

Like many immigrants, Asians come to the U.S. in search of opportunity. They often find it. Pew Research revealed that Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial group in the United States. They are also the highest-earning and best-educated racial group in the country.

In 2022, immigrants accounted for 13.8% of the population, although this number has since grown. In total, there were 46,118,600 immigrant residents living in the United States in 2022.

That's a substantial number. These immigrants have an estimated $1.6 trillion in spending power and paid $579.1 billion in taxes during the 2022 tax year, so they play a major role in the country's economy.

For many immigrants, birthing and raising children in the United States is part of their American dream. In fact, 7.9% of U.S. residents have at least one immigrant parent. That's an estimated 17.6 million children who have at least one parent born outside of the United States.

While immigration has become a hot-button political issue in recent years, most immigrants have lived in the United States for a very long time. In fact, 26% entered the country prior to 1990 and 46% have lived in the U.S. since 2000 or before.

The vast majority of immigrants have established lives in the country, and many have taken steps toward making it their permanent home.

Although immigration is not a new phenomenon, there has been a significant uptick in migration to the United States in recent years. In total, the foreign-born population increased by 5.1 million in the two years following March 2022. This is the largest two-year increase in American history.

The influx of new immigrants has increased the foreign-born population to 51.6 million, and immigrants now account for 15.6% of the total U.S. population.

Immigrants are not distributed evenly across the United States. California has the largest number of foreign-born individuals, with other top states including:

Some of these states share common traits. Texas and California are border states, so immigrants arrive and settle there. Others, such as New York, are known for being especially welcoming to migrants, including both legal and undocumented individuals arriving in the United States.

Naturalization is the process of becoming a lawful permanent resident. One of the many jobs of immigration lawyers is to assist people with the process of becoming a naturalized citizen.

Many immigrants are well-established in their lives before naturalizing in the United States. The median age of individuals who naturalized in the United States in 2023 was 41, while more than 39% of citizens who were naturalized that year were 30 to 44 years old."
Five Things Small Business Owners Can Do To Prepare For The Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyshoenthal/2024/10/07/five-things-small-business-owners-can-do-to-prepare-for-the-election/,2024-10-07T16:49:24Z,"As the U.S. braces for the upcoming presidential election, small business owners harbor a unique set of concerns around how the outcome might impact their day to day operations. From legislation that could affect taxes, healthcare costs and regulation, the political climate will have a domino effect on consumer behavior, financial markets and more.

Regardless of who wins, it's critical for small business owners to stay informed on new policies and regulatory shifts, as new legislation could reshape things like employee benefits and compliance requirements. With one month to go, many small business owners are curious about proactive steps they can take to prepare for the looming uncertainty. Experts suggest five key principles to prepare for the election's outcome:

1. Monitor policy changes.

It's widely known that election years can bring market volatility. That's why it's critical for small business owners to stay informed about proposed changes in regulations, taxes, healthcare and labor laws that could directly impact their operations. Understanding candidates' platforms will help anticipate shifts and plan for potential changes accordingly.

Jen Stark, who serves as a strategic advisor to Don't Ban Equality, advises small business owners to pay attention to local laws that might impact employee health benefit concerns, especially around reproductive care.

""Small businesses in states that have passed abortion bans and restrictions are left with the burden of shouldering the costs and chaos facing workers and communities,"" she says. ""Those workers have to travel out of state, resulting in more time off and greater healthcare costs out of pocket even if their employer has a benefits program to support them.""

Shifts in economic regulations are another area small business owners should pay close attention to.

""Political uncertainty in the months leading up to the presidential election can affect confidence and decision-making for consumers, which leads to impact on small business owners and can cause a decrease in consumer spending,"" says Cate Luzio, former banker and founder of Luminary, a professional education and networking platform. ""The election results themselves can eventually cause a change in business regulations that small business owners need to be aware of, along with the impact that might have on their business, their growth, their customers and more.""

2. Focus on consumer and employee engagement.

Consumer spending patterns may shift during an election year due to uncertainty. Many people tend to cut back on discretionary spending when they feel uneasy about the economy.

Consider changes you can make to your business to prepare for this sentiment shift. Do you offer essential products or services that are less impacted by economic swings? Are there ways to re-engage your most loyal consumers right now? Focus on those if possible.

At the same time, this is a prime opportunity to foster civic engagement among employees.

""As this election season kicks into high gear, entrepreneurs and business leaders have an opportunity to use their trusted voice to protect American democracy,"" says Katie Vlietstra Wonnenberg, principal of Public Private Strategies. ""Consumers want businesses to be active in protecting America's democracy and they support actions to ensure it.""

Wonnenberg cited research from the Business & Democracy Initiative, which revealed that 75% of consumers support businesses who promote employee civic education and agree that employees should have time off for political engagement.

""Taking these steps during election season can help with employee retention and can build trust and loyalty with consumers,"" she points out.

3. Scenario plan.

Given the potential for significant regulatory changes, business owners should consider the changes that might occur under different administrations. Think through any adjustments you might need to make within operations or budgets when considering factors like minimum wage hikes, healthcare mandates, trade policies and more.

""Company leadership should always be preparing for uncontrollable changes by discussing different scenarios with their teams so they are prepared,"" says Chantell Preston, a healthcare development consultant who advises small businesses on reducing risk.

Preston suggests playing out different scenarios so your company and employees are prepared for any outcome. ""Enlist feedback and engage with your stakeholders so they know you are preparing,"" she says. ""Communicate and be transparent with your employees to build trust and reduce uncertainty.""

4. Remind your employees that they have a say.

Presidential elections can influence labor laws and healthcare regulations, which impact employee pay and HR policies. Business owners should keep a close eye on any proposed changes to healthcare, minimum wage, or employee benefits that could impact overhead costs, communicating openly with employees to prepare for any potential changes that might occur following the election.

Kimber Lanning, CEO of Local First Arizona, suggests starting this conversation prior to the election by reminding employees that they actually do have a say in shaping the outcome.

""A great way to get involved in an election while staying out of divisive politics is to stick to a message of getting out the vote,"" she says. ""Consider giving your employees time off to go to the polls on Election Day. Encourage your customers to vote by placing signs in your establishment or stickers at the cash register. Sponsor or organize a voter registration event. Using your voice as a business owner to support democracy is a noble thing to do.""

5. Be prepared to dip into cash reserves.

Election years can bring about economic uncertainty, which leads to market volatility. Small businesses should consider building up cash reserves to cushion against any potential downturns.

Experts recommend postponing major investments until after the election, reviewing current tax strategies and being prepared to dip into cash reserves in case of significant disruption.

Preston recommends having at least 18 months of capital available. She also suggests researching regulatory perspectives from all parties and evaluating supply chains in case of issues.

Lanning suggests treating an election cycle like any other slow season. She points out that, ""In Phoenix, our summers are hot, so businesses know to plan for decreased revenue as customers go away on vacation. In the months running up to a major election, business owners should do the same thing.""

""No matter what industry you're in, sales activity slumps as Americans hold their money tighter, wondering how the election will turn out and what policies a new president will implement that may affect their pocket book,"" says Lanning. ""You may need to pause hiring, dip into savings or wait to make a big purchase to keep your business healthy.""

Luzio acknowledges the financial anxiety that comes with the election can lead to impulsive, shortsighted decisions.

""Get your 2025 financial projections in order with scenarios around growth, flat and down performance,"" she suggests. ""At a macro level, key issues may have an impact on your numbers: taxes, regulation, trade and consumer spending/customer acquisition. It is important for business owners to be informed about issues and make sure they're aware regardless of which way the election goes. Doing an updated SWOT analysis for your business can help, especially as it relates to how to mitigate or protect your business against threats.""

Finally, Luzio recommends talking to your trusted experts such as insurance professionals, financial advisors, cybersecurity experts, attorneys and banking partners to help mitigate risk.

""Discuss potential business impacts with these experts to help you feel informed about decision making around the business,"" says Luzio.

""The election is out of your control,"" she says. ""So don't panic, please vote, and focus on awareness to support your business through this time."""
"""Whatever It Takes"" Is On The Table",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brendanahern/2024/10/07/whatever-it-takes-is-on-the-table/,2024-10-07T16:49:11Z,"Asian equities were higher, despite a stronger US dollar due to rising US Treasury yields, except for India.

Over the weekend, a Mainland brokerage noted the government fiscal stimulus will be ""a gradual strategy"" versus ""an immediate large-scale expansion"" as they expect ""the initial expansion scale will be about 2 trillion yuan of additional bonds, which will be used to support the trade-in of consumer goods, strengthen social security benefits, and help local governments repay their debts.""

Based on economic data and government policy meetings at month-end, December's Chinese Economic Working Conference, and next year's Two Sessions, there are multiple opportunities for the government to press the gas pedal, as necessary. Skepticism about the Chinese government's ability to improve the economy was cited in a Bloomberg News article on the topic. CLSA and Goldman Sachs equity strategists are the only two firms that have upgraded their China model weights thus far. Moving the sentiment supertanker will take time, which means more buyers will likely be forced to come back into the space in the coming months, quarters, and years.

Train data indicates a strong National Holiday, with 17 million passengers taking trips on each of the last six days. Meanwhile, Macau hotel occupancy rates were 95% during the holiday.

Hong Kong was led higher by growth stocks and sectors, though it was another broad rally, led by Hong Kong's most heavily traded stocks by value, which were Tencent, which gained +0.17%, Alibaba, which gained +0.61%, Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), which gained +21.76%, Meituan, which fell -0.09%, and Hong Kong Exchanges, which gained +4.68%. Tomorrow's China reopening should be fun to watch! Shanghai and Shenzhen stocks have a limit-up of 10%, which means trading will be halted once the market is up by that amount, while the STAR Board has a limit-up of 20%.

The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes gained +1.60% and +3.05%, respectively, on volume that increased +13.5% from Friday, which is 266% of the 1-year average. 448 stocks advanced, while 60 stocks declined. Main Board short turnover increased 40% from Friday, which is 248% of the 1-year average, as 16% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers' ETF hedging). The growth factor and small caps outperformed the value factor and large caps. All sectors were positive, except for Real Estate, which fell -0.02%. The market was led higher by Information Technology, which gained +5.46%, Industrials, which gained +4.84%, and Utilities, which gained +4.45%. All subsectors were positive, except for media, led higher by semiconductors, diversified finance, and capital goods. Southbound Stock Connect will reopen tonight.

Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board are closed until tomorrow.

How Atlassian Drives Growth: Listening To Customers And Its Employees,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/10/07/how-atlassian-drives-growth-listening-to-customers-and-its-employees/,2024-10-07T16:27:56Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CEO newsletter, which offers the latest news for today's and tomorrow's business leaders and decision makers.

It's a very good time for unions right now. Last week, organized labor likely notched another victory, as 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association returned to work, reopening 36 East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports after a three-day strike.

Union members started striking at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, after their contract with ocean carriers and port operators represented by the U.S. Maritime Alliance (USMX) expired. The strike essentially shut down all cargo ports on the eastern side of the U.S., potentially roiling the economy and supply chains for everything from groceries to automobiles. Union members wanted a 77% wage increase over six years, as well as an agreement to ban automation in places where it could be used to replace workers. To end the strike for now, USMX offered a 62% wage increase over six years and extended the current union contract until January 15, 2025, to allow for further negotiation.

The contract extension means that the nation's ports will remain open for Q4 -- which includes the presidential election and the all-important holiday shopping season. But the new contract isn't even fully negotiated yet, so it's hard to say whether port workers will ultimately support it. Port automation hasn't been resolved, and as Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly notes, it's a huge issue for the union. The cranes used to remove containers from cargo ships and move them to wherever they need to go next can be automated, meaning fewer people are needed to do the work. Union members are essentially negotiating for their job security -- at least for now.

But cargo ships are getting bigger, global trade is increasing, and there is more demand for imports and exports. Proponents of automation say that it could make ports more efficient, which could help them handle higher volumes. Some ports in Europe and China, as well as a couple on the West Coast, are already automated. The California ports that use automation increased their employment numbers and wage hours after the machinery went in.

These numbers -- and what truly makes a port efficient -- will likely to be discussed at length as the union and USMX return to the bargaining table. It's unknown if the port workers will be willing to compromise on this point. Jim Kruse from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute told Marketplace he has seen forecasts of seaport trade volume doubling by 2050, meaning ports really should be striving toward more efficiency. But if there are no port workers, all of the automation in the world won't be helpful.

Thousands of companies worldwide use Atlassian's collaboration tools -- including Jira, Confluence, Trello and Loom -- to work together and manage projects. I talked to Atlassian President Anu Bharadwaj about how the company uses its culture and experience to best serve enterprise technology needs. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Last month, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs, a huge increase over economists' estimates of 150,000, according to government data released on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, an improvement of a tenth of a point over August. This level of job growth didn't just happen in September. The government revised its summertime job growth figures, adding 55,000 more jobs to July's total -- reaching 144,000 jobs -- and 17,000 more jobs to August, for a total of 159,000.

With the upbeat job data, the stock market turned upwards, too. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both rose close to a percentage point on Friday, while the Nasdaq was up 1.2%. ""The economy continues to show incredible resilience,"" Bolvin Wealth Management Group President Gina Bolvin said in comments emailed to Forbes.

While the jobs data and stock bounces are all good for the economy, economists say they're negatively impacting the chances for another big interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets early next month. According to CME FedWatch, 88.5% of economists now believe interest rates will be cut by a quarter percent, with the remaining 11.5% not expecting a rate cut at all. Forbes' Derek Saul talked with Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, an alternate member of the Open Market Committee, about what he'll be paying attention to as the Fed closes out the year. The unemployment rate going forward is important, he said. ""After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?""

Spirit Airlines stock dropped more than 30% on Friday after reports that the budget carrier may be exploring bankruptcy following a failed merger with JetBlue Airways. It was the deepest plunge of the airline's stock since January, when the Justice Department blocked the proposed $3.8 billion acquisition on antitrust grounds, sending prices down more than 50%. Spirit has been working toward improving its financial position this year, executing a restructuring plan that involves changing routes, deferring new aircraft deliveries, cutting 32 routes, and adding new premium tiers for passenger service and experience. Spirit Airlines CEO Ted Christie has said in the last two earnings reports that the company was discussing options with its bondholders for bills due soon. In the last earnings report, CFO Fred Cromer said updates would be provided ""when appropriate."" According to the Wall Street Journal, people familiar with the matter said any bankruptcy filing is not imminent, and recent talks have focused on reaching an agreement to support a Chapter 11 filing.

In today's business world, studies found most women are not at the levels where decisions are being made. Just 9% of CEOs at the largest U.S. companies are women, but there are few women in the other C-suite roles that can be seen as stepping stones to the top spot, according to a new analysis by executive search firm Russell Reynolds. Looking at the top 100 companies on the S&P, there are 74% fewer female executives on leadership teams than there are in the current U.S. population. Looking at the position-by-position breakdown, 46% of CMOs are women, the closest to the half of the population women represent. There are the most female CHROs -- 72% -- and the fewest CEOs and COOs -- 8%. Forbes senior contributor Kim Elsesser writes other recent studies show that the professional bias against women starts early. A recent study by McKinsey and LeanIn found that women represent 59% of all bachelor's degree recipients, but only represent 48% of entry-level corporate roles. For every 100 men promoted to manager, only 81 women get the same career advancement. Another study that interviewed 57 women CEOs found that two-thirds of them weren't aware the CEO role was in their grasp until someone else suggested it.

Thousands of companies across the globe use Atlassian's collaboration tools -- which include Jira, Confluence, Trello and Loom -- to work together and manage projects. I talked to President Anu Bharadwaj about how Atlassian serves companies' tech and AI needs, the culture at the 22-year-old company -- which is still founder-led, and its growth prospects.

This interview has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here.

How do you figure out which problems Atlassian should be solving next with AI, and how do you go forward doing it?

Bharadwaj: We are a company of product builders. Our philosophy is: Create the things that you want to use yourself. A lot of our product heritage has been we build products for ourselves and then figure out [if] this is interesting for other people, and how can we make it more generalized and applicable in different industries and contexts?

Or we go off and acquire a product. Loom is a great example of a company we acquired last year that we used heavily inside Atlassian. We are a 12,000-person company distributed across 13 countries. [At] the beginning of the pandemic, we made the decision to go fully distributed. We said to employees, we will not ask you to come into an office for any number of days a week, but we will set some guidelines around how many working hours overlap you have with your team. When we compose a team of people on the West Coast and East Coast, that's okay. But if you take people on the East Coast, West Coast, Australia and Singapore, it becomes a problem because there are not enough working hours overlap. A lot of the tools that we use are really our own tools for collaboration and for teamwork. And one of the tools we heavily relied on was Loom, which really helped, creating video snippets that would help disseminate information so that people can then consume it at their own pace. We decided to buy the tool ourselves and integrate it with our product suite because it really helped with asynchronous communication and distributed teamwork.

Scott Farquhar, one of the founders of Atlassian, recently stepped down from the co-CEO spot. While this may not signify a huge transition for the company, since cofounder Mike Cannon-Brookes is assuming the sole CEO role, what does it mean symbolically for Atlassian?

I have been at Atlassian for 10 years, and the big reason for me staying this long has been Scott. Scott's a personal friend and has been a great supporter and champion. Personally, I feel bittersweet about it. I feel very happy for him that he is now going on to the next phase of life. He has the energy and the bandwidth to focus on some of the things that he has started, like Pledge1%. He has a number of well-defined philosophical philanthropy projects that he's rallied the company around.

Operationally day-to-day, it's not that much of a change for us because he's been very thoughtful about this transition. He has set up the requisite systems and leaders. I personally have been doing a lot more on the go-to-market, which Scott used to run.

Mike, our CEO, [and Farquhar] have been co-founders and co-CEOs for 20-plus years, which is very unusual in software. Mike staying on as the founder CEO means that even symbolically for Atlassian, it's really not that much of a step change, because we continue to be founder-led. We continue to have the 20-year context continue.

One of the staggering things about Atlassian is we have a lot of tenured people in the company. We have a Slack channel called Old Timers, which seems to keep growing each day. It's mostly people who have 10-plus years, and I recently joined. Because we have a lot of tenured people, the culture, the ethos of the company, beliefs, values, they all tend to be strong. We are lucky that we have that cohort of people where this continues to be a defining way of how we run the company.

In Atlassian's most recent earnings report, some investors reacted negatively to slower growth prospects than they were hoping. Where do you see Atlassian's growth going? What is your vision for the next six months?

It's interesting because I've been here since we were $100 million in revenue. We are about $4.5 billion dollars in revenue, and we've been a growth company throughout. We are committed to a 20% CAGR over multiple years. [A] 20% CAGR on a $4.5 billion base is substantial, and it's quite rare for a company of our scale. I continue to be excited and grateful that we have a business where the opportunities are so big that we can confidently talk about 20% CAGR over multiple years.

Why do we think that that is the case? Because we operate in three fundamental markets where I think the opportunity is going to grow, because more and more people are poised to be creators. Thanks to gen AI and redefining of the software development lifecycle, more people can do what only technical people used to be able to do before. That's a good thing for Atlassian because we serve the full cycle, not just the coding part of a developer's life. That means more software gets created and more opportunity to grow in that business.

Our second business is the IT service market, which is fundamentally service request handling. This is a market that stands to greatly benefit from the AI wave. Even outside of the AI wave, this is a market that continues to grow at a very healthy clip. We just put out the numbers for each of our business lines for the first time back in April. Service management has been our fastest growing business, close to $500 million. We are priced super competitively, and we are just getting started. That's really at the early phases of the market capture, and that's several billion dollars that is open opportunity for us to go after.

The last market is for knowledge workers. We can democratize that with an open philosophy of saying companies can use any number of tools for knowledge management applications they require, but we want to be the backbone that connects all of those things in one single place through a connected data platform, and offers customers the choice to use multiple tools, but have a single knowledge backbone across their organization such that they can make the maximum use of their own data and deliver the most insights based on what their own employees are doing. That is definitely the largest market we are addressing, and has the most promise, and we are also the earliest in that market.

Business leaders need to be decisive, but that's easier said than done. Here are some ways that top entrepreneurs can make big -- and tough -- decisions in five minutes.

It's officially Q4, and many executives are looking to the future: finishing 2024 strong and starting 2025 off right. Here are four priorities to focus on to bring this year to a successful close.

Presidential candidates are busy racking up endorsements and promoting them to try to sway undecided voters. Former President Donald Trump touted a big endorsement last week on social media, but that person quickly contradicted it, saying they had not endorsed any candidate. Who is it?"
What To Expect From September's CPI Inflation Report,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/07/what-to-expect-from-septembers-cpi-inflation-report/,2024-10-07T16:20:48Z,"Consumer Price Index inflation data to be released on October 10 is expected to provide some support for the Federal Open Market Committee cutting rates in November. However, unemployment data may ultimately matter more for the FOMC's decision making.

All inflation metrics are down over the past 12 months according to the Atlanta Fed's Dashboard that measures a range of inflation metrics. Specifically, headline annual CPI inflation is 2.5% to August 2024 and core CPI, which removes swings in food and energy prices is 3.2%.

Although these figures do not hit the FOMC's 2% inflation goal, inflation is running at a much lower rate than for much of the 2021-2023 period. As a result the FOMC made the first interest rate cut of this cycle in September, recognizing that monetary policy no longer needed to be as restrictive with significant progress on inflation.

Inflation nowcasts from the Cleveland Fed call for reassuring inflation data. They expect 0.1% monthly inflation for headline CPI for September and 0.3% monthly core inflation. Should these forecasts hold, they would provide further reassurance for the FOMC that inflation is now under control. However, some minor concerns remain.

Firstly, shelter costs, which make up a large portion of CPI inflation continue to rise at a relatively fast 5.2% annual rate as of August 2024. Reaching the FOMC's 2% target may require shelter costs to cool from these levels. Secondly, the FOMC continues to monitor for unexpected shocks that could cause inflation to resume. For example, the dockworkers' strike ending with a substantial pay increase recently is the sort of thing the FOMC will be monitoring, to make sure wage-lead inflation doesn't resume.

Inflation was among the more closely watch economic indicators in recent years, given the surge in prices. Now, the FOMC is paying closer attention to the other component of its dual mandate - maintaining full employment. Typically, when the FOMC raises rates abruptly, increases in unemployment result. We've seen that to some degree this cycle with unemployment now at 4.1% for September compared to 3.8% in September 2023. However, so far the increase in unemployment has been sufficiently gradual, so far, to ease fears of a potential recession. Still, jobs data is likely to get more attention than inflation data should inflation continue to ease back towards 2%.

The FOMC next sets interest rates on November 7. Therefore, the October 10 figures will be the last CPI release before that meeting. However, there will be a Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index release on October 31, which may offer further insight on U.S. inflation trends.

It is expected that the FOMC elects to cut interest rates by 0.25% according to the CME FedWatch Tool, with some chance that rates are held steady. Previously, markets anticipated a material chance of a larger 0.5% cut. However, that probability has faded with unexpectedly robust jobs data for September, with the economy adding a higher than expected 254,000 jobs. Should inflation continue to cool, so it is likely that the FOMC continues to cut rates. However, the pace of loosening monetary policy may be more informed by jobs data than inflation figures."
VMware BrandVoice: Unlocking The Benefits Of Private Cloud For Modern Enterprises,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/vmware/2024/10/07/unlocking-the-benefits-of-private-cloud-for-modern-enterprises/,2024-10-07T16:06:30Z,"Written by Richard Monro, Technology Executive and Business Value Lead, VMware Cloud Foundation Division, Broadcom

We are in the middle of a resurgence of interest in private cloud because the concept remains the best answer to solving today's growing IT cost, complexity, and compliance challenges. This interest is driving current CIO spend and activity, with Forrester's ""Private Cloud Market Insights, 2023"" reporting that 79% of surveyed cloud decision makers are implementing internal private clouds.

There are a plethora of private cloud solutions on the market. Many are described by tech marketers using very similar terminology. Yet definitions of what ""cloud"" and ""private"" mean can vary enormously. The challenge lies not in any judgment of solutions being ""good"" or ""bad,"" ""right"" or ""wrong,"" but in expectations and the risk of misunderstandings.

Cloud, as befitting its meteorological alter-ego, is a nebulous term for many.

For some it is a strategy, others a tactic. It is sometimes even used to describe a thing or place. Yet cloud computing is an operating model, as clearly defined by NIST. In short, it is the way we build, deploy, manage, consume, and protect our IT services. The most fundamental characteristics of cloud -- the deal breakers if you will -- are user self-service backed by automation.

Private cloud technology has come a long way in the last 10 years and this cloud operating model, once only available from public clouds, is available privately too. A modern private cloud platform can provide governed and secure self-service, using powerful automation layers, simplified operations, and workflow orchestration. What previously took weeks, now takes minutes.

The modern tools and capabilities for building applications, for so long synonymous with public clouds, are also more widely available as well. A private cloud platform is now far more comprehensive in terms of feature set, offering parity with those public cloud services.

Executives should expect their investments in private cloud technology to enable that cloud operating model and provide access to innovative services like AI and analytics. Many private solutions today are based around independent siloed architectures, bound together with an automation layer that is typically limited in capability while being complicated to maintain. This might be branded a ""cloud,"" but it does not provide for a cloud operating model.

Now that we have described current expectations for a ""cloud,"" we need to define how that cloud operating model will be delivered. This is where the accompanying adjective becomes important -- public or private?

Public cloud has less demanding constraints than private cloud. It is generally understood to be a platform belonging to another organization where we can build and run services. There are restrictions on control and customizations -- everything will need to be done the way the public cloud platform wants it done and this will be different from self-owned services. Applications will also need to comply with the public cloud platform requirements for how workloads will run and data will be stored.

Private cloud, in contrast, has a range of vendor definitions which makes it important for an executive to be very clear about their own requirements and expectations in order to assess solutions.

The definition of the word ""private"" in everyday use has two meaningful characteristics. Something private is ours -- it belongs to a single person or entity. It also means there are the necessary controls to protect our confidential information. These same essential characteristics also apply to private cloud and can translate into tangible business advantages.

In sectors such as finance, healthcare, and government, stringent compliance requirements necessitate robust data protection and privacy measures. A private cloud ensures that sensitive data remains within the organization's own control, adhering to regulations, meeting custom control requirements, and minimizing the risk of breaches.

Data sovereignty may also be a critical driver of private cloud. As well as compliance with public policies, data is increasingly being seen as a strategic asset in the digital economy, particularly with the increasing use of AI, and sovereignty is seen as an essential component of data protection.

Moreover, existing systems and data architectures in many enterprises are often deeply intertwined with their operations. Here, the customization that a private cloud affords modernization without sacrificing stability and integrity.

A private cloud should help you unlock the value of your private data in a controlled manner.

By calling solutions ""private cloud"" when they do not deliver a cloud operating model nor align with the need for control, sovereignty, and customization, vendors have diluted the term and confused the market. The gaps and omissions in vendor definitions tend to be driven by elements they are simply unable to deliver.

The onus is on executives to identify what cloud challenges they are trying to solve -- and what each vendor is actually capable of delivering when they offer a private cloud solution. The Broadcom definitions for private cloud and hybrid cloud can help you start.

Ultimately, executives are looking for private cloud solutions that do not compromise on cloud features while still ensuring enterprise controls. Private clouds are expected to deliver:

We know that private cloud is a current imperative for most organizations, but that need will only increase. In the next article in this series, we will uncover exactly why that is and how you can get ahead of it.

Stay tuned."
Democratizing Finance: How Web3 Bridges The Gap For The Underbanked,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/07/democratizing-finance-how-web3-bridges-the-gap-for-the-underbanked/,2024-10-07T15:08:01Z,"The global financial landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation, driven by rapid advancements in technology. In particular, the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 technologies promises to break down traditional barriers to financial services, making them more accessible to individuals and communities that have long been excluded. As of 2021, an estimated 1.4 billion people worldwide remain unbanked, meaning they have no access to formal banking institutions. Another 1 billion are underbanked, lacking sufficient access to affordable financial products. This exclusion contributes to cycles of poverty, as it limits individuals' ability to save, borrow, or invest. However, decentralized technologies, which utilize blockchain infrastructure and smart contracts, offer a new pathway to financial inclusion, providing innovative solutions for these underserved populations.

Web3 technologies, which refer to a decentralized version of the internet built on blockchain, represent a significant departure from traditional centralized financial systems. Instead of entirely relying on intermediaries such as banks or payment processors, Web3 enables peer-to-peer transactions and automated financial services. For the underbanked, this is revolutionary. Access to digital wallets, decentralized applications (dApps), and cryptocurrencies means that people can store, transfer, and grow their wealth independently of traditional financial institutions, avoiding high fees and geographical limitations while complying to regulatory compliance requirements across jurisdictions.

Key industry players in this space are already making significant strides toward democratizing finance. Mastercard, in collaboration with MetaMask and Baanx, recently launched a crypto-to-fiat card allowing MetaMask wallet users to spend their cryptocurrency directly in fiat currency at any location accepting Mastercard. This new solution removes the need for intermediaries like exchanges or banks, making it easier for self-custodial wallet users to access funds outside the crypto space. This initiative is a step towards connecting Web2 and Web3 ecosystems, empowering underbanked individuals with instant crypto-to-fiat conversions for everyday purchases.

Another company actively driving financial inclusion through Web3 technologies is CrossFi, founded by Alexander Mamasidikov. It creates decentralized finance (DeFi) tools that aim to democratize access to financial services, empowering everyone to take control of their own financial futures. By building a bridge between traditional banking and DeFi, CrossFi offers a suite of products that allows users to seamlessly manage both fiat and cryptocurrency assets. These innovative products include the world's first non-custodial payment card, enabling users to spend cryptocurrency directly from their Web3 wallets, without the need for a third-party custodian or exchange. For millions of people across various socioeconomic backgrounds who don't have access to conventional banking, this on-chain payment card represents a gateway to the global economy, enabling their access to secure, transparent, and efficient financial services.

""We believe that financial inclusion is not just about offering financial services -- it's about creating accessible, secure, and user-friendly tools that anyone can use, regardless of where they are in the world,"" said Alexander Mamasidikov, founder of CrossFi.

Another player in the Web3 finance space is 1inch, known for its decentralized finance products. The 1inch Wallet and 1inch Card provide users with seamless ways to manage and spend digital assets. The 1inch Card allows for crypto-to-fiat conversion at competitive rates and supports Apple Pay and Google Pay, ensuring that users can make everyday purchases with crypto while benefiting from secure, fast transactions. With features like a physical and virtual card, it empowers individuals to bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional financial systems.

However, as with any new financial technology, regulatory frameworks need to be in place to prevent misuse. Fintech companies like CrossFi need to ensure compliance with local regulations by requiring users to pass Know Your Customer (KYC) checks before obtaining their credit cards. These companies work closely with local regulators and banking partners to maintain full compliance across all products, backed by dedicated legal teams that monitor and adhere to the legal requirements of each geography.

""Robust compliance and regulatory frameworks are essential to ensure that web3-powered DeFi innovations operate within the boundaries of the law. Without clear guidelines, we risk creating a system vulnerable to exploitation. That's why, at CrossFi, we prioritize full compliance, leaving no loopholes in our approach. It's crucial for us to adhere to the laws in the different regions we operate, as it ensures trust and long-term sustainability for our users,"" said Mamasidikov.

Beyond payment cards, innovations like stablecoins and decentralized lending platforms are also playing a crucial role in extending financial services to the underbanked. Stablecoins, for instance, are digital currencies pegged to a stable asset such as the U.S. dollar issued by Circle or Hong Kong dollar issued by IDA. These offer a secure and reliable alternative to the volatility of other cryptocurrencies, making them an ideal option for people in regions with unstable currencies or inflationary economies. Additionally, decentralized lending platforms enable individuals to access credit without needing a traditional bank account or credit score, opening up new opportunities for financial empowerment.

Olga Feldmeier, a prominent blockchain expert and CEO of Smart Valor, an AI-powered crypto investment platform, believes that DeFi has the potential to completely reshape the financial landscape by making essential financial services more accessible to all. ""Stablecoins, for example, can serve as a lifeline for people living in countries with hyperinflation, providing them with a way to protect their wealth and participate in the global economy,"" Feldmeier explained.

Mamasidikov also shares a similar view: ""The real power of Web3 in democratizing finance lies in its ability to provide programmable liquidity and trust-less financial instruments. By leveraging decentralized protocols, we can bypass traditional gatekeepers and offer financial services that are not bound by geographic borders or legacy banking infrastructure. In this context, stablecoins represent a breakthrough in providing stability in uncertain economic environments. They allow people to store and transfer value securely and affordably, particularly in regions where traditional banking is inaccessible or unreliable.""

The movement towards decentralized finance is still in its early stages, but it holds immense potential for creating a more inclusive financial system. By eliminating intermediaries and providing direct access to financial services, innovative Web3 technologies can empower individuals to take control of their finances, no matter where they are located. In doing so, they are helping to bridge the gap for the underbanked and pave the way for a more equitable global economy.

Ultimately, the democratization of finance through Web3 is not just about technology; it's about creating a fairer, more inclusive system that gives everyone the opportunity to participate in the global economy. The future of finance is decentralized, and it's one where everyone has a seat at the table."
Is It 'Irrefutable' That The Economy Performs Better Under Democrats?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/10/07/is-it-irrefutable-that-the-economy-performs-better-under-democrats/,2024-10-07T15:02:38Z,"Responding to the failures of Enron and Worldcom within six months of each other, failures that didn't spook the markets much at all, President George W. Bush zestily signed into law Sarbanes-Oxley (legislation that most certainly did spook the markets), thus criminalizing failure in an economy that had long derived its dynamism from - you guessed it - a lack of barriers to the decline of corporations no longer meeting or leading the needs of customers.

Even though government spending is the ultimate tax on growth (this is not a comment on deficits, which both sides needlessly waste time on when the other Party is in power), was allergic to government-spending vetoes, he reversed the Reagan-Clinton emphasis on a strong, stable dollar that had been such a major driver of economic vitality in the '80s and '90s, plus when banks and investment banks began to go belly-up in 2008 (arguably symptoms of the Bush Treasury's confusion about dollar-price stability), the rhetorically ""free market"" Bush claimed the markets weren't working on the way to bailouts that logically caused the ""financial crisis,"" as opposed to staving off market mayhem.

Bush's unsuccessful presidency always comes to mind every four years, and when Republicans and Democrats claim the economy does much better when their party controls the White House. It's a discussion that elevates neither side, and not because policy doesn't matter. The reality is that good and bad individuals with good or bad ideas occupy the White House, after which part of the success or failure of individuals has much to do with how cooperative (or rather crucially, uncooperative) Congress is toward the president in office. Bush can be given a little leniency here with the latter in mind.

While his awful dollar policy was all his, Sarbanes-Oxley was passed near unanimously in the House and Senate. Considering TARP, the bank bailout bill that morphed into so much more, many more Democrats voted for it than Republicans.

This is important in consideration of the economic portion of Barack Obama's presidency that followed Bush's. The economy had limping qualities much of the time. One anecdote supporting the previous truth comes care of Republican-leaning Wall Street Journal columnist Mary O'Grady. O'Grady has noted that from 2009-2014, more Mexicans crossed the southern border back into Mexico than came into the U.S. However, looming large in the weakness of the Obama economy were the bailouts signed into law by George W. Bush, but that were overwhelmingly supported by Democrats in Congress.

Obama had his own errors, including the passage of the misnamed Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), but the stock market did pretty well as his presidency wore on. Was this Democratic policy? Arguably no. Lest readers forget, the legislative portion of Obama's presidency (2009-2017) largely ended in 2010 after the electorate, presumably chastened by Obama's lefty lurch (after running a centrist campaign), handed control of Congress back to the Republicans. In 2014, the GOP took control of the Senate too.

Obama's presidency is useful to think about when making comparisons between Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Using the charitably worthless measurement that is Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Reagan economy averaged annual growth of 3.5%, while Clinton was near 4%. The stock market soared under both too, but more under Clinton. Ok, so both GDP and the stock market favor Clinton and the Democrats? Not so fast.

It's easily forgotten that Clinton, like Obama, lost Congress in the mid-term elections, and after tax increases in concert with an attempt to nationalize healthcare. Clinton later admitted regret about the tax hikes, plus famously proclaimed subsequent to the GOP's taking of Congress that ""the era of big government is over."" As Democratic historian Richard Reeves observed about Clinton's presidency, it was Reagan's third term.

With Republicans in control of Congress while Clinton was in the White House, welfare reform was signed into law, a capital gains tax cut was passed, after which divided government invariably keeps a lid on major legislation meant to expand government. It's worth adding that to Clinton's everlasting credit, he replaced weak-dollar Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen with Robert Rubin. This was a big deal.

Still, it's useful to consider a Clinton presidency that in so many ways mimicked Reagan's in the eyes of Democrats, all the while considering the role of GOP's takeover of Congress in Clinton's makeover. What if Reagan had similarly enjoyed a GOP congressional majority?

It's worth asking mainly because in judging the individual in the White House, you can't judge them solely on their actions. What about the Congress in opposition or supporting them? Democrats like Clinton and Obama plainly prospered more than they otherwise would have thanks to Republicans in majority opposition.

Pivoting to Donald Trump, stocks and the economy generally did well during his presidency with a mix of good (de-regulation, exiting of the Paris Accord, ok tax cuts) and bad (tariffs) decisions, only for stocks and the economy to plummet in March of 2020. Think the lockdowns following political panic over the coronavirus. It was then that Trump went against type and supported freedom, economy, and logic-trampling government control. The collapse under Trump towards the end of his presidency obviously compromises the numbers leading up to March of 2020, at which point Trump and Republicans are awful at economic policy? Not so fast once again. Without excusing Trump's mindless actions for even a second, let's never forget that Democrats supported this hideous lurch from sanity exponentially more than allegedly virus-denying Republicans.

This is important in consideration of the Biden presidency that followed. While Democratic governors were only too happy to oversee lockdowns in the states they ran, and while mouthbreathing Republican governors locked down late while ""unlocking"" early to the disdainful horror of double-masked Dems, the total discredit of lockdowns in GOP-led states set the stage for eventually all U.S. states ending what was so inhumane, unhealthy, and inimical to growth. Yet it's ""Biden's"" economic growth now?

Hopefully readers see the point. Prosperity under Democratic presidents was so often aided by the GOP's more routine embrace of limited government and freedom, while horrendous errors by GOP presidents (2008 bailouts, 2020 lockdowns) were embraced much more by Democrats than Republicans. Which means it's overwhelming fallacy for Democrats to claim a ""clear"" relationship between their policies and growth.

At the same time, Republicans should be looking inward too. As evidenced by the not-infrequent economic success of Democratic presidents, there's a case to be made that the GOP does the most for freedom and for growth when they're out of the White House, and aggressively restraining the Democrats from being - yes - Democrats."
Biden Responds to Chinese Foothold in Iraq Energy Sector,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dipkabhambhani/2024/10/07/biden-responds-to-chinese-foothold-in-iraq-energy-sector/,2024-10-07T14:23:58Z,"The U.S. government is laser-focused on bringing American companies to Iraq to rebuild its energy sector in an attempt to edge out Chinese investors, reduce emissions from Iraq's burgeoning oil and gas production, and counter Iran's growing influence.

In August, Forbes reported that over the past four years, Iran has become more energy dominant, cash rich, and globally influential. The Biden administration is now pivoting swiftly to help Iraq under its new pro-business Prime Minister Mohammed Shiaa Al-Sudani.

""Everybody recognizes the asset that Iraq represents, second largest proven reserves in OPEC,"" Geoffrey Pyatt, the State Department's Assistant Secretary for Energy Resources told Forbes.

Iraq has 145 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, which is about 100 years of supply at the current rate of production, according to the World Bank.

However, when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, it destroyed critical infrastructure, including Iraq's electricity infrastructure, leaving the country deficient and unable to rebuild, until now.

""Two decades of American blood and treasure are in Iraq and we shouldn't forget that,"" Pyatt said.

""Now the relationship is shifting into a new phase.""

U.S. national security is at stake in staving off China.

Developing the energy system in Iraq is also an opportunity to usurp China's position in the region, Pyatt said.

The assistant secretary said the growth of Iraq's energy sector is going to take place ""in a market environment.""

""And unlike the Chinese that may have other motives, our companies are going to get involved where they feel there's an asset...but also where there are options for recovery of capital and making some progress,"" Pyatt said.

China, which was already one of the leading operators of oil and gas fields in Iraq, is now developing 10 more oil and gas fields after winning a competitive bid process to develop selected blocs earlier this year.

Pyatt said, ""Sudani is serious about trying to attract Western investment into the sector. When I was there in May, there was a genuine sense of chagrin that the fifth and sixth bid rounds had gone entirely to small and not particularly competent Chinese bidders, and that there had been a paucity of big Western companies coming in.""

China imports more crude than any other country, more than 11 million barrels of crude a day. Iraq is the country's third largest source of oil behind Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Iraq sends 35% of its crude to China, and the trade volume between them has reached $50 billion.

Still China could also end up buying the newfound Iraqi oil and gas developed by American companies.

Pyatt is not concerned.

""It's a globally integrated oil market, so I don't worry at all about the flag on the molecule. It's a fungible and integrated market, with the exception of Russia, which has managed to put itself deep into the penalty box because of Ukraine and which is excluded from mainstream markets,"" he said.

This relationship between the new Government of Iraq and the U.S. government has been developing over nearly 6 months in force.

After Sudani visited Washington in April, Pyatt visited Bagdad, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, which set into motion a series of MOUs, meetings and collaborations.

In the past month alone, the U.S. State Department has managed high-level meetings between Sudani and energy giants like GE Renova, Total, BP, Baker Hughes, Haliburton, Hunt and Honeywell.

With a sense of urgency, Pyatt, Sudani and high-level executives from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the energy sector met in Houston around Gastech, the international ministerial-level conference of natural gas executives. They met again a week later during NY Climate Week and the U.N. General Assembly.

On October 1, the U.S. Export Import Bank announced that Congress had allowed it to release nearly $300 million to Iraq's Ministry of Electricity, which will pay Jacksonville, Florida-based Stellar Energy Americas, Inc. to retool several power plants to make the grid more reliable and efficient.

The Iraqi government will pay Stellar $297 million for a project EXIM said will ""increase the availability and reliability of electricity in Iraq by generating power through waste heat"" and support 600 U.S. jobs across more than half a dozen states.

The deal was part of $1 billion package to support U.S. exports.

EXIM is the U.S. export credit agency which helps U.S. businesses export products and services to international markets to compete for global sales. It offers financing including export insurance, working capital guarantees, loan guarantees and direct loans.

In documents obtained by Forbes, Stellar will convert two of Iraq's three single-cycle power plants into combined-cycle natural gas-fired units.

Once converted, total plant generation capacity in Iraq will rise from 550 MW to 835 MW, about a 40% increase in power generation capacity.

According to EXIM Bank's notice to Congress, the project represents ""a significant expansion in energy produced with no material increase in greenhouse gas emissions.""

EXIM said the increased production of electricity will yield a 31.2% reduction in GHG emissions per MWh generated.

Stellar will handle engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, design, health and safety management, and operational training for personnel. The London branch of JP Morgan Chase Bank is EXIM's guaranteed lender.

Beyond EXIM, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation is also investing in Iraq. A DFC official told me the active investment in Iraq's energy sector is $299 million.

The agency said its energy priorities in Iraq and across the entirety of its global portfolio are focused on wind, solar, methane abatement, carbon capture among other clean energy investments.

Between 2004-11, the U.S. Trade the Development Agency helped Iraq invested $2 million for programs to develop Iraq's energy and natural resources and mining sectors.

A USTDA official told me the assistance fell into two categories: training programs in technical, management, and human resources for the oil sector, and reverse trade missions that brought delegations of Iraqi oil sector officials to the U.S. to examine American innovations with the goal of exporting U.S. technology.

The goal at the time was a post-war rebuild before the U.S. would withdraw military troops, which it did for the most part in 2011. ""While the Agency has not done work in Iraq for several years, USTDA is open to new programming in the country if a proposal aligns with our demand-driven funding model.""

There's another priority for the Biden administration -- lowering emissions.

In an interview, Pyatt told me there are ""huge opportunities"" under Sudani to bring efficiency to Iraq's ""legacy energy sector,"" and opportunities to capture gas that's currently vented at record levels.

""They are one of the world's largest emitters. The volume of gas they currently vent or flare is on par with the volume of energy they import from Iran,"" Pyatt said.

Currently, when Iraq drills for oil, the associated gas is burned off. Flaring is a hazard to the environment, and a loss of gas revenues to the Iraqi government. The goal is to reduce flaring and instead pipe that natural gas to the power sector.

""For the U.S., a big part of this is Iraq's sovereignty and economic success, and the convergence of interests between the US and Sudani's vision right now, in particular his objective of getting to zero imports by 2030,"" Pyatt said.

Iraq's Minister of Oil, Hayan Abdel-Ghani, said in Houston he wants Iraq to end all flaring by 2028, which is ""consistent with Biden administration climate goals as well,"" Pyatt said.

Iraq will soon select a contractor to install rooftop solar systems on more than 500 public buildings.

According to Mideast Utilities magazine, Ziad Fadil, Iraq's Minister of Electricity, confirmed that nearly $68 million has been secured in the 2024 national budget, ""underscoring the government's commitment to addressing the country's chronic electricity supply challenges.""

An Iraqi official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Iraq is one of the world's greatest victims of climate change. ""It's a real issue,"" he said.

Ironically, as countries work to meet global climate goals to become net-zero by 2030, Iraq could be producing record volumes of oil and gas for the global market by then.

""Not how I look at it. The market is going to decide when demand begins to abate for fossil fuels. The IEA says that's going to happen within this decade. The United States is working to help make that so,"" Pyatt said.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has forecast a sharp global decline in fossil fuel supply from 2022 to 2050.

""In the meantime, we need to make sure we're doing everything possible to reduce the climate intensity, the climate footprint of the fossil energy that the world does produce,"" Pyatt said.

He said he likes the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's celebrated Vision 2030 model whereby the country increases renewable energy capacity for its domestic grid but sells its oil and gas into the global marketplace.

""The more they power the domestic economy with renewables, the more molecules they're left with to sell into the global market. Iraq ought to be following that same pathway,"" Pyatt said.

In May, Oil Minister Abdel-Ghani said he wanted to increase Iraq's proven reserves to 160 billion barrels by producing 29 new oil and gas fields."
"The Tax Man Comes For Fast Fashion, Part 3: The U.S. Leads The Way",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/taxnotes/2024/10/07/the-tax-man-comes-for-fast-fashion-part-3-the-us-leads-the-way/,2024-10-07T14:23:49Z,"This is the third article in a series. The first provided an overview of how fast fashion companies are taxed globally and potential solutions moving forward. The second discussed rivalries within the growing fast fashion industry, focusing on how this growth has been influenced by tax policy.

Temu's parent company, PDD Holdings, has had a rough several weeks.

In August the company's stock price plunged nearly 30 percent after its second-quarter earnings fell short of analysts' expectations. Despite this, PDD is performing astonishingly well in the market, making the steep sell-off a bit surprising. In the second quarter, PDD earned $13.6 billion in revenue -- an 86 percent jump over its same-period earnings from the previous year, the company reported. PDD should be celebrating, but instead it is assuaging the nerves of Wall Street analysts who had forecast an overly optimistic $14 billion for the quarter, according to CNBC.

PDD is in a bit of a delicate spot. Yes, revenue is high, but the company is also aware that its boom may be nearing its end. In its second-quarter release, PDD acknowledged that it's likely to face pressure amidst ""intensified competition"" from other low-cost e-commerce retailers.

Investors are clearly skittish. PDD's stock price took a mini tumble in mid-September after the Biden administration announced that it intends to close a customs exemption that allows low-value imports to enter the country duty free.

In the statement, the White House left little question about who it is targeting:

The majority of shipments entering the United States claiming the de minimis exemption originate from several China-founded e-commerce platforms, putting American consumers at risk, undercutting American workers and businesses, and resulting in the importation of huge volumes of low-value products such as textiles and apparel into the U.S. market duty-free.

In the United States, importers are exempted from paying customs duties on packages valued under $800 under section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. The problem is that the number of exempt packages is accelerating at such a high rate that some lawmakers and industry analysts suspect the system is being gamed. In 2023 the United States received 1 billion de minimis packages -- a 57 percent increase compared with 2020. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says de minimis imports have jumped by 88 percent over the past six years.

The de minimis exemption was not meant to become a point of controversy or exploitation. Rather, it was meant to ensure that Americans who purchase goods abroad can buy a certain amount duty free. The exemption amount used to be much lower: Until 1994 the de minimis threshold for low-value imports was $5, but it gradually increased until it hit $800 per person per day in 2016. Congress landed on $800 because it wanted to align the de minimis threshold with the duty-free exemption that applies to international travel.

It turns out that this exemption, which was meant to help U.S. consumers, may be helping foreign e-commerce retailers as well. Lawmakers specifically say fast fashion retailer Shein and PDD's Temu are taking advantage of the exemption. In June 2023 a U.S. House committee released a report saying that the two companies alone accounted for nearly 30 percent of the 685 million de minimis shipments that entered the United States in 2022. Although the companies are doing heavy business in the United States, they aren't shipping their products in bulk. Instead, they mostly send their packages as direct-to-consumer shipments. Because their products are ultra-low value, the direct-to-consumer shipments are typically worth less than $800 and can enter the country duty free.

The Biden administration says it will issue proposed rules ensuring that products subject to tariffs under sections 201 or 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, or section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, will not qualify for the de minimis exemption. That spells bad news for Chinese e-commerce apparel operators, because 70 percent of Chinese textile and apparel imports are subject to section 301 tariffs. However, the de minimis threshold shielded many e-commerce apparel shipments from the tariffs.

Biden is building on policy from his predecessor, former president Donald Trump.

Between 2018 and 2019 the Trump administration imposed an escalating series of section 301 tariffs on Chinese imports, including a wide array of textiles, fabrics, and apparel. The decisions subjected those goods to additional tariffs ranging between 10 and 25 percent. The Biden administration decided to keep those tariffs, and now it plans to ensure that they will be fully applied.

The White House also announced that it wants more information about de minimis shipments entering the country's borders, including a shipment's 10-digit tariff classification number and information about the person claiming the de minimis exemption.

Although the White House is ready to use its executive power, it wants Congress to reform the de minimis exemption within the next few months. Specifically, it wants Congress to exclude textiles and apparel from the de minimis exemption and formally exclude products covered by section 301, section 201, or section 232 trade enforcement actions.

It's not an unreasonable request -- the de minimis issue is one that has bipartisan alignment in a polarized Congress.

The White House's proposal -- which should be released soon -- is similar to the End China's De Minimis Abuse Act (H.R. 7979), introduced in April by Rep. Gregory F. Murphy, R-N.C. That measure would prevent firms from applying the de minimis exemption to any goods subject to section 301 trade enforcement tariffs.

The White House's announcement has pleased Republicans and Democrats alike. House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo., said he, too, wants bipartisan legislation on the issue. ""They say imitation is the highest form of flattery, so I am pleased Democrats in Washington are once again acknowledging that Republicans' tough-on-China trade policy works,"" he said in a statement. ""Given that the Biden Administration has finally embraced Republicans' common sense reforms to prevent China's abuse of the de minimis threshold, I am hopeful that House Democrats will work with us to codify this policy into law.""

Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who in August introduced similar legislation under the Fighting Illicit Goods, Helping Trustworthy Importers, and Netting Gains (FIGHTING) for America Act, also praised the White House's announcement.

The United States is moving quickly on the matter, but other jurisdictions aren't far behind. The European Union is facing a similar de minimis issue, even though it applies a much lower €150 ($162) customs exemption. Germany -- the EU's largest market -- is being ""inundated"" with up to 400,000 low-value imports per day, according to member of European Parliament Engin Eroglu. The country's finance minister, Christian Lindner, thinks the bloc needs to scrap the exemption, according to Reuters.

The European Commission agrees; it actually called for the €150 exemption to be removed last year, but the proposal went nowhere. Some lawmakers think the bloc should revisit the issue. In March MEP Maximilian Krah asked the commission how it planned to address the rising number of de minimis imports, noting that ""customs duties are . . . paid on around one in every thousand packages.""

""Asian suppliers in particular, such as Temu, undermine this requirement by no longer sending large consignments on pallets -- instead, they package and ship goods individually in small packages and parcels. If a single product costs more than €150, it is -- if possible -- disassembled into its constituent parts, which are then shipped separately. This way, none of the individually shipped items costs more than €150,"" he said. ""The EU's Supply Chains Directive does not seem to have any effect.""

Krah asked the commission to divulge the amount of customs duties the bloc has lost because of the €150 customs exemption and further asked the commission to outline its response to the environmental burdens that high volumes of individual shipments present.

Paolo Gentiloni, European Commissioner for the Economy, didn't quite answer those questions, but he responded that risk management is ""essential"" for determining whether packages truly fall below the €150 threshold. The commission, he said, will ""use all available instruments to accelerate the EU customs reform and to coordinate and strengthen the enforcement activities against goods that pose health, safety and environmental risks, in cooperation with different EU enforcement-related bodies.""

Krah added that even if the customs exemption applies, e-commerce packages should be subject to an import turnover tax, and potentially to sales tax.

""In practice, however, these two taxes are paid only in exceptional circumstances,"" Krah said in another written question. ""First of all, non-EU traders like Temu only enclose a delivery note. Invoices showing the applicable taxes are hard to come by in practice, even upon repeated request. What is more, given the sheer volume of packages and parcels (approximately 900,000 per day), it is virtually impossible to levy charges. No import service has the capacity for this.""

Krah asked the European Commission to explain how it is addressing the issue and to provide member-state-level estimates of the amount of revenue they are missing.

Gentiloni responded that the commission wants e-commerce platforms to charge VAT and duties at the time of sale and share that information with customs. In the meantime, the European Parliament is reportedly looking at a new commission proposal to remove the customs duty exemption, according to the Guardian.

South Africa charges tariffs of up to 45 percent on clothing, but officials say foreign e-commerce companies are paying a fraction of that rate by shipping clothing in smaller packages. That's because the country allows importers to pay a 20 percent rate on shipments values at less than ZAR 500 ($28.90) and does not apply VAT to those parcels.

In August the South African Revenue Service announced that it is changing this system. In a release, the revenue authority said it ""noted legitimate concerns that have been expressed in the importation of several . . . goods, especially clothing, via e-commerce by a number of importers who have not been paying the obligatory customs duties and VAT on these imports, resulting in unfair competition with other industry players.""

There will be no more exemptions. Starting September 1, VAT is applied to low-value e-commerce shipments, in addition to the 20 percent customs duty. By November 1 SARS will apply a new set of reconfigured VAT rates to e-commerce shipments."
5 Stocks To Own For The 2024 Elections & Beyond!,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenberman/2024/10/07/5-stocks-to-own-for-the-2024-elections--beyond/,2024-10-07T14:10:05Z,"Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut ""party,"" which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year's robust gains

The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren't going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India's middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade

The U.S. economy's relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns

After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections

Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance

Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases

Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities

Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond

2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector's continued leadership and the bull market's broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023.

Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq's extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years.

The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the ""New Golden Age of Stock Picking"" that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that.

But, before diving deep into the Gorilla's top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail!

Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer

Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market's continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros.

August's deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs' (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power.

There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer's pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don't believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist.

The Fed's New Focus: Jobs and Growth

The Fed's fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer.

What's more, inflation is now officially in the Fed's rear-view mirror, and the past few months' trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed's Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed's new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years.

Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates.

Let's see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed's easing cycle.

Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead?

Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system's strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector's stability in the face of last year's regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla's main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024.

So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer's gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August's pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon.

Evidence for a ""soft landing"" is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia's war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks.

With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring ""Goldilocks"" conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions.

A Maturing Bull Market

Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a ""slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year."" By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter's grinding and ""boring"" advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don't closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets.

Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla's expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally's base is undeniable.

The odds are that this year's trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November's elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year's increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party!

If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year.

The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies.

Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won't slow down anytime soon.

Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth

AMT's average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry's profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors.

American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge.

Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company's core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters.

Financials and Valuation

American Tower's short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029.

The company's growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years' surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth.

American Tower's valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company's valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently ""underinvested"" due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally.

The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company's substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth.

Technicals and Recent Performance

AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company's fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock's all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year.

Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business.

Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company's recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM's growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story.

Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption

Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI's most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized ""in-house"" productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM's expertise, especially given the company's ""hands-on"" approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years.

IBM's strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company's hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM's latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon's (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth.

IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company's offerings fit well into IBM's strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path.

Financials and Valuation

IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM's operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM's operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company's further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters.

IBM's latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM's debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed's easing cycle.

In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM's business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come.

Technicals and Recent Performance

IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently ""testing"" the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200.

Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company's mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic.

The company's mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company's biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix's video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces.

Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push

For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses.

Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify's customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify's U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts.

Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify's diversification push. These new products could broaden the company's demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company's bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run.

Financials and Valuation

Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers' fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company's increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify's total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a ""cash cow"" would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates.

When it comes to evaluating Spotify's financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company's costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify's optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price.

Spotify's revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022.

Thanks to the past couple of years' positive developments, the company's financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify's valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks.

Technicals and Recent Performance

SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company's cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company's business continues to mature, the stock's sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla's picks while having the most upside potential as well.

Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company's strategic focus since well before going public in 2019.

Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company's platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors.

The company navigated the past couple of years' bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market's weakness for ""bolt-on"" acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space.

Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients

Tradewed defines itself as an ""operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,"" which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb's average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb's, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company's growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients.

For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company's addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential.

The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal.

Financials and Valuation

Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb's profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company's revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more.

Tradeweb's rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions.

Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company's financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company's growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years.

Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock's valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index.

Technicals and Recent Performance

Tradeweb's great execution is reflected in its shares' performance and the company's valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical ""support"" below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock.

Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the

U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber's core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company's ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the ""new economy"" over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the ""unicorn"" status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company.

Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber's revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion.

The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the ""big guns"" of the tech sector. Although Uber's markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed's easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant.

Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength

Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company's strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it's hard to question its strategic vision.

Uber One, the company's membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company's great execution.

Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber's platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver.

According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber's ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won't impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s.

Financials and Valuation

In its early years, profitability was Uber's achilles heel, but since 2018, the company's revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company's ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth.

Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics.

Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company's strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER's strong performance over the past couple of years.

Although the company's debt load is still substantial, Uber's swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company's bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here.

Technicals and Recent Performance

Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock's market value, with the company's surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER's relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point.

Conclusion

Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the ""boring"" truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s.

Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August's historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index's (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days.

Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it's important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed's painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher.

That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed's tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this ""rotation"" could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level.

This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla's hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential.

Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections.

With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!"
Putin Faces Risks His Energy Holdings Cannot Prevent?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielmarkind/2024/10/07/putin-faces-risks-his-energy-holdings-cannot-prevent/,2024-10-07T13:45:29Z,"As the Ukraine war progresses toward its third winter, Russian President Vladimir Putin finds himself besieged on numerous fronts. During the first 30 months of this conflict, Putin used his vast energy resources to hedge against the collapse of the Russian economy. Now, however, the oil and natural gas bounty may not be enough to keep Russia's economy afloat, as some captains of industry decide to distance themselves from the regime.

One of the secrets of Putin's longevity in the Byzantine world of Russian politics is his alliance with a handful of wealthy men known as oligarchs. While some of these men were allies of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, others rose with Putin since he succeeded Yeltsin in 2000. The first-generation oligarchs used their connections to purchase formerly state-owned Soviet assets in the 1990s, such as in the energy industry, for prices far below market. The ""Putin oligarchs"" used their ties to secure massive state contracts since the 2000s. ""Yeltsin's oligarchs"" gained substantial control over Russia's natural resources. All became potential targets of Mr. Putin if they happened to cross or displease him.

Despite the potential threat posed by Yeltsin-era oligarchs to his power, Putin often chose not to confront them but rather to co-opt, telling them they could keep their money and assets so long as they stayed out of politics. This gave them a stake in his regime, with a substantial penalty likely for those who chose to oppose him. Putin showed how heavy-handed he could be in the case of the opposition oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who he imprisoned for nine years beginning in 2003.

For twenty years few did. However, the script changed with the massive Ukrainian invasion in February 2022. Western governments slapped sanctions not only on Russian state assets but also on the possessions of many of the oligarchs, counting on whatever influence they might have over Putin to induce him to stop the fighting. As a result, men who had become accustomed to vacationing on the French Riviera and hosting lavish parties on their massive private yachts could no longer do so. Not only were they barred from traveling to many Western countries, but their yachts and other possessions were often seized from under them but cannot be sold unless a crime was committed. As the result, the seized assets remain in a legal limbo.

The dam may now begin to break. The last few months have seen more Putin allies, such as Vladimir Lisin and Albert Avdolyan, break with the Russian President, for the first time. Recently, Igor Rotenberg, who for some years now was quietly selling his stake in Russian companies, has rid himself of all of his holdings in the country.

This is significant because Igor Rotenberg, currently sanctioned by the EU had once been one of the prime beneficiaries of Gazprom Bureniye (Gazprom Drilling), a company that received contracts from the state gas monopoly, Gazprom. In December 2023, Rotenberg sold his shares of RTITS, more formally known as RT- Invest Transport Systems, his last major asset in Russia. Rotenberg, whose estimated net worth was once believed to reach $1.5B, was sanctioned by the UK in 2022 following Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine.

Igor is the son of Arkady Rotenberg, the Putin judo buddy from St. Petersburg, a sanctioned billionaire who is worth $4 billion and is on Forbes' billionaire list as #781. Despite his father's connections though, the young Rotenberg has distanced himself from politics in the country and from the regime.

All of this is happening as the West moves ever more aggressively to track and seize the assets of Russian oligarchs. On September 20, the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control designated seven oligarchs and 12 companies that they control as subject to having their assets frozen.

The sale of all of his assets by Igor Rotenberg and the recent anti-war comments made by Oleg Deripaska, may evidence a growing unease among the most powerful men in Russia who are outside of the security, military, or Vladimir's Putin's inner circle

Nevertheless, while it is clear that despite the economic sanctions, Vladimir Putin intends for Russia to remain a major energy power on the world stage, he will have to do so without the support of some of the high-profile businessmen who have led the country's energy industries for the last thirty years."
Heat And Drought Imperil The Panama Canal And Adjoining Rainforests,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2024/10/07/heat-and-drought-imperil-the-panama-canal-and-adjoining-rainforests/,2024-10-07T13:06:38Z,"Standing outside one of former General Manuel Noriega's retreats, I witnessed several ships waiting to pass through the Panama Canal. These included mega vessels carrying cargo and LNG. About 32 ships, or 6% of global maritime traffic, go through those locks daily. They pay billions in annual tolling fees and contribute 5% to 10% of Panama's gross domestic product.

The canal is shrouded by rainforests that store water, feeding the surrounding lakes and filling the locks that allow ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, climate change threatens water levels and is causing more extreme weather patterns, including prolonged droughts. Less rainfall results in less water, leading the canal operators to restrict the number of vessels passing through or the amount of cargo they can carry.

If water shortages become routine, the Panama Canal Authority must construct new reservoirs or desalination plants. This would lead to higher tolls for shipping companies, prompting them to seek alternative routes. I watched the ships pass through locks, which takes 8-10 hours. Since its completion in 1914, the canal has shaved 30-50 days off specific routes, saving exporters a ton of money and ensuring uninterrupted global commerce.

""Experts measure every drop of water every day,"" says Yafa Melamed, an environmental protection specialist for the Panama Canal Authority, at a talk in her office. ""We have a monitoring plan to check the water quality in the lake, rivers, and wastewater,"" with sensors and stations that measure rainfall and lake levels. ""We also monitor air quality.""

The Panama Canal is one of history's most impressive engineering achievements. It was constructed on Barro Colorado Island, which was mountainous before the canal's creation in 1914. The system includes locks that operate like an elevator, raising and lowering ships. The locks were designed to accommodate the largest vessels of the early 20th century, known as Panamax ships.

The Panama Canal Authority expanded the lock system from 2007 to 2016. This growth was necessary to serve larger vessels, known as Neopanamax ships. They can carry more cargo, resulting in higher tolling fees. However, potential water shortages threaten the canal's operation.

""During droughts, fewer ships pass through so that we can have more water to provide to the communities,"" which depend on it for drinking supplies, says Melamed. When the canal expanded, the authority performed environmental impact studies examining forest, soil, air, and water quality. ""To expand or modify now, we must address climate change and biodiversity.""

The Panama Canal relies on freshwater from rainfall and the adjoining rainforests, which store water in the soil. The canal's $5.25 billion expansion added two new locks to the existing three, allowing the system to handle four times as much cargo as before. This resulted in greater income for the authority and shipping companies.

However, the expansion requires more water; the larger Neopanamax ships traverse broader and deeper locks. On average, transit through the newer locks uses 50-60 million gallons of fresh water compared to 40-50 million gallons for the older locks. Moreover, salt water has crept into the lakes that feed the locks while human consumption has increased. Nevertheless, the newer technology allows recycling as much as 60% of the water.

Water management is a challenge. It may require building more reservoirs, new desalination projects, or diverting water from nearby rivers. ""However, increased warming leads to more evaporation, decreasing water availability,"" says Jeff Hall, a scientist with Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, during a hike through the Agua Salud Project. ""There has been an increased frequency of droughts in this part of the world, which leads to water uncertainty and potentially less transit.""

How does a drought affect the rainforests that provide water to the local lakes? Some trees tolerate the lack of rainfall, while others do not. That creates a system of winners and losers, underscoring the importance of diversity.

""A monoculture could die out, and the whole forest could collapse,"" says Hall. ""Diverse forests can survive. Forests have helped preserve the integrity of the canal watershed by preventing ecological disasters such as floods and providing water to the canal during the dry season.""

But when a drought is combined with extreme heat, it is a lethal one-two combo. Trees and plants take in water and release it into the atmosphere, delivering it worldwide. If they die, it means longer dry seasons. The rainforests further absorb atmospheric CO2. Without those trees, that CO2 is released back into the atmosphere.

""Warming doesn't happen in isolation,"" says Martijn Slot, a research biologist with the Smithsonian's institute, as we were on a crane above the canopy. ""It is often combined with droughts."" The result? ""The rate at which plants absorb CO2 tends to decrease while the rate at which CO2 is lost increases.""

The CO2 compounding effect is apparent. Since the industrial age, we have released increasing amounts of heat-trapping emissions. Almost every climate scientist agrees that humans have contributed to global warming. Consequently, temperatures increased by 1.1 degrees Celsius in 2023. If fossil fuel usage and deforestation rates remain unchanged, we will hit 1.5 degrees Celsius in 2030, resulting in more extreme weather patterns.

The Panama Canal's operators and the scientists who monitor the adjacent rainforests implicitly understand their symbiotic relationship.

Protecting the forests is a critical step in managing water resources and capturing CO2. When there is insufficient rainfall, trees act like sponges, releasing water into the canal's lakes. On the other hand, forests can also slow down the movement of water and prevent flooding. Global warming endangers that association.

Steve Paton, director of physical monitoring for the Smithsonian's institute, emphasizes the importance of rainforest preservation and decarbonization, stating, ""We can't wait for things to get worse. The cost of not taking action is too great.""

Climate change could upend Panama's economy, but it is hellbent on protecting its trees -- benefitting the entire planet. Indeed, the country's well-being is closely tied to the Panama Canal and the neighboring rainforests. Together, the two foster sustainable development and national wealth while contributing to the global economy and eco-viability.

Reporter's Note: This is the second in a series of three stories I have done on Panama. Here's the first one that profiles Panama's environmental and economic goals. The third one, which runs in a week, will focus on measuring rainforest preservation -- a key step in the quest to attract financing."
Forecasters Predict Tepid Holiday Sales Growth as Consumers Lean In to Austerity,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregpetro/2024/10/07/forecasters-predict-tepid-holiday-sales-growth-as-consumers-lean-in-to-austerity/,2024-10-07T13:05:56Z,"Consumer sentiment has ticked up, but forecasts for Q4 retail sales see only modest growth as shoppers trim their budgets.

The retail industry begins its annual fourth-quarter dash to the end of its fiscal year (Jan. 30), with the majority of consumers planning to spend the same or less on gifts compared to last year. Overall, industry forecasters predict decelerating sales growth this year, despite a recent rebound in the widely-followed University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment.

Regardless of whether the economy achieves a soft landing or avoids a recession, consumers are still adjusting to the stubbornly high costs of major living expenses, such as housing, cars, and insurance. Across several recent consumer surveys, a common theme emerges -- consumer confidence in the future is rising, but so are credit card debt and financial stress.

In a survey of 1,300 shoppers across the US, Canada, and the UK, 9 out of 10 (a full 90%) said they expect to spend 50% less on holiday gifts this year compared to 2023, according to project44, a logistics technology vendor.

A recent survey by Bankrate, a financial services platform, found that 33% of holiday shoppers plan to spend less this year, and another 43% plan to spend about the same. Consumers are embracing frugality, says Bankrate senior analyst Ted Rossman, because ""multiple years of high inflation and high interest rates have taken a considerable toll.""

The Bankrate survey also found that older generations ""are more likely to feel stretched thin during the holiday season."" A third of Gen X holiday shoppers said gift shopping will strain their budgets, while only one in five Gen Z respondents said the same.

Accounting network PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) reported similar results. Nearly 30% of respondents in its survey expect to spend less this season than last, marking a new high. A quarter of respondents said they will spend more, which -- except for pandemic-era 2020 -- was the lowest PwC has ever recorded.

The National Retail Federation, which has a strong track record for forecasting industry revenue, is projecting full-year fiscal 2025 sales growth of between 2.5% and 3.5%, down from fiscal 2024's final tally of 3.8%. While this might seem like a small number, it's based on a very large industry base.

Beneath the top line, there will be the usual suspects that outperform and those that lose ground or disappear. Walmart is projecting sales growth of up to 4.75% for the current year, and Amazon.com's e-commerce sales are expected to grow by more than 10%.

At the bottom of the list, companies that are perennially struggling include department store brands like Macy's and Neiman Marcus, apparel chains like Express Inc., and big-box hardware stores like Lowe's and Home Depot, along with some surprises like Nike.

One can only wonder how consumers feel about each of these companies' product offerings and why they are winning or losing."
Council Post: The Hidden Impact Of Fees On Inflation -- And What It Means For Businesses,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/10/07/the-hidden-impact-of-fees-on-inflation-and-what-it-means-for-businesses/,2024-10-07T13:01:45Z,"Inflation is a complex phenomenon influenced by many factors, from global supply chain disruptions to labor shortages. However, another often overlooked contributor is subtly driving prices higher across various sectors: fees.

These fees can take many forms -- service fees, convenience fees, processing fees -- and while they may seem insignificant in isolation, their cumulative effect can be profound, especially when considered across an entire industry or economy.

Take the facilities management industry, for example, where I operate daily. We see how hidden fees accumulate and significantly increase operational costs. From contract management fees to technology charges, these can sneak into agreements and strain company budgets.

Such fees are often passed down the supply chain, ultimately affecting pricing strategies and inflating costs for consumers. In retail, we've seen similar impacts, where incremental fees are contributing to the rising cost of goods and services.

The Proliferation Of Fees In Modern Business

In recent years, fees have become ubiquitous, tacked onto everything from airline tickets to hotel stays and banking services to utility bills and healthcare services. Companies often justify these fees as necessary to cover the costs of new technology, comply with regulations or provide additional services. However, many of these fees are more about padding the bottom line than covering actual costs.

An example is the rise of swipe fees in the retail sector. When consumers use a credit or debit card to make a purchase, banks and card networks like Visa and Mastercard charge retailers a ""swipe fee"" to process the transaction. The implementation of these fees, which average just over 2% of the transaction, has skyrocketed over the past two decades: Total swipe fees in the U.S. have grown from about $20 billion in 2001 to $172 billion in 2023.

The Ripple Effect On Prices

When companies pass on fees to consumers, the immediate impact is an increase in the price of goods and services. But the ripple effect goes beyond retail consumers.

It also affects the B2B environment, where businesses are not immune to the growing prevalence of hidden fees. As organizations encounter higher costs due to fees in areas like payment processing, shipping and vendor contracts, these costs are often passed along to other businesses in the supply chain, eventually reaching consumers.

In retail and B2B settings, these incremental fees can create a cycle of rising costs. In B2B transactions, where pricing can be complex, fees further complicate the financial landscape, squeezing margins and straining budgets. Whether a company is a direct consumer-facing business or a B2B provider, these rising operational costs can drive inflationary pressures that affect everyone down the line. Ultimately, even cautious and well-informed companies and consumers pay more as these fees accumulate.

Facilities Management: A Case Study In Hidden Fees

In facilities management (FM), fees are a pervasive issue. For example, backend fees -- such as per-work-order charges, implementation fees and support fees for data downloads and tailored reporting -- often add up across multiple service agreements.

At my company, we have encountered these costs frequently, and I think it's clear that a lack of transparency in such contracts can quickly inflate operational expenses. Many companies managing multi-location facilities have found themselves blindsided by unexpected charges that quietly accumulate into significant annual expenses.

Strategies For Transparency And Efficiency

Clients and consumers today are increasingly savvy, often scrutinizing the costs and fees associated with their services. Many seek value and transparency and quickly switch providers if they feel they're being overcharged.

However, when an entire industry collectively adopts practices that involve adding or increasing fees, the options for avoiding these costs become limited. This collective action can lead to widespread cost increases, impacting everyone, regardless of their choices.

Over the years, I have learned that businesses can combat these rising costs through a variety of strategies. Here are a few to consider:

1. Audit existing contracts regularly. Conduct regular audits of contracts to identify hidden fees. Many businesses miss recurring charges because they assume all fees are necessary. An audit helps reveal unnecessary or redundant fees that can be renegotiated or eliminated.

2. Establish clear upfront pricing. Ensure that pricing structures are clear and transparent from the outset, both internally and for clients. By listing all potential costs upfront, businesses can avoid unpleasant surprises later in the process. This practice helps build trust and reinforces long-term client relationships.

3. Consider automation to reduce labor costs. Automating repetitive processes, such as invoice management or payment processing, can reduce the labor costs associated with fee management. At my company, we've integrated platforms that streamline operations, thereby avoiding unnecessary tech and service fees.

4. Negotiate terms with vendors. If a vendor's service fees seem inflated or unnecessary, negotiate for more favorable terms. Explain the impact of hidden fees on your bottom line and leverage volume agreements to secure better terms.

A Broader Perspective

The issue of fees and their contribution to inflation reminds us that the costs we encounter as consumers and businesses are often more complex than they appear. While fees may be justified in some cases, their widespread and sometimes opaque application can have unintended consequences for the broader economy.

Given the above, and with rising costs across sectors, it is more important than ever for businesses to investigate alternative solutions and cost models that reduce or eliminate unnecessary fees. By understanding the role fees play in driving up prices, we can make more informed decisions by advocating for greater transparency, choosing service providers that prioritize efficiency or simply being more aware of the actual costs behind our prices.

In the end, I think controlling inflation isn't just about managing the big-ticket items; it's also about keeping an eye on the small fees that can have a significant impact.

Earnings Kickoff And World Conflicts Highlight The Week,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/07/earnings-kickoff-and-world-conflicts-highlight-the-week/,2024-10-07T12:47:57Z,"Oil Surge And Inflation Fears Threaten Economic Stability And Markets

A stronger than expected jobs report on Friday further eased fears of a slowing economy and allowed markets to stage impressive rallies to end the week. The S&P 500 closed higher by 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2%. For the week; however, markets were little changed. That came despite a wide trading range overall. As we head into this week, the expected move in the S&P 500 is 86 points, which means we could see a total trading range even bigger than last week.

It's going to be a data heavy week with much of it being of the qualitative variety. Fed members will be speaking throughout the week but what I think will be most interesting is the release of minutes from the last Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, due out Wednesday. These will be the minutes from the meeting at which the Fed decided to cut rates by half a point. With another Fed meeting not scheduled until November, I think a lot of investors are eager for a closer view into the last meeting and what members were thinking moving forward. I think this is especially true in the wake of Friday's jobs report and the response out of the bond market where we've seen yields on the 10-year note climb back above 4% for the first time since August. Then later in the week, on Thursday and Friday, we'll get the most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports.

Also on Friday, we'll kick off earnings season. JP Morgan and Wells Fargo are both scheduled to announce earnings and each bank offers a slightly nuanced view into the health of the economy. JP Morgan will likely discuss the health of consumers, spending habits and credit card debt. Wells Fargo often provides a look into the housing sector given their presence in the mortgage market.

As we prepare for a deluge of earnings over the next few weeks, it's worth noting the expectations for the quarter have fallen. At the end of June, estimates for third quarter earnings were a growth rate of 7.8% on a year-over-year basis. However, those estimates have since fallen and now stand at 4.2%, according to FactSet. While it is common to see estimates revised downward, these revisions are slightly larger than the average drop of around 3.3%. It's also worth noting that the S&P 500 is currently trading at 21.4x its expected 12-month forward-looking earnings, which is above its historical 10-year average of 18x and 5-year average of 19.5x. In other words, much like we saw at the end of the second quarter, stocks are fundamentally valued at levels above their norm.

The revised earnings growth rates and fundamental valuations may also explain the tempered enthusiasm for company stock purchases by insiders. An article in today's Wall Street Journal says insider purchases by officers and directors were at their lowest level in a decade. While purchases upticked in August and September, they are still below their 10-year average.

In addition to the economic news and earnings, we also have a couple other externalities that could make their way into the market this week. Oil, which was up 1% on Friday and 8% for the week, is something I'll be watching as the world continues to await possible continued escalation between Israel and Iran. Also, back here at home, we are less than thirty days away from the election and I would not be surprised if we see market volatility hold its current level of even increase as the election nears.

A couple individual stocks worth watching today include Chevron and Pfizer. Chevron is selling off some Canadian assets as part of a plan intended to divest between $10 to $15 billion by 2028. That stock is higher by just over 1% in premarket. Shares of Pfizer are higher by nearly 3% in premarket after it was announced that activist investor Starboard Value has taken a $1 billion position in the company.

For today, I am keeping my eye on oil and any news out of the Middle East. I think markets are already bracing for the economic data and upcoming earnings, but the geopolitical situation is the wildcard I'm most focused on. No one is entirely sure what response to expect from Israel and I think that adds a bit of volatility that's more difficult to quantify. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."
"Consumers Start Holiday Shopping Early, But High Prices On Essentials Drives Cutbacks",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sharonedelson/2024/10/07/consumers-start-holiday-shopping-early-but-high-prices-on-essentials-drives-cutbacks/,2024-10-07T12:31:16Z,"It's not even Halloween yet, but consumers already have Christmas on the brain. They're concerned about how prices of essentials will affect their budgets. In a survey by ESW, 61% said they'll spend more than $600 this holiday season, compared to 48% last year. Of the people who are spending less, about 47% said the high price of food and fuel will lead them to reduce spending.

""Even though global inflation is coming down, many consumers are still feeling stretched due to high essentials costs,"" said Martim Avillez Oliveira, chief revenue officer of ESW, a leader in direct to consumer ecommerce.

According to the survey, 37% of consumers have started their shopping journeys. As expected, Amazon Prime Deal Days and Black Friday are expected to be the biggest deal days of the season, with Cyber Monday coming in third place.

""Black Friday is where consumers plan to spend more money, and focus on deals and value,"" said Oliveira. ""We think global uncertainty isn't healthy for the economy. We're seeing that consumers will spend more, even though price and value was top of mind.""

From an intent perspective, consumers will spend more this holiday season, said Oliveira. Online will continue to grow, which means there are additional opportunities for online retailers to capture market share.

AI is going to be everywhere from physical to digital channels, smoothing store efficiencies and curating online experiences for shoppers. ESW found that 43% of consumers will shop more online.

""Retailers will have to make sure they have different promotions and loyalty schemes,"" Oliveira said. ""It's critical to understand who your customer is. Free shipping is now table stakes. In addition to free shipping, free returns are popular. We'll see free returns and other promotional activity like gifts-with-purchase and product bundles that consumers will expect from their preferred brands.""

ESW unlocks the local DTC channel for retailers. ""If you're a brand and want to capture or trial your product to international audiences, ESW acts as a merchant of record,"" Oliveira said. ""The brand can shift any liabilities and compliance requirements to the merchant of record [ESW].

Shopping cuts across demographic lines. For example, 51% of all consumers said they won't use TikTok for shopping, however, when broken down by age, 65% of millennials and Gen Z combined said they'll use TikTok for inspiration.

What categories will be popular? According to Oliveira, beauty will resonate with consumers, and ""private label will be able to stand out this year and gain more market share just because of the sensitivity and how price-conscious shoppers will be this season.""

In addition to free shipping, Oliveira sees omnichannel as table stakes this holiday season. ""That's a seamless commerce experience,""he said. """"For retailers, finding their most cost-effective routes to get their goods to the consumer will be important. And making sure they plan their inventory and their pools of stock according to where the demand lives, both domesticaally and internationally. From our perspective localizing inventory, making sure you have, for example, the right product, the right sizes and the right promotions, will be key."""
How EPC Firms Are Helping The Energy Sector Do 'More With Less',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gauravsharma/2024/10/07/how-epc-firms-are-helping-the-energy-sector-do-more-with-less/,2024-10-07T11:40:21Z,"As the energy industry embraces increasing calls for more efficiency, decarbonization and adoption of environmentally friendly business practices, they are increasingly turning to their engineering, procurement, and construction or EPC partners to replicate that in the built environment.

With large scale energy, oil and gas projects being a critical part of their business, EPC companies also appear to be embracing the challenge effectively turning into ""EPCM"" outfits, with the ""M"" incorporating management services as part of their broader client offering.

EPCM contracts now routinely involve sustainability targets, circularity or circular economy tenets and environmentally friendly practices in the construction and procurement value chain, according to research conducted by EY, based on its study 30 leading firms in the segment.

Furthermore, EY also notes that new global regulatory requirements will likely compel EPCM companies to disclose information about their own greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks in tandem with the sponsors of the projects they happen to be working on.

Nobody in the industry has any illusions about the scale of such a challenge. That too in an operating climate that until very recently saw EPCM companies clobbered by high inflation and interest rates whilst facing the constant age-old clamor for on time and on budget energy project delivery.

To manage the turbulence, many turned to technology and digital tools to the point that what once a subtle shift has now become routine.

Artificial intelligence, the industrial internet of things, robotics, construction data analytics, 3D and 4D printing, drones, virtual reality and augmented reality are all playing a vital role in enabling the EPCM segment become more efficient and sustainable across the life-cycle of the project, according to Chris Ashton, CEO of Worley, one of the largest companies operating in the segment.

""These digital tools are disrupting ways of working as they are deployed, leading to a reduction in time on repetitive tasks. And we see the development of digital platforms, the digital accelerant, as critical enablers to create trust amongst stakeholders and drive faster, more efficient project processes to move forward at speed,"" Ashton said.

He also appeared unfazed by the fact that some investments in emerging technologies carries the near-term risk of failure.

""We're regularly investing and are open to fail fast as we learn and pivot if roadblocks appear; leveraging advancements in information technologies; tapping into our global expertise, using standardized tools and processes to reduce costs and increase capital efficiency; and truly working in partnership with our customers to deeply understand their strategic plans for the future.""

According to EY, despite economic head winds, capital flows in construction technology or ConTech came in at just under $5.7 billion in 2022. Further growth is expected when latest data is available early in 2025.

An evolving built environment within the energy sector inevitably requires construction equipment partners to also respond in kind and they are, said Gavin Kerr, Director Global of Services at Mammoet, the world's largest engineered heavy lifting and transport company.

""We own and operate most of the world's largest cranes, and large jacking systems and transporters that are specialized to lift the heaviest loads built by humanity. Recognizing the growing need for efficiency and sustainability in EPCM segment, we recently launched the world's strongest land-based crane - the SK6000.""

It has a maximum capacity of 6,000 tons and can lift components of up to 3,000 tons, roughly the weight of six Airbus A380 super-jumbo aircraft, to a height of 220 meters.

""Such a capacity allows for critical components to be simultaneously built offsite anywhere in the world, before being transported to the actual project site ahead of installation. This potentially allows our EPC customers to build efficiently in larger pieces and shrink their project logistics, integration and mobilization phases in the construction cycle,"" Kerr added.

Ultimately, it is all about helping project developers reach first power generation or first hydrocarbon production sooner.

The evolving climate has resulted in EPCM companies and equipment makers becoming co-drivers of industry change for their project partners. Nowhere is it more visible than at industry trade shows and exhibitions in general, and ADIPEC in Abu Dhabi in particular. Regularly billed as the world's largest energy event of its kind, it attracts nearly 200,000 attendees every year.

Among its over 2,000 exhibitors will be 30 of world's largest EPCM companies and energy construction equipment makers of all shapes and sizes jostling for attention at a 155,000 square foot facility.

How EPCM corporate exhibits, displays and business pitches to world have evolved over the year offer ample proof of ""changing times"" according to Christopher Hudson, President of dmg events, an organizer of over 30 global energy events in a typical calendar year including ADIPEC.

""When we look at ADIPEC and go back as recently as ten years ago, it was primarily an oilfield services show. But since then, it has gradually transformed into a broader energy show with many, dare I say most, participants making their displays more cognizant of need to address the energy sector's efficiency and sustainability challenge,"" Hudson said.

""It feels different for us as platform creators. Even as recently as 10 years ago, you'd see very traditional exhibition booths of 100 sq meters with a drill bit here, a lifting equipment display and generator model there. Now it's far more technology driven with often two to three level stands, pods and meeting rooms.

And not only that, the EPCM exhibition boot of today also highlight specific technology and efficiency gains that can be achieved from energy project conception to completion - to produce on one level and generate at another level and how you split within that supply chain at, Hudson added.

""There is a clear reason for this. The major energy companies need to invest heavily in sustainability and decarbonization remains a key ADIPEC theme - something that 12 leading energy CEOs committed to in Abu Dhabi in 2023. The EPCM segment is key if this is to be achieved, and we see firms operating in the sphere adapting to opportunities presented by an evolving climate, something that's reflected in their displays and exhibits.""

Doing 'more with less' - or in other words achieving improved throughput / energy generation, doing so sustainably and whist using less energy - has become imperative for the industry. Therefore, ditching the old way of doing things is both mission critical and commercially logically for the EPCM segment and research strongly points to it, says Worley's CEO Ashton.

""Our thought leadership work with Princeton University Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment shows us that executing projects the same way we always have will not get us to net zero by 2050. In fact, we won't even get halfway. So we must change, and are changing, how we traditionally deliver projects.""

Ashton added that energy project sponsors are balancing strategic investments supporting their move to a lower carbon future and at the same time managing shareholder, investor, and society's environmental and sustainability expectations with the complex capital management, regulatory and jurisdictional frameworks within which they operate.

""Over the past five years, we've seen our customers shift to partner with Worley, to share their strategic plans and work together to drive down costs while delivering projects in new and innovative ways. And by working in partnership with our customers on their vast portfolios of projects, we're delivering real, life-time value across their assets.""

This will in all probability accelerate in a fiercely competitive post-pandemic EPCM market."
How Data From Space Is Transforming Mobility Services,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwyman/2024/10/07/how-data-from-space-is-transforming-mobility-services/,2024-10-07T11:38:28Z,"The satellite industry has been transformed in recent years from one with a few, mostly government-controlled, high-orbit vehicles into one with a proliferation of smaller, low-orbit constellations of multiple satellites dominated by commercial enterprises. All that has given the global economy and mobility systems in particular access to new data and applications that are leading to major efficiencies in the operation of various networks and ultimately better service for end users.. They include everything from systems that monitor airport operations and provide dynamic roadway traffic management to automated rail and public transport services that enable automated ticketing and trip planning. By our estimates, these markets should see annual growth of 5% to 10% through 2030, but they need more players with vision to realize their true potential.

Space-based mobility systems are ushering in not only a new era of data availability but also a new ecosystem of providers looking to replace current capabilities. The new players are operating in such areas as fleet management, advanced driver assistance systems, public transport, emergency assistance, insurance telematics, bike sharing, and congestion control, and as space-based data collection expands so do the possibilities for new services. Space-based technologies is one of nine megatrends analyzed in our 2024 report on sustainable mobility, ""Fast-Tracking The Mobility Revolution,"" written in collaborations with mobility and infrastructure operator

The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) -- constellations that provide positioning, navigation, and timing data for a host of transportation networks and individual vehicles -- has spawn new technology and services markets that already total over $460 billion Mundys SpA.

A plethora of space-based data possibilities

GNSS data has been available to the public free of charge for years. But two innovations have opened new possibilities for its use. First, the ability to process data has significantly improved. Next, there has been a steep reduction in the cost of launching satellites, leading to the creation of more privately held constellations and the ability to collect even more accurate data. Couple that with the higher expectations of mobility consumers for personalized services and the development of new data-driven mobility solutions using space data seems an inevitability.

By far, the two biggest segments for these new services are consumer applications in tourism and healthcare, including fitness apps, and road and automotive management. They make up more than 90% of today's space-based mobility services marketplace. For instance, the big users or potential users in automotive and roadway management are fleet operators, traffic enforcement, toll collection, insurance companies, and car owners themselves.

But the market is changing rapidly as more companies become knowledgeable about the data-collection possibilities in space. If there is one thing holding growth back, it's this lack of awareness of the possibilities among enterprises with the wherewithal to develop them.

New markets opening up

One of the newest sectors to enter the fray is aviation. Here, real-time data collected from satellites can prove an immense enhancement of navigational and weather monitoring capabilities. For airports, the space data is providing accurate positioning data for improved air traffic management and flight navigation, forecasting weather conditions, and enabling real-time communication between aircraft and ground control, even in remote areas.

Most of these are only on the cusp of reaching commercial scale. When they do, there is likely to be a good deal of market disruption for those not accessing the endless data space provides. Ultimately, space-based data could be the artificial intelligence of the next decade if companies can expand their vision on the possibilities."
"Mortgage Rates Today: October 7, 2024 -- Rates Move Up",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-10-07-24/,2024-10-07T11:32:12Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

The current average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.82%, according to Curinos. The average rate on a 15-year mortgage is 5.96%, while the average rate on a 30-year jumbo mortgage is 6.87%.

Today, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage is 6.82%, compared to last week when it was 6.67%.

The annual percentage rate (APR) on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is 6.84%. The APR was 6.67% last week. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

With today's interest rate of 6.82%, a 30-year fixed mortgage of $100,000 costs approximately $653 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included), the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. Borrowers will pay about $135,077 in total interest over the life of the loan.

Today, the 15-year mortgage rate sits at 5.96%, higher than it was at this time yesterday. Last week, it was 5.69%.

The APR on a 15-year fixed is 5.99%. It was 5.72% this time last week.

At today's interest rate of 5.96%, a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage would cost approximately $842 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. You would pay around $51,515 in total interest over the life of the loan.

The current average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage is 6.87% -- 0.12 percentage point up from last week. The 30-year jumbo mortgage rate had a 52-week APR low of 5.50% and a 52-week high of 10.50%.

A 30-year jumbo mortgage at today's fixed interest rate of 6.87% will cost you $657 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. On a $750,000 jumbo mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment would be approximately $4,924.

The first step on your homebuying journey should be to calculate affordability. You'll want to find out how much you can afford based on things like income, debt and savings.

Here are a few important factors that go into home affordability:

The annual percentage rate (APR) represents a loan's interest rate and fees, expressed as an annual cost over the life of the loan. It's essentially the all-in cost of the loan.

The APR is a helpful number because it shows you the total cost of a mortgage if you keep it the entire term.

Multiple factors affect the interest rate for a mortgage, including the economy's overall health, benchmark interest rates and borrower-specific factors.

The Federal Reserve's rate decisions and inflation can influence rates to move higher or lower. Although the Fed raising rates doesn't directly cause mortgage rates to rise, an increase to its benchmark interest rate makes it more expensive for banks to lend money to consumers. Conversely, rates tend to decrease during periods of rate cuts and cooling inflation.

Home buyers can make several moves to improve their finances and qualify for competitive rates. One is having a good or excellent credit score, which ranges from 670 to 850. Another is maintaining a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio below 43%, which implies less risk of being unable to afford the monthly mortgage payment.

Further, making a minimum 20% down payment can help you avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI) on conventional home loans. If you can afford the larger monthly payment, 15-year home loans have lower rates than a 30-year term.

Conventional home loans are issued by private lenders and typically require good or excellent credit and a minimum 20% down payment to get the best rates. Some lenders offer first-time home buyer loans and grants with relaxed down payment requirements as low as 3%.

For buyers with limited credit or finances, a government-backed loan is usually the better option as the minimum loan requirements are easier to satisfy.

For example, FHA loans can require 3.5% down with a minimum credit score of 580 or at least 10% down with a credit score between 500 and 579. However, upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums can apply for the life of the loan.

Buyers in eligible rural areas with a moderate income or lower may also consider USDA loans. This program doesn't require a down payment, but you pay an upfront and annual guarantee fee for the life of the loan.

If you come from a qualifying military background, VA loans can be your best option. First, you don't need to make a down payment in most situations. Second, borrowers pay a one-time funding fee but don't pay an annual fee as the FHA and USDA loan programs require."
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: October 7, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-10-07-24/,2024-10-07T11:31:44Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are going down. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Shopping for an account where you can put some money aside? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are notorious for paying puny interest rates. But if you know where to look, you can find rates 10x higher. Several online banks and credit unions pay rates that are far more competitive than those offered by brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you spot a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.23%, Curinos says. Last week, it was 0.24%. APY, or annual percentage yield, reflects the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts generally pay considerably higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the thing to know is you may have to jump through some hoops for the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.89%. You'll be in good shape if you can find an account offering a rate close to 4.89%. Last week at this time, the best rate was 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's about the same as last week's APY.

If you're shopping around for a traditional savings account, high-yield savings account or MMA, you'll want to remember a few key points.

A great interest rate is important, but it's not the only factor that matters when picking an account to hold your savings. Another major consideration is whether the account has a minimum deposit -- and whether you can come up with the cash.

You'll also want to understand the fees. Savings accounts can come with monthly maintenance fees, excess transaction fees (if you ignore limits on withdrawals) and other pesky charges that can bite into your returns.

And before you open an account, look into a financial institution's reputation and safety. You should trust your bank or credit union and feel like you're in good hands. Read the reviews, see what account holders have to say about customer service and learn about how the financial institution responds to consumer questions.

Search for an account that's insured by the FDIC or, in the case of credit unions, the NCUA. Those federal agencies provide up to $250,000 in insurance per depositor and per bank for each account ownership category.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
SAP BrandVoice: How To Create A Strategy To Reduce Youth Unemployment,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2024/10/07/how-to-create-a-strategy-to-reduce-youth-unemployment/,2024-10-07T11:28:18Z,"The global education goal, part of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), remains significantly off track. Various reports, including from UNESCO and UN news, highlight the concerning trend that unless drastic changes occur the world will not meet its commitments to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education by 2030.

The world today is grappling with a polycrisis - a complex set of interconnected global challenges that impact economies, industries, and job markets simultaneously. From climate change and geopolitical tensions to technological disruptions and economic instability, these crises are reshaping the landscape of work, especially for young people. While youth unemployment remains high, employers worldwide are also struggling to fill critical roles, highlighting a significant skills gap.

According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), global youth unemployment was 13% in 2023, with many young people facing limited prospects for stable and decent work. On the flip side, the World Economic Forum (WEF) found that 44% of businesses report difficulties in finding talent with the right skills to fill jobs. This contrast reflects a deepening mismatch between the supply of young job seekers and the demand for skilled talent, which, if left unaddressed, will exacerbate both unemployment and the talent shortage.

To tackle this challenge, we must take a comprehensive, systems-based approach, focusing on five interconnected elements: economy, education, employability, equality, and the ecosystem. Together, these factors can help close the skills gap, reduce youth unemployment, and create pathways to decent work for all.

Economic growth remains a critical driver of job creation, but the quality and inclusivity of that growth matter. In many parts of the world, jobless growth has become a pressing concern, as economies expand without generating enough formal employment opportunities for young people. Youth unemployment continues to rise even in nations with positive GDP growth, indicating that inclusive economic policies and investment in key sectors are lacking (ILO, 2024).

Moreover, the alignment between economic growth and investment in education is critical. The Global Education Monitoring Report 2023 highlights that national budgets for education often fall short of the recommended 4%-6% of GDP that UNESCO advocates. Without adequate financial support, education systems cannot provide the skills and competencies needed to prepare young people for modern job markets, leaving many young workers without the necessary tools to succeed.

Education systems need to evolve to meet the changing demands of the workforce. The OECD - OCDE emphasizes the importance of embedding skills, knowledge, attitudes, and values into education systems to ensure that young people are prepared for lifelong learning. In particular, stackable credentials - modular qualifications that allow learners to build expertise over time - are becoming an essential component of successful education-to-employment transitions.

For more information on how SAP is helping the world run better and improving people's lives all year round, visit sap.com/csr

Despite the need for adaptable learning pathways, many education systems remain rigid and slow to adopt these models. However, countries that have embraced flexible learning, such as Germany with its robust vocational education and training (VET) programs, have been able to reduce youth unemployment significantly. The integration of industry-specialized learning and competency-based education is critical for preparing young people to thrive in an evolving workforce, particularly in sectors like technology and sustainability.

One of the most significant barriers to reducing youth unemployment is the skills mismatch - the gap between what young people learn and what employers need. The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2023 projects that 50% of employees will need reskilling by 2025 due to rapid technological advancements. Yet, traditional education systems are often not aligned with industry needs, leaving many young workers without the skills required for high-growth sectors.

Governments and businesses must collaborate to ensure that training programs are directly linked to market demand. Public-private partnerships, such as apprenticeship programs and industry-led training initiatives, can play a pivotal role in closing the skills gap. For example, in Switzerland, where education and training are tightly integrated with the labor market, youth unemployment is among the lowest in the world. Building a system that continually adapts to changing workforce needs is essential for improving youth employability.

Recent trends show that many young people increasingly prefer entrepreneurship over traditional employment, driven by the desire for independence and the ability to create change. A 2019 study by Deloitte found that 76% of millennials view entrepreneurship as a key vehicle for driving social impact. However, research highlights the need for robust support systems to help these young entrepreneurs succeed.

The 2021 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor emphasizes that access to entrepreneurial education, mentorship, and skill development is critical for youth to thrive in their ventures.

Any strategy to reduce youth unemployment must prioritize equality, ensuring that opportunities are equally accessible to all young people, regardless of their background, gender, or location. Despite advances in education, women and marginalized communities continue to face barriers to entry in high-growth industries, particularly in STEM fields. According to UNESCO, only 35% of STEM graduates are women, highlighting the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

Programs that specifically target underrepresented groups - such as mentorships and women-in-tech initiatives - can help diversify the talent pipeline. Furthermore, companies that emphasize inclusive hiring practices, gender parity, and equity in leadership are not only contributing to social justice but also benefiting from a more innovative and dynamic workforce. The data is clear: promoting diversity is a strategic advantage in the modern economy.

A thriving job market requires more than just a functioning economy and well-prepared workers - it needs a cohesive ecosystem where governments, businesses, educational institutions, and civil society work together efficiently. The OECD underscores the importance of synergy across the value chain, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned toward the goal of reducing unemployment and fostering decent work.

Successful models of ecosystem collaboration, like those seen in Singapore, offer valuable lessons for other nations. In these countries, the government plays a central role in orchestrating cooperation between educational institutions and industries to ensure that young people are being trained in fields that are projected to grow. Such synergies foster an environment where young people can transition smoothly from education to employment and where employers can easily find the talent they need.

As respective leaders, SAP and UNICEF join forces to create innovative solutions to global skilling and workforce challenges with an aim to help young people transition to earning. Together, we're generating inclusive opportunities for underserved young people worldwide, preparing them for decent work with the skills that employers need.

We expanded our partnership in 2022, with a three-year investment focused on impacting youth in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa through a new program that supports learning to earning pathways in growing digital and green economies. The program helps equip youth with the essential skills they need to flourish - wherever they may see their future. Further, it builds on UNICEF's Generation Unlimited (GenU) signature program, Youth Agency Marketplace (YOMA), a platform developed by young Africans to tackle labor market challenges and increase youth agency across the globe.

By the end of the first year, SAP and UNICEF's GenU reached more than 600,000 youth, granting them access to foundational and digital skills opportunities that help young people unlock opportunities in the changing global economy.

One of the learn to earn pathways on YOMA is the SAP Educate to Employ initiative designed by SAP to help equip beneficiaries with essential competencies for the digital economy. The free initiative, implemented by the local non-profit UMUZI, focuses on developing skills, knowledge, attitudes, and values to help prepare candidates for employment.

It also aims to assist employers in accessing diverse and certified talent, thereby accelerating digital transformation in each country through a skilled talent pipeline. More than 1,000 learners completed one or more foundational skills courses, while 165 learners completed over 400 hours of critical skills development training and achieved an SAP certification for technology consultant beginners. Additionally, 100 learners have completed their intermediate training on the SAP Learning site and are preparing for SAP-certified associate exams.

This multistakeholder approach underscores the power of partnership in addressing complex social challenges. By pooling expertise and resources, SAP, UNICEF's GenU, and UMUZI are collectively ensuring that youth not only gain relevant skills but also access meaningful pathways to employment. These partnerships exemplify the collaborative frameworks needed to drive sustainable impact on a global scale. As digital and green economies continue to reshape the future of work, partnerships that unite private, public, and civil society actors will remain crucial in ensuring that marginalized youth are not left behind.

The polycrisis we face today demands multidimensional solutions that address both the supply and demand sides of the labor market. By focusing on the interconnected elements of economy, education, employability, equality, and ecosystem, we can create a comprehensive strategy to reduce youth unemployment and foster decent work for all.

Policymakers, business leaders, and educators must come together to close the skills gap, promote inclusive growth, and build resilient labor markets. The challenges are great, but so are the opportunities. With coordinated effort and sustained investment, we can build a future where young people have the skills, opportunities, and support they need to thrive in the global economy."
Why We Need AI: Alphabet's Moonshot To Save The World's Electrical Grid,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsiegel/2024/10/07/why-we-need-ai-alphabets-moonshot-to-save-the-worlds-electrical-grid/,2024-10-07T11:28:08Z,"Humanity's largest machine is demanding an overhaul. We built this behemoth haphazardly and yet we rely on it absolutely. Now we must fix it.

The electrical grid is the vascular system of modern society -- but it wasn't originally designed for its current immense scale. Nor was it designed to evolve, as it must, to seamlessly assimilate an inpouring of clean energy sources like wind and solar.

This brewing crisis presents one of the highest-stakes challenges imaginable for infotech as a field: Across trillions of overtaxed, aging components -- most of which date back to the 1960s and 1970s -- which ones demand maintenance first?

Predictive AI to the rescue -- and boy do I mean it this time. Only with machine learning models will we be able to address this century's greatest global infrastructure crisis.

Google's parent company Alphabet has established a new paradigm to supercharge grid upkeep globally. Here's how the paradigm works -- with the help of AI -- and how it not only scales critical maintenance but also sets a foundation for the grid's next evolutionary development: full-scale support for clean energy.

Grid operators can't keep up. Most still perform inspections manually -- workers approach individual components, clipboard in hand. Staff can only inspect a small fraction of potentially rusty, broken or otherwise failing poles, pins and transformers.

To lead a sweeping high-tech overhaul of the global grid, an organization would need large-scale instrumentation resources, a brand reputation capable of rallying worldwide participation and an aptitude and appetite for attempting moonshots.

Enter the world's only ""moonshot factory,"" X, part of Alphabet and therefore a sister of Google. X's initiative to take on this and related energy challenges is called Tapestry, described as, ""Making the world's electric grid visible so everyone can access clean, reliable energy.""

To put eyes on the problem, X taps Google's immense image database originally collected for Street View -- you know, the panoramic, street-level perspectives you can access in Google Maps.

X is also exploring the advantages of new, customized image-collection efforts. It rejiggers the hardware developed to collect Street View images, mounting it on the vehicles of energy partners to roam their terrains and collect photos of their grid components. In the last couple of years, vehicles outfitted with this hardware have covered several thousand miles in -- for example -- Michigan, as part of a joint initiative with the state's largest energy utility, Consumers Energy.

Out of the frying pan and into the fire. This scaled-up monitoring provides ideal, centralized visibility -- but it's too much to look at. The problem is we don't know what the problem is. Among trillions of components, which ones have a defect or impending failure set to cause an outage -- or even a dangerous incident like a fire?

The antidote to information overload is predictive AI, the use of machine learning models to triage and prioritize. It's a rule of thumb for the Information Age: Warehousing data isn't enough. To leverage any newfound source of data, you've got to learn from it. Machine learning has become imperative.

By targeting maintenance right where it's needed most, predictive AI fortifies the grid. Once trained, ML models predictively score individual cases -- incoming field photos that may or may not reveal an impending issue -- which are then prioritized for human inspection. Acting on this great number of incoming images is largely a matter of establishing a strategic decision threshold so that the most urgent issues are properly flagged -- and yet not too many flags come in, overwhelming staff.

This predictive targeting parallels another X project, Bellwether, which informs first responders where to go after climate catastrophes. Bellwether uses AI to prioritize photos captured from aircraft, whereas Tapestry prioritizes photos captured from land vehicles.

The wins are in. Even after early deployments, Consumers Energy credits Tapestry with reducing massive outages by 11.2 minutes during 2022, according to testimony given to the Michigan Public Service Commission. Each of these minutes are estimated to cost the Michigan economy $3.6M.

As with many machine learning initiatives, manually labeling the data presents a bottleneck (although nowhere near the bottleneck of manually surveilling equipment out on the field with a clipboard). X must manually label thousands of images that reveal defects and it partners with the experts, system operators, to do so. ML needs these labeled examples -- along with non-defective examples as well. Crunching the numbers, it learns how to differentiate between positive and negative cases.

As Tapestry gains traction globally, it's enabling fruitful data-sharing cooperation between its customers. For example, Vector, which provides power to most of New Zealand's population, is benefiting from the work done with Michigan's Consumers Energy. After all, the two don't compete for business.

""This global cooperation works because some patterns are universal,"" Tapestry lead Page Crahan told me. Her team trained a model for Michigan and then tried it out on images from Auckland, New Zealand, where grid infrastructure looks entirely different, e.g., transformers are located on the ground rather than on a pole.

Amazingly, the model performed fairly well. ""The Michigan model identifies 84% of faults on poles and cross-arms in New Zealand,"" Crahan said. ""To take advantage of this international crossover, we're now developing a practice for tuning and repurposing models to transfer well across geographies. This scales our efforts by greatly reducing the investment needed to cover grids globally.""

Similar arrangements have emerged in other industries. For example, FICO's payment card fraud detection system, called Falcon, greatly benefits from shared data across a consortium of over 9,000 banks, all cooperating for the common good. Likewise, ""Flood behavior on the East Coast of the U.S. can be used to forecast floods on the West Coast,"" the lead for Bellwether told me.

The Tapestry project began only a few years ago, but this singular initiative is positioned to weave a new fabric of intercontinental energy management. Several other grid operators also have signed on as customers and more are in the pipeline.

But wait, there's more! All this grid monitoring doesn't only serve grid maintenance -- it also builds the foundational visibility needed for grid advancement and expansion. This addresses much longer-term, larger-scale concerns. Keeping the grid working is critical, but radically evolving it for a new future of energy is an even greater challenge. In my next article, I will continue with that part of the story."
"Beyond Meat Stock Has 24% YTD Decline, But Can Sentiment Change?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/07/beyond-meat-stock-has-24-ytd-decline-but-can-sentiment-change/,2024-10-07T11:07:25Z,"After almost a 24% decline this year, at the current price of around $6 per share, we believe Beyond Meat stock (NASDAQ: BYND), a plant-based meat alternative - is fairly priced. BYND stock has dropped from around $8 to $6 year-to-date, largely underperforming the broader indices, with the S&P growing about 20% over the same period. The company has been facing challenging revenue and considerable cash burn for about three years now - thanks to the combination of inflation, pandemic-related shifts in demand, and rising competition. Although it would be premature to declare Beyond Meat's stock as irreparable, the company's current trajectory suggests a challenging outlook with no clear escape from its detrimental cycle.

In Q2 2024, the company's revenue of $93 million was down almost 9% year-over-year (y-o-y), driven by a 14% decrease in the volume of products sold. BYND also saw its revenues decline somewhat moderately in Q2 from an -18% y-o-y decline in Q1, but again this is largely a function of prior-year comps easing as well. BYND scaled back on promotional trade discounts in the recent Q2. Along with price increases on certain products in the U.S., this resulted in a 6.1% increase in its net revenue per pound compared to the year-ago period, which includes a ~21% increase in its U.S. retail channel (largest segment) net revenue per pound. Thanks to this, the revenue declines softened in Q2 and gross margins made a major recovery. However, there are still several headwinds that continue to pressure BYND stock in the future. In the U.S., the company's distribution has maxed out, while inventory levels remain high. Moreover, the company is dealing with low plant utilization and lower product volume. The company also has a substantial amount of debt in its capital structure, which may become a meaningful risk factor in the current high-interest rate environment. BYND has $1.14 billion in debt (due in 2027) on its balance sheet and a limited cash runway of $145 million (down from $194 million at year-end 2023). All said, BYND's most pressing issues still have not been addressed.

Notably, BYND stock has performed worse than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were -48% in 2021, -81% in 2022, and -28% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period.

Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BYND face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?

Beyond Meat's gross margin turned negative in 2023 and 2022 compared to its positive gross margins of 25% in 2021 and 30% in 2020. It should be noted that the company achieved a 4.9% gross margin in Q1 2024 and showed a substantial improvement to 14.7% in Q2 2024. Price increases have helped in this improvement along with lower cost of goods sold per pound and higher net revenue per pound. In addition, the company's adjusted Q2 EBITDA came in at a loss of $23 million compared to a loss of $41 million in the year-ago period. Beyond Meat was able to bring its operating cash flow losses down to -$47.8 million so far, roughly half of the year-ago loss, driven by the gross margin expansion and reduction in operating expenses from headcount efficiencies.

We forecast Beyond Meat's Revenues to be $326 million for the fiscal year 2024, down 5% y-o-y. We now forecast revenue per share to come in at $5.07. Given the changes to our revenues and RPS forecast, we have revised our Beyond Meat's Valuation to $6 per share, based on a $5.07 expected RPS and a 1.2x P/S multiple for the fiscal year 2024 - almost in line with the current market price. Beyond Meat expects net revenues to be in the range of $320 million to $340 million in FY 2024, representing a decrease of approximately 7% to 1% compared to 2023. The company continues to anticipate operating expenses to be approximately $180 million to $190 million. Also, the company expects further gross margin progress across the balance of the year, reflecting the combined impact of more fully distributed pricing adjustments and continued moderation of promotional spending.

"Meta's New Creator Program: A Step Forward Or Too Little, Too Late?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianshepherd/2024/10/07/metas-new-creator-program-a-step-forward-or-too-little-too-late/,2024-10-07T10:58:35Z,"Meta has announced a significant overhaul of its creator monetization programs for Facebook. The tech giant is consolidating its three existing creator monetization schemes into a single, streamlined program. While this development promises to simplify the process for creators to earn money on the platform, there is a question of whether this effort goes far enough to compete with other social media giants, particularly YouTube, which I believe offers the best opportunities for creators.

The New Facebook Content Monetization Program

Meta's latest initiative aims to address the complexity that creators have faced when trying to monetize their content on Facebook. Previously, the company offered three separate programs: In-stream ads, Ads on Reels, and Performance bonuses. Each of these had its own eligibility requirements and sign-up process, creating a potentially confusing landscape for creators looking to earn on the platform.

The new Facebook Content Monetization program, currently in beta, will unify these disparate systems. According to Meta, this consolidation will simplify the onboarding process, requiring creators to apply only once to gain access to all monetization features. The program will maintain a performance-based payout model, allowing creators to earn from ads in their reels, longer videos, photos, and text posts.

A key feature of the new program is an enhanced Insights tab. This tool will provide creators with a comprehensive view of their earnings across different content formats, enabling them to identify which videos and posts are generating the most revenue. This level of transparency and data access could prove invaluable for creators looking to optimize their content strategy.

The Rollout and Eligibility

Meta is taking a measured approach to the rollout of this new program. The company plans to invite 1 million creators who are already earning on the platform to participate in the beta testing phase. This initial group will receive invitations this week, with more creators being added to the program in the coming months.

It's worth noting that participation in the beta is optional. However, creators who choose to join the new program will not be able to return to Facebook's standalone monetization schemes. For those eager to join but not yet invited, Meta has provided an option to express interest through Facebook's official content monetization page.

A Step in the Right Direction, But Is It Enough?

While Meta's move to simplify creator monetization is commendable, industry insiders are questioning whether this effort is sufficient to compete in the increasingly crowded creator economy. A closer look at the numbers reveals a stark contrast between Meta's investment in creators and that of its competitors, particularly YouTube.

Meta proudly announced that it paid creators more than $2 billion for their content over the past year. At first glance, this figure seems impressive. However, when compared to Meta's overall revenue, the picture becomes less rosy. In 2023, Meta reported a staggering $134 billion in revenue. The $2 billion paid to creators represents merely 1.5% of this total.

Even if we assume that Facebook, despite its declining popularity in some markets, still accounts for a conservative 25% of Meta's revenue (approximately $33.5 billion), the payout to creators would only amount to about 6% of Facebook's estimated revenue.

The YouTube Comparison

The contrast becomes even starker when we look at YouTube's approach to creator compensation. Over the past three years, YouTube reported paying out $70 billion to creators, music labels, and studios. While this figure likely includes payments to larger entities, it still dwarfs Meta's contribution to the creator economy.

YouTube's parent company, Alphabet, doesn't disclose YouTube's total revenue, but we can make some educated guesses based on available data. YouTube's ad revenue over the same three-year period was $90 billion. If we conservatively estimate that total revenue was double this figure, around $180 billion, it would mean that YouTube is paying out approximately 39% of its total revenue to creators and content partners.

This stark difference in payout percentages - 6% for Facebook versus 39% for YouTube - raises questions about Meta's commitment to making Facebook a primary platform for content creators.

Meta's new program is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. Simplifying the monetization process and providing better insights will likely be welcomed by creators. However, the relatively low payout percentage suggests that Meta may need to do more to make Facebook an attractive primary platform for content creation.

Looking Ahead: What Meta Needs to Consider

For Meta to truly compete in the creator economy, several key areas need attention:

1. Increased Revenue Share: To attract and retain top talent, Meta may need to consider significantly increasing the percentage of revenue shared with creators.

2. Platform-Specific Features: Developing unique features that leverage Facebook's strengths could encourage creators to produce original content for the platform.

3. Cross-Platform Integration: Given Meta's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp, a more integrated approach to creator monetization across all its platforms could provide a compelling ecosystem for content creators.

4. Transparency and Communication: Clear, consistent communication about monetization opportunities and potential earnings could help build trust with the creator community.

Meta's new Facebook Content Monetization program is a positive development in the company's relationship with content creators. The simplification of the monetization process and the introduction of better analytics tools demonstrate Meta's recognition of the importance of the creator economy.

However, when compared to competitors like YouTube, it's clear that Meta has significant ground to cover. The relatively small percentage of revenue being shared with creators suggests that there's room for much more aggressive investment in the creator ecosystem. Only time will tell if Meta can transform Facebook into a home for original creator content."
The Truth About Making Money Online: Real Opportunities That Work,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissahouston/2024/10/07/the-truth-about-making-money-online-real-opportunities-that-work/,2024-10-07T10:04:50Z,"In the age of digital transformation, the allure of making money online has captivated the imagination of many. Whether you're looking for a side hustle, planning to transition from a traditional job to entrepreneurship, or aiming to build a scalable online business, the internet seems like a goldmine.

But the big question remains: can you really make money online these days?

The short answer is yes, you absolutely can. However, as with any opportunity, there's more to it than the glamorous Instagram ads or YouTube success stories.

One of the most popular and easiest ways to make money online is through gig platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr. The gig economy allows people to offer services like writing, graphic design, web development, and virtual assistance. If you have a skill, you will likely find someone who is willing to pay for it online.

However, competition can be stiff, and building a solid reputation can take time. Many who start as freelancers initially struggle to land high-paying gigs. Success here is about finding a niche, marketing your skills, and continuously improving to attract higher-paying clients. While it can take effort to establish yourself, consistent freelancers can earn a full-time income.

E-commerce has transformed the way we purchase and sell products. Platforms like Shopify, Etsy, and Amazon have made it incredibly easy for anyone to set up an online store. Whether you sell handmade crafts, digital products, or physical goods through dropshipping, the potential is enormous.

The key to success in e-commerce is finding a product that's in demand, mastering online marketing, and optimizing your supply chain. It's not an overnight process, and many who start give up because they underestimate the work involved in managing a business. However, the rewards can be substantial if you can create a sustainable business model and scale it.

If you're more creatively inclined, content creation can be a lucrative option. Blogging, podcasting, YouTube videos, and social media platforms allow creators to build an audience and monetize through advertising, sponsorships, or affiliate marketing.

Affiliate marketing is especially popular as it involves promoting other companies' products and earning a commission on sales. The most successful content creators build trust with their audience by offering valuable, authentic content. But don't be fooled as there's more to it than just posting. You need to understand SEO, audience engagement, and monetization strategies to make it work.

The good news is that the opportunities for content creators continue to grow, especially with platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels offering creators new ways to monetize their presence.

Another avenue growing in popularity is online education. If you have expertise in a certain area, whether it's business, fitness, personal development, or crafting, you can package your knowledge into an online course or coaching program. Platforms like Teachable and Thinkific make it easy to create and sell courses online.

Coaching is also popular, with many professionals offering 1:1 sessions, group coaching, or even masterminds. This space has significant income potential, but it requires deep knowledge in your niche and the ability to market yourself effectively.

While making money online is possible, it's important to recognize the realities:

If you're serious about making money online, the first step is to assess your skills and interests. Are you a great writer? Consider freelancing or starting a blog. Do you love creating content? Build a YouTube channel or a podcast. Do you have deep knowledge in a certain field? Consider creating an online course or coaching program.

Next, invest time in learning. Research platforms, successful strategies, and stories from others who have done it. Knowledge is your best asset, and the more you know, the easier it will be to navigate the online business world.

Finally, commit to the long game. Just like any business, building an online presence takes time. You'll face setbacks and learn through trial and error. But with persistence, the right strategy, and a focus on delivering value, you can build a profitable online business.

The bottom line is that you can make money online these days, but it's not for the faint of heart. You need to be strategic, adaptable, and patient. The opportunities are there, but only those who are willing to put in the work will see the rewards. If you're ready to jump in, do so with eyes wide open and a commitment to growth. The potential is real, and with the right mindset and effort, so are the profits."
New Lower Priced Models Help Xpeng Stock See Record Sales,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/07/new-lower-priced-models-help-xpeng-stock-see-record-sales/,2024-10-07T10:02:13Z,"Chinese luxury EV maker Xpeng delivered a record 21,352 vehicles in September, up 39.5% year-on-year and up 52% from August. Xpeng's total year-to-date sales stand at about 98,561 vehicles, up 21% versus last year. In comparison, Li Auto , the largest of the emerging EV players in China, delivered 53,709 vehicles for September 2024 - an increase of 49% percent year-over-year, with its year-to-date sales growing by 40%. A bulk of the Xpeng's growth appears to have been driven by the company's new sub-brand, Mona, with the brand's first model, the Mona M03, selling over 10,000 units in its first full month of deliveries since its launch in late August. The vehicle has a starting price of about RMB 119,800 (about $17,000), which is well below Xpeng's other models and roughly half the price of Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y.

Now, China's economic growth has been weak due to a downturn in the real estate market and a slow rebound from stringent Covid-19 lockdowns that ended over a year ago. Consumer spending and domestic consumption also remain weak in China. Despite concerns about the economy and weakness in the global EV market, the Chinese EV market has held up with the mix of new energy vehicle sales rising to about 50% of overall automotive sales in the country. Moreover, there has also been a premiumization trend in the Chinese EV market, with cars costing upward of $30,000 accounting for a growing mix of sales. This could play in Xpeng's favor, as it competes primarily in the premium end of the electric vehicle market. Moreover, Xpeng's new lower-end models could benefit from the Chinese government's incentives of RMB 10,000 (approximately $1,410) offered to consumers who switch from gasoline to electric or low-emission vehicles. Separately, the Chinese government recently announced a stimulus plan aimed at stabilizing the economy, which includes lowering interest rates and fiscal support. This could help consumer spending to an extent, further driving the EV market.

The decrease in XPEV stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 18% in 2021, -80% in 2022, and 47% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could XPEV face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?

Xpeng stock trades at just about 1.9x forward revenues. Although this is not an unreasonable valuation, it is higher than its peers Nio and Li Auto. That said, Xpeng's financial metrics have been looking up of late. For Q2 2024, the most recently reported quarter, the company saw revenues grow by 54.1% year-over-year to RMB 6.82 billion ($0.94 billion), while gross margins stood at 14% compared to negative 3.9% for the same period of 2023. This is partly due to a higher mix of sales of the more premium X9 multi-purpose vehicle and a patent licensing deal with Volkswagen. See our analysis of Nio, Xpeng & Li Auto: How Do Chinese EV Stocks Compare? for a detailed look at how Xpeng stock compares with its rivals Nio and Li Auto."
Europe's Hidden Tech Champions: The Rise Of Bootstrapped Startups,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/josipamajic/2024/10/07/europes-hidden-tech-champions-the-rise-of-bootstrapped-startups/,2024-10-07T09:46:42Z,"In the heart of Europe's bustling tech scene, a quiet revolution is unfolding. While venture capital-backed startups grab headlines with massive funding rounds, a new breed of companies is emerging as the true backbone of the continent's innovation ecosystem: bootstrapped startups. In an exclusive interview with the CEO of a leading tech M&A advisory boutique specialized in small and midcap transactions, he shares insights on how in his experience these self-funded ventures are proving that sustainable growth, profitability, and innovation can go hand in hand, often outperforming their VC-backed counterparts in the long run.

On the surface, European venture capital appears to be thriving. According to Dealroom, European startups raised a record €100 billion in 2021 and although it dropped to €63 billion in 2023, this figure would have seemed unthinkable just a few years ago. However, beneath this glittering façade lies a more complex and troubling reality, especially for scaleups.

""We have so many clients coming to us who built great companies with a range in revenues of, two, three million i,"" reveals Stefan Köppl, CEO of Samira Advisors, a leading tech M&A advisory boutique. ""But they burnt several millions on the way in VC money because from the very beginning they were used to 'Okay, my investors will pay me anyway.'""

This scenario, repeated across countless startups, points to a fundamental issue: the misalignment between VC funding models and the natural growth trajectories of most businesses.

Whereas venture capital is the perfect financing method for a specific subset of high-growth companies in rapidly advancing markets, a lot of companies in a more conservative environment would be better suited to grow more capital efficiently and/or finance their development with different financial instruments.

""We're seeing a surge in highly successful bootstrapped companies across Europe,"" Köppl begins. ""These companies are building sustainable businesses with real revenue and profits in a highly capital efficient way, often outpacing VC-backed startups in terms of long-term viability.""

While venture capital remains an important part of the ecosystem, Köppl argues that the success of bootstrapped companies is challenging the notion that massive funding rounds are necessary for startup success. ""We worked with dozens of bootstrapped companies that have grown to €5-10 million in annual recurring revenue with lean teams of 20-30 employees. They're often profitable from day one and have complete control over their destiny and the pace in which they reach it.""

Köppl shares an illuminating example that highlights the potential of bootstrapped companies:

""We recently worked with a bootstrapped software company.They started in a garage five years ago and had grown to double digit million in annual recurring revenue with just 28 employees. They were profitable from month six and had complete control over their product roadmap and company culture. When they decided to explore acquisition options, they had seven serious bidders and ultimately sold for 8x revenue, a multiple that many VC-backed companies struggle to achieve. Furthermore, the founder could choose between potential acquirers not just based on how much they pay but even more on how he perceives the acquirer to fit to his company, also in cultural terms.""

This success story stands in stark contrast to some VC-backed companies that struggle to find exits despite raising significant capital. Köppl points out, ""How many really large strategic M&As are happening in Europe per year, over 200 million? Very few. And when they do happen, the terms are often not favorable to founders due to complex cap tables and liquidation preferences.""

According to Köppl, bootstrapped companies enjoy several key advantages:

Beyond the financial benefits, Köppl observes that bootstrapping often leads to a healthier work environment for founders and employees alike. ""The founders who build sustainable, bootstrapped companies often end up much happier,"" he notes. ""They're building on their own terms, without the constant pressure of raising the next round.Top-tier VCs already recognized this and are avoiding founders who are not genuinely up for this game.

This approach also allows for a more diverse range of startups to flourish. Köppl explains, ""Not every great idea needs to be a potential unicorn. Bootstrapping enables entrepreneurs to build valuable businesses in niche markets that might be overlooked by VC funds. We're seeing incredible innovation in areas like vertical SaaS, where bootstrapped companies are dominating niche industries. ""

While bootstrapping offers many advantages, Köppl acknowledges it's not without challenges. Limited resources can slow growth, and some industries require significant upfront capital that self-funding can't provide. However, he points out that innovative solutions are emerging:

While private capital plays a crucial role, Köppl notes that public initiatives are also evolving to support a more diverse startup ecosystem. ""It is true that there is still a strong need to boost venture capital in Europe, especially in certain regions and in the growth stage."" he observes. ""But at the same time, there's a growing recognition that supporting sustainable, bootstrapped companies can have a significant positive impact on the economy.""

He highlights several promising initiatives:

Stefan highlights that public support plays a crucial role in venture capital, but it doesn't always align perfectly with market needs. For instance, there is a lot of capital avaliable for seed stage VC funds, despite some regional markets already having sufficient liquidity in that area. The real challenge, he notes, seems to lie more in growth stage funding than in early stage. The Road Ahead

As Europe's tech ecosystem matures, Köppl believes the importance of bootstrapped companies will only grow. ""The future of European innovation lies in a diverse ecosystem that celebrates different paths to success,"" he concludes. ""Bootstrapped companies are showing us that it's possible to build world-class businesses without following the traditional VC playbook.""

Köppl emphasizes that there's room for both models in the ecosystem. ""VC funding is crucial for certain types of businesses,but is more a niche product then it is perceived often right now. We need to recognize and celebrate the bootstrapped companies that are often the unsung heroes of European tech""

As policymakers, investors, and entrepreneurs look to the future, Köppl argues that embracing and supporting bootstrapped startups will be key to building a sustainable and innovative European tech sector. By celebrating these hidden champions and providing them with the resources and recognition they deserve, Europe can foster a new generation of technology leaders that compete on the global stage while staying true to their roots.

The message from Köppl's insights is clear: in the world of European tech, sometimes less outside capital means more innovation, more sustainability, and ultimately, more success. As the continent continues to establish itself as a global tech powerhouse, it's the bootstrapped startups that may well lead the way, proving that with determination, creativity, and a focus on customer value, European entrepreneurs can build world-changing companies on their own terms."
8 Workplace Trends That Will Define 2025,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/10/07/8-workplace-trends-that-will-define-2025/,2024-10-07T06:06:10Z,"The landscape of work is undergoing a seismic shift, propelled by technological breakthroughs and evolving societal dynamics. Much like the ever-changing realms of fashion and music, workplace trends serve as a barometer for the direction and velocity of this transformation, offering us a glimpse into the future of our professional lives. As we navigate through economic uncertainties, demographic changes in the workforce, and rapidly evolving employee expectations, it's crucial to understand these emerging patterns. So, let's explore the nine most significant workplace trends poised to shape the coming year, providing insights into how they might reshape our professional environments and practices.

As AI and automation continue to reshape the professional landscape, the imperative for continuous learning and skill development has never been more pronounced. While certain roles may become obsolete, a plethora of new opportunities are emerging, demanding novel skills and competencies. Organizations offering robust learning opportunities will attract top talent, positioning themselves as growth incubators. Those failing to embrace lifelong learning risk falling behind. In 2025, adaptability and continuous learning will be crucial for both organizational success and individual career resilience.

The four-day workweek is gaining momentum, challenging traditional work structures. In 2025, more organizations are expected to adopt this model, which promises enhanced employee well-being, improved work-life balance, and reduced carbon footprints. This shift suggests that concentrated work hours and extended recovery time can maintain or even boost productivity. As adoption grows, we may see a broader reshaping of work-leisure norms across industries.

The gig economy is evolving beyond ride-sharing and delivery services. By 2025, we expect more skilled professionals to embrace this model, attracted by autonomy and diverse opportunities. This shift is driven by the fading ""job for life"" concept and the desire for flexible, challenging work. It will be prominent in fields with skill shortages, like healthcare, AI, and cybersecurity. Organizations must adapt, focusing on creating appealing project-based opportunities to attract and retain top talent in this fluid landscape.

The AI narrative is shifting from replacement to augmentation. While some roles may be automated, AI tools are increasingly enhancing human capabilities and boosting productivity and creativity. Success in this new paradigm hinges on developing uniquely human skills like nuanced communication, emotional intelligence, and strategic thinking. This human-AI collaboration isn't just about coexistence; it's about unlocking new possibilities. As AI handles routine tasks, humans can focus on innovation and interpersonal aspects that drive true progress.

As AI takes on traditional managerial tasks, leadership roles are transforming. Leaders who foster emotional connections and build cohesive teams will be in high demand. Key attributes include empathy, facilitating human-machine collaboration, and focusing on talent development. This shift represents a fundamental change from task management to nurturing teams through rapid change. Leaders who adapt to this model will be crucial in balancing technological advancements with human needs in the AI age.

In 2025, ""out-of-office"" will be redefined through immersive online platforms. These environments, integrating VR and AR, enable seamless collaboration regardless of physical location. They transform all aspects of work life, from dynamic meetings to immersive training and team building. While the grand ""metaverse"" vision may have faded, its core concepts are finding practical applications in work-focused platforms. This trend is set to redefine remote work, blending in-person interaction benefits with digital flexibility.

AI integration in HR is accelerating, revolutionizing human capital management. It's reshaping core functions like recruitment, performance management, employee engagement, and talent development. As AI handles routine tasks, HR professionals can focus on strategic, high-value activities. This shift transforms HR from an administrative function to a key driver of organizational strategy. The challenge lies in balancing AI efficiency with the human touch in people management. Successful HR departments will leverage AI to enhance, not replace, human judgment and empathy.

Despite their best efforts, attempts (involving either threat or enticement) to persuade employees to give up the freedom of work-from-home have largely proven unsuccessful. The simple fact is that for every company issuing an ultimatum that workers return to their desks full-time, another realizes that offering flexibility is the key to attracting top-tier talent. This means that hybrid working is quickly becoming the default in skilled roles. Forward-thinking employers in 2025 are adopting this new paradigm, creating opportunities for their workforce to improve their work-life balance while also maintaining strong connections to colleagues and company cultures.

As we navigate these transformative trends, it's clear that the future of work will be defined by our ability to adapt, harness technology, and prioritize human potential -- creating workplaces that are not only more efficient and flexible but also more engaging, fulfilling, and aligned with the evolving needs of both individuals and organizations."
The Man Who Stopped Disney From Losing Half A Billion Dollars On 'The Marvels' And 'Quantumania',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2024/10/06/the-man-who-stopped-disney-from-losing-half-a-billion-dollars-on-the-marvels-and-quantumania/,2024-10-06T20:51:50Z,"It's no secret that 2023 was far from a blockbuster year for Marvel Studios. The Disney-owned entertainment giant had to deal with assault charges filed against its up-and-coming star Jonathan Majors, growing discontent from its visual effects staff and the departure of their boss Victoria Alonso. And that was all in the first three months of the year. Surprisingly, the worst was yet to come.

This turmoil was followed by the studio releasing a string of productions which were panned by critics even though they came at a colossal cost. As we recently revealed, The Marvels and Ant-Man threequel, Quantumania, together lost $296.4 million at the box office but it could have been a whole lot worse if it wasn't for the help of an unlikely ally.

Many movie trade titles claim to know how much money films lost at the box office. Although industry analyst Box Office Mojo publishes data about theater takings, which is widely accepted to be accurate, there is no equivalent source for production costs. Studios such as Disney don't comment on the cost of individual productions so trade titles tend to resort to using figures from contacts or estimates and this can lead to wild inaccuracies.

For example, Variety claimed that The Marvels ""cost $250 million"" when, in fact, more than $350 million was actually spent on it. By doing a bit of detective work it's possible to be bang on the money.

The precise costs of movies made in the United States is usually a closely-guarded secret as studios combine the costs of all of their productions in their overall expenses and their filings don't itemize how much they spent on each one. It is a different story in the United Kingdom which is where The Marvels and Quantumania were made.

As we regularly report, studios filming in the UK often incorporate a subsidiary company to make each picture there and they have to file financial statements showing everything from the total sum spent on it right down to the pension contribution paid to the staff who worked on it. Some even disclose the difference in pay between the men and women they employ and the proportion of the workforce represented by each gender.

The companies usually have code names so that they don't raise attention with fans when filing for permits to film on location and when they are correctly matched to the productions they are making it lifts the curtain on their costs.

This is because the terms governing the UK production companies state that they have to show all of the costs, from pre-production right up to delivery of the finished film. What's more, the terms add that movies made in the UK can only have one production company so studios can't set up others elsewhere and hide some of the spending in them. Crucially, the companies have to warrant that the data in their filings is true and accurate so the cost of the movies they make is indisputable. Studios don't disclose this information out of the goodness of their hearts.

They shoot in the UK to benefit from the government's Audio-Visual Expenditure Credit (AVEC) which gives them a cash reimbursement of up to 25.5% of the money they spend in the country.

To qualify for the reimbursement, at least 10% of the production costs need to relate to activities in the UK. Studios set up separate production companies for each picture so that they can demonstrate the spending to the UK government and the filings for the Disney subsidiaries behind The Marvels and Quantumania show that they cost a total of $762.4 million to make.

The movies generated a combined $682.2 million at the box office with around 50% of it going to Disney leaving the studio with a loss of $421.3 million. That doesn't include the revenue from merchandise and Blu Ray/streaming sales as they go to the studio but it too has to cover the cost of marketing the movies which could drive up its loss. However, that's just the start of the story.

The filings also show that The Marvels and Quantumania received a combined $124.9 million in reimbursements from the UK government bringing Disney's loss down to around 300 million dollars. Getting the reimbursement is far from child's play.

In addition to the 10% minimum UK spending threshold, films must pass a points test based on factors such as whether the film showcases the UK and how many of the lead actors are British. It explains why the cast of many Marvel movies is dominated by British actors and why cultural icons from the country sometimes appear on-screen despite seeming so incongruous that it can distract from the action.

A sign in the background of one of the scenes in Avengers: Infinity War shows a Scottish flag and a reference to deep fried kebabs which are an unusual local delicacy. Likewise, at one point in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, a portal opens to reveal a classic British red telephone box.

Neither The Marvels nor Quantumania showcase any British heritage, nor are their ranks filled with British actors. However, the points test also covers aspects such as whether the soundtrack was recorded in the UK and how many of the production team are from the UK. Both movies were made in the UK and passed the points tests as the filings for their production companies confirm that they received final British Film Certificates.

The filings also show that neither The Marvels nor Quantumania used the full 25.5% reimbursement available to them as it only covered 17.8% and 15% of their total costs respectively. As Robby Montoya, an investigative reporter at the Texas Scorecard, astutely observed on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, ""British taxpayers funded box office bombs.""

That said, Disney is isn't doing anything wrong by receiving the reimbursements as it is simply taking advantage of the UK's tax laws. It isn't even a new development as Disney has been filming in the UK for decades. Indeed, its first completely live-action film, Treasure Island, was filmed in the UK way back in 1949. under the supervision of Walt himself.

However, Disney's relationship with the UK government has changed over the years and stepped up a gear a decade ago.

It followed Disney's $4 billion buyout of Lucasfilm, creator of the Star Wars series, in 2012. No sooner was the ink dry on the contract than Disney gave the green light to a reboot of the sci-fi saga which began filming two years later. Disney decided to go all-out on it and, as we revealed, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the first film in its trilogy, became the most expensive movie of all time with total costs of well over $500 million.

In order to recoup some of this staggering sum, Disney made the movie in the UK. With so much money at stake, the studio didn't take any chances and got endorsement from the UK government right from the start.

In 2014 the UK's then-Treasury Secretary George Osborne proudly announced that the historic Pinewood Studios would not just be home to The Force Awakens but also to its two sequels. It was a dream ticket for the self-confessed Star Wars fan though there is no suggestion that Osborne did anything improper or gave Disney any special treatment. In fact, at the time, the UK was part of the European Union and its state aid rules prevent the governments of its members from cutting such deals with companies.

According to the Daily Mail Osborne worked closely with Lucasfilm's president Kathleen Kennedy to ensure the new slate of films, directed by JJ Abrams, were made in the UK, snatching them away from rivals including Canada. Osborne's support was so valued by Disney that it thanked him in the credits of The Force Awakens and gave him several replica Lightsabers.

Disney even invited him on to the highly-secretive set of The Force Awakens for a behind the scenes tour during filming which he described as ""one of the most exciting days in the job."" He added that ""I did walk on the Millennium Falcon and meet Chewbacca. It's like walking back into your childhood. I couldn't actually believe I was meeting these characters.""

He kickstarted a relationship that stands strong to this day. Disney didn't just make its trilogy of Star Wars films in the UK but their two spinoffs, two streaming series and 17 Marvel productions including The Marvels and Quantumania. There is more to come as Disney announced in August that it plans to invest $5 billion over the next five years in films, television and streaming shows made in the UK and Europe.

Osborne, who is now chairman of the British Museum, didn't support Disney because he is a Star Wars aficionado but because of the financial benefit it brings to the UK. Testimony to this, the latest data from the British Film Institute (BFI) shows that in 2019, every $1.31 (£1) of reimbursement handed to studios generated $10.88 (£8.30) of additional Gross Value Added (GVA) benefit for the UK economy. It led to a total of $10.1 billion (£7.7 billion) in GVA being generated by the fiscal incentives for film in 2019.

Released in December 2021, the BFI's triennial Screen Business report showed that between 2017 and 2019, the fiscal incentives to studios generated a record $17.7 billion (£13.5 billion) of return on investment to the UK economy and created more jobs than ever before. Filming in the UK doesn't just generate jobs for locals, it also drives spending on services such as security, equipment hire, transport and catering.

The report found that, in general, between 40% and 60% of production expenditure was spent in the general economy in sectors such as travel and transport, construction, hospitality and catering. In specific, productions with a budget of more than $65.6 million (£50 million) spend 11.7% on construction; 9.8% on travel and transport; 9.7% on locations; 6.5% on hospitality and catering; 4.2% on business supplies; 3.1% on local labor; 2.3% on music and performing arts; 2.2% on fashion and beauty; and 2.1% on digital services.

In 2019, this spend generated 37,685 jobs in London and 7,775 throughout the rest of the UK. The report added that when the wider impacts of the film content value chain are taken into consideration, 49,845 jobs were created in London in 2019 and 19,085 throughout the rest of the UK.

The UK economy is still getting a magic touch from the fiscal incentives. Despite Hollywood being gripped by strikes for more than six months last year, foreign studios contributed around 77% of the $1.8 billion (£1.4 billion) spent on making films in UK according to the BFI.

Critics claim that the impact isn't felt outside the film industry which is still a niche sector in the UK. There is some evidence for this from the government itself. When it introduced its high-end television reimbursement scheme in 2013 it noted that ""this measure is expected to have a positive impact on the high-end television industry, but is not expected to have significant wider macroeconomic impacts.""

However, a senior industry source points out that the UK doesn't just benefit from job creation and the studios spending money on local businesses but also from the increased tax paid by these companies. Furthermore, as the reimbursement is paid to studios after the spending has occurred, the UK government collects the tax before the money is paid out.

""The amount of taxes on the spend makes it pretty cash neutral to start,"" says the source. ""Even better, the spend happens and taxes are paid a year at least before the government writes a cheque in return."" He adds that the film industry workers then spend the money they have been paid which in turn generates more tax receipts for the government. ""If you follow the actual tax collection against the impact of this onward money it vastly exceeds the payout.""

Testimony to this, the Screen Business report estimated that the fiscal incentives for film caused UK tax revenues to surge by 27% from $3.7 billion (£2.8 billion) in 2017 to $4.7 billion (£3.6 billion) in 2019. The source adds that the government puts this to good use as it ""results in our technologies helping cut the trial times for drugs by 50% and my new knee operation time. Direct from R&D done by people like us in film.""

He adds that the fiscal incentives are ""not at the expense of spending on hospitals etc. Without the inward money the payroll and other taxes on the £7 billion plus would not be generated.""

Despite these statistics, some observers feel that efforts might have been better focussed elsewhere in the arts industry. According to Neil Griffiths, CEO of youth charity Arts Emergency, ""austerity politics has been cataclysmic for the long term health of our nation's cultural life and creative industries. It may work as a short term incentive for global corporations to bring business here, but they won't keep coming when the talent pipeline runs dry due to the short term thinking and small minded educational and cultural policies of successive Conservative governments. Community arts and state funded comprehensive education are the bedrock of the UK's global pre-eminence in cultural production and creativity.""

Another counter argument is that the UK's facilities, talent and landscape are strong enough to attract studios to film anyway so the country could reap the benefits from their spending without the government needing to pay out the reimbursements. If the UK had not offered such attractive fiscal incentives to movie-makers it remains to be seen whether The Marvels or Quantumania would have been filmed there anyway and whether their costs would have come down if so. However, there is no doubt that as long as the incentives remain in place, it isn't likely that the curtain will come down on film making in the UK."
"Beijing Must Feel Like It Is Under The Gun, And It Definitely Is",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2024/10/06/beijing-must-feel-like-it-is-under-the-gun-and-it-definitely-is/,2024-10-06T17:50:35Z,"Beijing has again moved to jumpstart China's beleaguered economy. Implicitly admitting that its May stimulus package had failed to do the job, the nation's leadership in September made a dramatic gesture, advancing monetary and fiscal measures far beyond anything to date. These steps may help Beijing meet its 5 percent real growth target for 2024, but they will not restore China's economic momentum.

The fiscal measures present a strange mix. According to China's Xinhua News Service, Beijing plans to issue some 2 trillion yuan (about $284.4 billion) in additional sovereign debt. Half this amount will help already heavily indebted local governments. The other half will go to a number of support programs for individuals and families.

Part of this support for individual Chinese and families will involve giving what Beijing calls ""living allowances"" to the poor, ostensibly to celebrate the 75 anniversary of communist rule. No doubt recipients will spend these monies quickly and provide an immediate fillip to consumer spending. This measure, however, can have little lasting effect. Beijing will also offer an ongoing monthly allowance of 800 yuan ($114) for each child in families with two or more children. This will have a more lasting effect on economic activity, though there are relatively few such families in China these days. No doubt this measure also aims to encourage births and thereby counteract the demographic pressure imposed on the economy by years of low fertility rates. It might help but it will take 15-20 years before any rise in births today can influence China's workforce.

City of Shanghai from its own resources will offer 500 million yuan in vouchers for people to use on dining, and amusements. At less than 1.0% of Shanghai's gross domestic product, this measure can hardly have much overall effect. Beijing has also earmarked 1.0 trillion yuan (about $142 billion) to recapitalize six big banks, clearly an effort to remedy some of the harm done by the failures of the property crisis.

On the monetary side of the ledger, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will cut the 1-year medium-term lending facility rate from 2.3% at present to 2.0%. It will cut the 7-day reverse purchase rate, its main policy tool, from 1.7% to 1.5%. These changes look tiny compared with the latest Federal Reserve half-point rate cuts in the United States, but by the standards of past PBOC measures, the recent PBOC cuts look bold indeed.

To further stimulate lending and presumably economic activity, the bank will reduce the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve against their deposit and loan portfolios. To lift China's falling stock market, the PBOC will also make 500 billion yuan (about $70 billion) available for lending to investment funds, brokers, and insurers. It will make an additional 300 billion yuan available to finance share buybacks by listed companies. The bank's hope no doubt is that a rising stock market will offset some of the household wealth lost to the property crisis and its depressing effect on real estate values. To help real estate directly, the PBOC will cut the rates payable on existing mortgages, a relief for existing homeowners, since unlike Americans, Chinese have no facility to refinance their mortgage. To increase home buying, the bank has also scheduled a drop in the required downpayment on second homes from 25% at present to 15%.

Though this list of fiscal and monetary measures may sound impressive, it will likely fail to do the trick. More than measures to make credit cheaper and more plentiful or to help certain of society's needier demographics, China, if it is to get back its economic momentum, needs to restore confidence among the vast population of Chinese consumers. It also needs to encourage investment spending by private businesses, which are estimated to account for some 60% of the economy and 80% of new urban employment.

Certainly the Chinese consumer needs more help than this package offers. Households have lost confidence and remain unwilling to spend. At last measure the country' consumer confidence index was down about 3% from last spring and almost 30% below its level in 2022. To some extent, this sorry state of affairs reflects the lingering effects of the zero-Covid policies that stopped economic activity and interrupted employment and paychecks long after the pandemic ended. More than this, however, is the effect of the property crisis on real estate values. No pickup in the stock market can repair this burden. A family's home in China constitutes the bulk of its net worth, and real estate prices have fallen more than 12% since 2021, when the property crisis first broke.

Private business owners and managers are no better off. They have slowed their capital spending on expansion, modernization, and hiring to a negligible amount. Fixed capital formation has actually declined over the past year. Part of this shortfall reflects the shock the economy's growth slowdown has had on a business community once accustomed to the rapid growth or earlier years. Private business owners and managers can also remember how not too many years ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping chastised them for caring more about profits than the communist party's agenda. Xi has changed his tune of late, but memories are long, and they have left doubts about Beijing's attitude in future years.

Without policies to restore confidence in these two crucial sectors of the nation's economy, growth will continue to struggle. It is doubtful that China will deliver the targeted 5 percent real growth for 2024. If if it does report such growth, it will more likely come from statistical legerdemain than from genuine economic activity. Beijing has hinted at more stimulus to come. Perhaps these next actions can address the confidence problem. Without help on this front, the economy will continue in its weakened state."
"There Are No Economic Forecasts, There's Just Fallacy",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/10/06/there-are-no-economic-forecasts-theres-just-fallacy/,2024-10-06T14:02:18Z,"Economists quite literally ascribe to themselves an ability to forecast the global economy. Any doubts about the previous assertion can be found by placing ""global recession"" into the search bar of your engine of choice.

The arrogance of such a presumption is astounding. As is written here with some frequency, the mere notion of measuring the street one lives on is beyond comprehension. Even one's own house is a bridge too far. Think about it. After measuring the consumption inside 1234 Maple Street, the more modest of us might stop and contemplate the infinite actions taking place outside 1234 Maple (and around the world) that profoundly inform that consumption.

Economies are just people, and so much of what people do and how much they can do of it is a function of what people and machines do (and don't do) far from them. Measuring an ""economy"" is so pointless, and then when the deep in thought operate under the pretense of an ability to measure the world...

Unfortunately, it gets worse. If there's a justification for what's unjustifiable (and also wildly unrealistic), it can perhaps be that these monuments to misleading (think GDP) presume an economy in a stationary state. Of course, the latter itself speaks to dimwitted nature of it all. An economy that's stationary naturally rejects capital and is soon enough not stationary thanks to rapid shrinkage. Which is kind of the point.

The here and now of an economy not only can't be reasonably measured (see above and the challenges of measuring 1234 Maple Street), but if it's growing there's no realistic way to forecast the growth. As Oklahoma State professor Steve Trost puts it, economic forecasts are a fallacy. So true.

That is so simply because what propels us out of the stationary state is surprise. Economic growth doesn't spring from consumption (think GDP) that can only occur after the actual production (growth) that enabled it, rather it's about increases in production that are logical consequences of infinite global discoveries of how to do things better than previously done.

In other words, entrepreneurial advance is what drives most advance. The problem is that it can't be forecast. By definition.

More realistically, if it could be forecast it wouldn't be entrepreneurial. And it wouldn't be simply because markets are reasonably efficient. What's a known, or what's accepted as a driver of economic advance is what's already being done. Just as a $20 bill lying on the street doesn't go long before being picked up, neither does a good idea sit unused. There's too much money to be made from it.

Which speaks to the genius of entrepreneurs. They're that way not because they did the expected, but because against all odds and in the face of enormous ridicule, they inserted into the proverbial economic bloodstream an all-new way of doing things. Entrepreneurs by their very description introduce surprise that propels us out of the stationary state.

About these leaps, it doesn't insult economists one iota to point out that they're unable to divine the upside surprises that power growth. By extension, it similarly insults economists not one iota that they can't foretell the commercial concepts that will vanish amid all the growth-boosting surprise.

What insults economists is the forecasts themselves, and that presume an ability to foresee the surprises and shocks (business decline) that are the source of economic advance. At least stopped clocks are right twice a day. The same can't reasonably be said of any fallacious economic forecast (a triple redundancy), no matter how ""accurate."""
Robust Job Gains Remove Recession Fears,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/10/06/robust-job-gains-remove-recession-fears/,2024-10-06T11:06:04Z,"The September jobs report on Friday put to rest any fears that the labor market might be on a path to cool enough to endanger U.S. economic growth. On the contrary, the report was so broadly strong as to give rise to worries that the Federal Reserve might pause further cuts and reignited wage growth might be a looming danger.

Employment grew by 254,000 nonfarm jobs, which was well above expectations, and the upwardly revised 159,000 in August. The household survey data was also robust at a gain of 430,000 jobs, with the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, soaring by a whopping 666,000.

The unemployment rate was reported at 4.1% but was close to 4.0% at 4.05%, down from 4.2%.

Wages crept up to 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.8%, which reinforces the strength of the labor demand but might raise questions about renewed inflation pressures. The only blemish on the jobs report was the average workweek hours falling to 34.2, a four-year low also seen in July and January.

The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm that the cooling trend in the labor market has stabilized, with both measures off their respective peaks.

Before the recent decline, the unemployment rate had risen enough off the lows to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. However, there are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle.

Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is further evidence that the labor market does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy.

Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 near all-time highs by Friday's market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved higher as well.

Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. The lower probability of recession after the healthy jobs report is reflected in the better performance of economically sensitive companies.

The crucial economic reports before the next Federal Reserve meeting on November 7 include Thursday's consumer inflation (CPI) and another monthly jobs report. Consensus estimates expect September CPI to slow to 2.3% year-over-year from 2.5%. The Cleveland Fed's CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the November meeting.

Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expected pace of 2024 rate cuts. A short-term interest rate cut of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November and December Fed meetings is implied. In response to the slower expected pace of rate cuts, the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields rose to 3.92% and 3.97%, respectively.

Friday's job report increases the probability that the Federal Reserve can engineer a soft landing with the U.S. economy remaining remarkably resilient. The Atlanta Fed's estimate of third-quarter GDP is at 2.5%, according to their last update on October 1. As the fears of recession recede and have been reflected in all-time high stock prices, earnings will likely need to be the next catalyst for higher prices. Third-quarter earnings season kicks off at the end of the week as if on cue."
Trump's Wall Street Tower Appears To Be Underwater,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacheverson/2024/10/05/donald-trump-wall-street-tower-40-building/,2024-10-06T10:33:44Z,"At one of Trump's biggest buildings, profits are down, expenses are up and the mortgage is about to come due. It's all enough to push 40 Wall Street into the red.

ne of Donald Trump's prized properties, the landmark building 40 Wall Street, is 63 stories high but now appears to be underwater. The remaining 35 years on Trump's leasehold in the Financial District tower is worth about $116 million. That's $2 million less than the estimated $118 million Trump owes on his mortgage, according to an analysis of loan documents, real-estate records, financial disclosures and appraisals.

The building is simply not earning enough money to cover the loan: 40 Wall Street's annual net operating income has dropped from about $20.7 million in 2018 to $12.8 million last year, as the building's occupancy rate plummeted from 94.3% in early 2018 to 73.9% in June, thanks in part to the distressed post-pandemic commercial real estate market.

Adding to the headaches: Trump, who doesn't own the land on which the building sits, has just nine years left until his ground rent escalates dramatically, due to an agreement with the building's German owner. There is a good chance that if net operating income doesn't rebound that the new terms could potentially wipe out all of his profit.

Things could come to a head soon. Trump's debt is due in July but -- with an estimated $566 million of legal liabilities hanging over him and just $413 million of cash -- he does not have the funds to comfortably pay it all back. Refinancing will be hard, too, because any new lender would likely balk at the math behind the deal. That leaves the Republican presidential candidate in a tough spot as the November election approaches, short on funds to save one of his prized possessions.

riginally named after its primary tenant, the Manhattan Company, a bank whose founders included Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, 40 Wall Street was expected to be the tallest building in the world when construction began in 1929. But shortly after the 927-foot-tall Manhattan Company Building was finished 11 months later, it was bested by midtown's Chrysler Building, boosted by its massive spire that had been built in secret, according to New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission.

The business model for 40 Wall Street didn't work out according to the original plan either. Opening just months after the 1929 stock market crash that kicked off the Great Depression, would-be tenants backed out of their commitments, the commission wrote when designating the property a landmark decades later. Nine years after opening, the owners defaulted on interest, taxes and payments, lenders foreclosed on the building, and it was on the auction block, bought by bond holders for the outstanding principal on their loans, the New York Times reported in 1939.

As the American war-time economy ramped up, though, so too did 40 Wall Street, with some of the country's most-reputable tenants including Westinghouse and the Navy taking up quarters there in the 1940s. By 1944, the building was completely occupied for the first time, according to the Times.

The Manhattan Company merged with Chase Bank in 1955. While the new entity was headquartered at Chase's offices, it still maintained a bank and offices at 40 Wall Street, according to the landmark commission. But Chase sold its stake in the building in 1959, when a real estate firm consolidated ownership of 40 Wall Street, paying $32 million for the leasehold and the three separate parcels of land on which the building sits. The following year though, the development was split up again, with Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. buying the land and a London-based real estate company picking up the leasehold. In 1966, it sold the leasehold to the partners of a brokerage firm that was the building's largest tenant.

In 1982, Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda secretly invested in the building. That same year, a group of investors led by members of the reclusive Hinneberg family, a Hamburg, Germany-based shipping dynasty, bought the land from MetLife for $70 million, according to the Landmarks Preservation Commission. After Marcos was deposed, his assets were frozen and 40 Wall Street was auctioned off, again, seven years later. With downtown real estate in the dumps and the building reportedly in disrepair, in 1995, Trump picked up the building and its 1.1 million square feet of office from Citicorp, who had been stuck with it, for a mere $1.3 million. He also inked a 64-year ground lease with the Hinnebergs. Through five companies and a revocable trust of which he is the only beneficiary, Trump is the sole owner of the lease.

With a $5 million loan payment to Capital One coming due, in 2015, Trump refinanced the building, borrowing $160 million from Ladder Capital. Almost immediately the lender sliced up the debt into four separate notes and bundled it up with dozens of other properties that were then sold to investors. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for those four notes, Trump still owes a total of about $118 million of his original $160 million mortgage. That loan comes due in 10 months. Meanwhile, after speaking with experts in NYC commercial real estate, Forbes estimates Trump's leasehold is worth an estimated $116 million. That means Trump's equity could be worth less than zero, quite a drop from an estimated value of $80 million a year ago.

Wells Fargo, the bank servicing the commercial mortgage pass-through certificates that include Trump's loan, had enough concerns about his debt that it has been on a watchlist since December. The bank's accompanying note cites New York state's civil fraud verdict against Trump, 40 Wall Street's occupancy rate and the building's declining operating income to debt service ratio as reasons why.

When Trump took out that loan in 2015, 40 Wall Street's occupancy rate was 94.5%, about one percentage point higher than comparable rental properties, according to Ladder Capital. Up until 2019, the building's rate was pretty stable, ranging from 91% to 98%, per loan servicer reports. But then the Covid-19 pandemic hit, tanking the commercial real estate market, and 40 Wall Street's occupancy rate began dropping: 89.1% in 2019, 86.1% in 2021, 82.9% in 2022, 74.2% last year and 73.9% in June. One notable departure: retail pharmacy Duane Reade, which occupied 6.8% of the building, cleared out of 40 Wall Street in 2023, 4.5 years before its lease was set to expire, according to Morningstar.

Right now, the building's website advertises 73,000 square feet of ""select"" rental space available. The actual figure seems to be much higher according to the loan servicer's report: a 73.9% occupancy rate in a building with 1.2 million square feet of rentable space means that unoccupied area should be closer to 300,000 square feet. It's not clear if the information on the 40 Wall Street website was inaccurate or if new tenants have committed to moving in. Spokespeople for the Trump Organization did not respond to inquiries.

Not surprisingly, the decline in occupancy rate has coincided with a drop in the building's income, which fell from $41.7 million in 2019 to $30.9 million in 2022. An increase in the rent Trump collected last year, however, caused it to bounce back to $33 million (it's not immediately clear why the rent increased while occupancy decreased in 2023). Even still, when Trump signed the loan, Ladder Capital projected 40 Wall Street's annual gross income to be about $43.1 million. Not once has it reached that figure.

The building's annual operating expenses, meanwhile, have exceeded estimates. While Ladder Capital projected them to be $20.6 million a year, they've surpassed that figure every year since 2016, ranging from $20.9 million in 2017 to $23.6 million in 2019. Driven by repairs and maintenance costs that doubled Ladder Capital's estimates, operating expenses last year totaled $23.2 million.

Putting it all together, 40 Wall Street's net operating income in 2023 was $12.8 million. But leasing commissions, tenant improvements and other capital expenditures along with the annual $9.8 million payment to service his debt, resulted in 40 Wall Street putting just $1.2 million in Trump's pocket last year-a far cry from the $11 million Ladder Capital expected him to be raking in.

The future doesn't look any better. The lease Trump signed in 1995 requires him to pay the landowner about $2.5 million of annual rent right now. That is set to change dramatically, assuming he doesn't dump the leasehold or renegotiate. His payments on the ground lease are set to skyrocket in 2033, escalating to at least 6% of the value of the land, according to a lending prospectus. That shift would cause Trump's ground rent to soar from $2.8 million in 2032 to $16.3 million the following year, predicted Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate firm, in 2015 (the latest available). If the rest of 40 Wall Street's financial picture remained the same as it is today, that would leave Trump with a negative $5 million in net operating income in 2033.

Trump will likely struggle to find someone to loan him enough to pay off the entire principal when the mortgage comes due, given the shaky outlook of the real-estate market, the onerous terms of his lease, and the fact that he's likely underwater on his investment. Using his own money to pay off part of the principal and borrowing to cover the rest is still an option. Trump could also declare bankruptcy on 40 Wall Street (it would be his seventh bankruptcy, although it'd break new ground for him by being his first not involving a hotel). Unless Ladder Capital retained a stake in the loan, it will be in the clear, said Amiyatosh Purnanandam, a professor of finance at the University of Michigan. ""The losses will be borne by investors who own these certificates,"" Purnanandam said. ""They can range from banks to insurance companies to hedge funds.""

If Trump does stick around, he could renegotiate his leasehold with the German shipbuilding magnates, right around the time he is either beginning a potential second term as president or figuring out his next move."
Why Starting A Side Hustle Is The Smartest Financial Move,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissahouston/2024/10/06/why-starting-a-side-hustle-is-the-smartest-financial-move/,2024-10-06T10:05:19Z,"In our current economy, where the cost of living has spiked and job security is increasingly uncertain, having one source of income can leave you financially vulnerable. Starting a side hustle has become more than just a trend; it's a financial necessity.

The most obvious benefit of starting a side hustle is the additional income it provides. Having a second stream of income can be a game changer when you're working toward financial goals, whether it's saving for retirement, paying down debt, or building an emergency fund. By maintaining your day job, you reduce the financial risk of entrepreneurship while still reaping the benefits of growing a business on the side.

Unlike relying solely on a paycheck, which can be limiting and risky, side hustles allow you to build financial security over time.

For those dreaming of leaving corporate life behind, a side hustle is often the first step toward entrepreneurship. It allows you to dip your toes into business ownership without the pressure of immediate financial success. You can experiment with ideas, learn valuable lessons about marketing and sales, and refine your offerings -- all while maintaining the security of a paycheck.

Launching a side hustle is the best way to test the waters if you've been thinking about entrepreneurship. As you build your side hustle, you'll gain confidence in your ability to run a business, which could eventually lead to full-time entrepreneurship.

There are tax advantages to starting a side hustle. Expenses such as supplies, software, office space, and even a portion of your home can be written off as business expenses, which can reduce your taxable income.

Every expense related to growing your side business becomes an opportunity to save on taxes, giving you more financial flexibility. By managing these tax benefits effectively, you create a cushion that can help stabilize your personal and business finances as you scale your business.

A side hustle offers something much more valuable than money. It offers empowerment. There's a unique satisfaction that comes from creating something of your own, from being the boss of your time, and knowing that you're not solely dependent on someone else for your financial wellbeing.

By building your own business on the side, you're taking control of your financial future. This financial independence is not only empowering but also crucial as you prepare for retirement or other life transitions. Having that additional stream of income means you can retire on your own terms or continue working in a way that fits your lifestyle.

Let's face it, the traditional retirement age is not as secure as it once was. Pensions are rare, and social security alone won't be enough to maintain your current lifestyle. Starting a side hustle can help bridge that gap. By building a side business that generates passive or active income, you can continue to earn well into your retirement years, giving you more control and security over your financial future.

The bottom line is that starting a side hustle doesn't have to be overwhelming. It can start as something small, such as freelancing, selling products online, or offering services in your area of expertise. The key is to start. Over time, you'll find that this extra income, along with the skills and opportunities it brings, can significantly improve your financial situation."
The Foundations Of Great Career Coaching,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewabela/2024/10/06/the-foundations-of-great-career-coaching/,2024-10-06T09:01:48Z,"Every great career coach draws from their own source of expertise. Matching that source of expertise with your own specific coaching goals can be the key to achieving your objectives.

Coaches draw from different sources of expertise: professional experience, often based on decades in a particular industry or function; formal training; research; wide network of relationships and contacts; and from a sense of deep empathy with their clients.

While many will draw from multiple sources, you can often identify one main source of expertise for each coach. Different types of expertise can be beneficial for different coaching needs.

If you are looking for help with a major transition, or stalled career, a coach that has a formalized set of frameworks for guiding people through such events can be very helpful.

Julie Gerdeman is Global Head of Data & Analytics for BNY (Bank of New York Mellon), and a client of coach Mark Nevins. She uses several frameworks that she learned from Mark, including the ""stakeholder management plan."" According to Julie, ""this involves understanding key influencers and the dynamics of engaging with them to accomplish your most important goals."" With Mark's help, she created a map of all the key individuals in her network -- her own personal stakeholders -- and what roles they play in achieving the outcomes she's working towards, and uses it to guide her interactions with them.

The ""four questions pulse check"" is a framework she finds helpful both for performance review season, and also, with Mark's encouragement, in regular conversations with her direct reports. She attests that it is ""very simple and usually generates a productive discussion."" The four questions, as told by Julie, are:

Julie finds this framework to be highly effective: ""My team members open up quickly and appreciate the 'safe space' to share what might not be going so well and how we can work together to address them. Question 4 in particular is a great way to ensure I am doing what I can to remove obstacles to help achieve our objectives. I have found this framework to work every time, with everyone.""

Coaches working from this source of expertise need the wisdom to adapt their use of frameworks to individual clients. Joel Bines is a retail expert, Managing Partner at Spruce Advisory LLP, author of The Metail Economy, and also a client of Mark's. ""Frameworks are critical to effective coaching,"" he says. ""At the same time, adapting frameworks to the situation, instead of dogmatic adherence to a framework, is what makes a good coach a great coach.""

That flexibility is key. ""When I met Mark, the first thing I said was 'I am uncoachable,' but what I really meant was 'I am different, so don't try a cookie-cutter approach with me.' Had he pushed a framework-first methodology, we would have gotten nowhere. Instead, he adapted his framework to my situation brilliantly, and as a result became an invaluable coach, friend and advisor.""

For those in search of guidance on career fit, a coach whose source of expertise rests on a deep foundation of research can be the right choice, facilitating an evidence-based match between your own personality and preferences, and career alternatives. Jacque Merrit is a Senior Consultant and Executive Coach at Gallup who coaches based on the CliftonStrengths system. CliftonStrengths (formerly called StrengthsFinder) is built on extensive empirical research and identifies a stable set of strengths for each person, which are useful in guiding career choice and development.

Jacque has been coaching with CliftonStrengths since its inception in 1999. She notes that ""CliftonStrengths not only enhances mutual awareness of my clients' natural talents but also helps them gain confidence in their abilities, understand themselves more deeply, and live authentically. This focus encourages them to appreciate the unique strengths of others, build diverse teams, and approach interactions with curiosity rather than judgment, ultimately paving the way for greater success in their leadership roles.""

A powerful source of expertise for coaches can be their own life experience. Working with such a coach can be particularly suitable for someone struggling to climb out of a difficult situation. Daniel Gasser knows about difficult situations. A heroin addict in his late teen years, the Zurich, Switzerland-based coach was able to overcome his drug addiction, only to fall into three decades of alcohol abuse. ""I was a complete a**hole,"" he says in his Swiss-German accent. A severe car accident some years ago was a wakeup call, leading him to reform his life successfully, and he now specializes in coaching women on how to deal with men who are like the person he was.

Coaches not only draw from their source of expertise, they can also integrate their clients into it. This is the case when a coach's source of expertise is their own large network, which allows them to stay current from a wide range of sources and make new connections for their clients. Choose a coach with this source of expertise when you are personally looking to expand your own network to find new customers and business opportunities.

Cory Warfield has half a million followers on LinkedIn, and coaches his clients on how to build their own networks. Alexey Navolokin leads semiconductor company AMD's commercial sales organization in the Asia-Pacific region. When he started working with Cory four years ago, he already had 70,000 LinkedIn followers. Cory ""provided guidance on building and maintaining professional relationships through LinkedIn. He assisted me in creating engaging and valuable content that showcases my expertise and attracts followers, and helped to craft effective messages to reach my target audience and generate leads."" Following Cory's guidance, Navolokin has surpassed his coach's reach, with over 700,000 followers today.

Coaches themselves appreciate the value of a good coach. David Citron's firm, expressocoaching.com, ""helps adults with ADHD who are procrastinating their goals, unleash their superpower in 4 minutes a day,"" according to David, and he is also a client of Cory's. David was having great success with his existing clients, but wanted to reach a broader audience. Working with Cory helped him grow from 9,000 to over 100,000 LinkedIn followers in four months. He now has clients in 31 countries across 6 continents.

When you hire a career coach, you don't just hire the person -- you hire their expertise, experience, background, and connections. Make sure that this package fits what you are hoping to accomplish."
Sense And Nonsense About Taxes,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngoodman/2024/10/05/sense-and-nonsense-about-taxes/,2024-10-06T01:51:36Z,"As we draw closer to the November elections, there is an inordinate amount of attention being paid to ""disinformation,"" and a great deal of fact-checking of candidates' statements.

Yet here are four surprising facts: (1) the subject on which there is the most disinformation is ""taxes""; (2) almost all the disinformation comes from the left; (3) it is spread to the general public by the mainstream media; and (4) it is almost never fact-checked.

Most of the benefits of the 2017 (Trump) tax cuts went to the rich.

The tax code today is just as progressive (if not more so) than it was before the tax cuts went into effect.

Surprisingly, both these statements are true. The first statement is true but misleading. The second statement is simply true.

What is rarely said in policy debates is that for the most part, half the population isn't paying income taxes at all. Specifically, the top one-half of taxpayers are paying 97.9% of all income taxes, while the bottom half pays a paltry 2.3%. So, it's hard to think of a tax cut that wouldn't confer most of the benefits on the top half of the income distribution.

Progressivity is a different matter. Suppose we cut everyone's taxes by 1%. For a millionaire, that would be $10,000. For a $30,000-a-year worker, that would be $300. That's a big difference in raw numbers. But from an equality standpoint, everyone's share of the country's after-tax income would be the same both before and after the tax cut.

If we define the rich broadly (to refer to the upper half), their share is already approaching 100% and that is as high as it can go. But even if we are talking about the really rich, their share is quite high.

The top 1% (people who earned more than $682,577 in 2021) paid 45% of all income taxes collected that year. The top 10% (earning more than $169,800) paid three-fourths of all income taxes.

This reflects the fact that the United States has the most progressive tax system in the world. We tax the rich proportionally more than any other country.

Why is our income tax system so progressive?

Although they don't like to talk about it, Republicans are the main reason. Going all the way back to Ronald Reagan, every Republican tax bill threw more and more people off the income tax rolls. Through this and other provisions, Republicans have been shifting the tax burden to the rich every time they have legislated on taxes.

Both private and government analyses confirm that the same is true of the 2017 tax reform law. In 2018, the top 20 percent of the income distribution faced a lower tax rate, but they paid a larger share of the total tax burden than the year before.

Had Democratic opponents had their way, the share of the tax burden would actually be lower for the rich and higher for low- and moderate-income families than it is today.

What about corporate taxes?

Although corporations send checks to the U.S. Treasury, economists do not regard corporate entities as bearing the real burden of taxation. That burden is borne by people in their role as shareholders, workers, customers, etc.

The Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimates that 20% of the corporate income tax is paid by labor in the form of lower wages and 80% is paid by capital (lower dividends and interest payments, for example). For certain types of tax changes, the TPC assumes a 50/50 split. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assumes that 25% is paid by labor, and it is the official score keeper for Congress.

When Joe Biden and Kamala Harris say that raising the corporate income tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent will not result in a tax on anyone earning less than $400,000, almost no economist will agree with that assertion. If members of Congress vote for the measure, they will be instructed by the CBO that they are voting to take one out of every four dollars of increased government revenue out of the pockets of ordinary American workers.

Also, remember that workers are also shareholders through their pension plans, 401(k) plans and IRA accounts. So, to the extent that corporate taxes fall on capital, workers bear part of that burden as well.

The most sophisticated model of international capital flows and corporate taxes ever developed has been produced by Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff and his colleagues. Their finding: the burden of corporate taxation is almost entirely shifted to labor. If Kotlikoff and his colleagues are right, then almost all of the Biden/Harris proposed increase in corporate taxes will come out of the pockets of people who make less than $400,000 a year.

Taxing capital gains

Last time I checked, the stock price of Microsoft was $416. That's what investors have to pay for the right to share in the company's earnings indefinitely into the future, as long as they hold the stock. The world ""future"" is key. If a sell my share after a rise in price, I will have a capital gain. But that gain does not reflect any increase in income to Microsoft. It merely reflects a change in the market's expectations.

Eventually the future will arrive, Microsoft will experience real earnings, and investors will pay taxes on those earnings. That's why we don't need a capital gains tax on the trading of Microsoft stock. Eventually, all of Microsoft earnings will be taxed by regular income taxes.

It is noteworthy that capital gains are not included in the calculation of GDP. They are nowhere to be found in our national income accounts. Ditto for capital losses.

If there were a logical reason to tax capital gains, there would be an equally compelling reason to allow the full deduction of capital losses. But were that allowed, the government would probably get no net income in the process. By way of analogy, the only reason the government collects any money by taxing the winnings of gamblers is because it doesn't allow them a full deduction for their losses.

Taxing unrealized capital gains is even harder to justify. It would be like taxing the gambler -- not at the end an evening of gaming, but after each time a roll of the dice produces a win, while ignoring each time there is a loss.

What is wrong with taxing investment to pay for consumption?

Take the progressive $5 trillion plan for cradle-to-the-grave benefits, including child care, elder care and everything in between. Like the idea of taxing unrealized capital gains, almost all progressive ideas for new revenue involve confiscating funds that are now in the capital market and using those funds to pay for current consumption.

But less investment means slower economic growth. And that means our children and grandchildren will have a lower standard of living. And since economic growth is the greatest anti-poverty program ever discovered, slower growth means more people will continue to live in poverty for a longer period of time.

That's why many economists - on the right and the left - advocate a progressive consumption tax, with no tax on saving and investment. That would be a fairer tax. It would tax the rich for what they take out of the economy by consuming, but not tax them on what they contribute to the economy by saving and investing."
Mortgage Rates 5 October 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-05-10-24/,2024-10-05T19:31:10Z,"Bank Rate was held at 5% in September by the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steadying interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Good news on inflation and interest rates has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy. We will know more in its Autumn Budget on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.45%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.47% and 4.20% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 3.59%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 3.79% and 3.68% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.57%, with the best in this category priced at 5.15%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stands at 7.23%, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 October there were 6,645 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,460 on 1 September. The number has been steadily growing as the market improves. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

Nationwide's latest house price report (published 30 September) reported that average property values in September were 3.7% higher than the previous year. It marks the strongest annual house price growth since November 2022. On a monthly basis, the rise was 0.7% when compared to August. Nationwide, which bases its index on mortgage data, puts the cost of the average home in September at £266,094.

The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before. It marks the fifth consecutive month of rises. On a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."
Re-Imagining Jobs And Future Proofing Careers In The Age Of AI,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lindsaykohler/2024/10/05/re-imagining-jobs-and-future-proofing-careers-in-the-age-of-ai/,2024-10-05T17:09:49Z,"In the fast-evolving world of work, there is a lot of conversation and theorizing on which jobs might be displaced by generative AI. While many are focused on the threat, there are two more compelling questions to ask. First, which roles are least susceptible to AI disruption? And second, which roles need to evolve in this new era of working -- regardless of the impact of AI?

We're in a time where businesses are increasingly thinking about the composition of the skills they need, the roles within the organization to deliver their strategy, and what outside support is required. A new report from Indeed's Hiring Lab sheds light on the skills and roles employers are seeking in today's market. Regarding the outside support needed to close any gaps, consultants and freelancers remain the go-to resource -- but they need to evolve their craft, too.

Let's look at the impact of AI first on the talent market. The fact remains that there are some jobs that AI cannot easily replace. ""We assessed all the different skills in Indeed job postings, and the jobs least exposed to AI replacement are those that require hands-on work such as driving and nursing, empathetic skills, and childcare,"" says Jack Kennedy, Indeed's senior economist. It seems that the human touch, whether it's physical or emotional, is still something AI cannot easily replicate.

The flip side, of course, is that many jobs are susceptible to AI disruption. ""There's a whole swathe of the job market that, when you break down which tasks are involved, AI can replace or enhance those tasks,"" says Kennedy. ""It can be productivity-enhancing in some instances; it can completely take over tasks in other instances; and still there are other parts of the role that it can't replace. I think a lot of jobs are going to change in the nature of the work required. It's early days, but we're certainly seeing that more job postings include AI-related terms. Interestingly, a lot of the categories where that's prevalent are not in tech. We're seeing it more and more in occupational job postings, such as research and development, media and communications, marketing, art, banking, and architecture. The job descriptions are incorporating this gen-AI phraseology.""

But, for all the hype around AI, the number of Indeed job postings containing AI-related terms is sitting at just 2-3%. ""Despite all of the focus on AI, for many employers they are more focused on basic computer literacy,"" says Kennedy. ""The pool of candidates with advanced AI technical skills is still quite a limited one. We're still in the early stages."" Dan French, CEO of Consider Solutions, agrees. ""The thing about the AI boom right now that we've got to remember is that AI has been around for decades. What's got people excited in the past 18 months is generative AI, which is a very specific niche. And I think there's less mileage in generative AI than people claim.""

In terms of seeking outside resources for support, businesses continue to turn to freelancers and consultants. There's an active narrative around freelancers and the gig economy -- but no one is talking about how the role of the consultant is also due for an overhaul. ""Traditionally, there are two business reasons that people use consultants,"" says French. ""There's either a new executive, or there's some big business problem where executives want to create some time to take a breath, so they hire McKinsey. They almost don't care what the solution is; it just gives them six months to think about what to do next.""

Now, businesses are looking for real partners and getting more value out of their consultants. ""I think businesses are looking for a genuine diagnosis of business problems, but they don't want to outsource the problem anymore -- they want to own the answer. It has to be a collaborative partnership,"" says French. Moreover, consultants must deliver more value if they want to stay in the game. ""I speak to executives every week who say, 'We've just hired XYZ firm at a cost of 12 million, and all we got was a report of everything we told them -- but nothing extra. We could've used generative AI for that,'"" says French.

As we navigate this era of change, employers must get more creative in how they get the job done -- whether that be reimagining roles, accurately assessing the skills needed in the business, or strategically engaging outside support. Employees should consider how they can future-proof their careers. The question for today's workforce is not just ""Will AI take my job?"" but rather, ""How can I re-imagine my role?"" Now is the time to focus on cultivating skills that AI can't replicate, whether that's empathy, hands-on expertise, collaboration, or the ability to think creatively."
5 Questions For The Fed's Austan Goolsbee -- Including: Did They Move Fast Enough On Inflation?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/05/5-questions-for-the-feds-austan-goolsbee-including-did-they-move-fast-enough-on-inflation/,2024-10-05T12:09:41Z,"It's an unusually tense time at the Federal Reserve as Democrats and Republicans -- including former President Donald Trump -- target the central bank as it starts cutting rates in its most significant monetary policy in decades. Forbes spoke with Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, an alternate member on the highly watched Federal Open Market Committee and a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Obama, about how ""super serious"" central bankers feel about becoming a political football ahead of the election, how the Fed is adjusting to easing inflation and growing recession angst, and what he'd change about the ""behind the curve"" policy leading to the worst inflation crisis in the U.S. since the early 1980s.

Forbes: Have there been any discussions at Federal Open Market Committee meetings about pressure from both sides of the political aisle to act in a certain way heading into the election? Context: The FOMC is the U.S. central bank panel that votes on the target federal funds rate, which heavily influences interest rates on loans across the country, impacting inflation, economic growth and unemployment. The Fed is under heightened scrutiny after rolling out the first interest rate cuts since early 2020 last month. The reaction function refers to how a central bank responds to one event, like lowering rates when inflation rises.

When you become a sworn member of the Federal Reserve, you're out of the election business. Everybody takes that super seriously. The things that determine our decisions are: What are the economic conditions and what are the forecasts. What would we need to see to stop raising? What would we need to see to hold? What do we need to see for stuff to come down? We've been laying out the criteria, and now we're just seeing come to pass the stuff that we've been forecasting, and so the reaction function is pretty well established.

Forbes: What are the data points in the labor market that you are paying the closest attention to meeting to meeting? Context: We interviewed Goolsbee two days before the September jobs report surprisingly revealed the strongest job growth since March, decelerating bets on continued aggression from the Fed on lowering rates and throwing another wrench into the central bank shift as borrowing costs look less likely to tumble.

Goolsbee: The unemployment rate, but everybody knows that. A little bit less, the payroll, job employment numbers. There was a time when, if you had asked me ""what's the single most important number?"" I probably would have said that, but not now, with the uncertainty about immigration and the uncertainty about these [revisions to jobs data].

This has been such a strange, unprecedented moment of new firm creation and self employment and different work arrangements. I think that's why we're having such major revisions on these [data points]. All of those things make me put a little bit less weight [on monthly nonfarm payrolls] since there's more of a question mark around [them]. All the measures that we tend to look at as economists to track the labor market - the ratio of vacancies to the number of unemployed, the employment-to-population ratio of prime age workforce, the quit rate, hiring rate, all of those things, plus the the new unemployment claims - I feel like they're all kind of saying the same thing.

The rate of change is all in the direction of cooling. And if you look in the past, it's quite rare that you see cooling labor markets that just settle into full employment. Usually, when things start to go bad, they keep getting worse. And so that's our challenge now: After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?

Forbes: Let's imagine we have that crystal ball and we're able to look forward to the end of next year. We officially stick the landing, core PCE runs right in that sweet spot of about 2%, and the federal funds rate falls to right around the median forecast around 3%. What risks for the second half of the decade are you most worried about? Context: Core PCE is the Fed's favored inflation metric as it tracks how much Americans spend monthly on goods and services outside of more volatile food and energy categories. Projections shared at the FOMC's latest meeting indicate officials have a median forecast of 3.4% at the end of 2025.

Goolsbee: It's productivity growth.

For productivity growth, the [data] matters the most over the long run, and in the short run, it's one of the most noisy [data points] there is. So that's why it's kind of hard to take that into account in the meeting-to-meeting monetary policy decisions. We saw wild swings in that over Covid...but in the last year-and-a-half, that growth rate of productivity has been averaging well higher than the trend before Covid.

Is that a sign that technology has changed, or is it AI? Is it something else? Is it hybrid work? Is it the business dynamism that we've had all these startups? Because if the productivity growth rate is going to be higher, even if not permanent [but] for the medium term, then the second half of the decade we're going to have a bunch of discussions like the second half of the 1990s, where there was an extended increase in the productivity growth rate. The implications for the economy are that you can grow faster and have more job growth without inflation in a world like that.

And income, wages are going to go up. Nobody needs to be nervous about wages going up at fast rates, because productivity growth will justify it. To me, that's an overwhelmingly important factor that we're going to have to think about in this second half.

Forbes: You're allowed to time travel back to mid-to-late 2021, right before inflation skyrocketed, and you can change one policy within relative reason. What do you choose? Context: After a decade of sub-3% inflation, prices began rising rapidly in 2021, and consumer price index inflation peaked in June 2022 at a 41-year high of 9.1%. The Fed didn't raise rates, the most common response to inflation, until March 2022, and raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to a two-decade high of over 5% in a 16-month span.

Goolsbee: I think looking back, if you had one thing to change, if you could know that the supply shocks were not going to be transitory in the three or four months sense, you would have started moving earlier.

You would not have been raising with this kind of rapidity that the Fed engaged in, 500 basis points in one year. That's about as fast as it's ever gone up. You would have started earlier but also realistically, I think it's worth considering how much lower you think inflation would be if they had done that. If you could have a crystal ball and have perfect timing and recognize it's not going to be a temporary supply shock lasting three months, it's going to be a temporary supply shock lasting two years, how much less would inflation be?

There were a lot of countries that tried both monetary and fiscal policy a lot of different ways, and, for the most part, they basically had the same inflation experience. It is instructive that there are limits to what the Fed could have done. But if I had one thing to do over - I wasn't on the FOMC at that time - but looking back, they were behind the curve, slow to move.

Forbes: I know you're a big fan of ""The Simpsons"" - what do you think Mr. Burns would want the FOMC to do now? What's the conversation like at Moe's tavern when CNBC comes on after the last FOMC meeting? Context: Goolsbee often references ""The Simpsons,"" the animated comedy which features curmudgeonly nuclear power tycoon Mr. Charles Burns and the pub ""Moe's Tavern,"" where Homer Simpson and his more working class drinking buddies congregate.

Goolsbee: Mr. Burns has, in various episodes, lots of cash, lots of equity and/or lots of bonds. So does he want high rates or low rates? I would like to think Mr. Burns, just out of his own pure self-interest, wants whatever is good for the economy. Financial stability seems like it is the order of the day for him. At Moe's Tavern, there's one of the episodes where they're showing old presidential debates, and Kennedy's like, 'I'd like to express my fondness for Duff beer,' and Richard Nixon's like, 'I would also like to express my fondness for that particular beer,' and it cuts Moe's Tavern. And they're like, 'That guy never drank a Duff in his life!' And I fear that Moe's Tavern, they would not be super enamored of the FOMC, but they should be. We're not the bad guys. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

[Goolsbee revised his Burns response in an email: ""Burns is a notorious gold bug that's still complaining that the Coinage Act got rid of the ha'penny in 1857. He's had it out for the Fed since we tipped off authorities in season 9 that he was the one who stole the 1 Trillion dollar bill after WWII.""]"
Sweden's Environmental Minister Reiterates No Bail Out For Northvolt,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/heatherfarmbrough/2024/10/05/swedens-environmental-minister-reiterates-no-bail-out-for-northvolt/,2024-10-05T08:34:48Z,"Two years ago, the 25-year-old Liberal Romina Pourmokhtari became Sweden's youngest ever minister to take office, taking on the joint responsibilities for Climate and Enterprise.

Early this year, Pourmokhtari and the government's climate policy survived a vote of no confidence, with critics arguing it had failed to include concrete measures to deal with climate change and gone back on many of its earlier climate pledges. Sweden is on track to miss its 2030 targets as a consequence of its decision to cut tax on petrol and diesel and sharply reduce the amount of biofuel that needs to be blended with these fuels.

""Northvolt is an example of how much the economic aspects of production also have to be taken into consideration [as well],"" says Pourmokhtari. At a conference organised by the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in the UK, she ruled out providing finance to Northvolt, the ailing Swedish battery maker. The company's aim is to be the major European battery maker, large enough to be able to compete with CATL, BYD and Tesla. The minister argues adequate private capital available and well equipped; public capital is not.

""I see myself as an important partner to clean tech in Sweden, bringing forward solutions... and enabling Sweden to gain from its expertise and global exports of clean goods and services, providing and lowering emissions all over the world,"" she says in an interview with me after the event.

""I've actually just recently put out an inquiry for our authorities to count the possibilities of how much of a carbon sink Sweden can create by .. [the] export of goods and services lower carbon emissions in other places than our country."" This can get her into trouble.

""I often get criticism [with people asking] why are you doing that? That's just lowering emissions somewhere else.""

Her response is that official politics don't have a cross-boundary perspective necessary [to deal with] the climate crisis. ""Emissions don't stop at the country's borders. They travel freely across our oceans and through our forests and through the products we are importing and exporting. And that perspective is often a bit lacking amongst governments. I try to incorporate it as well as I can, to the extent that I can.""

Sweden's economy still depends to quite a large extent on major industrial companies whose carbon emissions have - for instance, SSAB, Atlas Copco, Scania, Sandvik, SKF, Volvo. Despite unparalleled investments in green steel production, some 12 per cent of Sweden's emissions are still generated by steel manufacturing. While there is a misconception, the minister believes, that the more conservative, traditional industries might be less prone to engage themselves in the risk-taking that comes with climate transition, in fact the opposite is true.

What she can do as a government minister is ensure policies create the conditions for a reliable energy system, a key component of clean steel production. ""If I can provide conditions for them to decrease their emissions by 98%, which is the goal they have set, then I can make a real difference,"" Pourmokhtari says.

""Not standing in their way with the process of applying for permits taking up to seven years, not letting bureaucracy from a completely different time stand in the way of the progress that needs to be made. There is an urgency now, a competitiveness between companies and countries. So we're making very big shifts to how we handle permits, carry out risk analysis and assess the reliability of the infrastructure, and investing in skills and training in universities, in aspects such as battery technology.""

In November 2023 the Swedish government effectively changed policy towards building nuclear reactors and announced it would construct two large-scale reactors by 2035 and the equivalent of 10 new reactors, including small modular reactors, by 2045.

If Northvolt fails, it will be a major economic and political blow to Sweden but the country is on track, Pourmokhtari says, for its 2050 emissions targets. ""We've done this before, in the 1970s when 70% of our electricity system was dependant on imports of oil. We have two decades this time as well."""
The S&P 500 Carry Trade,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevincoldiron/2024/10/04/the-sp-500-carry-trade/,2024-10-05T01:19:00Z,"Tim Lee, Jamie Lee and I published The Rise of Carry in late 2019. We described how and why carry trades have grown to dominate financial markets. The result is that markets, and by extension the global economy, now follow the typical carry trade pattern of small, steady growth punctuated by occasional sudden selloffs.

Now that we have a bit of distance from the August implosion of the yen carry trade it's worth thinking through what REALLY causes these selloffs. Because we will see them again.

It's gratifying to see our ideas become more widely accepted. However, it's still a smidge frustrating that the carry trade we identified as the most important - the S&P 500 - is still not really recognized as such.

In many way that's understandable. Thinking of the ""stock market"" as a carry trade isn't intuitive. We're working on a second book where we'll explain this idea in even more detail. But since the whole world seems to be talking carry trades, I thought I'd use some material from our drafts to discuss it now (and whet your appetite for the next book...)

Below is one of the key passages in the Rise of Carry. The paragraph explains in geeky terms why the S&P 500 is the central global carry trade. I'll try to de-geek it in next 800 words.

The first line - ""S&P 500 volatility has become global volatility"" is straightforward.

The S&P 500 is the most visible and heavily traded risk asset in the world. It's the risk asset at the center of a staggeringly large ecosystem of products that investors around the globe use for speculation and hedging.

Below is a graph I've been working on for the new book. WARNING: it's incomplete1 and I haven't double-checked all the numbers. Still, it presents a fascinating picture of the annual trading volume associated with the key products linked to the S&P 500. And, yes, all the numbers are in trillions of dollars.

No other equity market comes close to this hyper-liquid ecosystem and this makes the S&P 500 the global epicenter for risk taking and risk hedging. S&P 500 volatility is therefore a proxy for volatility of risk assets everywhere.

Now for the geekier bits.

How does this turn S&P 500 volatility into ""generic liquidity risk""? And why would this ""define the value of money""?

Being ""liquid"" means having access to cash. For levered traders that means being able to quickly and cheaply sell what they own in exchange for cash. In The Rise of Carry we document how the world has grown ever more levered over time. Each year more actors need more liquidity. The S&P 500 ecosystem has grown in a symbiotic fashion to provide it.

The table below is a very simple stylized example of a levered trader's need for liquidity. The trader starts Day 1 with $100 and borrows an additional $100 to buy the S&P 500. The first row is the trader's balance sheet after setting up this levered position. If the S&P 500 falls by 10% on Day 2, leverage goes up to 225%. To return it to 200% the trader needs to sell $20 worth of the market and use the cash - the liquidity they've accessed - to pay down their debt. Once they've done this they're back their starting leverage.

Even though it's very simple, the example highlights three important points.

First, reducing leverage back to target involves trading with the market - selling after it falls.

Second, this trading is not optional. Ok, for small market moves it is - lenders allow leverage to fluctuate around agreed levels. But for big moves the trader must sell to reduce leverage or the person that lent them the money will do it for them.

Third, to supply the liquidity the levered trader needs, some brave soul (or brave algorithm) must take the other side.

I say ""brave"" because the liquidity supplier buys as the market falls. This exposes them to crashes. For example, imagine you supply liquidity by purchasing the S&P 500 when it's down 3% on Friday. If it falls another 3% on Monday you're nursing losses and far less willing to supply yet more liquidity.

It's easy to see how the non-linear, sharp falls we experienced in the last few days emerge. A big enough jump in volatility causes liquidity supply to fall just as liquidity demand rises. That's what we mean by volatility ""defining the value of money"". When volatility spikes, the value of having cash goes up. And the volatility that matters is S&P 500 volatility because that is a proxy for generic risk asset volatility.

Why should providing this type of liquidity be the ""best paying risk in the world""? Because you can't diversify it away. When S&P 500 volatility spikes there is literally nowhere to hide. Suppliers of liquidity in the S&P 500 ecosystem are taking on the risk of a global crash. That's why their risk should very well compensated.

The S&P 500 ecosystem didn't always work this way. At the start of the carry regime it was more like the stock market we read about in textbooks, where things like earnings and interest rates are the main drivers. Below is my graph of the ecosystem from 1995. Index options did exist but volumes were tiny, so I left them out.

Calling this an ""ecosystem"" is a stretch. Still, the futures were liquid enough to give the S&P 500 an advantage over other markets in terms of being the preferred location for speculating and hedging. From there growth in the market value of the index, the assets controlled by levered traders and the range of related derivative products reinforced each other. Gradually and steadily the S&P 500 ecosystem became the central risk marketplace it is today.

When volatility rises a reflexive feedback loop develops within this ecosystem. Liquidity providers pull back and that forces liquidity demanders - the levered traders - to sell at lower prices. That in turn pushes prices lower and causes a further diminution in liquidity supply.

Most of the time this doesn't happen. In fact most of the time there are plenty of liquidity suppliers and their activity helps the market self-stabilize. But when some force, random or fundamental, triggers a big enough jump in volatility, the feedback loop switches to being self-reinforcing and we get a sudden crash.

This is how carry trades work. They make money ""when nothing happens"", when volatility is stable or falling. But when something does happen and volatility spikes we get a sudden and very sharp drawdown. That's exactly the pattern of returns the S&P 500 has adopted as the carry regime has progressed over the last thirty years. And that's why we say the ""absorption of generic liquidity risk must convert the S&P 500 into a giant carry trade"".

This isn't your grandfather's S&P 500. It's the most important carry trade in a world awash with them."
Has The Fed Cut Rates Too Much And Too Soon?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2024/10/04/has-the-fed-cut-rates-too-much-and-too-soon/,2024-10-04T19:53:12Z,"Winter it seems, across much of Europe, has come early. Two instincts that grow as the evenings darken are the inclination to have a tipple in the evening and to watch a good film. One Danish work that captures both sentiments is 'Druk' or 'Another Round', which won the Oscar for best international film in 2021. I recommend it.

In the film a group of four school teacher friends decide to test the hypothesis of a Norwegian psychologist that humans have a deficiency of alcohol in their blood, and the protagonists undertake an experiment to maintain a 'warm' level of alcohol in their blood. It is an experiment I attempt often, but the real lesson today is with central banking.

It seems that central bankers have decided that in the spirit of 'Druk', the liquidity in the world financial system is not sufficient and have set out to administer near daily injections of cheap money. The number of central banks changing policy (i.e. to negative) is the greatest it has been, apart from the global financial crisis and the COVID period. In September alone there have been 24 rate cuts from central banks around the world.

Chief amongst these has been the 50-basis point cut from the Federal Reserve and the very dramatic, multiple policy moves by China. In short China has cut rates, infused the banking system, made mortgages cheaper and generally tried to spread liquidity over the emerging cracks in China's economy. In the spirit of 'Druk' it is the equivalent of going on a five day bender in order to cure a serious disease.

Nonetheless, the easing in policy from the Fed and China, together with what will likely be a couple of more rate cuts this year from the European Central Bank mean that the world financial system is flush with liquidity. Chinese markets - hitherto the worst performing markets of a major economy - show the impact and importance of liquidity. The market cap of the Hang Seng index has grown by a quarter in less than two weeks. China has overtaken the US in terms of equity market performance to date.

There is no change to fundamentals - I don't see this policy move having a decisive impact on the downward trend in Chinese earnings, but that doesn't matter in the near term - liquidity is coursing through the pipes of the Chinese financial system, and in turn might bring a temporary easing to conditions in the property market.

For all the analysts who devote time to measuring earnings and calibrating valuations, the reality is that in this era of 'quick to please' monetary policy, liquidity matters a lot for asset prices. My rule of thumb in constructing a measure of liquidity would encompass money supply, the state of central bank balance sheets, the key role of the dollar and net issuance of debt by treasuries.

The arcane notion of financial liquidity has attracted enough attention that the Financial Times recently ran an article breaking down its component parts. A couple of top-flight economics consultancies run their own measures of liquidity - such as LongView Economics and Michael Howell at CrossBorder Capital. The latter holds that we are on the cusp of a significant upswing in global liquidity.

If that is true, the implication for markets is 'Druk'- a persistent giddyiness whilst central banks keep rates low and liquidity flush, amidst an acceptable level of GDP and profit growth. Friday's job market figures in the US were very strong, suggesting that in fact there was no need for a large rate cut. This is the kind of macro climate we have seen in the mid and late 1990's, and one that tends to dampen the market implications of turbulent geopolitics.

From the point of view of asset prices, there are a couple of possible trajectories. Historically, the Fed has started to cut interest rates when the price to earnings ratio on the S&P 500 has been close to 10 times (1960's to 1990's). Now, like in 2000, it is in the mid 20's which suggests that extra liquidity now could run asset prices in bubble territory proper, and cultivate the next bout of inflation, something the central banks' bank, the BIS, has warned about (helpfully the BIS has taken a counter view to that of its members ahead of a number of crisis).

For the time being, the upturn in liquidity may be most meaningful for capital markets activity and assets in the private economy. They have been in the doldrums. If the 'Druk' hypothesis is working we should see a rise in IPO activity into 2025, and intensification in private equity deals and a rise in funding activity (beyond AI firms) in venture."
Broke And Unemployed? Here Are 5 Steps To Financial Recovery,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/truetamplin/2024/10/04/what-if-youre-broke-and-unemployed-5-steps-to-financial-recovery/,2024-10-04T18:13:03Z,"Being broke and unemployed is undoubtedly one of the most stressful financial situations one can face, with the pressure to make ends meet -- buying food, paying rent, or keeping the lights on -- seemingly impossible. Nonetheless, there are steps you can take to regain control. This article offers practical strategies to help reduce expenses, access assistance, and quickly generate income. By taking swift action, you can ease financial pressure and work toward long-term stability. Even in difficult times, small, focused efforts can make a significant difference in securing your financial future.

Before making decisions about managing your finances, you must first fully understand where you stand. Knowing the extent of your resources and liabilities will provide a clearer picture of what needs to be done.

Gather a complete list of all available resources, such as any cash you have on hand, money in checking and savings accounts, or funds held in PayPal or other payment services. You should also consider any assets that you could potentially liquidate, such as unused electronics, jewelry, or other valuables.

This step serves as your financial baseline, a way to determine how much you have to work with. While the number may seem small, it's crucial to have clarity on the exact amount of money you can draw from in the short term.

The next step is to examine where your money is going. Categorize your expenses into essential and non-essential groups. Essentials are things like rent, utilities, food, and transportation. Non-essentials may include streaming services, dining out, entertainment, or other discretionary purchases.

A detailed breakdown of your spending will enable you to construct a minimal budget centered around survival. This is the initial stage of identifying areas where you can cut back.

Based on your expenses, you'll need to estimate how much money is required to cover your essential costs over the next one to three months. This timeframe provides a short-term view, allowing you to focus on immediate survival while planning for longer-term recovery.

Write down exactly how much you need for basic living expenses and subtract this from your current assets to understand any pressing shortfall.

This is one of the most critical steps in managing a financial crisis. In some cases, it might mean making difficult decisions about what to cut, but reducing expenses as quickly as possible is necessary to stretch your available resources.

Cancel or pause your streaming services, gym memberships, or other subscriptions. Even though these services may provide comfort or routine, they are not important for survival.

You should also refrain from dining out, going to the movies, or shopping. By cutting out all non-essential expenditures, you can redirect the money saved toward critical living costs.

Many service providers, from utilities to ISPs, are willing to offer flexible payment plans or temporary reductions for individuals facing financial hardship. Contact these companies directly and explain your situation.

Landlords may also be willing to negotiate, particularly if you're at risk of eviction. Depending on your location, there may be legal protections against eviction for those who are unemployed. Negotiating can buy you time, reduce your financial burden, and prevent essential services from being cut off.

If you are carrying debt, reach out to creditors to explore options for deferring payments, reducing interest rates, or restructuring your debt. Some creditors offer hardship programs designed for individuals going through periods of unemployment or financial crisis.

If deferring payments isn't an option, focus on making minimum payments to avoid additional late fees or damage to your credit score. Although debt can be stressful, your basic needs, such as housing and food, should take precedence over aggressive debt repayment during this time.

There are a variety of emergency assistance programs available, designed to help you cover essential costs like food, housing, and utilities when you cannot do so on your own.

Several government programs offer financial assistance to those who are unemployed and struggling. Unemployment insurance provides temporary income to eligible individuals who lost their jobs through no fault of their own, and can be applied for through your state's Department of Labor.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program helps low-income individuals and families purchase groceries, while Temporary Assistance for Needy Families provides cash assistance for basic living expenses. For healthcare, Medicaid offers free or low-cost coverage to qualifying individuals based on income. Research what programs you qualify for and apply as soon as possible. These programs can provide the financial lifeline you need to get through the toughest months of unemployment.

In addition to government assistance, many charitable organizations provide food, housing assistance, and other resources to those in need. Local food banks can provide groceries, allowing you to cut food costs from your budget while still ensuring you and your family are fed.

Non-profit organizations often offer rental assistance, emergency housing, and utility support. Religious organizations may also provide financial aid or community support. These resources are usually available at little to no cost and can offer significant relief.

Even with reduced expenses and assistance programs, there may still be a gap between your needs and available resources. You can earn money quickly through these temporary measures:

Look around your home for items you no longer need or use that can be sold, such as electronics, furniture, appliances, or even clothing. Use platforms like eBay, Craigslist, or Facebook Marketplace to post these items for sale.

While this isn't a long-term solution, it can provide the funds needed to cover a bill or buy groceries. Even small sales can add up and provide some breathing room in your budget.

If selling items isn't enough, you might consider short-term borrowing. You can ask friends or family to lend you cash, but be sure to communicate clearly about repayment terms to avoid straining personal relationships.

You may also consider taking out a personal loan from a credit union. However, be cautious with payday loans or other high-interest borrowing options, as these can trap you in a cycle of debt that's difficult to escape.

The gig economy offers numerous opportunities to earn an income without the need for long-term commitment. Apps like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, TaskRabbit, and Upwork allow you to take on freelance work, driving, or small tasks that can bring in money quickly.

Many of these jobs offer flexibility, allowing you to work as much or as little as you need. While gig work may not provide the stability of a full-time job, it can be a useful short-term strategy to cover your essential expenses during this period.

After stabilizing your immediate financial situation, the next step is to focus on building a strong foundation for long-term financial health. This involves not only finding a sustainable income but also creating a financial safety net and developing better financial habits. By addressing these three critical areas, you'll be better prepared to weather future financial challenges and steadily build wealth.

Securing stable employment is a crucial part of moving forward financially. Be strategic and persistent in your job hunt. Reach out to former colleagues, connect with industry groups, and engage on professional platforms like LinkedIn. Remember to tailor your resume for specific roles and focus on sectors that align with your goals.

You may also use this period of unemployment as an opportunity to reassess your career path and identify ways to enhance your job prospects. Instead of rushing to accept any available job, think about how you can increase your skills and qualifications to align with industries that offer better job security and growth potential.

After you've landed a stable job, your next priority is building a financial safety net. This will protect you from future emergencies and give you peace of mind knowing you have a buffer to fall back on in times of crisis.

Establish an emergency fund and aim to save three to six months' worth of living expenses to cover unforeseen situations like job loss, medical emergencies, or major car repairs. Building this fund may take a while, but even small, regular contributions can grow significantly over time. Automate your savings to ensure consistency, with a portion of each paycheck regularly transferred into a separate savings account.

If you incurred debt during unemployment, managing and reducing it is key to improving your financial standing. Prioritize paying off high-interest debt first, such as credit cards, as these can quickly spiral if left unchecked. Once your debts are under control, your available income can be directed toward savings and investments, allowing you to focus on long-term financial growth.

This will ensure you don't fall into financial crisis again. For example, budgeting is the foundation of good financial management. There are several tools and apps that simplify the budgeting process and allow you to track your spending more efficiently.

Aside from short-term budgeting, think about the bigger financial picture. Set concrete goals such as saving for retirement, buying a home, building a business, or investing for future growth. For instance, if your employer offers a retirement plan, contribute as much as possible, particularly if they provide matching contributions. You may also consider investing in low-risk, diversified options like index funds or ETFs.

Even modest, consistent investments can benefit from compound interest, significantly increasing your wealth in the long run. Or if you have an entrepreneurial spirit, there are ways to start a business with zero capital. Whatever you decide, remember that your investment strategy should align with your goals and risk tolerance to ensure that you're building a secure financial future.

The struggle of unemployment and financial hardship can be overwhelming. However, by making timely interventions to cut expenses, access emergency resources, and generate quick cash, you can alleviate some of the pressure and maintain control over your financial situation. Remember to remain proactive and seek help when needed. Financial recovery is possible, and by taking it one step at a time, you can move toward a brighter future."

AI Training Data Dilemma: Legal Experts Argue For 'Fair Use',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2024/10/04/ai-training-data-dilemma-legal-experts-argue-for-fair-use/,2024-10-04T16:28:49Z,"In the race to build smarter Artificial Intelligence (AI), should knowledge be locked behind paywalls or flow freely? Generative AI, as a technology djinn, has burst onto the digital scene, enhancing productivity by answering questions, solving complex problems, and creating content across multiple domains -- capabilities that are only possible thanks to breakthroughs in machine learning (ML).

The Legal Battleground: Creators vs. Tech Giants

Beneath this magical facade lies a brewing conflict that pits content owners against tech giants. Content owners have filed several lawsuits against AI companies: Getty Images sued Stability AI over image use; authors like Sarah Silverman sued Meta and OpenAI for using their books without permission; the New York Times and eight daily newspapers have taken legal action against OpenAI and Microsoft for utilizing their articles; and Artists have filed a class-action lawsuit against Midjourney and Stability AI, and more. The crux of the matter is the alleged unauthorized use of copyrighted works to train AI models.

An AI track mimicking Drake and The Weeknd hit streaming platforms before legal removal; Wacom and Hasbro facing backlash for using AI images in marketing; OpenAI's Sora producing realistic videos from text prompts; AI language models are generating news articles and opinion pieces; and more. Over 200 artists signed an open letter against AI voice cloning; Wizards of the Coast admitted to using AI in marketing materials for Magic: The Gathering (tabletop and digital collectible card game); ongoing lawsuits debating copyright infringement in AI training; and discussions continuing on ethical guidelines for AI-generated content.

At first glance, the solution seems deceptively simple -- make the tech giants pay for the training data. But this knee-jerk reaction could be a Trojan horse. By erecting a paywall around data, one risks not only fortifying the very monopolies that are being challenged but also concentrating AI's benefits in the hands of established cash-rich tech corporations rather than distributing them widely across society.

Restricting AI's access to the vast repository of data and knowledge, on the other hand, will severely hamper its ability to learn, significantly impeding potential advancements and curtailing broad societal benefits. And, if AI trains and learns from its own outputs or synthetic data, it risks a downward spiral where its output becomes less varied, less accurate, and of lower quality, leading to hallucinations -- a process researchers call ""model collapse.""

In fact, many legal scholars argue that ML systems should generally be allowed to use copyrighted databases for training purposes under the already established ""fair use""doctrine.

Fair Use and Fair Learning

While it may appear that AI tools create content from nothing, this is not the case. Behind the scenes, generative AI platforms are trained and developed on massive datascapes and question snippets, leveraging billions of parameters constructed by software processing massive archives of images and text data.

Dan Cahoy, a Professor of Business Law at Penn State's Smeal College of Business, states, ""Ultimately, there are four broad and somewhat amorphous factors to determine fair use: the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and the effect on the potential market for the original work. The first factor generally favors fair use if the work is ""transformed"" into something that is different in terms of its message or use from the original. It looks at whether new ideas, meanings, or value has been added for a different audience. This change might create fresh information, artistic elements, insights, or viewpoints beyond simply copying the original.""

Mark Lemley, the William H. Neukom Professor of Law at Stanford Law School and the Director of the Stanford Program in Law, Science, and Technology, writes about ML models in a recent paper, ""To perform, they must first learn how -- generally, through a process of trial-and-error of epic proportions. And in order to create the right conditions for this learning process, engineers must begin by collecting and compiling enormous databases of exemplary tasks for machines to practice on, known as ""training sets."" ML systems generally require a more permanent training data set to test successive iterations of the software against. [...] Creating a training set of millions of examples almost always requires, first, copying many more millions of images, videos, audio, or text-based works. Those works are almost all copyrighted."" It's like creating the ultimate study guide.

Lemley posits further, ""AI isn't competing with authors or artists. Instead, it is using their work in an entirely different manner. [...] ML systems generally copy works, not to get access to their creative expression (the part of the work the law protects), but to get access to the uncopyrightable parts of the work -- the ideas, facts, and linguistic structure of the works."" He proposes 'fair learning' as a principle that the use of copyrighted works to train ML systems should be fair even if fair use factors -- the nature of the work, and the amount taken would otherwise weigh against fair use.

Take a language AI model trained on millions of books. It's not interested in the stories, characters, or themes; instead, it aims to learn linguistic patterns - things like grammar rules, sentence structures, and word relationships. Similarly, for an AI model to learn what a dog looks like, it needs to analyze millions of dog photos. The system isn't interested in the artistic composition or the specific dog in each photo - elements that might be protected by copyright. Instead, it's learning to recognize general features like fur, four legs, tails, and typical dog shapes. In fact, ""verbatim copying"" is the necessary intermediate step toward accessing the unprotectable ""ideas and functional elements"" of works that allow AI systems to learn generalizable patterns and concepts rather than simply memorizing specific content. AI models instead encode patterns from training data into parameters, generating responses using learned probabilities and not by referencing stored content.

The concept of ""enablement"" in patent law requires inventors to fully disclose their innovations in depth -- akin to a detailed recipe or instruction manual containing all essential information to teach someone skilled in the field to understand, use, and recreate the invention. The principle of ""thorough knowledge"" sharing underpins the legal framework to drive progress and should apply to the ethos of both human inventions and ML.

Behind the Curtain: AI's Insatiable Data Appetite

To illustrate AI's exponential appetite for data, consider the GPT series' evolution: GPT-1 (117M) → GPT-2 (1.5B) → GPT-3 (175B) → GPT-4 (est. 1T*). This approximately 8,547-fold increase in parameters (the AI's adjustable components) over four generations helps explain why AI needs vast datasets. More parameters allow AI to understand the context and generate human-like responses across diverse topics but require exponentially more training data.

The unprecedented scale of data required to train modern AI models lies at the heart of the current controversy. At a certain point, it's no longer about selecting data; it's about crawling the entire internet. Both ML systems and humans learn from information, but machines require vastly more data to excel at tasks.

Colossal Expenditures into Widespread Technological Empowerment

Developing large ML models not only requires massive amounts of data - it also demands enormous capital investments in data centers, top-tier tech talent, mega-scale energy utilities, and infrastructure. The scale of this spending is staggering. In the latest quarter alone, tech giants Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta poured a combined $52.9 billion into capital expenditures. Meanwhile, venture capital firms are investing $64.1 billion in AI startups so far in 2024.

Despite the huge upfront costs borne by tech companies and investors, the benefits of AI are poised to ripple across the entire business and consumer landscape. Enterprises of all sizes and individuals will be able to piggyback on these AI breakthroughs through efficiencies in the AI value chain. As a result, they will be able to solve their unique problems: streamline operations, create new services, boost productivity, and spark innovation -- all without spending billions on research and development. The features and benefits of AI will be broad and egalitarian, empowering businesses, individuals, and diverse sectors globally to dramatically enhance productivity and actively shape the evolving economy.

AI's Creative Surge Challenges Art, Ethics, and Law

AI-generated content is blurring the lines between human and machine-made art and challenging notions of creativity, authenticity, and human expression. AI can create artwork in the style of celebrated masters, compose music as fluently as skilled musicians, play complex strategy games, write software, produce writings that are difficult to distinguish from those of real journalists, and more -- all at a blazing speed. While these AI feats inspire awe, they simultaneously fuel worries about artificial intelligence as a genuine competitive threat. And what we're seeing now is just the tip of the iceberg in AI's potential.

The uncannily realistic AI outputs are sparking debates about intellectual property rights, attribution, and accountability. Who can claim the right to an AI-produced image, text, or song as their own? Artists whose works are part of the massive training data sets that the computers utilize to generate their results should be credited and paid for? How should the legal system respond to the blurring lines between human and AI-created works?

Copyright Law: Adapting to the AI Era

Rebecca Tushnet, who teaches law at Harvard, has a different take on this. She believes the rules about who owns creative work are already pretty clear when it comes to using AI. Tushnet points out that for a long time, the U.S. Copyright Office has only given copyright to things that were mainly made by actual people. She says courts have backed this up over and over. In her words, ""The U.S. courts are generally in agreement that you need a human being sufficiently in the loop to have an author. And a lot of AI-generated works are not that."" Basically, she's saying that if a computer does most of the work, it might not count as something you can copyright.

Imagine an AI system trained to recognize Prince across various artistic representations, processing millions of images, including Warhol's iconic pop-art portraits. While the AI's goal is simply to identify Prince within all artistic variations, it's not specifically trying to learn Warhol's techniques. Yet the model inadvertently gains the ability to mimic Warhol's style as a byproduct of its extensive training.

Such cases raise questions about authenticity and artistic content ownership across myriad creative genres, not just visual art, and allude to why many lawsuits are making their way through the legal system. However, in the short term, the low-hanging solutions are with the companies themselves.

Solutions are already being implemented in the form of bot-filters to prevent the output of content that closely resembles existing copyrighted works. YouTube uses technology to spot when someone uploads a video with copyrighted music or clips; once it catches these, it takes them down automatically. AI companies could similarly build smart filters that look at what their AI is producing and conclude, ""This looks an awful lot like that famous painting,"" or ""This tune is super close to that hit song from last year."" If it's about to spit out something that's practically a carbon copy of something that already exists, these filters would step in and block it.

Professor Lynda Oswald of the University of Michigan sums it up: ""One of the biggest legal challenges of the mid-21st century will be figuring out how to regulate AI effectively. Consider the complexity of the ownership and monetization issues posed by AI and its voracious consumption of data, the breakneck pace of advancing AI technology and the shuffling pace of the law trailing behind it, and the diverse and often conflicting interests and objectives of the myriad stakeholders involved. Crafting a regulatory response that adequately accounts for all of these factors and allows AI development to proceed on an orderly track will be a herculean task.""

Conclusion

As we navigate the complex landscape of AI and copyright law, a nuanced understanding is emerging. Legal scholars suggest two key points: the input data used for AI training may often be permitted under ""fair use"" or ""fair learning."" At the same time, purely machine-produced output is typically not copyrightable. This perspective recognizes that ML, at its core, is about extracting patterns and facts rather than copying creative expression. Ultimately, fair use is about more than transforming existing works. It's about preserving our collective ability to create, share, and build upon ideas. Or it's about preserving the ability to learn -- whether the entity doing the learning is a human or a machine."
"With Robust Hiring In September, Here's What Lies Ahead For Job Seekers In October And November",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/10/04/with-robust-hiring-in-september-heres-what-lies-ahead-for-job-seekers-in-october-and-november/,2024-10-04T16:28:16Z,"The job market in September showed remarkable strength as the United States economy added 254,000 new jobs last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday.

Hiring lived up to the hype of the ""September surge,"" as the government data outpaced the Dow Jones consensus forecast of 150,000. Employment continued to rise in sectors such as food services and drinking establishments, healthcare, government, social assistance and construction, while unemployment fell to 4.1%.

August's total was adjusted upward by 17,000, while July experienced a significant increase of 55,000, bringing the overall monthly growth to 144,000.

Adding to the positive momentum, the Federal Reserve is anticipated to implement another interest rate reduction on November 7, following an initial cut on September 18.

Market projections suggest a 0.25% decrease in interest rates, bringing them to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. However, there's a possibility of a more substantial 0.5% cut, contingent on the economic data released in the upcoming weeks.

Looking ahead, this buoyant hiring mood could continue into the coming months, potentially leading to further job growth. Although, challenges remain for job seekers, as competition for positions may intensify.

As October and early November roll in, job hunters find themselves in a prime window of opportunity, with many companies generally eager to fill positions before the holiday season commences.

Historically, this period often sees an uptick in hiring activity as businesses look to maximize their remaining budgets before year-end. The fall hiring season typically parallels the busy recruitment cycle of January and February, which are peak months for interviews as staff return from vacations, according to Indeed.

However, candidates must act swiftly, as this productive phase is fleeting, with a slowdown expected to take hold around Thanksgiving.

Moreover, the current economic climate has introduced some uncertainty to this hiring pattern. Job growth has been slowing overall, with the economy adding fewer monthly jobs compared to the previous years.

The average monthly gain over the past 12 months is 203,000, down from 251,000 in 2023, 377,000 in 2022 and 604,000 in 2021, according to BLS.

Job seekers should approach this period with realistic and flexible expectations, as well as a well-prepared strategy -- such as networking -- to maximize their chances of success. With fewer job openings, competition may be fiercer.

Certain sectors may still see increased hiring activity. Industries directly affected by the holiday season, such as retail and hospitality, often ramp up seasonal hiring during this period.

Amazon announced on Wednesday its plans to hire 250,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal roles across its customer fulfillment and transportation operations in the U.S."
Why Leaders Who Can't Unplug Are Sabotaging Their Own Success,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/soulaimagourani/2024/10/04/why-leaders-who-cant-unplug-are-sabotaging-their-own-success/,2024-10-04T16:28:15Z,"Burned-out leaders lead burned-out companies... but's be honest: taking a real vacation feels almost impossible. Over half of U.S. workers admit they're still checking in with colleagues during their time off, according to LinkedIn's Workforce Confidence survey.

And here's the kicker: the higher you climb in the leadership ranks, the worse it gets. Nearly 80% of directors and senior leaders are guilty of doing the same, and they're carrying something even more dangerous -- guilt.

Yes, guilt. The kind that gnaws at you when you're sipping a cocktail on the beach but still sneaks a glance at your phone. The kind that tells you that stepping away, even for a week, could make everything fall apart. So, you stay tethered to your email, half-present, and ironically, half-effective. But this is where we need to take a step back and think about the real cost of this behavior -- not just to us as leaders but to our teams and businesses.

Let's break this down. Why are leaders so bad at unplugging? According to the data, 41% of senior leaders feel guilty for even daring to take a break, compared to 35% of individual contributors. The higher you go, the more that guilt tightens. I've been there. When you're responsible for strategy, people, and performance, there's a pervasive feeling that things might unravel if you're not constantly ""on.""

But the problem isn't just personal -- it's cultural.

Many organizations (and their investors) expect leaders to be always available, equating constant accessibility with dedication. It's as if taking time off signals a lack of commitment, and that's where things start to break down. In reality, an ""always-on"" leader isn't showing commitment; they're showcasing a lack of trust -- in themselves, their teams, and the systems they've built.

You're not just fighting your instincts; you're up against company culture. Many businesses run on the belief that if you're out of sight, you're out of touch. This creates a toxic feedback loop where everyone needs to be plugged in 24/7, no matter the cost to personal well-being. And let's be real: technology hasn't helped. Our phones are both the tools that keep us connected and the shackles that make it impossible to step away.

Think about the message this sends to your team. If you can't take a break without checking in, why would they feel empowered to unplug themselves? Leadership sets the tone, and when leaders can't truly disconnect, neither can their people. We end up with an entire organization running on fumes, constantly reacting instead of being proactive.

Now, add a layer of complexity: global organizations. In the U.S., long hours and minimal vacation days are almost seen as badges of honor. But in countries like France or Denmark, where taking time off is sacred, the contrast is stark. These countries understand something we haven't quite mastered here -- that real breaks lead to real productivity.

As leaders in a global economy, we need to recognize that the way we handle work-life balance can vary drastically across borders. What works in New York doesn't necessarily work in Paris. So, the question becomes: how do you create a culture that supports your team in a way that's culturally aware but universally healthy?

The real challenge is figuring out how to disconnect in a world that's wired for constant connection. The truth is, completely ""going dark"" might not be realistic for many leaders, but there are ways to make it manageable without sacrificing sanity -- or productivity.

Here's what works:

Let's get practical. If you're constantly checking in, you're not leading with your best energy, creativity, or clarity. You're not bringing new ideas to the table or inspiring your team. You're firefighting instead of building.

At the end of the day, time off isn't just a perk. It's a necessity for leadership success. And frankly, your business will benefit more from you fully recharged than half-engaged.

So, the next time you're tempted to check that email on vacation (or during the weekend), ask yourself: is this really what great leadership looks like? Or is the real power in stepping back, trusting your team, and coming back ready to take on what's next?"
China's 30% Stock Rally Has An Economic Problem,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2024/10/04/chinas-30-stock-rally-has-an-economic-problem/,2024-10-04T15:42:59Z,"The bulls charging through Shanghai are beginning to look over their shoulders.

Gaining on them is economic reality that has many wondering if the more than 30% surge in equities from a September low is overdone. The problem is an underlying economy facing intensifying headwinds. And one failing to keep pace with the sudden surge in investor optimism toward China.

This stock rally follows an extraordinary barrage of moves to cut interest rates, slash mortgage rates, relax rules for homebuyers in major cities and lower the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping is hinting at bigger steps to come to boost national growth.

These maneuvers changed the subject from China's deflation-generating property crisis, high youth unemployment and weak consumer demand.

Not for long, though, as Chinese data suggest more trouble ahead. In August, industrial industry profits plunged 17.8% from a year earlier, the sharpest contraction so far in 2024. Other data on retail sales and fixed asset investment add to worries Asia's biggest economy is slowing anew.

So much so that some economists think Xi's Communist Party should issue about 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) in special debt to lift confidence via infrastructure projects. Count Jia Kang, head of private think tank China Academy of New Supply-Side Economics, among them.

""As these projects get underway, they will create jobs, increase income for citizens, and unlock consumption potential,"" says Jia, the former head of a research institute linked to the Ministry of Finance, told Chinese publication The Paper.

In other words, what Team Xi has done to date isn't gaining the traction economists hoped. One problem is that China is doing more to throw money at the forces generating deflation than implementing policies to reverse them.

Hence concerns that the stock surge is racing ahead of concrete efforts to raise China's economic game. Or even to meet this year's 5% growth target in credible ways.

It's a reminder that China needs to treat the underlying causes of its economic slump, not just the symptoms. It was those causes that had Chinese shares plunging two weeks ago. That selloff reflected concerns the economy is stumbling.

Yet even as the bulls charge again, those concerns remain real.

In an op-ed for news organization Project Syndicate, Chinese economist Yu Yongding argues ""it's fair to say that China's 'economic miracle' of maintaining an average annual growth rate of 10% is over. Still, I believe that with wise macroeconomic policy, market-oriented reforms, and a genuine commitment to opening up its economy, the economy should be able to maintain a solid growth rate of 5-6% for the foreseeable future.""

Yu was on the Chinese central bank's monetary committee. Now, he's on the frontlines of another epochal debate.

""Chinese economists have debated for years whether policymakers should adopt more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate GDP growth, or focus instead on structural reforms aimed at eliminating overcapacity,"" Yu argues. ""But given this year's lackluster economic performance, their views are increasingly aligned. In fact, one could even say that all Chinese economists now advocate expansionary measures.""

Even more important, though, are steps to end the property crisis once and for all. Lessons from Japan abound. In the 1990s, Tokyo acted glacially to get bad loans off banks' balance sheets, paving the way for 25 years of deflation.

Japan comparisons only go so far with China. But the slow pace of stabilizing a property sector pivotal to gross domestic product has helped no one in China. It's the biggest cause of Chinese deflation.

Xi's inner circle has been slow to get bad assets off property developers' balance sheets. It's lacked urgency to address China's fast-aging population and catalyze a bigger, more disruptive startup boom. It's been too slow for comfort to build social safety nets to encourage households to save less and spend more.

Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's Analytics, can't help but think back to a market mini-crash that happened nine years ago. Recent data suggest Chinese officials aren't recalling the lessons from Tokyo's lost decade.

""Outside of the pandemic, this is the lowest it has been since the 2015 stock market crash,"" Cruise says. ""With the domestic economy struggling, deflation fears are elevated.""

The 2015 crash still traumatizes Xi's party. In a three-week period, from July to August 2015, Chinese shares plunged 30%. At the time, China Inc. circled the wagons. Xi's party pumped tidal waves of state funds into markets, scrapped all initial public offerings, suspended trading in thousands of companies and let mainlanders pledge homes as collateral to buy shares.

Yet then, as now, Beijing did more to address symptoms than the underlying causes. The more the bulls catch on, the more Chinese stocks may be vulnerable to a big correction."
Why Are Concert Tickets So Expensive? It's Not (Entirely) Ticketmaster's Fault,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/why-are-concert-tickets-so-expensive/,2024-10-04T14:34:44Z,"These days, it seems like snagging affordably priced tickets to a concert should be its own Olympic sport. It wasn't that long ago when Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain was famously shocked to learn some musicians charged $50 or more per ticket; in comparison, Nirvana was only charging about $17. If someone told you today they got a ticket to a Taylor Swift concert for only $50, you'd probably wonder where they found their magic lamp. Which leads to the inevitable question: Why are concert tickets so expensive these days?

To find out why things have changed so much in the live entertainment industry, we spoke to Eric Renner Brown, senior editor at Billboard and a former staff writer and editor at the concert-centric publication Pollstar, as well as Tatiana Cirisano, a senior music industry analyst at MIDiA Research and a former music business reporter at Billboard.

As you might imagine, it's a little complicated, with multiple factors conspiring to raise prices. Some factors, such as inflation, aren't especially surprising, but others are more subtle and involve the way modern day musicians make money right now.

As with other sectors of the economy, inflation has impacted the concert industry, causing the price of supplies to spiral upward. But there's more to it than that, because it largely started during the COVID-19 pandemic.

When the global economy slowed down and large public gatherings stopped in 2019 and 2020, many professionals were forced to take a step back from their work when concerts were canceled for health and safety reasons.

""A lot of bus drivers and truck drivers who transport musicians and crews, and, in some cases, semi-trucks full of production equipment for tours -- a lot of those people left the concert business,"" says Brown. ""They went to work in freight trucking, Amazon and other big companies transporting goods because that was still happening during the pandemic.""

Once concerts started up again, however, getting those workers back into the touring business didn't happen right away. With fewer people available to work on tours, wages (and consequently prices) escalated. So if concert producers wanted those goods and services, they had to pay more for them, post-pandemic. That lead directly to higher ticket prices.

Cirisano adds that inflation affects the cost of everything, including the gas to get to tour stops, airfare and hotel accommodations. There's also been a multi-year global supply chain crisis, which impacted many goods and services, including the tour buses themselves.

""There was a point where they were really scarce, so the prices went up,"" says Cirisano. ""If you have to spend more on that as an artist, you end up maybe pricing tickets a little bit higher.""

Big-name artists such as Taylor Swift and Beyoncé don't live directly off the money they make from touring; they have additional income streams like record sales, merchandise, endorsement deals, royalties and more.

But that's not the experience for many smaller artists, who generally rely on touring income as a main source of revenue. That's even more true now than it was a decade or two ago when record sales were higher and streaming wasn't the predominant way for people to consume music. Factor in that many artists were sidelined for a year or two because of the pandemic, and the result is that many musicians need to earn back what they lost during those non-touring years.

""Most artists don't make any meaningful income from streaming, so they have to supplement it with these other things [such as merchandise or live performances],"" Cirisano says. ""For a lot of artists, touring is their bread and butter.""

Moreover, Brown points out that many tours taking place across the U.S. are much bigger productions today than they were in the past. ""When you're looking at these extremely highly produced arena and stadium tours, fans expect a more immersive, multi-faceted concert experience than they might have expected before,"" Brown says.

Having a band play onstage with little-to-no production simply doesn't cut it with modern audiences -- which means that there are extra costs to create a monumental performance -- and that obviously becomes the fans' burden.

While this is a complicated question, Brown says it's a safe bet that the bigger the artist, the more control they have over their business, including ticket prices. Even if the artist doesn't have the final say over the final ticket price, they do have leverage. That said, artists simply don't have control over reseller prices on the secondary market.

Longtime bands such as The Rolling Stones and The Eagles tend to have some of the priciest tickets in the concert business, and fans will typically pay the high costs to see these legendary artists. It's a case of supply and demand, Brown points out.

Back in 2022, ahead of his 2023 U.S. tour, Bruce Springsteen faced controversy over exorbitant dynamic prices -- as much as $5,000 per ticket -- and that's before tickets hit the secondary market. When asked by Rolling Stone about the choice to price that high, Springsteen said he told his team, ""'Hey, we're 73 years old. The guys are there. I want to do what everybody else is doing, my peers.' So that's what happened."" The Boss then explained how ""most of [his] tickets are totally affordable"" but if ""the ticket broker or someone is going to be taking that money, [he thought,] 'Hey, why shouldn't that money go to the guys that are going to be up there sweating three hours a night for it?'""

In the pop world, Taylor Swift tickets could easily set you back four figures if you're seeing her in the U.S. this year. Tickets to her European shows were priced significantly lower. However, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end business analysis, Swift's average ticket price was about $239, the highest in 2023. Beyoncé's average ticket price came in at No. 2, around $209. Interestingly, according to Pollstar's 2024 mid-year report, the publication noted a 9.4% increase in the average ticket price, going from $116.41 to $127.38. The report stated the price hike ""marks only the third year on record with an average ticket price over $100. The 2022 average was $105.55, while the 2019 average topped out at $92.42.""

On the flipside, Ed Sheeran is a major artist who's managed to keep his ticket prices relatively low. Brown cited Sheeran's smaller band as a possible contributing factor to lower ticket costs. Per Pollstar, Sheeran's average ticket price was about $105 in 2023.

Another example is Robert Smith from The Cure. He worked to significantly lower prices, spurning dynamic pricing. Many of the tickets to The Cure's Shows of a Lost World tour in 2023 only cost fans $20 apiece. Smith worked with Ticketmaster after learning fees on the platform doubled the $20 tickets and surprisingly was able to refund fans for part of the service charge.

Web searches for concert tickets can sometimes lead to misleading perceptions of ticket prices. Google ""Taylor Swift tickets,"" for example, and the first few results you see will generally be resale sites on the secondary market, not the primary market. Cirisano notes that Ticketmaster is part of both market types, which can be especially confusing to fans trying to purchase tickets from their website.

""I think that's added to this perception that ticket prices are skyrocketing, when, a lot of the time, it's not actually the original ticket price you're looking at,"" Cirisano explains. ""It's the one that's been marked up by, in many cases, professional resellers who employ bots to buy hundreds, if not thousands, of tickets and resell them at higher prices.""

In May 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Live Nation, Ticketmaster's parent company, over an alleged monopoly. According to a press release, ""The lawsuit, which includes a request for structural relief, seeks to restore competition in the live concert industry, provide better choices at lower prices for fans, and open venue doors for working musicians and other performance artists.""

Could this lawsuit be successful? Cirisano believes that the case depends on whether the Justice Department can prove Live Nation is putting artists who do not book through their venue system at a disadvantage. Without that evidence, the suit could be in jeopardy.

Also in May 2024, the so-called Taylor Swift bill was signed into law by Minnesota Governor (and now vice presidential candidate) Tim Walz after the politician was unable to purchase tickets to Swift's tour stop in Minneapolis in 2023. This law, according to The Associated Press, ""will require ticket sellers to disclose all fees up front and prohibit resellers from selling more than one copy of a ticket, among other measures. The law will apply to tickets purchased in Minnesota or other states for concerts or other live events held in Minnesota."" Basically, it will provide stronger protections for digital consumers and goes into effect on January 1, 2025.

The internet is ablaze with memes about Ticketmaster's controversial fees, but where do these fees actually go? Who's benefiting? For starters, the main benefactors are (perhaps surprisingly) the venues themselves.

Some of the fees are going to credit card processing as well. ""What a lot of fans don't realize is that when they're seeing those fees that are added on, a lot of them are not actually going to Ticketmaster,"" Cirisano says. ""It creates this perception like, 'Oh, Ticketmaster is adding all of these fees,' when a lot of those fees are being passed on to others.""

Of course, some of the fees do go directly to Ticketmaster, though the site claims that they are used to improve the platform and services.

Case in point: One way Ticketmaster has tried to improve the users' experiences is to use All-In Pricing for certain shows. (Some states, such as New York, Tennessee and Connecticut mandate the use of All-In Pricing.) All-In Pricing requires Ticketmaster to include all fees as part of the ticket price right up front, so there aren't any surprises when a fan goes to check out. For tickets that don't offer All-In Pricing, Ticketmaster created a feature that lets you toggle to view the total price with fees.

Advocates for All-In Pricing, such as the National Independent Venue Association (NIVA), also want an itemized list of fees presented at the time of purchase for better pay transparency.

All-In Pricing can be the make-or-break solution for fans who budget a maximum price of, for example, $100, for a specific concert, then learn at the checkout their final cost will now be $200 with fees. The timer counting down how long they have to make a decision creates added pressure to what may already be a stressful situation. Fans in this predicament are forced to make a choice and it could be between having money for bills or getting to attend their dream concert. Knowing all the facts upfront can lessen the anxiety and make the experience a more relaxing purchase.

Make no mistake: If the next time you go to purchase a concert ticket and have to do a double take when you see the final total, it's not your imagination. Prices have gone up significantly in recent years.

Yes, Ticketmaster and other ticket sellers frontload ticket prices with additional fees that benefit the venue, credit card companies and the ticket sellers themselves. But don't discount the pandemic and all its financial repercussions, along with the need to offset the revenue artists have lost in the transition from CD sales to online streaming. It's no secret that Spotify just doesn't pay the bills for most musicians.

Artists have to adapt to these changes, which can ultimately trickle down to consumers through ticketing platforms. But in the words of Oasis, ""Don't look back in anger"" -- or, at least try not to when you remember a ticket to one of their shows in 2009 was about $50, but a ticket for their 2025 tour starts around $180.

Job Market Strong in September - Will It Slow Fed Rate Cuts?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/harryholzer/2024/10/04/job-market-strong-in-septemberwill-it-slow-fed-rate-cuts/,2024-10-04T14:34:24Z,"The jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for September was considerably stronger than expected.

Economists had been predicting payroll growth of 140-150,000 jobs; instead, payrolls rose by 254,000. The estimates for July and August were revised up substantially; the average for the last 3 months is now 185,000, which is considerably higher than earlier estimates. The strongest growth was in eating and drinking places, where employment rose by a very robust 69,000 jobs.

Wage growth has also been more robust than in previous months. Combining August and September, monthly wages have risen by about 5% (on an annualized basis). And, from the household survey, the employment rate out of the population grew by .2 percentage points (60.0 to 60.2%), while the unemployment rate fell - especially among high school dropouts and Hispanic workers.

It would probably be a mistake to read too much into this, or any other report, that covers just a single month. The monthly employment statistics tend to bounce around, and 3-6 month averages present a more informative picture. Also, other measures like the job vacancy rate (which held steady at 4.8 percent in August), suggest a steadier labor market. And another reading in the coming weeks on productivity will also be important - since the relative strong productivity growth (above 2 percent) over the past year and a half suggest we can live with wage growth of 4 percent or higher.

Still, the large bump in payrolls in September, combined with upward revisions for July and August as well as more robust wage growth, suggest that the job market weakness we had detected in the late spring and summer months might have been a bit overstated, or perhaps a more temporary lull than we thought. The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a half percentage point earlier this month, indicating its concern about a slowing economy. The current data might cause it to slow down further rate reductions a bit, until we get a clearer picture of where the job market is really heading."
Strong September Jobs Report Reduces Recession Fears,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/10/04/strong-september-jobs-report-reduces-recession-fears/,2024-10-04T14:03:49Z,"The September jobs report was stronger than expected and is likely to assuage recession risks and fears, driving up hopes for ""soft landing"" or ""no landing"" economic scenarios. This report is likely to reduce the chances that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 0.5% on November 7, but the recent trend of slowing payrolls is still supportive of a 0.25% rate cut. An uncertain presidential election outcome could still push the Fed to cut rates by 0.5%.

The Employment Situation report, known to economists and analysts as the jobs report, was strong for September. It showed a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%, strong net payroll gains of 254,000, and strong upward revisions to payrolls by 72,000 for the previous two months. This was a much stronger report than economists and analysts had been forecasting, and it reduces the perceived downside risks to the U.S. labor market and economy.

While the jobs report supports the claim that the U.S. labor market is relatively solid, other recent data also reinforce this notion. After all, initial and continuing jobless claims are very low. Continuing claims are at 1.826 million, which is only around 1.1 percent of the labor force. Initial Jobless Claims are also very low, at just 225,000.

Strong Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data showed that there were over 8 million open jobs in August 2024. While this is around 4.2 million fewer open jobs than the U.S. historic high in March 2022 of 12.2 million, 8 million is still around 1 million more open jobs than before the COVID pandemic. With over 6 million more open jobs than people collecting unemployment, it is difficult to expect very large net payroll losses across multiple months anytime soon.

The Fed has a dual mandate to support full employment and keep inflation rates low and stable. The September jobs report, August JOLTS data, and recent weekly jobless claims reflect full employment in the U.S. labor market, but consumer prices are not yet low and stable - or at least not yet at the Fed's 2% inflation target. The combination of above-target inflation and a solid labor market could incentivize the Fed to cut interest rates by only 0.25% rather than 0.5% in its next policy decision on November 7.

Of course, we don't yet have September inflation data, and there is also a U.S. election to contend with before the next Fed meeting.

The September CPI and PCE reports will be critical for the November 7 Fed decision. Year-on-year inflation rates are likely to have made more progress toward 2% in September, and Prestige Economics is forecasting year-on-year September total CPI to be 2.4%, with core CPI at 3.1%. However, it may be the November election outcome - or uncertainty about that outcome by November 7 - that could push the Fed to cut rates by 0.5%

A strong September employment report with payrolls well above August levels and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1% is a signal that the Fed can take its time with rate cuts, which is likely to support the greenback and bond yields. Additionally, this solid report could still have positive impacts on equities, oil prices, and industrial metals prices because it assuages concerns about recession."
Here Is What A Government Efficiency Commission Should Look Like,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesbroughel/2024/10/04/here-is-what-a-government-efficiency-commission-should-look-like/,2024-10-04T13:53:51Z,"Elon Musk has floated the idea of a government efficiency commission aimed at addressing wasteful spending and regulations in Washington. Former President Donald Trump embraced Musk's idea, stating that if re-elected he would establish such a commission with Musk at the helm. While government efficiency commissions can indeed be powerful tools for reform, they are also easy to ignore or sideline, particularly when their recommendations are controversial or if they are set up merely for political optics rather than substantive change. The success of such a commission therefore lies in its structure and its role within a broader policy mandate to overhaul government, such as through an explicit government-wide goal of reducing regulation.

Musk and Trump can learn from the past, starting with looking at commissions that have offered valuable recommendations that went unheeded. A prime example is the 2010 Simpson-Bowles fiscal commission, which was formed during the Obama administration to address the federal deficit. The commission's recommendations were well-researched and pragmatic, tackling tough issues like Medicare and Social Security reform. Despite the balanced and informed nature of its suggestions, Congress ultimately chose not to act on them. The commission's failure was largely due to the politically sensitive nature of its proposals and a lack of consensus within Congress, underscoring the importance of not just having good ideas but having the political will and bipartisan cooperation to see those ideas through.

Similarly, some commissions are formed to create the illusion of action without any genuine intention to make changes. This is similar to how Congress sometimes requires a study of a particular problem instead of addressing the problem itself. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's Georgians First Commission made thoughtful recommendations on how to reduce regulatory burdens in the state, yet they remain unimplemented. This suggests the creation of the commission was more of a political maneuver than a substantive effort to reform government bureaucracy.

To be effective, therefore, Trump and Musk's proposed commission should seek to avoid these pitfalls and instead build upon models that have yielded tangible results. One example comes from New Jersey under former Governor Chris Christie. During Christie's tenure, New Jersey created the Red Tape Review Commission. The commission was proactive, met regularly, and included members from different political backgrounds and sectors.

The New Jersey commission also produced regular reporting, which was impactful in part because it included powerful stories illustrating how problematic regulations were interfering with the daily lives of people. These were stories of business owners, workers, and residents struggling to jump through government-created hoops in their efforts to improve their stations in life. The commission's recommendations were acted upon multiple times by the legislature. Although an effort to make the commission permanent ultimately failed, it had broad support, with only one opposing vote in the legislature. The failure was due to Governor Phil Murphy's veto and his reluctance to hand a political win to former Governor Christie.

Trump and Christie may have their differences, but regulatory reform could be an area of productive collaboration. It might even make sense for Trump to consider involving Christie in the proposed commission.

A key challenge for any efficiency commission is that it inherently lacks enforcement power. It can make recommendations, but it cannot compel anyone to act. This is why commissions are easy to ignore, particularly in the face of competing interests within government. Federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency or the Securities and Exchange Commission operate independently and have their own priorities. Even if a commission led by Musk were to identify a regulatory problem, there is little reason to believe agency heads would prioritize it. Most prefer to spend time cementing their legacies with new initiatives, rather than revisiting the work of their predecessors.

The effectiveness of such a commission will also depend on its ability to produce recommendations that are driven by consensus and backed by evidence. This is why a bipartisan makeup is important. Musk may ultimately lead the commission, but it should include representatives and stakeholders from both major parties. Without bipartisan participation, any recommendations risk being dismissed as political -- by Congress, by agency staff, and even in some cases by members of Trump's own cabinet. A broad coalition of support will help guarantee that recommendations are seen as pragmatic and in the public interest.

Like in New Jersey, the commission should produce regular reports -- annually, if not more often -- identifying programs and regulations in need of reform. It should engage with nonpartisan offices like the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office to collect data and ideas. Academic research should be gathered and summarized, ensuring that recommendations are well-supported by empirical evidence. The more rigorous and transparent the commission's work, the harder it will be for its findings to be ignored.

The proposed commission should also work in tandem with other regulatory reform mechanisms, such as a regulatory budget and reduction goals -- both of which were features of Trump's first term. Setting a regulatory budget limits the total cost that regulations can impose on the economy, forcing agencies to prioritize eliminating outdated and inefficient regulations rather than adding new rules to the pile. A regulatory reduction goal similarly incentivizes agencies toward achieving a desired outcome. A goal of, say, cutting the Code of Federal Regulations by 25,000 pages or reducing annual compliance and paperwork costs by $200 billion, is realistic and actionable, and would give the commission an idea of its intended purpose.

In Trump's first term, his administration also appointed ""deregulation officers"" within agencies. These were people whose role was to make sure that the regulatory reduction agenda was being implemented. Individuals who are empowered within agencies to advocate for reform from the inside could be powerful allies to an efficiency commission. Their roles should be reinstated to complement the work of the commission.

The idea of an efficiency commission, particularly one led by Elon Musk, is an exciting prospect, but it must be implemented wisely. It has to be more than just a symbolic gesture. Every recommendation should be backed by evidence and presented in a nonpartisan light, forming part of a comprehensive plan to streamline the federal bureaucracy and foster greater accountability in government. A government efficiency commission is a good idea, but how it gets set up matters."
Is It A Goldilocks Economy?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/04/is-it-a-goldilocks-economy/,2024-10-04T13:06:32Z,"Temporary Strike Resolution Offers Short-Term Relief For Impacted Industries

Stocks were relatively quiet on Thursday as markets awaited this morning's employment situation report. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite was flat. Small cap stocks were the biggest movers for the day, falling over 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%.

This morning, the Labor Department released the latest employment report. Forecasts were calling for 147 thousand new jobs and an unchanged unemployment rate of 4.2%. The actual numbers were 254 thousand new jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. We also saw upward revisions for both July and August, suggesting the economy continues to show strength. We'll get the latest Consumer Price Index late next week and a chance to see if prices are continuing on their trajectory of moderating. Thus far though, the net effect of recent data implies an economy continuing on target for a soft landing. However, there is one potential caveat to that, oil.

On Thursday, oil was up over 5% as the world awaits Israel's response to Iran's missile attack earlier in the week. For the week, crude oil prices are up nearly 10% and that is something with the potential to upset the progress made vis-a-vis inflation. If there is one commodity that has the potential to jumpstart inflation, it is oil. Therefore, in addition to both the humanitarian and geopolitical repercussions, there is the potential for economic upheaval as well. The 200-day moving average for crude oil is right around $75 and that is a level I'll be watching. A close above that could be bullish for those who are long but bearish for inflation.

The other big story on Thursday was the temporary end to the strike at ports along the East Coast. Employers offered workers a pay increase of 62% spread out over six years. The International Longshoremen's Association and port operators said this agreement will last until late January as the two sides work on a long-term deal. One of the main sticking points in the negotiations is automation and how that will impact jobs. Seeing as how the strike lasted just three days, any economic impact was likely muted. However, this is an issue we may hear about again come early next year. In the meantime, we're seeing some of the companies that could have been negatively impacted by a prolonged strike trading higher in premarket activity. Shares of Walmart are up 0.5% along with Target, which is trading higher by nearly 1%.

For today, I'm keeping an eye on how the jobs data report is spun and oil. The market's initial reaction to the jobs number has been bullish. Index futures jumped when the report was released. Heading into this morning's report, sentiment was largely in the camp that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by a quarter point when they meet in November. Expectations for that quarter point cut were relatively unchanged after the employment number was released. One other thing I'll be watching today is the VIX. Last Friday, volatility increased right near the end of the day. I believe that was largely due to the situation in the Middle East and investor concern about the potential for increased hostilities over the weekend. Given the state of affairs as of Friday morning, I would not be surprised if we saw a similar situation today. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."
The Latest Employment Numbers And The Presidential Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2024/10/04/the-latest-employment-numbers-and-the-presidential-election/,2024-10-04T12:44:31Z,"The Employment Situation Report for the month of September was released this morning. It showed what everyone expected: very little change in the unemployment rate. At 4.1%, it was actually slightly lower than that for August (4.2%). One open question was the impact of Hurricane Francine on jobs, but ""Our analysis suggests that Hurricane Francine had no discernible effect on national payroll employment, hours, and earnings from the establishment survey, or the national unemployment rate from the household survey.""

As important as these releases are in normal times, they take on extra significance in the lead up to an election. In fact, experts claim that the economy is particularly important to voters this year. It has consequently been a running theme for both parties, with Democrats focusing on low unemployment and robust growth and Republicans on the recent spike in inflation.

What's curious about this campaign is the fact that the Democrats are having to scramble to defend themselves. You'd think that theirs was the high ground given that:

Meanwhile, though it is true that inflation accelerated temporarily, there is little question that this was related to factors outside of the US and has calmed down considerably.

Despite this, however, voters have a very dim -- and flawed -- view of the state of the economy:

""Nearly everything Americans believe about the economy is wrong, according to a recent Harris-Guardian poll...The poll, conducted earlier this month, found that perceptions of the U.S. economy are often at odds with reality. For instance, most Americans (55 percent) think the economy is shrinking, with about the same share saying we're in a recession.""

Unfortunately for the Democrats, perceptions are more important than reality in situations like this.

There are three more key indicator announcements before the November 5th election:

If any of these is out of line with what we have been experiencing of late, it could have an impact on voters.

That said, economists do not expect any significant deviation from our current low unemployment, solid GDP growth, and moderating inflation. Even if the dockworkers' strike (now resolved) and recent flooding were to raise prices, the October 10 CPI announcement only covers September. It simply wouldn't show up yet.

What this suggests is that the releases will include very little new information and both parties will simply recycle their earlier talking points. If the outcome is going to be affected by the state of the economy, it is going to be because one party did a better job of spinning than the other. And while there is evidence that Kamala Harris' economic message may be gaining ground on Donald Trump's, a lot can happen in a month.

Everyone will be watching these numbers closely."
Federal Trade Commission Sues Big 3 Pharmaceutical Benefit Managers,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/aldenabbott/2024/10/04/federal-trade-commission-sues-big-3-pharmaceutical-benefit-managers/,2024-10-04T12:44:27Z,"My Forbes commentary published yesterday highlighted a July 2024 Federal Trade Commission interim staff report critical of pharmaceutical benefit managers, ""middlemen"" firms that specialize in negotiating with drug makers for rebates on the list prices of drugs. I explained that the interim report's analysis is at odds with economic research that delineates the substantial economic benefits of the PBM system.

This commentary turns to an assessment of a September 2024 FTC lawsuit against the three major PBMs. The lawsuit is weak and economically problematic.

Background On The Lawsuit

In a September 20 press release, the FTC announced a legal challenge to the practices of the ""big 3"" PBMs:

""Today, the Federal Trade Commission brought action against the three largest prescription drug benefit managers (PBMs) -- Caremark Rx, Express Scripts (ESI), and OptumRx -- and their affiliated group purchasing organizations (GPOs) for engaging in anticompetitive and unfair rebating practices that have artificially inflated the list price of insulin drugs, impaired patients' access to lower list price products, and shifted the cost of high insulin list prices to vulnerable patients.""

In a nutshell, the FTC claimed that the ""big 3"" PBMs' rebate practices caused a 1,200% rise in the price of Humalog, a brand-new Eli Lilly insulin medication, between 1999 and 2017. These actions allegedly were illegal ""unfair methods of competition"" (an antitrust-type of concern) and ""unfair acts or practices"" (a consumer protection type of concern) that violated Section 5 of the FTC Act.

The FTC's legal complaint in this case will be heard by an in-house FTC administrative law judge, whose initial findings can be reviewed by the FTC. The FTC's decision, if history is a guide, will almost certainly uphold the legal complaint. The FTC's holding can and most likely will be appealed to a federal U.S. Court of Appeals.

The FTC's Case Is Weak As A Legal Matter

The Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts, which forbid monopolization and anticompetitive agreements among firms, do not apply. No single big PBM (the big 3 together have 80% of the PBM market) is a monopolist, and no anticompetitive agreements by the big PBMs are alleged by the FTC.

Admittedly, courts have stated that the FTC Act Section 5 prohibition against ""unfair methods of competition"" goes a bit beyond the Sherman and Clayton Acts. Nevertheless, it is doubtful that merely favoring higher-priced formulary drugs over lower-priced ones - which lies at the heart of the PBM case - would be viewed as a form of problematic competition on review by federal judges. (There are no federal court holdings that would support such a result.)

The FTC also alleges that the PBMs are committing ""unfair acts or practices"" in violation of Section 5 by keeping lower-priced insulin drugs off their formularies and by targeting those consumers who must face high unrebated list prices for certain insulin products.

But Section 5(n) of the FTC Act specifies that the ""unfair acts"" prohibition is only triggered if harm to consumers is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. The PBMs would have a strong argument that the procompetitive benefits of the formulary system, summarized in yesterday's commentary, do indeed outweigh the harm to certain insulin consumers.

The FTC's Remedy Is Economically Harmful

Finally, the FTC's suggested remedy for the violations it alleges strikes at the heart of the PBM rebate system. Specifically, the FTC would prevent the big PBMs from accepting rebates based on a particular price benchmark. It would micromanage the PBMs' decisions as to the drugs included on a formulary. And it would prevent PBMs from basing patients' deductibles or coinsurance on a drug's list price, rather than its net cost after rebates.

The FTC's remedy would substitute government regulation for PBM decision-making. It would thereby wreak havoc with a system that has bestowed enormous benefits on the American economy. Consumers as well as businesses would likely be the long-term losers.

The FTC Should Drop The PBM Lawsuit

The FTC should vote to withdraw from administrative litigation its complaint against the major PBMs. That complaint is fraught with major legal weaknesses. Most importantly, it poses a threat to the economically beneficial PBM model.

There is, admittedly, legitimate reason to be concerned about the excessive cost of the U.S. health care system and, in particular, high drug prices to consumers. Government should, however, seek to address this problem through economically efficient measures that do not distort markets.

Comprehensive procompetitive regulatory reform of the American health care system would be a good step forward. Moreover, specific remedies, such as targeted payments to poorer drug consumers, may warrant consideration.

But a bureaucratically-led legal attack on welfare-enhancing PBMs should be avoided at all costs."
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: October 4, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-10-04-24/,2024-10-04T10:36:58Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are going down. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can park some cash? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are infamous for paying paltry interest rates. But if you know where to look, you can find rates 10x higher. Several online banks and credit unions pay rates that are far more competitive than those offered by brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you score a basic savings account with a rate in that general area, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield also was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.23%, Curinos says. APY, or annual percentage yield, shows the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts often pay substantially higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the thing to know is you may have to meet tough requirements set by the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.89%. You'll be in good shape if you can get an account offering a rate close to 4.89%. Last week at this time, the best rate was 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's about the same as last week's APY.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

That's tough to say -- it depends on the path of inflation and the overall economy.

The highest interest rates in recent history were seen in the early 1980s when the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to over 19%. That was in response to record-breaking inflation that had prices rising at a rate of over 14% annually.

In the early 1980s, the average five-year CD paid almost 12%, compared to less than 2% today, according to Bankrate data. Savings rates eventually fell as inflation cooled and the federal funds rate was brought back down.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
Democrats Mobilize Crypto Voters To Counter Trump's Bitcoin Appeal,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2024/10/04/democrats-mobilize-crypto-voters-to-counter-trumps-bitcoin-appeal/,2024-10-04T10:05:16Z,"As the 2024 election approaches, cryptocurrency is no longer a fringe topic. Once dismissed as a niche concern, crypto asset and blockchain policy has rocketed to the forefront for millions of Americans who recognize the critical role of crypto in driving future economic growth and innovation. This shift underscores a broader divide among voters, particularly within the crypto space, with some leaning towards the Democratic Party, while others rally behind former President Donald Trump, positioning him as the so-called ""champion"" of their bitcoin holdings. In response, Suite View PAC has launched Crypto Rides, a direct effort to mobilize Democratic-leaning pro-crypto voters in a way that counters the GOP's bitcoin-only voter narrative.

Crypto Rides represents a dynamic example of how Democrat-leaning voters for this election are reclaiming crypto support by focusing on balanced and responsible regulation. Offering Uber ride vouchers to pro-crypto, pro-tech voters in New York, this initiative seeks to boost turnout for those committed to advancing thoughtful, nuanced oversight of digital assets -- especially in stark contrast to the ""bitcoin maximalism"" embraced by Trump's base.

The Rise Of The Single-Issue Bitcoin Voter

Trump's transformation from bitcoin skeptic to crypto advocate has been one of the most notable shifts in his political stance as he vies for the presidency in 2024. Once dismissive of bitcoin -- calling it a ""scam"" in 2021 -- Trump now positions himself as a champion of cryptocurrency, promising to turn the U.S. into the ""crypto capital of the world."" His pledges to dismantle the Biden administration's war on crypto, and his purchase of a meal with bitcoin, has endeared him to a growing segment of bitcoin maximalists and crypto entrepreneurs who see his return to office as a potential boon for deregulating the industry.

The allure of Trump's pro-bitcoin stance is hard to ignore for many in the crypto community. Despite what some described as his ill-timed and questionable DeFi project for accredited investors, Trump has attracted millions of dollars in donations from crypto founders and investors, and his promise to make bitcoin a centerpiece of his economic policy has galvanized a bloc of voters solely focused on this issue. However, while Trump's campaign may appeal to single-issue bitcoin voters, a broader group of Democratic and independent crypto enthusiasts are concerned about what his broader policies under Agenda 47 (based on Project 2025) could mean for the industry's future stability and inclusivity.

The Democratic Crypto Agenda: More Than Bitcoin

While Trump courts the bitcoin vote, many Democrats are focusing on a more nuanced approach to crypto regulation. Rather than pushing for the wholesale deregulation of digital assets, Democratic crypto voters are calling for policies that balance innovation with consumer protection, financial inclusion, and economic equity.

This difference in approach was highlighted in a recent letter sent to Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign by leaders in the Web3 and DeFi communities. Industry stalwarts like Olayinka Odeniran, Founder and Chairwoman of Black Women Blockchain Council, emphasized the importance of ensuring that Black, Latino, AAPI, and Indigenous communities -- early adopters of cryptocurrency -- are included the regulatory conversation. She, and other diverse Web3 and DeFi leaders, advocated for policies that foster capital formation and financial access for these groups, while also protecting consumers from fraud and ensuring transparency in the industry. For these voters, the stakes are high -- not just for bitcoin's survival but for the entire ecosystem of emerging technologies that could reshape the global economy to be as inclusive and democratizing as its promise, and as articulated in Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper. And according to a recent Morning Star poll, crypto voters are evenly divided.

Resetting The Democratic Stance On Digital Assets

In addition to voter mobilization efforts like Crypto Rides, the Crypto4Harris initiative has emerged as a key movement aiming to reshape the Democratic Party's stance on digital assets. This group of cryptocurrency advocates, which includes high-profile figures like Mark Cuban, Anthony Scaramucci, and Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA), is rallying behind Harris's campaign with a clear agenda: influence future regulatory direction for the crypto industry.

One of the most notable developments within the Crypto4Harris group is the backing of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who participated in a virtual rally hosted by the initiative. Schumer expressed strong support for pushing through crypto legislation this year, warning that if the U.S. does not take a proactive approach to regulate digital assets, the industry could move overseas. Schumer's involvement indicates that key Democratic leaders are becoming increasingly receptive to the crypto community's concerns.

Additionally, Jonathan Padilla, CEO of Snickerdoodle Labs and a leading organizer for Crypto4Harris, confirmed that the group has been in early discussions with the Harris campaign, aiming to shape policy and influence regulatory appointments. However, skepticism remains due to Harris's obvious connection to the current anti-crypto administration as the Vice President.

Despite the limited constitutional role of a Vice President to preside over the Senate, break ties in case of a 50/50 vote, to serve at the pleasure of the Chief Executive (the President), and to replace the President in times of crisis, vice presidents are inextricably linked to policies advanced during their time in office. Nonetheless, Harris has begun the challenging and nuanced task of separating herself from the current anti-crypto policies in favor of a pro-digital asset and blockchain stance in alignment with her Opportunity Economy policies to bolster the middle and working classes. She even went so far as to be the first Democratic presidential candidate to publicly declare support for pro-digital asset innovation and reasonable regulations, a stark contrast from Biden's approach.

If the Crypto4Harris movement succeeds in resetting the Democratic Party's stance on digital assets, it could lead to increased investment and innovation in the U.S. digital assets industry and broader Web3 economy. However, the outcome may turn on how willing the Harris campaign is to engage with the ""proof of pivot"" demands of the crypto industry and push back against more stringent regulatory measures of the current administration.

Polling Data Shows Crypto's Growing Importance In The Election

New polling data from Consensys and HarrisX reveals just how much cryptocurrency has risen in importance as an election issue. Nearly 49% of U.S. voters now consider a candidate's stance on crypto to be ""important"" when deciding their vote. This is a massive shift from previous elections and highlights the increasing relevance of digital finance in shaping the political landscape.

The 2024 election is shaping up to be pivotal for the crypto community, with 92% of crypto holders planning to vote -- a striking statistic that makes them a demographic both parties are keen to win over. Yet, the crypto community is anything but monolithic. Recent data shows that 40% of respondents favor the GOP's stance on crypto, while 38% align more with Democrats. This split highlights an opportunity for Democrats and independents to connect with voters who, while perhaps skeptical of the GOP's bitcoin maximalist approach, are seeking a more balanced and inclusive regulatory framework.

Swing States: Crypto as a Deciding Factor

Swing states could very well be where the crypto vote makes the most significant impact. A poll by DCG and The Harris Poll reveals that 26% of voters in these crucial states are actively considering candidates' positions on digital assets when deciding whom to support. With crypto emerging as a key issue in these battlegrounds, initiatives like Crypto Rides are essential in rallying Democratic crypto supporters.

Crypto Rides: Mobilizing the Democratic Crypto Vote

This is where Crypto Rides enters the fray as a direct counter to the GOP's single-issue bitcoin voter. By offering Uber ride vouchers to pro-crypto, Democratic-leaning voters in New York, Crypto Rides ensures that voices advocating for innovation, consumer protection, and financial equity are heard at the polls. ""Crypto Rides isn't just about turnout,"" says founder Will Schweitzer, ""it's about turning out the right votes."" While Trump may have rallied a faction of the crypto community around bitcoin, Schweitzer emphasizes that initiatives like Crypto Rides focus on a more inclusive and responsible approach to digital finance.

The Importance Of Down-Ballot Voting

Though much of the spotlight is on the presidential race, it's crucial to recognize that lasting regulatory reform comes from Congress. Lawmakers across the country will be pivotal in shaping the future legal framework for digital assets, whether in a swing issue or one with a clear party leaning. Initiatives like Crypto Rides remind voters that real change happens up and down the ballot, ensuring that representatives pushing for smart crypto regulation are elected to Congress.

As we approach November 5th, the race for the crypto vote is intensifying. Trump may have energized the bitcoin vote, but Democrats, independents, and never-Trump voters are expanding the tent and the conversation with initiatives like Crypto Rides and Crypto4Harris. The outcome of this election will undoubtedly have lasting implications for the future of digital assets. Whether through ride vouchers, grassroots efforts, legislation or shaping regulatory appointments, the Democratic crypto vote is making its presence felt -- and it could well tip the balance of power in Washington."
Headwinds For Li Auto Despite Strong Deliveries,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/04/headwinds-for-li-auto-despite-strong-deliveries/,2024-10-04T10:05:12Z,"Li Auto, the largest of the emerging EV players in China, delivered a record 53,709 vehicles for September 2024 - an increase of 49% percent year-over-year. Sales also expanded by about 11.6% compared to August. Li's total deliveries year to date stand at about 341,812 vehicles, an increase of 40% compared to last year. Li's performance for the quarter was also better than its rival XPeng which delivered 21,352 EVs in September, a 39% year-over-year growth. Although Li Auto didn't break down the key drivers of its growth, it's likely that the Li L6, the most affordable model in the company's lineup, had a big part to play. The vehicle has gained popularity among younger consumers. The vehicle, which was launched in April, is priced at about RMB 250,000 (about $34,500). Li also lowered prices for several of its models a few months ago and this has also likely helped support sales to an extent.

Now despite the strong growth. Li Auto stock remains down by about 31% year-to-date. There have been a couple of headwinds for Li Auto. While the company's Q2 2024 results, published a little over a month ago, were better than expected, Li's profitability and average selling prices per vehicle are seeing some pressure due to mounting competition. The Chinese EV market is crowded, with over 100 brands competing in the space. Li is also likely seeing a lower mix of premium EV model sales (such as the Li L7, Li L8, and Li L9) and a higher mix of the low-priced L6 model. Li has seen its average selling prices decline by about 13% year-over-year to about RMB 280,000 during the most recent quarter. Li Auto's gross margin stood at 19.5% in Q2, down from 21.8% in the year-ago quarter. Separately, China's economic growth has been weak due to a downturn in the real estate market and a slow rebound from stringent Covid-19 lockdowns that ended over a year ago. Consumer spending and domestic consumption also remain weak in China. However, the government recently announced a stimulus plan, which includes lowering interest rates and fiscal support and this could help consumer spending.

Now, the decrease in LI stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -36% in 2022, and 83% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that LI underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could LI face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?

Despite concerns about the economy and weakness in the global EV market, the Chinese EV space is still showing promise. With China offering incentives to consumers who replace their gasoline cars with electric and low-emission vehicles, the mix of new energy vehicle sales has jumped to about 50% of overall automotive sales. Moreover, there has also been a premiumization trend in the Chinese EV market, with cars costing upward of $30,000 accounting for a growing mix of sales at the expense of lower-end EVs. This could play in Li Auto's favor, as it competes primarily in the premium end of the electric vehicle market. Overall, Li says that it has about 17% of the market share in the premium EV segment, for vehicles priced over RMB200,000 ($28,500), making it the leader among premium Chinese EV brands.

Li's valuation is also fair, with the stock trading at just under $26 per share - a little over 15x estimated 2024 earnings and roughly 11x 2025 earnings, which is not very expensive considering that the company's revenues are projected to grow by over 15% this year and by over 35% next year per consensus estimates. See our analysis of Nio, Xpeng & Li Auto: How Do Chinese EV Stocks Compare? for a detailed look at how Li stock compares with its rivals Nio and Xpeng."
How To Transform Profit Into Purpose And Elevate Corporate Ethics,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/soulaimagourani/2024/10/03/how-to-transform-profit-into-purpose-and-elevate-corporate-ethics/,2024-10-04T01:40:23Z,"With the buzz from UNGA 24 still echoing in our ears, it's clear that the world is ready for a shake-up.

As headlines spotlight the urgent need for companies to step up on issues like sustainability and social responsibility, it's time for us leaders to rethink our game plans. Profit is great, but let's face it -- today's consumers are looking for more than just a bottom line. They want to connect with brands that stand for something meaningful. So, how do we shift gears from just chasing dollars to building a purpose-driven culture?

As the late Philip Windsor wisely stated, true progress lies not in mere tolerance but in active toleration -- embracing our differences as a source of strength. Now is the time for leaders to reflect on our collective narratives, engage in meaningful dialogue, and strive for a world where every individual's voice is heard and valued.

The question is no longer whether businesses should engage in corporate responsibility, but rather how we can integrate it into our core strategy.

For too long, many corporate structures have prioritized profits over ethical considerations, leading to alarming consequences for individuals and society at large.

In the U.S. alone, consumer debt has surged to a staggering $35 trillion. Many individuals find themselves ensnared in a cycle of financial hardship, exacerbated by the absence of protective regulations against predatory lending. This is not just a crisis of ethics; it's a crisis that undermines the very foundations of our economy.

As leaders, we must recognize that we cannot build sustainable businesses in a society riddled with suffering.

Companies that prioritize ethical practices, like Milton Hershey's unwavering commitment to fair wages and community development, serve as powerful reminders that social responsibility and financial success are not mutually exclusive.

As we contemplate our roles as leaders, we must empower our teams to connect their personal stories and values with our organizational mission. This alignment can catalyze transformative change within our companies and beyond.

Take inspiration from defenders in conflict zones who bravely work to bridge divides and foster understanding. Leaders can adopt similar principles by encouraging dialogue and collaboration within their organizations, nurturing an inclusive culture that values diverse perspectives.

Consider the United Arab Emirates, where over 50% of parliament members are women! This remarkable achievement not only empowers women but also exemplifies the profound impact that diverse leadership can have on shaping societal norms and driving sustainable progress.

As we engage in conversations about corporate responsibility, we cannot overlook the role of technology -- particularly artificial intelligence. While AI presents challenges, it also offers unprecedented opportunities to democratize access to information and empower individuals across the globe.

As we innovate, we must ensure that our technological advancements are rooted in human values, fostering a sense of community and cooperation. This approach is not just ethically sound; it's essential for building a resilient society that embraces diversity, tolerance, and coexistence.

Let us commit to rethinking our corporate frameworks, reinforcing individual responsibility, and championing innovation that uplifts communities. By embracing ethical practices and fostering inclusive leadership, we can not only transform our organizations but also contribute to a brighter, more equitable future for all.

As leaders, we must ask ourselves: how do we build organizations that not only thrive financially but also contribute meaningfully to the communities we serve?"
MEDIOCRE JOB GROWTH REPORTS BELIE MAJOR PROBLEMS AHEAD FOR US ECONOMY,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2024/10/03/mediocre-job-growth-reports-belie-major-problems-ahead-for-us-economy/,2024-10-04T01:40:11Z,"The September job report (10/4 @8:30am) is expected to show 150,000 new (non farm) jobs and an unchanged 4.2% unemployment rate. These numbers are not overwhelming, but neither are they disastrous. Importantly, anything close (or even weaker) will be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to proceed with continued interest rate cuts. This is key to further market advancement.

But the jobs reports, thus far, in 2024 are not signaling the massive problems on the horizon. As a population, we are an old country and getting older. Moreover, we are not creating jobs like we used to and have resorted to outsourcing many jobs that we could keep ""in house"". Further, we have lately resorted to a propensity to create ""non productive"" jobs to maintain employment. For example, over the past 5 years, the United States created 350,000 MORE jobs in government, social services and healthcare than overall total jobs created.

It should come as no surprise that the US has long since lost its competitive edge in manufacturing. However, our job growth is now dependent on aging baby boomers with many refusing to retire. This may be due to economic necessity or desire to keep active, but eventually, the issue becomes moot. Sooner or later they leave the workforce. Many individuals will no longer contribute wealth to our society and will become an added burden to limited support and services.

Surprisingly, in a close election year, marked by animus from one political party to the next, the economic news has taken a back seat to other issues deemed more worrisome. It shouldn't. Current economic issues, the direction of job growth and the inevitable, irreversible decline in the US workforce, should take center stage. The next four years will be critical to the economic direction of the US economy. In the absence of a visionary change in direction, economic retooling, incentives and policy changes, our overall economy is headed for a vicious downward cycle.

There are some key fundamental demographics which are not going away. Ever. The US has an aging workforce with 75m baby boomers. Notably, by the year 2030 the number of Americans who are 65+ will exceed 20%, almost doubling the level in the year 2000. Each year, more than 4m Americans are eligible to retire. This will continue for the foreseeable future and have a profound impact on the size of the civilian labor force, the employed population ratio, and the unemployment rate. To place these numbers in perspective, one needs to understand that in the past 5 years, only 3m new jobs were created. There are currently 40m+ Americans who are 65-75 and in the next 6 years another 25m will join them. Approximately 1/3 of them work (up for 1/4 10 years ago). This implies that within the next 5 to 10 years, the US can expect 20m+ retirements. Given the current level of 161m employed Americans, on a civilian non institutional population base rate of 268m, the employed population ratio could plummet from 60% to 50%. In other words, in only 5 to 10 years, the US could be in a situation in which 1/2 the civilian non institutional population (above 16, non military, not in jail or nursing home) would not be working.

Compounding the problem is that the US has added to taken a leadership role in outsourcing talent -- notably to Eastern Europe and India for technical IT support and Philippines and Viet Nam for bookkeeping and accounting support. Millions of jobs, both high and low wage jobs are being sent overseas.

Meanwhile, the job growth in the US has come from 3 key areas: HealthCare, Government, Social Assistance. In fact, over the past 20 years, 2/3 of the new jobs from these areas and in the past 5 years, more than 3.5m jobs were created in government, health care and social services than overall jobs!

Given the aging population, the trend in healthcare will clearly continue. Moreover, the demand for social services will likely also continue to rise as additional illegal immigrants enter the country.

Is there a solution to avoid this impending doom? Possibly, but we would need immediate corrective actions. Unfortunately, job growth, and in particular, long-term job creation has not received the attention that it requires. Minor tweaks are being made to extend retirement age among some workers from 65 to 67, but this does not address the larger issue that will happen within 5 to 10 years.

Policies need to be implemented to create economic incentives for companies to keep jobs in America and bring other jobs back home. Along these lines, tough policies regarding minimum wages need to be considered in the context of not forcing employers to shut down, move or outsource talent. America also needs to grow it's educated work force, especially among young people. Simple solutions, such as keeping foreign college students in our country longer, might go a long way to helping resolve this developing crisis.

Finally, the US cannot continue to create jobs primarily in government, social services and health care. Jobs that help reduce global balance of payment deficits are required for long term economic growth. This cannot happen with governmental or social service jobs. As part of this action, governmental policy regarding the increased cost of millions of illegal aliens entering our cities needs to be addressed.

The forthcoming jobs reports for the next few months will likely continue without major surprise. But it is just a matter of time before baby boomer retirements kick in. At that point, it will become clearer that the US has major problems ahead. Hopefully, our future policy makers will make these issues a top priority. The growth of our economy and the future for our children depend on it."
AI And The Gig Economy Is Reshaping The Workforce. Here's How,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/timothypapandreou/2024/10/03/ai-and-the-gig-economy-is-reshaping-the-workforce-heres-how/,2024-10-04T00:11:59Z,"The gig economy, once primarily associated with entertainment or low-wage service jobs, is undergoing a profound transformation, driven in part by the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence. As AI technologies continue to mature, they are enabling new forms of work, creating opportunities for individuals seeking greater flexibility and autonomy. Many younger adults are turning to platforms like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash to earn extra income on their own terms. This trend is not limited to these jobs; white collar professionals are also embracing the gig economy through platforms like Toptal, Fiverr and Upwork, seeking greater flexibility and the ability to work on projects that align with their passions.

One of the most significant ways AI is reshaping the gig economy is through the development of AI agents. These platforms can match workers with tasks, manage projects, and even automate certain aspects of the work. For example, AI agents can be used to:

The rise of the gig economy has significant implications for traditional entry-level employment. As more individuals choose to work independently, the demand for full-time jobs will change, particularly in sectors such as retail and food service. The gig economy offers a diverse range of individuals the opportunity to work on their own terms. However, the reasons for choosing gig work vary significantly across demographics.

The growth of the gig economy has led to a surge in the popularity of the ""digital nomad"" lifestyle. This trend is particularly appealing to highly educated individuals who seek greater flexibility and the ability to work remotely. Automation and AI platforms have played a crucial role in enabling this lifestyle by providing the tools and payment infrastructure necessary for remote work.

For example, AI-powered collaboration tools and cloud-based software have made it easier for digital nomads to connect with clients and colleagues, regardless of their location. Additionally, AI-powered translation and communication tools have broken down language barriers, allowing digital nomads to work with clients from around the world. These systems have simplified payment and opened up a much larger employee and employment catchment area beyond the traditional hubs.

Demographics of Gig Workers:

Millennials and Generation Z are particularly likely to embrace gig work due to their preference for flexibility and their comfort with technology. Parents often choose gig work to balance their childcare responsibilities with their careers. Students may turn to gig work to earn extra income or gain experience in their field. Many retired individuals choose gig work as a way to stay active and earn supplemental income. Gig work can offer flexible opportunities for individuals with disabilities who may face challenges in traditional employment.

The AI gig economy's growth presents both opportunities and challenges for the larger economy. On the one hand, it can create new jobs, flexibility and stimulate economic growth. On the other hand, it can also lead to increased income inequality, job insecurity and a race to the bottom. Notably, in the AI-driven gig economy, gig workers often find themselves working not directly for clients but through AI agent intermediaries. These AI agents assign tasks, facilitate payment, and dispatch work, creating a new dynamic in the labor market that requires careful consideration and regulation.

To ensure that the gig economy benefits all segments of society, policymakers must address issues such as worker classification, benefits, and labor protections. By establishing clear guidelines for AI deployment, governments can help to mitigate potential risks such as algorithmic bias, privacy violations, and job displacement. These guidelines should address issues like transparency in AI decision-making, data privacy protections, and safeguards against discriminatory outcomes. Additionally, ensuring worker protections is crucial to prevent exploitation and maintain a fair working environment.

The gig economy is undergoing a rapid transformation, driven in part by the advancement of AI. As AI technologies continue to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative forms of work emerging. By understanding the trends and challenges associated with the gig economy, individuals and businesses can better position themselves to thrive in this new era of work."
Oil Surges On Israel-Iran Tensions: OPEC+ Strategy Shifts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdaugherty/2024/10/03/oil-surges-on-israel-iran-tensions-opec-strategy-shifts/,2024-10-03T21:42:38Z,"In the span of 24 hours, President Biden met to discuss an Israeli attack on Iranian facilities causing oil prices to surge while the Saudi oil minister has said prices could drop to as low as $50 per barrel if so-called cheaters within OPEC+ don't stick to agreed-upon production limits, according to delegates in the cartel. Benchmark U.S. crude saw its largest one-day gain in a year, jumping 5.1% to $73.71. The news also impacted U.S. stock indexes negatively. The Saudi oil minister's remarks were interpreted by other producers as a veiled threat that the kingdom is willing to launch a price war to keep its market share if other countries don't abide by the group's agreements.

This stark juxtaposition of geopolitical tensions and internal OPEC+ dynamics underscores the complex forces at play in the global oil market. As the threat of conflict pushes prices up, internal disagreements within OPEC+ threaten to pull them down, creating a volatile environment for oil prices. Daniel Yergin, the legendary authority on energy, geopolitics and the global economy, has consistently shared insights about oil prices. He notes, ""Energy is a strategic commodity, and those who control its production and distribution wield considerable power"" and ""If a war started, the oil price probably would go up until you saw other oil from the extra supplies that are available elsewhere coming into the world, into the market.""

As tensions escalate in the Middle East, with Israel retaliating against Iran's recent launch of 200 missiles (most of which were intercepted or landed in unoccupied areas), the global oil market finds itself on edge. The potential for conflict in this volatile region raises concerns about disruptions to the world's oil supply, with implications that extend far beyond the immediate participants. Iran, a key player in this unfolding drama, contributes significantly to the global oil market. Producing approximately 3.99 million barrels per day, Iran accounts for about 4% of the world's oil supply.

Any disruption to this output could have immediate and far-reaching consequences for global energy markets. Iran's smuggling network is sophisticated; the country's petroleum business is run by the National Iran Oil Company (NIOC), a state monopoly. Its main customer is China -- not the country's large, state-owned firms, which are exposed to Western sanctions, but ""teapot refineries"" that snap up 95% of Iranian supplies. However, the concerns don't stop at Iran's borders. The fear of a wider regional conflict looms large, potentially impacting other major oil-producing nations in the area. Saudi Arabia, the world's second-largest oil producer, contributes a staggering 11% to global supply. Iraq and the United Arab Emirates each account for 4%, while Kuwait adds another 3%. Collectively, these Middle Eastern nations form the backbone of global oil production.

The interconnected nature of the global oil market means that disruptions in one area can quickly ripple across the entire industry. The potential for price volatility extends beyond the immediate term. If a conflict were to escalate and impact multiple producing countries, the effect on oil prices could be much more dramatic. Historical precedents, such as the 1973 oil crisis, serve as stark reminders of how geopolitical events in the Middle East can send shockwaves through the global economy. Furthermore, as Yergin points out, higher prices tend to incentivize increased production from other sources. This market response can help to balance supply and demand over time, though the process is neither immediate nor without its own complexities.

The impact of oil price fluctuations extends far beyond the energy sector. Transportation costs, manufacturing, and consumer goods prices are all influenced by the cost of oil. Central banks and policymakers watch oil prices closely, as significant increases can contribute to inflationary pressures and impact economic growth. For oil-importing nations, particularly in the developing world, sustained high oil prices can pose significant challenges to economic stability and growth. Conversely, for oil-exporting countries, including those in the Middle East, higher prices can boost government revenues but may also intensify regional tensions.

For investors looking to capitalize on potential oil price increases, especially if further hostilities break out in the Middle East with direct conflict involving producing nations, two stocks stand out as potentially beneficial: Exxon (ticker: XOM) and Imperial Oil (ticker: IMO). Both of these companies are poised to benefit from higher oil prices and have less exposure to activities in the region than major oil producers operating directly in the Middle East. However, as with all investments, thorough research and consideration of one's individual financial situation and risk tolerance is advised before making any investment decisions."
"Thursday, October 3. Russia's War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/katyasoldak/2024/10/03/thursday-october-3-russias-war-on-ukraine-news-and-information-from-ukraine/,2024-10-03T21:22:47Z,"Regional. Kharkiv region. On October 3, a Russian glide bomb hit a residential building in the city of Kharkiv, wounding 12 residents, including a 3-year-old girl.

Chernihiv region. On October 3, A Russian drone struck a gas truck delivering fuel to residents in the village of Snovska 30 miles from the Russian border, resulting in the deaths of three people. The strike also caused a devastating explosion and subsequent fires, wounding four others.

Donetsk region. Russian shelling has severely damaged two water facilities in northern Donetsk, disrupting the water supply for about 260,000 residents. Local authorities are seeking alternative water supplies to mitigate the crisis.

War Crimes. Russian forces reportedly executed 16 Ukrainian prisoners-of-war in the largest known mass killing of POWs of the war, according to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office. A video recording of the incident, which took place near the front line in the Donetsk region on September 30, has circulated on social networks. The footage shows Russian troops lining up Ukrainian soldiers along a wooded area under Russian control, then shooting the men and finally killing the wounded with shots at close range.

Reports of Russian forces murdering Ukrainian POWs execution-style have appeared with alarming regularity. Near the occupied city of Novohrodivka in the Donetsk region, Russian troops in September reportedly barbarically killed a Ukrainian soldier with a sword.

National. Civilian casualties in Ukraine surged over the summer, with deaths rising by a third to 589 and the number of wounded increasing nearly 50% to 2,685, according to a UN report. By contrast, the spring ended with 444 civilian deaths and 1,817 wounded. Autumn casualty lists might confirm this upward trend as the number of casualties has remained high due to relentless glide-bomb attacks on residential buildings in the Sumy, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia regions and the intensified Russian offensive in the Donetsk region. The war has resulted in at least 11,743 civilian deaths and 24,614 wounded. The UN has also documented 1,358 educational facilities and 580 medical facilities destroyed or damaged.

According to estimates by the Kyiv School of Economics, Ukraine's economy has suffered indirect financial losses exceeding $1.2 trillion in lost revenue since the war started. The total estimated indirect losses, including current and projected revenue, amounts to $1.164 trillion, with an additional $385.7 billion expected in future losses. Besides lost revenue, Ukraine is grappling with substantial costs stemming from the conflict, including $42 billion for mine-clearing.

Russia has carried out 25 mass attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, launching more than 1,400 rockets and 500 drones in total against these facilities over the past two years. Russia has used approximately 1,200 cruise missiles in the attacks. Although Ukrainian air defenses have intercepted some 75% of these missiles, Russian ballistic missiles frequently reach their intended targets. Fully 98% of the drones employed were Iranian-made Shahed models, of which Ukraine shot down about 90%.

On August 26, Ukraine endured the largest and most devastating aerial attack to date. The strike, involving more than 200 Russian missiles and drones, inflicted an estimated of $1.2 billion in damage to energy infrastructure.

Ukraine can produce 4,000,000 drones annually, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed during the second International Defense Industry Forum in Kyiv attended by 115 domestic and 168 foreign companies from 30 countries. Zelenskyy outlined significant Ukrainian advancements in long-range technologies, including the long-range drone missile ""Palyanytsya"" and a newly developed ballistic missile that has completed its flight tests. In the first half of 2024, Ukraine manufactured 25 times more ammunition for artillery and mortars than in 2022, he added.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has invested up to $4 billion in arms manufacturing this year. The government also allocated $580 million for drone procurement in August, with 500 Ukrainian companies now engaged in drone production.

World. During his first foreign visit as NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte met President Zelenskyy in Kyiv on October 3. Zelenskyy encouraged NATO to intensify air defense support, stressing the critical need to reinforce Ukraine's defenses against missiles and drones, and to expedite implementation of key air defense commitments from the July NATO summit before the onset of winter.

Zelenskyy also acknowledged the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the eastern stronghold of Vuhledar, emphasizing the necessity of preserving soldiers' lives in the face of relentless Russian aggression. ""Without adequate weaponry, we cannot halt the Russian Federation, which is wreaking havoc on our positions. The safety of our soldiers is paramount; they are our citizens, and their lives matter more than any infrastructure,"" Zelenskyy asserted at a joint press conference with Rutte.

To bolster Ukraine's chances of getting through this winter, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has allocated $825 million, nearly twice as much as last year. During a visit to Kyiv on October 2, USAID Administrator Samantha Power emphasized the urgency of this funding as Russian forces continue to target energy facilities, using harsh winter conditions as a weapon against the Ukrainian people. In addition to energy aid, USAID is launching a five-year rehabilitation program called ""Rehab for You,"" with a budget of $13 million, allocating $237 million for humanitarian assistance and supporting Ukrainian education with 3.2 million newly-printed textbooks.

Switzerland has committed $1.7 billion over the next four years to support Ukraine's reconstruction efforts. Almost two-thirds of the funds will go to governance, mine-clearing and humanitarian aid while the remainder will fund recovery initiatives in collaboration with the Swiss private sector.

Ukraine has received a Patriot air defense system from Romania. This delivery is a crucial step in boosting its hard-pressed defense capabilities. NATO allies have pledged a total of seven air defense systems to support Kyiv, although former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba previously noted delays in delivery of some promised Patriot systems."
"Immigration Isn't The 'Crisis,' But Planning Of Markets Activity Is",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/10/03/immigration-isnt-the-crisis-but-planning-of-markets-activity-is/,2024-10-03T21:10:21Z,"Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has taken to blaming the Republicans for problems associated with a surge of immigrants at the southern border. Republicans have hit back. Commentary at the Wall Street Journal asserted that ""Blaming the surge on Republicans evades years of failed policies.""

Without taking sides, it should be obvious to Republicans that ""failed policy"" is a redundancy of sorts. We're talking government after all, and government policies are but the substitution of the knowledge of the few for that of the marketplace itself.

Applied to the southern border, naturally the policies have failed. Central planning of a market phenomenon always fails. Which is no insight.

At the same time, some readers will no doubt reject the assertion that human beings massing at the southern border is a market phenomenon, but if not, what is it? Really, what explains the paucity of humans north of the United States desperately trying to get to the U.S.?

Hopefully the implied point is sufficiently illuminating. Though not Singapore, Canada's economy is largely free and sufficiently prosperous such that the desperation to exit Canada isn't so great.

South of the U.S., and right on down to Venezuela at the very least, let's just say there's too much ""policy"" of the economic kind. And where there's an excess of central planning, there's invariably an outflow of people in search of the much greater opportunity that exists where policy isn't so ubiquitous. That's the United States. People have been coming here to cure their poverty for as long as the U.S. has existed, and surely before that.

Which is evidence yet again that this human migration to the U.S. is a market phenomenon. Even those who seek more border-patrol enforcement, a wall, or both, might agree. Figure that Haiti doesn't have a ""problem"" of desperate people trying to make their way there, but the U.S. generally always does. It's markets at work.

Conversely, let's call central planning the ultimate wall. Though invisible, it guards against the arrival of people better than any wall of any size ever could. Just the same, free markets and freedom ultimately overwhelm any wall, or any kind of border enforcement.

Which is a not-so-insightful way of saying that it's free markets borne of a lack of economic policy exerting their powerful pull for human capital from countries defined by a lack of free markets, and way too much policy. Think about it. Before Maduro and Chavez in Venezuela, was Venezuela's loss of human capital nearly as substantial? Hopefully the question answers itself.

In being answered, ideally it can be said that people generally do best economically where rules and regulations concerning commercial matters are the lightest. Yes, people do best in locales where policy is least apparent.

Applied to the U.S., its market economy is in so many ways a beautiful picture of human cooperation. At the same time, how ironic that the chaos and misery at the southern border resembles what it's like in the countries that would-be U.S. immigrants are trying to escape.

Why aren't Republicans talking about this? Why aren't they showcasing the always and everywhere failure of policy? Just as a policy meant to regulate the number of laptop computers, cars, and chips imported into the U.S. would amount to overwhelming failure, so do efforts to centrally plan people.

Which means we can end the chaos at the southern border in one of two ways: either mimic the economic policies of the countries migrants are exiting so that the U.S. is no longer attractive, or legalize work in the free-market U.S. so that wages and prices can dictate who comes to the U.S., and where. Anything else is central planning."
10 Practices To Mitigate Toxic Business Conversations,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinzwilling/2024/10/03/10-practices-to-mitigate-toxic-business-conversations/,2024-10-03T20:08:44Z,"In my work with business professionals over the years, I have met many who seem quick to engage in contentious dialogs with peers and constituents. These may be experts in their field, and have more experience, but they often exacerbate the problems rather than resolve them. The most effective leaders seem to be able to turn toxic conversations into more healthy dialogs.

I've always admired the art of dealing with toxic people and tuned by own habits to improve. I found some excellent recommendations along these lines in a new book, ""Habits of a Peace Maker,"" by Steven T. Collis, a recognized thought leader on this subject. I will summarize here his top ten practices, adding my own business perspective, for your own efforts to be more effective:

1. Show intellectual humility by first reframing the issue. Relating a tough business issue to another context will help conversations focus more on making progress and gaining new insights, rather than proving someone else wrong. Prioritize discussing potential win-win solutions and avoid trying to show off your expertise or role authority.

2. Practice real learning by seeking constructive dialog. Don't rely totally on social media or favorite news sources for market information and a position. Generate knowledge together and seek to understand what is meaningful to both of you, rather than choosing your position from competitor and customer catchphrases and interactions.

3. Assume the best about people, rather than the worst. You know that in business, your teams are normally motivated to do the right thing since hurting the business may also hurt their career. You should assume they just can't express their position in the best light, or allow their emotions to take control, so reframe their comments in the best light.

4. Avoid feeding the fears in your peers or adversaries. Always listen more than you talk and speak with kindness and a gentle tone. Be slow to state your own opinions, leaving open the possibility that you could be wrong. Acknowledge and avoid your own business biases and use that knowledge to tone down your inherent position on hard issues.

5. Seek to understand the best argument against you. Don't waste time on specious or weak arguments - reframe them to define the toughest counter-argument and address this one in your thinking before you respond. Listen for irrelevant facts and always politely keep the focus on business facts that matter. Don't respond to slogans or emotion.

6. Show willingness to change your mind with new info. Always take the time needed to reflect on business issues and arguments, acknowledging to yourself and your team that the best outcome may require you changing your mind. Put principle above loyalty to specific groups or causes and be willing to stand alone if necessary for the right answer.

7. Spend time with people on non-contentious activities. You need to spend uplifting recreation time with all members of your team, doing anything other than talking about the business challenges. This will help build bridges to understand legitimate concerns justifying why they believe what they believe, and help you take each other seriously.

8. Insert a sliver of humor into the business discussion. Humor can be a powerful tool for putting people at ease and allowing more fruitful conversations. You need to learn to recognize when you own humor is not working and adjust your style to the type most team listeners appreciate. Also be sensitive to formal situations that don't call for humor.

9. Build mental and emotional health for inner peace. Use meditation, intentional breathing, and other forms of mindfulness to achieve inner calm and emotional stability. You need to protect the daily time necessary to do those things that work for you, and be humble enough to ask for help from business mentors, peers, or outside professionals.

10. Embrace the reality of not closing every difference. Many of the most challenging business problems are complex for a reason, so you must recognize it is okay to not be able to resolve any specific one totally. Small steps to these solutions are important, so always minimize moments of hostility and argument, and celebrate every progress step.

By nurturing these habits, I am confident that both you and your team will be more effective in addressing the many new and complex business challenges that every company faces in this age of instant communication in a global economy. Make your handling of difficult and potentially toxic situations your career and competitive advantage rather than a barrier you can't overcome."
Don Draper's Mistake: Why Creator Marketing Needs More Than Money,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiegutfreund/2024/10/03/don-drapers-mistake-why-creator-marketing-needs-more-than-money/,2024-10-03T18:21:48Z,"In one of television's most memorable scenes, Mad Men's Don Draper famously told a frustrated Peggy Olson, ""That's what the money is for!"" when she asked for a simple ""thank you.""

While Draper's view may be from another era, many marketers today still see the creator economy through the same transactional lens. It's an outdated perspective that assumes a paycheck alone guarantees excellent work. But this approach falls flat in today's media landscape.

To succeed in creator marketing, brands must move beyond short-term transactions and build long-term partnerships.

Many advertisers see creators as content producers and little more. However, creators are entrepreneurs who can unlock growth and build long-term brand value if given the proper support. Beyond a paycheck, creators want mentorship, business guidance, and opportunities to expand their careers.

Billion Dollar Boy, a global influencer marketing agency known for iconic campaigns for brands like Amazon, Dove, Kenvue, Loewe, and Ulta, recognized this gap and created FiveTwoNine: The Creator Club. The name ""FiveTwoNine"" flips the traditional 9-to-5 workday on its head, acknowledging that many creators juggle multiple jobs while striving to make content creation their full-time career.

FiveTwoNine is more than just a community -- it's a physical space in London designed to support creators' development as leaders and business owners. It features production facilities, soundproof studios, and classrooms where creators can collaborate, take business courses, and connect with senior marketing leaders.

For example, this past September, the space hosted an event, ""Free to Be Me: The South Asian Experience in Creator Advertising,"" to bring industry players together to foster inclusivity and discuss the importance of representation in advertising.

FiveTwoNine's founding members include a diverse range of creators, such as:

* Lucy Edwards - Beauty and accessibility creator and disability activist.

Along with Lipton as a founding brand partner, these creators set the tone for the club's mission to build meaningful partnerships between brands and creators.

""FiveTwoNine isn't just a place for creators to create,"" says Edward East, Founder and Group CEO of Billion Dollar Boy. ""It's designed to help creators build the business skills they need to thrive -- whether through coaching on brand partnerships, financial planning, or simply having a space to meet and share ideas.""

FiveTwoNine already supports a community of over 1,000 creators and is expanding with a new location in New York City, set to open in early 2025. ""When creators succeed, brands benefit from access to a strong, sophisticated talent ecosystem that can deliver meaningful results,"" says Becky Owen, Global Chief Marketing Officer & Head of FiveTwoNine at Billion Dollar Boy.

Research by Billion Dollar Boy revealed that 73% of creators prioritize business consultancy services. Their top needs include financial advice, pricing and negotiation guidance, and support for diversifying income streams. Recognizing this, FiveTwoNine offers workshops and coaching sessions on supply chain logistics, legal considerations, and financial planning.

""Creators are essentially small business owners, and like any business, they need more than revenue to grow,"" explains Owen. ""By helping creators develop entrepreneurial skills, we're creating a talent ecosystem that helps creators thrive and enables brands to connect with a dynamic network of innovative partners.""

However, Owen emphasizes that this approach isn't for every brand. ""The marketers that see the best results are those that understand their growth is based on a long-term investment in creators and the creator economy,"" says Owen. ""It's not for everyone. Some won't get it, and that's okay. It's about focusing on the right brands committed to supporting creators.""

Lucy Edwards, one of FiveTwoNine's founding creators, shares the value of these deeper relationships: ""When I started, I had to wear many hats -- editor, producer, director, and business owner. Education and guidance weren't there for me, but FiveTwoNine is changing that for the next generation of creators. It's about giving creators the support they need to succeed long-term, ultimately benefiting their brand partners.""

Deeper Engagement and Loyalty: Creators who receive mentorship and business support are more invested in the success of the brands they partner with, leading to more robust relationships.

Better Business Outcomes: When creators have access to resources like financial planning, negotiation guidance, and supply chain logistics, they can focus on producing higher-quality content and driving better results for brands.

Access to a Dynamic Talent Network: Supporting creators' growth helps brands tap into a sophisticated, skilled network of creators who can deliver deeper insights, creative ideas, and innovative solutions.

Long-Term Value: By building long-term partnerships, brands benefit from creators' continuous growth and evolving influence, positioning them to access new audiences and stay relevant in an ever-changing media landscape.

Success in creator marketing doesn't require more spending; it requires shifting how brands see creators -- from mere content producers to long-term partners. By investing in creators' development and supporting their entrepreneurial goals, brands can build deeper relationships that deliver sustained growth and value.

With the right approach, creators become brand ambassadors and strategic collaborators who can help shape a brand's future. Don Draper may have believed, ""That's what the money is for,"" but in today's landscape, money alone won't buy the loyalty, creativity, or lasting impact that true partnerships can deliver."
These Are The EVs The EPA Says Are The Most And Least Energy Efficient,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2024/10/03/these-are-the-evs-the-epa-says-are-the-most-and-least-energy-efficient/,2024-10-03T17:55:11Z,"The number of miles an electric vehicle can run on a charge is inarguably the most important specification for shoppers to consider, as it can make the difference between reaching one's destination or being stranded at the side of the road with a depleted battery. The longest-running EVs on the market can run for as many as 300, even 400 miles on a full charge, but even the most limited of the bunch in this regard at around 150 miles are usually able to accommodate modest commutes.

But an EV's operating range on a charge only tells half the story. In a sense it's like buying a car or truck on the basis of its gas tank capacity, while totally ignoring its fuel economy. An EV that consumes killowatts (kWh) of electricity at a quicker rate than another will cost more to operate, just as a conventionally powered ride that travels fewer miles per gallon will be more expensive to run.

As with gas-fueled cars, EVs are tested for both their operating range and energy consumption under controlled conditions in a laboratory, with the process supervised by the Environmental Protection Agancy (EPA). They're ""driven"" on a dynamometer, which is like a treadmill for cars, using multiple standardized driving schedules to simulate city and highway motoring. An EV begins testing with the battery fully charged, and is operated until it becomes fully drained.

Like other vehicle types, EVs are required by federal law to prominently display the electric-equivalent energy consumption estimates (called MPGe) for city, highway and combined city/highway driving on the so-called Monroney sticker that also shows the vehicle's retail price and other data. The sticker also shows the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity that's needed to run the vehicle for 100 miles (this is expressed as kWh/100 miles). The EPA says this measurement is actually more meaningful when comparing costs and energy consumption between EVs than the MPGe rating.

The sticker also shows the average annual cost to keep an EV running, based on 15,000 miles driven in combined city/highway use at a predetermined cost for electricity. (The EPA's fueleconomy.gov website allows users to tailor these estimates based on actual miles driven and the local cost of electricity.)

Not surprisingly, larger and heavier electrified rides, especially full-size EV pickup trucks and SUVs, are among the biggest kilowatt guzzlers. The worst models here are the brawny GMC Hummer EV Pickup and SUV, which are both rated at a combined 47 MPGe and estimated to consume 72 kWh of electricity per 100 miles driven. By comparison, the Lucid Air sedan is rated at 146 MPGe and just 23 kWh per 100 miles. The latter would average an annual running cost of $500, versus $1,600 for the former. For those keeping score that means a Hummer owner would spend an average $5,500 more in electric bills over a five-year ownership period than one driving a Lucid Air.

Now to be fair, even the worst EVs in this regard will still be cheaper to operate than a gas-powered equivalent. The Chevrolet Silverado EV, for example, is estimated to cost its owners an average $1,200 per year in electricity costs when driven 15,000 miles, while the most powerful conventional version with a 6.2-liter V8 engine will more than triple that amount at a projected $4,100. That's a whopping $14,500 more to keep the gas version running over a five-year period than the EV. What's more, an EV produces zero tailpipe emissions in the process, though the local power plant generating the electricity used to run the vehicle may produce more or less pollutants of its own.

However, as with gas-powered rides it should be noted that an EV's real-world energy consumption depends on a number of variables. Lead-footed acceleration and driving at higher speeds will tend to drain both an EV's battery faster than will maintaining a smooth and steady pace. Driving on under-inflated tires will also cost an EV owner additional kilowatt-hours of electricity, as will driving with a full load of passengers and cargo. An EV will also consume kilowatts far quicker while towing heavy loads and driving in extremely cold or hot weather.

As they say, your mileage may vary.

These are the most and least energy-efficient models among the current fleet of electric vehicles, according to the EPA. We're noting the MPGe ratings, the number of kilowatts it takes to drive 100 miles and the average estimated annual energy costs for the best and worst-performing variants in each model line:"
Chinese EV Firms Are Suffering Losses,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2024/10/03/chinese-ev-firms-are-suffering-losses/,2024-10-03T17:51:24Z,"Beijing had made a big bet on electric vehicles (EV). But like so many other efforts of China's centrally planned economy, things have not gone well. Intense price competition among China's many EV producers as well as waning demand -- both in China and abroad -- have put manufacturers into financial trouble, with some reporting losses despite still considerable public support. Beijing has begun to step away from the effort, leaving local governments to pick up the subsidy slack. It is not a sustainable situation.

This now failing effort began more than five years ago. According to the MIT Technology Review, the raft of subsidies, tax breaks, procurement contracts, and other more oblique incentives to ramp up production and make China dominant has cost Beijing the equivalent of some $230 billion. The push eventually created a market for 13.1 million vehicles that accounted for 60% of EV ownership globally. Beijing also pushed for global sales of Chinese-made EVs. That effort made little headway in the United States even before Washington began to show increased levels of hostility toward China and Chinese products. The effort did, however, have considerable success in Europe.

Now global sales seem set to decline. Washington has imposed tariffs on a number of Chinese products, including EVs and their components as well as Chinese-made batteries and parts. Washington's moves changed little, of course, since Chinese EV's had made little-to-no headway in North America. But tariffs and general levels of hostility do make it clear to Chinese EV producers that they have no hope of eventually making gains in the United States. Further squelching hopes for Chinese EV sales in this country are the difficulties facing the EV efforts of domestic U.S. producers, except perhaps Tesla. Chinese sales would in other words have faced difficulties even if Washington was not hostile. Meanwhile, Europe, where Chinese EV sales had been strong, has begun to complain that China is dumping low-priced vehicles on European markets and in the process is stymying the development of independent European EV production. Accordingly, the EU is ready to place tariffs of up to 45 percent on imports of Chinese EVs, squelching any hopes that Chinese producers can look to robust European sales any time soon.

Beijing, already stuck with other planning errors that have created overcapacities in other areas of China's economy, has backed away from the EV push. It has cut that support back nearly 66% from what it had offered the industry in 2018. Such an action would normally force a consolidation in the industry. Weaker, less efficient firms with poorer products would go out of business after a while, leaving others to find financial health at lower production levels. But that is not what is happening. Instead, local governments, many already in difficult financial straits, have spent to keep what are rapidly becoming zombi firms afloat.

Some regions-Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Changping stand out-have begun offering Chinese EV buyers rebates ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 yuan a vehicle. Some localities are trying to support EV producers more directly. They claim to be doing this in order to retain and expand the high-income workforces associated with EV production. Some of the local governments have little choice. In the salad days when Beijing was giving the industry a lot of support, these local authorities found ways to involve themselves in the effort through direct investments in EV producers or taking out loans and issuing bonds on behalf of these manufacturers. The City of Hefei, for instance, stands to lose its 5-billion-yuan investment in the EV division of NIO, Inc.

This situation is clearly untenable. These local governments already face financial difficulties. They can little afford to support unprofitable companies, especially since a global sales pickup is highly unlikely. Ultimately the consolidation will occur, private investors will face losses as will local governments, even as they also lose the high-income workforces they are striving to retain. China then will face another bump in the road to economic recovery."
YouTube Stars Sam And Colby Prove Creator Appeal Extends To Cinemas,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianshepherd/2024/10/03/youtube-stars-sam-and-colby-prove-creator-appeal-extends-to-cinemas/,2024-10-03T17:51:11Z,"The lines between social media stardom and traditional entertainment continue to blur as top YouTube creators expand their empires into film and beyond. Leading this charge are paranormal investigators Sam and Colby, who are blazing new trails with a nationwide theatrical release, while French adventurer Inoxtag has found success on the big screen in Europe.

Sam and Colby Go Nationwide with Theatrical Release

Known for their ghost hunting expeditions and paranormal content on YouTube, Sam and Colby are taking a big leap with the nationwide theatrical release of their new film ""The Legends of the Paranormal"". Building on the success of last year's limited release, the duo has partnered with Cinemark for a full week-long run in over 350 theaters across the US.

""This one is particularly special because it's not being shared on YouTube,"" Sam explained in an exclusive interview. ""Last year was more of a trial run. We had a one day release partnered with Cinemark, which was amazing, we were able to sell out about 168 theaters nationwide. And because of that, we were able to work this entire year on more of a feature film length version of that video.""

The film, which premieres this week, expands beyond their usual ghost hunting fare. As Sam shared, ""What's interesting about this one is, unlike our usual content, which is primarily about ghost hunting, we were able to expand the search. And so we went to this place called Mount Wilson Ranch, not only in search of the paranormal, but also there have been a lot of alien sightings and the sightings of cryptids or skinwalkers.""

Beyond just translating their YouTube style to the big screen, the theatrical release allows Sam and Colby to expand their storytelling. Sam noted, ""You get to see the raw moments of Sam and Colby, and we get to edit it a little bit more relaxed and different."" Colby added, ""It's a slower paced movie... fans really get to sit back and see us in a different light.""

The duo sees this as just the beginning of their cinematic ambitions. ""Hopefully we get better and better at this, and we bridge the gap more and more to where this becomes at least a yearly event, to where we can start making more and more movies in the future,"" Sam shared.

Colby echoed this sentiment, saying, ""Honestly, the sky's the limit. This is a learning process for us and so if the fans keep enjoying it and we're enjoying it as well, then we're just going to keep making better and better movies and hopefully striking cooler deals as time goes on.""

Hell Week and Expanding the Sam and Colby Universe

While the film represents a major milestone, Sam and Colby aren't slowing down on other fronts. Their annual ""Hell Week"" Halloween event is approaching.

""We can't spill all the beans about it, but we have, some really exciting announcements and news about this spot,"" Colby revealed. ""We spent an entire week where we couldn't leave at all, we had to stay there every single night in this elementary school... it was probably one of the craziest things we've ever experienced.""

Inoxtag Conquers Everest and the French Box Office

While Sam and Colby pioneer in the US market, across the Atlantic, French YouTuber Inoxtag is making waves with his own cinematic debut. His documentary ""Kaizen,"" which chronicles his year-long journey to climb Mount Everest, has become a sensation in French theaters.

Partnering with MK2, a French film group with a dedicated ""YouTube Cinema Club,"" Inoxtag's film sold an astonishing 350,000 movie tickets in just one day. The film's success highlights the power of creator fandom, with Inoxtag's 8.4 million YouTube subscribers eagerly supporting his big-screen debut.

MK2 co-CEO Elisha Karmitz told Variety, ""We thought it would be a success, and that's why we scheduled it in 350 screens, but it was like a tidal wave and a level of enthusiasm that we hadn't seen before.""

Notably, Inoxtag insisted on making the film available in small towns, recognizing that many of his French fans were from rural locations. This strategy paid off, with Karmitz noting that more than 40% of the screens that aired ""Kaizen"" ""are arthouses in small cities throughout France.""

After its theatrical run, Inoxtag made the decision to release the film for free on YouTube, where it has already racked up 24 million views in just four days. This move demonstrates the creator's commitment to his online community, even as he expands into traditional media.

A New Era for Creators

The success of creators like Sam and Colby and Inoxtag in traditional media formats signals a significant shift in the entertainment landscape. These YouTubers are leveraging their massive online followings to break into cinemas and beyond, while still maintaining their core YouTube presence.

This trend is not just a win for individual creators, but a positive sign for the creator economy as a whole. It demonstrates that the skills, audience connections, and storytelling abilities honed on social media platforms can translate to success in more traditional media formats.

As Sam and Colby aptly put it, ""The sky's the limit."" With creators continuing to push boundaries and explore new mediums, the future of entertainment looks increasingly creator-driven. For fans, industry professionals, and aspiring creators alike, this new frontier promises exciting possibilities and a continued blurring of the lines between digital and traditional media."
The Longshoremen Strike Is A Battle Of Workers Versus Automation,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/10/03/the-longshoremen-strike-is-a-battle-of-workers-versus-automation/,2024-10-03T17:37:39Z,"Thousands of longshoremen and dockworkers along the Eastern seaboard of the United States and the Gulf Coast walked off the job on Tuesday after the International Longshoremen's Association failed to reach contract agreements with the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports.

The ILA's initial proposal was for a 77% salary increase over the six-year duration of their contract with USMX, as well as a complete ban on the automation of gates, cranes and container-moving trucks at its ports. These union members earn a base salary of approximately $81,000 each year; however, those who work significant overtime can earn more than $200,000 annually, the Associated Press reported.

To avert the strike, the shipping industry group offered a nearly 50% wage hike on Monday and committed to maintaining the automation restrictions from the previous contract, but the union rejected the deal as it would not protect the workforce from semi-automation.

""The ILA is steadfastly against any form of automation -- full or semi -- that replaces jobs or historical work functions,"" the largest union of maritime workers in North America said in a statement. ""We will not accept the loss of work and livelihood for our members due to automation. Our position is clear: the preservation of jobs and historical work functions is non-negotiable.""

From the picket line at the Maher Terminal in Port Elizabeth, New Jersey, ILA president Harold Daggett reiterated that the union, which boasts upward of 85,000 longshoremen, seeks ""absolute airtight language"" to ensure there will be no automation.

The combined 36 ports on the Atlantic to Gulf coasts play a crucial role in both U.S. and global trade, handling 57% of U.S. container volume and a quarter of annual international trade valued at $3 trillion. According to the Conference Board, this sheer size limits alternative supply chain options for U.S. businesses, making the potential impact of a strike severe. A one-week work stoppage could cost the economy $3.78 billion and drive up consumer goods prices.

The ILA has expressed significant concerns over the implementation of automation, which it believes could reduce the need for human labor. The union seeks to maintain job security in an era where technological advancements are increasingly transforming port operations, and promises to strike until they reach a deal.

""The ILA intends for the demonstrations to continue round the clock, 24/7, for as long as it takes for United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) to meet the demands of ILA rank-and-file members,"" the organization said.

The ascendancy of technology has long been a point of contention between workers and employers since the Industrial Revolution, when mechanized production began replacing manual labor. This tension has only intensified with the rise of artificial intelligence, as the threat of disruption or obsolescence is widespread across various sectors and job functions.

The deployment of robotics and automated technology in ports globally has been a trend aimed at increasing efficiency, reducing costs and ensuring the health and safety of workers in handling the growing volume of cargo.

Although, its adoption in container terminals remains limited in the global shipping industry. According to research published in Maritime Economic and Logistics, as reported by Axios, only 62 out of 1,300 global container terminals were automated or semi-automated by the end of 2021.

U.S. ports are lagging behind their Asian and European counterparts in adopting automation. This technological gap has resulted in slower container ship unloading times at most American ports compared to those in Asia and Europe. Industry experts warn that without embracing more automated systems, U.S. ports risk becoming increasingly less competitive in the global shipping landscape. Additionally, American consumers end up paying for this inefficiency through increased import prices.

The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have led the way in implementing automation among U.S. ports. According to research conducted in 2022 by the Economic Roundtable of Los Angeles, which was commissioned by the West Coast dockworkers union, the introduction of partial automation at these California ports resulted in an annual loss of 572 jobs during 2020 and 2021.

However, data from 2015 to 2021 shows the ILWU workforce in the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports experienced an 11.2% growth, surpassing the 8.4% growth seen at other West Coast ports.

During this same period, the two automated terminals in these ports saw a significant 31.5% increase in paid hours, while non-automated terminals only experienced a 13.9% increase. The substantial difference in paid hours was attributed to efficiency improvements that allowed them to process more than twice the number of containers compared to their non-automated counterparts."
How Americans Think The Election Will Impact Their Personal Finances,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/presidential-election-personal-finance-impact/,2024-10-03T16:32:49Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

The economy is the top issue on the minds of voters heading into the 2024 presidential election, and Americans are divided on which candidate will improve their personal finances, according to a Forbes Advisor and Talker Research survey of 2,000 registered voters. Of these, 48% were Democrats, 39% were Republicans and 10% were independents.

For instance, 48% of respondents said Vice President Kamala Harris would deliver a better economy compared to 44% for former President Donald Trump.

However, 52% said their personal finances were healthier four years ago, when Trump was in office, compared to less than a quarter who said they're doing better now during the Biden Administration.

Voters want the eventual winner to focus on bringing down prices; 60% cited inflation as the top priority for the next administration.

A look at the topline figures paint a positive picture of the public's appetite for a potential Harris Administration.

Nearly half (48%) of respondents said the economy would improve under her presidency, compared to 36% who said it would worsen. Another 16% said it wouldn't change.

Meanwhile, 44% said that a Trump Administration would bode well for the nation's economic future, while 42% believed the economy would suffer. A seventh (14%) replied that the economy wouldn't change much in a second Trump Administration.

But when you drill down on the specific issues that affect personal finances, including borrowing costs and the stock market, Americans seemed to have a better appreciation for a Trump victory.

More than half of respondents (52%) said their finances are worse than four years ago, compared to just 23% who think they're better off. Another 20% said they were about the same, while another 5% weren't sure.

Republicans (70%) and independents (65%) were far more likely to think they're finances have gotten worse over the past four years than Democrats (35%).

This finding jibes with a series of data points and sentiment surveys.

For instance, median household income adjusted for inflation was higher in 2019 ($81,210) than in 2023 ($80,610), according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Just 31% of Americans believe the economy is getting better, according to Gallup, which is down from 51% at the end of 2019.

High prices continue to plague the American consumer.

Even as the rate of inflation has come down, prices are still growing much faster than the Fed's preferred target of 2%.

The personal consumption expenditures (core PCE) price index that strips out volatile food and energy prices, which is the Fed's preferred gauge, rose by 2.7% in August over the previous 12 months.

That's why 60% respondents in our survey think that easing the cost of living should be the top priority of a future Harris or Trump administration.

The next most important issues, lowering income taxes and creating more jobs, were each selected by just 10% of respondents.

Those results dovetail with what Americans say is impacting their decision this November.When asked to name the two biggest economic issues in the election, nearly three-quarters (74%) identified inflation. The second most popular response was healthcare expenses at just 33%.

This is a bipartisan issue: 79% of Republicans and 69% of Democrats selected inflation as one of their biggest concerns.

Americans are likely taking their vote seriously since 68% of respondents either somewhat or strongly agree that the president has a tangible impact on their financial situation.

Meanwhile, 54% think macroeconomic events, such as inflation or stock market performance, have the biggest impact on their financial health, compared to just 20% who say their personal choices are more important.

That makes sense given the massive events American consumers have faced over the past four years, from pandemic-era business and school closures to stimulus checks to sky-high inflation.

While folks believe that the outcome of the election will impact their personal finances, few will wait for a winner before making financial decisions.

In 2016, while President Barack Obama, a Democrat, was finishing his final year in office, those with a Democratic party identification were optimistic about the economy (+18), according to Gallup's U.S. Economic Confidence Index, while Republicans were gloomy (-31).

In 2017, when Obama was replaced by Trump, a Republican, the two sides flipped. Republicans (+46) were now ecstatic, while Democrats (-20) were miserable.

Independents were even-keeled throughout.

Obviously, these voters were viewing events through their partisan lens; people's fortunes didn't radically shift overnight.

This can have real consequences.

A Democratic voter who believed Trump would bring a market collapse missed out on years of stock market gains, for instance.

While your political passions may run hot, don't let them influence how you operate your personal budget.

Of course, big events impact your personal finances. Anyone who has lived through the past four years may have seen wild fluctuations in the value of their home, the interest rate on their high-yield savings account or the annual percentage rate (APR) on their credit card.

Where you run into trouble, though, is believing that these events have a bigger impact on your financial health than your own actions.

Research shows that financial self-efficacy, which is the belief that you're in control of your fate, is key to financial success.

Yes, big stuff happens. But big stuff always happens. The 2000s, for instance, were bookended by two recessions that led to a lost decade for stocks and a housing bubble burst.

You can thrive by learning how to navigate rough waters.

China Market Update: Hong Kong Takes Breather As Fiscal Policy Bazooka Awaits,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brendanahern/2024/10/03/china-market-update-hong-kong-takes-breather-as-fiscal-policy-bazooka-awaits/,2024-10-03T16:27:22Z,"Asian equities were lower on Middle East tension and a stronger US dollar except for Japan, which rose on a weaker yen as Mainland China is on holiday until next Tuesday. South Korea was closed for National Day, and Taiwan for a typhoon again.

Yes, Hong Kong was lower/took a breather from the recent epic run, though the Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech closed well above intra-day lows of -4.46% and -7.45%, indicating some bought the dip. Yesterday's top performers, such as internet and real estate, were today's worst performers. Investors understandably took some profits after the Hang Seng jumped 31% from September 11 and +50% since the January 22 low. Before today's pullback, the Hang Seng Tech was up +50% since September 9 and +71% since its bottom on January 31.

Bloomberg News had a good piece articulating why investors bought today's dip as former Ministry of Finance economist Jia Kang stated the Chinese government could issue RMB 4 trillion to RMB 10 trillion of government bonds to ""...lift confidence by drastically raising government investment in pubic projects"". Issuing long-term government debt at these low interest rates makes sense. RMB 7 trillion of stimulus would be 5.5% of GDP (China's GDP is $18 trillion), higher than our estimates/chatter of 1.5% to 3% of GDP. Yes, the monetary policy bazooka has been fired. However, it is critical to understand fiscal policy support hasn't been fully articulated, though it is coming based on last Thursday's release from President Xi and the Politburo. That would mean there is more likely to be more good news in the coming weeks, right?

As China's economy recovers, Chinese economic data will improve as year-over-year comparisons make for easy comparisons, i.e., more good news. Sell-side analysts have only started upgrading price targets for a few internet names. At the same time, most strategists haven't made any significant China overweight adjustments, nor have any economists reversed their recent downgrades of China's GDP. Those positive developments will happen over time, ie, more good news. Are investors prepared for this? I don't think so, as Q3 review/Q4 outlook investment committee meetings, board meetings, and trustee meetings are taking place.

The re-rating of Chinese equities is in a very early stage as pullbacks/corrections, such as today, will happen, which is a good thing/healthy. Next Tuesday will be must watch TV as the Mainland market and Southbound Stock Connect reopen. It is worth noting that Meituan was Hong Kong's most heavily traded by value as the stock bucked the downdraft +3.96% at a level 3X the pre-rally levels, trading 78mm shares versus its 1-year average of 37mm. Hong Kong still traded 282% of the 1-year average. As we reported yesterday, brokerage stocks also bucked the downdraft on reports of sixty brokerage houses remaining open to open new accounts. Yicai Global reported that the number of Chinese traveling by rail hit a record on Tuesday with 21.45mm railway trips as an anticipated 175mm passenger trips are expected over the 10-day national holiday. A Mainland media source noted that over 1 billion movie tickets have been sold thus far during the national holiday.

The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech fell -1.47% and -3.46%% on volume -28.5% from yesterday, which is 282% of the 1-year average. 66 stocks advanced, while 432 declined. Main Board short turnover declined -23.08% from yesterday, which is 249% of the 1-year average, as 15% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers' ETF hedging). Value and small caps fell less than growth and large caps. All sectors were negative: real estate -5.37%, healthcare -3.22%, and staples -3.16%. All sub-sectors were negative, less food/staples led lower by diversified finance, real estate, and consumer durables. Southbound Stock Connect is closed until next Tuesday.

Mastercard to Buy Swedish Startup That Makes It Easier to Manage and Cancel Subscription Plans

Mastercard said it's agreed to acquire Minna Technologies, a software firm that makes it easier for consumers to manage their subscriptions. The move comes as Mastercard and its primary payment network rival Visa are rapidly attempting to expand beyond their core credit and debit card businesses into technology services, such as cybersecurity, fraud prevention, and pay-by-bank payments. The payments giant said that the deal, along with other initiatives it's committed to around subscriptions, will allow it to give consumers a way to access all their subscriptions in a single view, whether inside your banking app or a central ""hub.""

UK Banks to Put Four-Day Hold on Suspicious Payments

UK Banks will have the power to pause payments for up to four days to give them more time to investigate fraud, the government has said. Currently, transfers must be processed or declined by the end of the next business day, but the new law will allow an extension of three more days. For years, banks have needed to have reasonable grounds to suspect fraud before being able to investigate but have also faced pressure from customers who want payments to be made instantly. The long-proposed new regulations will come into force at the end of October, later than originally planned. [BBC]

E-payments Are Essential in China, But Still Tricky for Foreign Visitors

China's digital economy has been evolving at a faster pace since the pandemic. Daily tasks like calling a cab or ordering and paying at a restaurant are all done mostly through Alipay and WeChat. According to the Chinese central bank, in 2023 there were 340 trillion yuan ($48 trillion) worth of third-party online payments. Alipay and WeChat make up over 90% of mobile payments. However, it has not been easy for foreigners to sign up for the payment apps. To attract more foreign visitors, cities like Shanghai, aided by the country's central bank, have pushed to make mobile payments more visitor-friendly. Foreigners residing in China must provide passport details and a scan of their passport information page. [Marketplace]

Average Cost of Credit Card Processing Fees

You can give your customers more payment options by accepting credit cards, but you will pay a credit card processing fee to do this. The average credit card processing fee, which will be taken out of a merchant's sales revenue, is in the range of about 1.5% to 3.5%. Merchants can negotiate their card processing fees, and they are not set in stone. [Bankrate]

Baby Boomers Still Have the Highest Credit Limits

A recent Experian survey found that baby boomers have an average credit limit of $41,906, up nearly 4% from the year before and more than three-times the average for Generation Z ($12,899). While it's tempting to be jealous of other people's financial positions, there are some good reasons why baby boomers outpace everyone else with their credit limits. For one, boomers have decades-long credit histories. Lenders love long credit histories, and those who've paid their bills on time have likely earned higher limits. Second, baby boomers generally have a higher credit score than most generations, with an average score of 743. [The Motley Fool]

43% of Americans Have at Least One Unused Gift Card

More than 2 in 5 Americans have at least one gift card, gift voucher or store credit they haven't used. The average amount in unused gift cards, gift vouchers or store credit is $244 per person. More than 1 in 3 Americans have lost money with a gift card misstep. The data shows that 55 percent of households with annual incomes of $100,000+ have at least one unused gift card, more than any other income bracket. The average amount of unused gift cards for this income bracket is $348. This contrasts sharply with households making under $50,000 annually. Just 35 percent of them have unused gift cards with an average value of $180. [Bankrate]

Visa Launches Spend Management Partnership with Denmark's Cardlay

Danish FinTech Cardlay is working with Visa to improve spend management for commercial card issuers. The partnership combines Cardlay's spend management platform with Visa's market position, payment network and data capabilities to offer clients ""fully embedded"" commercial cards and expense management solutions. Research by PYMNTS Intelligence has projected that the global value of virtual card transactions will grow from about $2 trillion to $6.8 trillion by 2026, a sign of the growing recognition of their simplicity and security when compared to outdated methods such as paper checks. The research also showed that 55% of companies were using virtual cards more frequently. [PYMNTS]"
The Best Dividend Plays For Fed Rate Cuts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/10/03/the-best-dividend-plays-for-fed-rate-cuts/,2024-10-03T14:52:20Z,"Now that Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell has pivoted towards his ""other mandate,"" we should take a cue from my six-year-old, who yells from the back seat:

""FedEx!""

For years she has been enamored with the FedEx Corp (FDX) logo. Neither her sister nor her parents are sure why, but the affinity is real. See a truck on the road, yell ""FedEx!"" loudly to score the point.

I didn't have the heart to tell her that FedEx disappointed investors with a sanguine outlook a couple of weeks ago. The stock corrected lower, as usually does after earnings.

(Seriously, the best time to buy FedEx lately has been right after the company talks to Wall Street and the suits sell their shares. They rally in between earnings calls.)

FedEx is the type of stock I always watch, waiting for a pullback. It directly benefits from a megatrend, a bull market in e-commerce sales. E-commerce as a percentage of retail sales gained for two decades and then spiked in 2020. After a brief respite, e-comm sales are heading to new all-time highs:

FedEx is increasingly fulfilling e-comm shipments. My in-house FedEx fan recently received her brand-new rainbow basketball via her favorite courier via my order from DICK's Sporting Goods (DKS).

Instead, FedEx got the call and this beautiful roundball -- sans air -- was shoved into a shoebox.

FedEx may be delivering even more rainbow basketballs shoved into shoeboxes thanks to an accommodative Fed. Chair Jay Powell spent the last two years focusing solely on the Fed's key mandate: stable prices. Now, he needs to make an about-face and hit the second mandate -- labor. So long, inflation concerns and hello, accommodation!

With lower rates and quiet QE on the menu, it is time to ask ourselves ""what if"" the economy surprises everyone and the Fed stimulus fuels growth. After all, the economy has been growing since April 2020. Rates are down 50 ""bips"" with more to come. What if we see neither a hard or soft landing but rather no landing at all?

In this scenario. FedEx benefits. In fact its stock price has 40% upside from here just to catch up with its ever-rising dividend.

And our Fed isn't the only dovish central bank! Last week the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced a sweeping set of stimulus measures. The PBoC lowered interest rates (including mortgage rates) and announced ""stock market support"" plans to help companies buy back their own shares and to allow investors to borrow against their portfolios.

Yee haw, China! Shares of Chinese firms spiked last week and copper miners popped with them.

Energy prices have, thus far, remained subdued. But this flood of global liquidity is obviously supportive of dividend king Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP ). When energy prices jump, the pipeline stocks that AMLP owns boost their dividends. Just look:

However! If you cleverly own the stock through AMLP, no K-1! Just a normal 1099 showing your sweet dividends received. Which dish an elite 8% as I write today, supported by central banks everywhere."
Author Darlene Cordero Is Helping Healers Turn Purpose Into Profit,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleemariepreston/2024/10/03/author-darlene-cordero-is-helping-healers-turn-purpose-into-profit/,2024-10-03T13:05:17Z,"The wellness industry has evolved far beyond its niche origins, emerging as a mainstream force in media, entertainment, and consumer culture. What was once limited to self-help books and exclusive retreats is now front and center in mass media, with influencers, celebrities, and thought leaders championing holistic living. The global wellness economy, valued at $5.6 trillion in 2022, is projected to exceed 8.7 trillion by 2027, fueled by increasing interest in the healing arts, mental health, and other spiritual practices.

Amid this booming landscape, Darlene Cordero has become a transformative figure within the sector. An author, strategist, and thought leader, Cordero has been instrumental in shaping the careers of some of the most prominent names in wellness, including Deepak Chopra and Jay Shetty, including a collaboration with reggaeton superstar J Balvin. With her new book, The Healer's Playbook: Empowering Wellness Entrepreneurs, she offers a blueprint for those looking to turn their spiritual gifts into thriving businesses.

With more than a decade of experience as a business strategist, Cordero has mastered the art of merging purpose with profitability -- a skill she shares generously in The Healer's Playbook. Each page offers readers practical tools, reflective prompts, and actionable strategies to help them craft clear, meaningful goals that align with both their personal and professional aspirations. For many wellness entrepreneurs, the challenge often lies in balancing the heart-centered work of healing with the pragmatic demands of running a business.

Exploring that balance further, Cordero sat down for an interview with ForbesBLK contributor Ashlee Marie Preston to discuss the inspiration behind The Healer's Playbook and her vision for empowering wellness entrepreneurs.

Ashlee Marie Preston: The Healer's Playbook has hardly been out a week and is already resonating with so many wellness entrepreneurs, spiritual teachers, and healers. What inspired you to write this book, and what impact do you hope it will have on those who read it?

Darlene Cordero: When I worked at Chopra Global as the Director of Talent and Partnerships, I saw a significant gap in the wellness industry. While millions of dollars are funneled into wellness brands, products, and apps, very few resources are directed toward the practitioners -- the healers, yoga instructors, meditation teachers, and therapists who are at the heart of this work. These individuals carry the responsibility of guiding others toward healing and care, yet they often lack the tools and resources to navigate the business side of their practice and their own self-care. I've walked alongside them, witnessed their challenges, and realized there wasn't a comprehensive guide to help them balance their deeper purpose with the realities of running a sustainable business.

This realization, combined with my own experience working on impactful projects like the ""Renew Yourself: Body, Mind, Spirit"" 21-Day Meditation Challenge with J Balvin and Deepak Chopra, where we brought meditation tools to Spanish-speaking communities that had never been reached before, solidified my vision for The Healer's Playbook. That collaboration wasn't just about bringing mindfulness to a new audience -- it was about creating a bridge between culture and wellness, offering tools for deep personal growth, and ensuring the wisdom holders behind these practices were supported as well.

Through The Healer's Playbook, I want to continue this work, not just for the communities who benefit from these practices, but also for the healers themselves. My hope is that this book provides a roadmap for aligning their purpose with sustainable growth, empowering them to feel less alone in their entrepreneurial journey. Whether it's helping them refine their business model, find their voice, or make meaningful connections, I want them to walk away feeling equipped, inspired, and ready to embrace their unique path with confidence.

Preston: As you've mentioned, you have worked with some of the biggest names in the wellness industry, including Deepak Chopra and Jay Shetty. What key lessons have you learned from these experiences, and how have they influenced your own approach to wellness and business?

Cordero: I feel very fortunate to work with these brands and individuals who have and continue to lead with such impact and reach. I love that they are bold in forging a path of knowledge and wisdom from their teachers and lineage. I resonate deeply with the idea of passing down teachings and stories, and now with advancements in media and technology, more people -- no matter where they are in the world or their stage of personal growth -- can access this knowledge. They can take what resonates with them at the moment, whether it's staying true to one lineage or mixing elements to create something authentic to who they are.

Deepak Chopra has been a guiding figure, showing me how crucial it is to lead with authenticity and alignment. The Jay Shetty Coaching School, which has been a client, has demonstrated the importance of making coaching accessible to a wide audience. I became a Life Coach this past year and loved the program and community. Through the school, I've seen how personal growth tools and wisdom can be spread in a modern way that aligns with people's lives and stages of development. These experiences have taught me the value of creating your own path and not trying to be anyone but yourself. Both have been authentic in their journeys, not trying to follow anyone else's path but their own. That's something I've taken to heart -- staying true to your own inner knowing, and from there, creating and leading boldly.

Preston: Many wellness practitioners struggle to balance their passion for healing with the practicalities of running a business. What advice would you give to someone just starting out in the wellness industry?

Cordero: One of the biggest challenges wellness practitioners face is balancing their passion for healing with the often overwhelming realities of running a business. My advice? Embrace both. As much as you may want to focus solely on the healing and service you provide, it's essential to learn the business fundamentals that will support your practice in the long term. Too often, I hear practitioners say, ""I'm not good at marketing"" or ""I don't know anything about business."" These mental blocks prevent them from learning and moving their business forward with confidence. My advice is to stay curious.

You don't have to become an expert in everything, but understanding the basics of pricing, branding, and client acquisition will make you a more empowered entrepreneur. When you approach these aspects with an open mind, you'll not only learn but also better understand the experts you may eventually hire to support you. Additionally, surrounding yourself with a community of like-minded individuals is key. Find mentors, build a network, and seek out resources that support both your personal and professional growth. The wellness industry can feel isolating, but when you align yourself with others who share your vision, the journey becomes far less daunting.

Preston: One of the most admirable things about you is your unyielding spirit. You've recently opened up about your journey with stage four cancer; yet that hasn't deterred you from your life's purpose. How has your health journey shaped the way you approach your work, both as an entrepreneur and as a healer?

Cordero: This journey has fundamentally shifted how I approach every aspect of my life. When you're faced with your own mortality, you're forced to reevaluate what truly matters. For me, it has brought a heightened sense of clarity and purpose. Every moment, every interaction, and every decision now feels more intentional. The diagnosis didn't stop my ambitions; it fueled them. I realized that life is precious and fleeting, and I no longer have time to second-guess my decisions or hold back. This experience has taught me to lead with more presence, more gratitude, and a deep sense of surrender -- not surrender in a passive way, but surrender in the sense of trusting the process, even when the outcome is unknown. It has also deepened my empathy for others. I understand, on a visceral level, that healing is not linear, and it's not just physical -- it's emotional, spiritual, and mental. This perspective allows me to show up in my work with more authenticity, and it has made me laser-focused on creating meaningful, lasting impact in everything I do.

Preston: One of the major themes in The Healer's Playbook is the importance of storytelling in business. Can you share more about how healers and wellness practitioners can use storytelling to grow their practice?

Cordero: Storytelling is one of the most powerful tools available. It's how we connect with our clients, share our values, and demonstrate the transformation we can offer. In The Healer's Playbook, I write, ""Healing begins when you honor your story and use it to light the path for others."" When practitioners share their personal journey -- whether it's how they discovered their passion for healing, the challenges they've faced, or the lessons they've learned -- they create a deeper connection with their communities. This allows potential clients to see themselves in that story and feel more confident that they're in the right place. Storytelling also humanizes your brand. It's not just about what services you offer; it's about why you offer them. The more you can share your authentic self, the more naturally you will attract the right clients and opportunities.

Preston: In your book, you emphasize the value of building authentic relationships in the wellness industry. What are some of the ways entrepreneurs can foster meaningful connections and community within their work?

Cordero: At the heart of any successful wellness business is connection -- true, authentic relationships built on trust and service. One of the most effective ways to foster these relationships is by approaching each interaction with a mindset of ""How can I serve?"" rather than ""What can I gain?"" Being present, offering support, and listening deeply are all essential to creating meaningful connections. It's also important to maintain integrity in everything you do, whether that's in how you run your business or how you show up in partnerships. Authenticity builds trust, and trust builds lasting relationships. Lastly, don't be afraid to collaborate. Some of the most powerful partnerships I've seen come from wellness practitioners working together to amplify their reach and impact. The key is to focus on how you can create value for others, and in turn, the right opportunities and connections will flow to you.

Preston: As the wellness industry continues to grow, what trends or shifts do you foresee in the coming years, and how can wellness entrepreneurs prepare for these changes?

Cordero: The wellness industry is expanding at an incredible pace, and we're seeing wellness become more integrated into everyday life. However, mental health remains a significant challenge, both in America and globally. A recent report from Mental Health America showed that nearly 60 million adults in the U.S. experienced a mental illness in 2021-2022, with more than 12.8 million reporting serious thoughts of suicide -- the highest number ever recorded. Youth are particularly affected, with 13% of young people aged 12-17 experiencing serious thoughts of suicide.

As wellness becomes more ingrained in the public consciousness, we're also seeing a rise in accessibility and the democratization of wellness tools. Therapy, meditation, nature walks, and practices like breathwork are becoming more widely accepted. I see technology, especially AI, playing a significant role in making wellness more accessible. Wellness entrepreneurs will need to prepare for a future where digital services, apps, and AI tools play a larger role in connecting with clients.

That said, human connection remains irreplaceable. As technology grows, wellness entrepreneurs will need to find the balance between innovation and staying grounded in authentic, human relationships. Wellness practices will continue to focus on community, connection, and shared wisdom to provide holistic solutions for well-being.

Preston: What's next for you? Are there any new projects or initiatives on the horizon that you're excited to share?

Cordero: I'm really excited about the launch of Healer Space Membership, a community platform I've co-created with a partner to support wellness entrepreneurs. This membership will provide tools, mentorship, connections, and opportunities to promote wellness practitioners who are dedicated to growing their businesses with purpose. We'll be offering curated resources, weekly calls, and access to an engaged network of professionals in the wellness space. I'm also continuing to expand The Healer's Playbook through workshops and partnerships with organizations that work with or employ wellness practitioners. I am known, as the ""Wellness Connector,"" my mission is to connect the best and most talented individuals with brands and opportunities, helping more people access the tools they need to heal and thrive. I'm excited for what lies ahead and to continue serving this incredible community."
How To Be Resilient Like Successful Founders (Lessons From The Top),Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jodiecook/2024/10/03/how-to-be-resilient-like-successful-founders-lessons-from-the-top/,2024-10-03T12:04:46Z,"Sometimes everything is terrible. Other times you wake up excited before you've even gone to sleep. The entrepreneurial rollercoaster is a very real thing. But it's resilience that sets apart thriving entrepreneurs from those who fold under pressure. In business, where problems pop up as often as wins, all you have to do is stay in the game.

Lucky for you, resilience isn't something you're born with. It's a skill you can learn and improve. Here's how top entrepreneurs build their ability to handle anything their working week throws at them.

Failure is part of success, not its enemy. Entrepreneurs don't see failures as dead ends. They see them as detours on the way to winning. The best do, anyway. Sara Blakely, billionaire founder of Spanx, spent years selling fax machines door-to-door, facing rejection daily before her breakthrough. Hamdi Ulukaya started Chobani yoghurt after buying a rundown factory, despite having no experience in large-scale yoghurt production.

To think this way, change how you talk. Don't say ""I failed."" Say ""I learned."" Write down your setbacks and what they taught you. This isn't just to feel better. It's to get value from everything that happens, good or bad.

Playing the victim kills resilience. The best entrepreneurs don't blame the economy, their team, or bad luck when things go wrong. They take charge of everything. Jennifer Hyman, co-founder of Rent the Runway, faced numerous challenges including sceptical investors and logistical nightmares, but always focused on solutions rather than excuses.

Stop saying helpless phrases like ""I had no choice"" or ""It's not my fault."" When you face a problem, ask yourself, ""What did I do to cause this, and how can I fix it?"" Switch from reacting to acting to build better resilience.

The toughest entrepreneurs know they need other people. They surround themselves with mentors, peers, and cheerleaders who offer advice and sometimes just listen. Sarah Kauss, founder of S'well, credits much of her success to building a strong network of advisors and fellow entrepreneurs who provided guidance and support.

Set yourself up for success from the very start. Join groups for business owners, go to industry events, or find a mentor. Make real connections with people who can help you hire, fire, and enjoy your winnings.

Don't avoid discomfort, push the edges of your comfort zone. Successful entrepreneurs put themselves in stressful situations on purpose to build their tolerance. Leah Busque, introvert founder of TaskRabbit, consistently pushed herself when scaling her company. ""I remember having this conversation with myself one day and I just said, you know what? This is not rocket science. You're gonna figure it out,"" she said.

Set some big goals but start small. Call five new potential customers a day or learn a new skill quickly. Then make it harder over time. The aim is to build your stress muscle so you're ready when big challenges come.

Building resilience like top entrepreneurs means preparing yourself to grow through challenges. See failure as a lesson, own everything, build a support team, and get used to stress. Set yourself up to thrive when problems hit, and breeze through every challenge like you've seen it before.

Setbacks make comebacks. Breakdowns make breakthroughs. Make resilience your superpower."
Trump Immigration Plan May End Deportation Safeguards For 2.7 Million,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2024/10/03/trump-immigration-plan-may-end-deportation-safeguards-for-27-million/,2024-10-03T12:04:45Z,"Up to 2.7 million people will lose protection from deportation in a second Trump administration if Donald Trump ends current immigration safeguards. New data show individuals in Temporary Protected Status and other immigration programs could see their legal protection expire in the next two years. Trump officials could add millions of people to potential deportation rolls by allowing immigration safeguards, such as TPS, to end. Immigration enforcement personnel in a second Trump administration could find targeting long-time residents and workers an advantageous way to boost deportation numbers.

""Protection from deportation may expire for up to 2.7 million people within the next two years,"" according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis. ""The vast majority face dismal prospects if forced to return to their birth countries, and obstacles in Congress mean legislation may not rescue even the most sympathetic groups.""

NFAP gathered the data from the Department of Homeland Security and other sources. The immigration programs and categories include Temporary Protected Status, humanitarian parole programs for Cubans, Venezuelans and others and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. Some individuals paroled into the United States, such as Ukrainians, could also hold TPS. The 2.7 million does not include individuals on Deferred Enforced Departure from Liberia, Hong Kong and elsewhere, participants in smaller parole programs or people who received parole at ports of entry.

Donald Trump stated he intends to implement mass deportations of immigrants without legal status that include ""sprawling camps."" Some have argued the plans will be difficult to implement. However, the existence and likely known whereabouts of millions of people who would lose protection from deportation during a second Trump administration adds credibility to the threat. Many of the up to 2.7 million people have lived in the United States for one to two decades or longer.

Economists have warned that reducing the supply of available workers through deportations or new immigration restrictions will harm U.S. workers and the economy. According to an analysis for the Peterson Institute for International Economics by George Mason University economics professor Michael Clemens, it is likely that for every one million unauthorized immigrant workers removed from the United States, 88,000 U.S.-born workers will be ""driven out of employment."" Deporting three million unauthorized immigrant workers per year ""would mean 263,000 fewer jobs held by U.S. native workers, compounded each additional year that mass deportations continue.""

Entrepreneurs will invest in fewer new businesses when ""hit by sudden reductions to labor supply,"" writes Clemens, and business owners will ""invest their capital in other industries and in technologies that use lower-skill labor less intensively, reducing demand for U.S. workers too."" Fewer immigrant workers will also shrink the demand for U.S.-born workers due to less consumer spending on ""grocery stores, leasing offices and other nontraded services."" According to the American Immigration Council, ""Due to the loss of workers across U.S. industries, we found that mass deportation would reduce the U.S. gross domestic product by 4.2% to 6.8%.""

Today, 863,880 people live in the United States under Temporary Protected Status, notes the Congressional Research Service. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, ""During a designated period, individuals who are TPS beneficiaries . . . are not removable from the United States; can obtain an employment authorization document; [and] may be granted travel authorization.""

TPS will expire in 2025 for 13 of the 16 countries, while the TPS designations for Haiti, Somalia and Yemen will end in 2026 unless extended. ""The Trump administration is likely to terminate most if not all new TPS designations in addition to not renewing prior designations,"" according to Elizabeth Carlson and Charles Wheeler, attorneys with CLINIC. Courts blocked attempts by Trump officials to eliminate TPS for at least 300,000 beneficiaries. However, the Ninth Circuit later vacated a lower court injunction, and legal avenues for helping people whose TPS designation has expired might prove fruitless in a second Trump administration.

Donald Trump has denounced Haitians as pet eaters and Venezuelans among migrants ""attacking villages and cities all throughout the Midwest,"" so expect the 200,005 Haitians and 344,355 Venezuelans currently living in America with TPS to be high priorities for deportation. In an interview with NewsNation (October 2, 2024), Trump said he would ""absolutely"" revoke TPS for Haitians and ""bring them back"" to Haiti. ""The Venezuelan government is unlikely to accept the return of its nationals, which would put the Trump administration in an unusual position if it ended the legal status of over 300,000 people but could not remove them from the United States,"" notes the NFAP analysis. More than 180,000 Salvadorans have lived in America with TPS since February 2001.

Trump has promised to end the humanitarian parole programs for several countries. According to data NFAP obtained from DHS, 528,000 individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela arrived in America after the Biden administration approved them for the CHNV humanitarian parole program. As of August 31, 2024, there are 110,000 approvals for humanitarian parole for Cubans, 210,000 for Haitians, 92,000 for Nicaraguans and 116,000 for Venezuelans. The numbers represent differing migration patterns.

DHS has received more applications than the 30,000-monthly allotment, resulting in a selection process, which may have limited the program's effectiveness in reducing illegal immigration. Still, even with these restrictions, after the humanitarian parole programs began, Border Patrol encounters declined by 92% for Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans as a group between December 2022 (the month before the parole programs started) and November 2023 compared to an 18% increase for nationals of non-parole countries, according to an NFAP analysis. Illegal entry also declined for Venezuelans, although that was shorter-lived, likely due to the greater demand and other factors affecting Venezuelans.

Eliminating the humanitarian parole program will likely increase illegal entry, in part because of the expected response from Mexico. The Mexican government agreed to accept 30,000 migrants a month from the four countries if expelled after unlawfully entering America. ""Normally, these migrants would be returned to their country of origin, but the U.S. cannot easily send back people from those four countries for a variety of reasons that include relations with the governments there,"" noted PBS.

After the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Biden officials granted humanitarian parole to Ukrainians under a new program called Uniting for Ukraine. The United States also paroled Afghans following the fall of Kabul.

According to DHS, 651,000 Ukrainians have been approved for humanitarian parole in the United States: 221,000 from Uniting for Ukraine and an additional 430,000 other Ukrainians. Under Operation Allies Welcome, 77,000 Afghans came to America and were approved for humanitarian parole, along with approvals for an additional 56,000 Afghans. If a future administration does not allow them to remain paroled in the United States, the 651,000 Ukrainians and 133,000 Afghans could be subject to deportation unless they can live legally in the United States through other means, such as TPS or asylum.

The Biden administration provided a ""re-parole"" process for Ukrainians in February 2024 and Afghans in June 2023. If Kamala Harris wins in November, her immigration team could use a similar process for individuals in the CHNV program.

Voters have heard little lately about Dreamers, young people without legal status brought to America by their parents. According to DHS, there are 535,030 DACA recipients in the United States as of June 30, 2024. DACA recipients could be deported should the U.S. Supreme Court rule against them. The Biden administration has sought alternative ways for Dreamers to remain in the United States, such as qualifying for H-1B status. A Supreme Court ruling stopped Trump officials from removing current DACA recipients from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

During the vice-presidential debate on October 1, 2024, GOP candidate JD Vance said a second Trump administration would prioritize criminal aliens when attempting to deport millions of people living in the United States without legal status. Analysts point out that is unlikely to be the case and belies how bureaucracies work: Once numerical targets are set, immigration agents will go after the easiest people to find and deport.

Shaul Schwarz, a filmmaker on the six-part Netflix documentary Immigration Nation, had unprecedented access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during the Trump administration. ""I think we repeatedly saw a desire to get numbers,"" he said in an interview in 2020. ""I think anybody who works in ICE knows it, because it was kind of everywhere we went. . . . We definitely saw a lot of agents wanting to hit numbers.""

In other administrations, under normal practice, ICE agents focus on criminal aliens due to limited resources. Yet once an administration decides all undocumented immigrants should be deported, the priority on criminals will fade. ""We thought a number of times during this administration that the priorities had shifted to be that it's no longer just detaining egregious criminals, but there was a wider mandate to say that anybody here illegally could potentially be a target,"" said Schwarz.

Economists note that deporting individuals who have lived in America and worked for years will harm U.S. workers and the American economy. It would also upend the lives of millions of people who sought and were granted protection in the United States."
Will Rate Cuts And AI Benefit Applied Materials Stock?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/03/will-rate-cuts-and-ai-benefit-applied-materials-stock/,2024-10-03T12:04:07Z,"Applied Materials stock gained almost 10% over the past month and remains up by about 30% year-to-date. In comparison, Applied's semiconductor industry peer Texas Instruments stock has gained about 22% this year. Here's a closer look at some trends driving Applied Materials' recent gains.

Rate Cuts Can Drive Capex Spending By Chip Companies

The Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, marking the first rate cut in close to four years. With the current benchmark federal funds rate standing at 4.75% to 5% post the cut, there also remains room for the central bank to lower interest rates further. Also, check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed's next move? As a major supplier of highly specialized semiconductor fabrication equipment, Applied Materials is dependent on the capital spending cycle of major chipmakers such as TSMC and Samsung. Now lower interest rates effectively reduce borrowing costs for manufacturers and make larger projects more viable. This in turn could drive up demand for the high-end equipment that Applied - the largest U.S.-based semiconductor equipment maker - supplies. Moreover, lower rates are also generally beneficial to growth sectors such as technology, which have higher earning potential in outer years. Looking for more companies that can benefit from increased digitization and AI deployment? See our analysis of Internet Infrastructure Stocks.

AI Demand, Stronger Logic Chip Market

Beyond interest rate cuts, the semiconductor industry at large is also stabilizing. Applied Materials faced challenges last year due to reduced capital spending post-Covid-19, but conditions have improved. In Q3 2024, the company reported a 5% year-over-year revenue increase to $6.8 billion and earnings of $2.12 per share, surpassing expectations. For Q4 FY'24, Applied is guiding revenue of about $6.93 billion, plus or minus $400 million, while adjusted diluted earnings are projected to be between $2.00 and $2.36 per share. This could represent up to 8.5% growth at the upper end of the guidance range. The semiconductor downcycle has bottomed out, with logic chip demand recovering alongside the PC market and growing GPU demand from data centers. Meanwhile, the memory market is shifting toward advanced high-bandwidth memory, driven by the AI sector's robust demand. AI workloads require significant computational power, higher memory capacity, and complex chips that rely on advanced manufacturing processes. Applied Materials is well-positioned in these areas, offering tools and services in materials engineering, process control, and integration. Now Nvidia has been the hottest of the AI stocks. But did you know there is a lesser-known AI name that could offer more upside than Nvidia?

What Lies Ahead For Applied

The increase in AMAT stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 84% in 2021, -38% in 2022, and 68% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could AMAT face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

Applied Materials stock currently trades at about $201 per share. Applied stands to benefit from potentially higher orders and a rising mix of higher-end equipment driven by applications such as AI and the shift to more advanced process technologies. This is also driving the company's margins higher. Gross margins were up 100 basis points year-over-year to 47.3% in Q3. We value Applied Materials stock at $222 per share, about 10% ahead of the current market price. See our analysis of Applied Materials Valuation for a closer look at what is driving our price estimate for the stock.

Community College Trustees Can Bolster Ties To Emerging Tech Hubs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/shalinjyotishi/2024/10/03/community-college-trustees-and-ties-with-tech-hubs/,2024-10-03T10:17:01Z,"A variation of this article originally ran for the Association of Community College Trustee's Fall 2024 issue of Trustee Quarterly Magazine.

Industrial policy is back in the United States, and the community college sector is needed more than ever before. There has never been a more important time for community college trustees to understand and support their institutions' contributions to science- and technology-based economic development, emerging technology sectors, and regional innovation ecosystems.

Scientific and technological innovation spurred by federal and private investments in R&D and economic development is catalyzing job creation, augmentation, and elimination nationwide. Community colleges will be critical to reskilling and upskilling incumbent workers, expanding pathways for young people beginning their careers, and meeting employers' labor market needs in a way that also diversifies the workforce and the jobs that will comprise the future of work.

Community colleges have always been pivotal in providing accessible, affordable, and workforce-oriented career preparation in healthcare, skilled trades, manufacturing, and transportation industries. However, all across the country, community colleges are also evolving to meet the workforce needs of the future of work - jobs and industries catalyzed and shaped by emerging technologies.

Today, community colleges have expanded customized training, certificates, associate's degrees, apprenticeships, and even applied baccalaureates (available in 24 states) tailored to opening doors to jobs in industries incubated and shaped by artificial intelligence, biotechnology, green energy, and quantum technology -- and, as a result, creating inclusive pathways to careers that define the skilled technical workforce for the jobs of today and tomorrow.

Their role in the innovation economy will only grow due to a massive influx of federal investments from the bipartisan CHIPS & Science Act, alongside the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. These bills have catalyzed new funding opportunities and the need for community college partnerships, job training, and sector strategy around emerging technology fields.

Notably, CHIPS created the first new arm at the U.S. National Science Foundation in over thirty years-the Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships Directorate. Under the new division, NSF has significantly expanded funding for community colleges in emerging technology fields, building on the successes of NSF's Advanced Technological Education program, which has been in operation since 1994.

CHIPS also created new opportunities for community colleges at the U.S. Economic Development Administration, such as through the Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs or ""Tech Hubs"" program.

More than fifty community colleges are partners across the thirty-one Tech Hub designees which will receive more than half a billion dollars in funding to create jobs and companies around technologies of the future, like quantum, semiconductors and personalized medicine.

The more trustees understand these science and tech-focused industrial policy investments and how their states and economies can leverage the funds, the better positioned they will be to help realize the promise of the innovation economy for students.

New America's Future of Work and Innovation Economy is dedicated to the study and support of community colleges in technology-based economic development and for job training in evolving and advanced technology sectors.

This spring, I provided an overview of these new programs in a recent podcast episode for the Association of Community College Trustees. This story, which builds on article that appeared in the association's magazine, further explores how trustees could connect their institutions to emerging industries.

Why trustees are critical for the community college in the innovation economy

While presidents, deans, workforce leaders, and faculty all have critical roles in unlocking equitable pathways to good jobs resulting from R&D investments, trustees have an especially important role to play.

First, as stewards of an institution, trustees can partner with a president and leadership to take a ""forest view"" of the college's offerings and their alignment with the region's economic development goals and, trustees might be elected, political appointees, or otherwise have political, business, and community ties that could help reinforce their colleges' tether to the needs of their local economy.

Second, trustees offer colleges stability in a time of turbulence. Presidential turnover and retention are becoming a growing problem for all higher education institutions, including community colleges. According to an analysis by the American Council on Education in 2023, presidential turnover has reached its highest level since the association began tracking such data in 2006.

Generational transitions will also impact college leadership. According to a recent survey from the American Association of Community Colleges, more than half of sitting community college leaders indicate they plan to transition out of their position within the next five years, and one-third expect to retire in that timeframe.

Faculty and staff, too, are in a period of transition. A 2022 survey from the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources found that more than half of surveyed higher education workers plan to leave their roles. An EAB analysis has found that community colleges have faced a 13% staff decline from 2020-2022.

That leaves trustees among the last lines of defense to help a college take a long-term perspective. That viewpoint is especially valuable when considering technology-based economic development predicated on investments in emerging technology sectors and the innovation economy. Silicon Valley wasn't built in a day, and neither will new innovation hubs catalyzed by federal investments, the AI revolution, or other future technology-driven paradigm shifts.

Trustees have a critical role to play in understanding, supporting, and advocating for their institution's role in job training relating to emerging technologies and to excel as partners in ""regional innovation ecosystems"" and technology-based economic development to grow and retain high-paying jobs.

What trustees and colleges can do: Three case studies

We interviewed trustees of three community colleges on the leading edge as workforce partners for the innovation economy - MiraCosta College in California, Miami Dade College in Florida, and Harper College in Illinois. Our conversations focused on the college's work and what trustees could do to support their college's role in regional innovation ecosystems.

First, I spoke with Frank Merchant, a MiraCosta trustee since 2015, to learn about a capacity-building effort MiraCosta undertook to better prepare the college for the future of work.

Situated in the southern California biotechnology hub, MiraCosta College is a recognized leader in education for the future of work. For example, in 2022, MiraCosta launched the nation's first community college baccalaureate in biomanufacturing to meet the workforce needs of Fortune 500 biotechnology giants like Pfizer, Abbott Laboratories, and Thermo Fisher Scientific. But MiraCosta's foresight has less to do with chance and more with strategy. MiraCosta was one of the first grantees of NSF's CHIPS-enabled new Experiential Learning for Emerging and Novel Technologies (ExLENT) program, which it is using to scale internships and apprenticeships in the biomanufacturing and microelectronics sector. But MiraCosta's success has less to do with chance and more to do with strategy.

In 2019, MiraCosta College partnered with the Institute for the Future, a Palo Alto-based non-profit, to undertake an institution-wide training in ""futurist thinking"" methods. The president, members of its Board of Trustees, top administrators, students, faculty, and staff took part in a series of trainings on ""futurist thinking"" methods, meant to help them foresee long-term trends and assess the possible implications for the institution, students, and neighboring communities. The college used institutional immersion to take an entirely new long-view approach to its strategic planning and operating process.

Not everyone at the institution was bought into the trendy-sounding training. ""You have to convince people that the futures process thinking is not the flavor of the day but your savior. It was key that I and other trustees go through this entire training process to let everyone in the institution know that this is important,"" Merchant told me.

Merchant recommended trustees explore similar training approaches that help institutionalize a proactive approach to the innovation economy - emphasizing the value of data to drive decision-making. ""Proactive expansion of offerings across these emerging technology areas is something that board members can support.""

Next, I spoke with Roberto Alonso, a trustee of Miami Dade College. Miami Dade is one of the nation's leading community colleges in AI education, becoming one of the only institutions to offer credit and non-credit certificates, associate's degrees, and bachelor's degrees in applied AI. In 2021, the college named Antonio Delgado its first Vice President of Innovation and Technology Partnerships, who has gone on to serve as the first 2-year representative on NSF's Computer and Information Sciences Directorate Advisory Committee.

In 2024, Miami Dade was recently awarded a $2.8 million grant from the NSF to partner with Houston Community College and Maricopa Community College District to launch a consortium dedicated to scaling and improving AI education at 2-year institutions.

Trustee Alonso emphasized the importance of trustees in ensuring that their institutions not only meet employer demands but also prioritize ethics across emerging technology training. ""We are democracy's colleges. We are an institution that gives access to all students. If we don't give students the knowledge they need to use AI in a positive way, we won't be tackling the biggest need,"" Alonso told me. Alonso encouraged trustees to consider how their institution can foster technologists in the public interest. Miami Dade is a member of New America's Public Interest Technology Network, which cultivates tech professionals who are ethics-savvy.

Trustee Alonso, who also serves as a Miami-Dade County School Board member, encouraged fellow trustees to tether their institutions' work in regional innovation ecosystems to their local communities through their own relationships. While 70% of Miami Dade's booming AI enrollment is above 26 and 30% above 41, Miami Dade offers an AI summer camp for high school students to immerse in the college's applied AI curriculum at no cost. Additionally, Mr. Delgado, himself as the college's tech workforce leader, serves as a senior advisor for tech talent development to the Mayor of the City of Miami to foster town-gown relationships.

Lastly, I spoke with William ""Bill"" Kelley, Board Chair of William Rainey Harper College, located outside Chicago, Illinois. Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker has envisioned Illinois as a ""global quantum capital"" and recently Nestled in the heart of a booming quantum science and technology hub, buoyed by a recent half-a-billion dollar investment in quantum technology. Harper is well-aligned with the tech-enabled future of its region's economic development strategy.

In fall 2022, Harper launched the Innovation Accelerator, a new collaborative unit designed to focus specifically on emerging technology workforce training. Writing for the American Association of Community Colleges, Harper President Avis Proctor described how the accelerator is developing accelerated career pathways in cybersecurity, quantum computing, and cloud-computing.

""Under Dr. Proctor's leadership, we set aside $900,000 from our HEERF [Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund] funding to creat the Innovation Accelerator,"" Kelley told me. ""We complemented that funding from the U.S. Department of Energy, NSF, and other agencies.""

Harper was one of the first grantees of NSF's new CHIPS-enabled Enabling Partnerships to Increase Innovation Capacity (EPIIC) grant funding program which it is using to work with a consortia of 2-year and 4-year institutions to improve employer partnerships in quantum fields. Trustee Kelley recommends trustees look at how the entire institution can support its tech goals. Harper engaged its philosophy program to support its ethics course in AI. ""We had to reach out to different departments for how to work better together as well as the college's foundation,"" Kelley told me.

Policy to Empower Community Colleges

Trustees Kelley, Alonso, and Merchant aren't alone as college leaders supporting their institution's evolution to address the future of work, but they are among the early adopters. All three trustees emphasized the need for federal and state governments to better recognize the need and value of community colleges in the innovation economy. Policy innovations such as allowing community college baccalaureates, funding apprenticeship and quality short-term training, and funding upstart costs all came up as needs.

Federally, Congress has only appropriated a portion of the funding of the CHIPS & Science Act authorizations. In July 2024, four community college presidents, including the presidents of MiraCosta and Harper College, joined New America to publicly call on Congress to fully appropriate funding for NSF. NSF encountered a budget cut in March, hamstringing its support of community colleges. ""Getting the other half of the loaf would be huge for the next wave,"" Kelley quipped.

As the U.S. government advances the vision of CHIPS and a bipartisan approach to industrial policy, community colleges will be critical to a successful and equitable innovation economy."
California Study Shows Which College Programs Pay Off And Which Don't,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2024/10/03/california-study-shows-which-college-programs-pay-off-and-which-dont/,2024-10-03T10:09:51Z,"A new report from the College Futures Foundation and the HEA Group identifies the return on investment that undergraduate students can expect to see from thousands of college programs in California.

The good news is that almost 9 out of 10 academic programs in California allow graduates to recoup their educational costs within five years. The bad news is that more than 100 programs yielded no economic ROI, leaving a majority of their graduates earning less than a high school graduate five years after finishing the program.

The results are contained in California College Programs That Pay: Measuring Return on Investment Across Majors and Credentials, by Michael Itzkowitz, President of the HEA Group. They are based on an analysis of outcomes for 260,000 graduates from 2,695 undergraduate certificate, associate's and bachelor's degree programs offered at 324 institutions in California.

Using data from the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard, the researchers calculated a Price-to-Earnings Premium (PEP) to assess how long it takes program graduates to recoup their educational costs after earning their credential.

Each college program's PEP is based on two factors: 1) out-of-pocket -- or net -- costs that students pay to complete a credential and 2) the earnings premium that they gain by completing a certain field of study.

To determine how much each credential costs, the researchers assumed that students pay one year of net costs to earn a certificate, two years to earn an associate's degree, and four years to earn a bachelor's degree. Of course, this is a conservative estimate because many students take longer and pay more out-of-pocket costs to complete their academic program.

They then used the annual out-of-pocket expenses after all grants and scholarships are deducted to calculate the total cost of earning a credential. Because cost data were not available for individual programs, they applied an institution's net cost to each of its programs regardless of the specific field of study.

The earnings premium each college program produces for its graduates is defined as the additional income a college graduate makes five years after completing the program compared to the typical high school graduate in California with no college experience (pegged at $26,073 per year). Programs that allow graduates to earn more than this amount yield a premium that can then be used to pay down the out-of-pocket costs required to earn the credential.

The new report is a sequel to the foundation's initial report published last spring that focused on institutions' ROI for low- and moderate-income learners. This report examines the economic ROIs across specific majors and credentials offered throughout the state and included all students who received a loan or grant from the federal government.

Among the highlights of the report:

The report also indicated that a student's college major sometimes matters more for economic ROI than the institution itself. ""We found outcomes for 'time to recoup' that differ across different programs at four-year institutions, two-year institutions, and certificate-granting institutions,"" Itzkowitz said. ""Some offer ROI in a short timeframe, and some offer little to no ROI whatsoever.""

Of the five most popular bachelor's level programs of study -- business administration, psychology, sociology, communication and media studies, and registered nursing -- most enabled graduates to recoup their educational costs between one and five years after completing their degrees.

In fact, none of these bachelor's degree programs -- at any institution across California -- showed their graduates taking longer than 10 years to recoup their costs of earning a degree. However, only registered nursing allowed the majority of its graduates (69%) to earn back their educational costs in less than one year

The most popular associate-level programs of study were: 1) liberal arts and sciences, 2) registered nursing, 3) allied health diagnostic, intervention, and treatment professions, 4) business administration, and 5) allied health and medical assisting services.

Many of these associate's degree programs enable their graduates to recoup their educational costs in less than one year's time. For example, 98% of nursing program graduates hit that threshold; so do 84% of those graduating from business administration programs. The most popular associate's degree program -- l iberal arts and sciences -- shows 95% of its graduates earning back the costs of their degree within five years, and 62% are able to do so in one year.

""Postsecondary attainment must continue to be tied to economic mobility, as it is essential to creating a higher education system that drives a robust, inclusive economy in California,"" said Eloy Ortiz Oakley, College Futures Foundation President and CEO, in a news release. ""Central to this research is showing which institutions and programs make that connection.""

According to Itzkowitz and Oakley, the report should not be considered a ""denouncement of any specific program or desired area of study, but rather an opportunity for further research to understand why and how these institutions produce these outcomes and where there may be policy and practice implications.""

""Learners deserve access to information so they can enter a program with eyes wide open about what they can expect, and institutions need to be transparent with their data and honest about how their programs deliver on the promise of economic mobility,"" Oakley said."
ESOPs And The Growing Movement Toward Purposeful Business,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryjosephs/2024/10/03/esops-and-the-growing-movement-toward-purposeful-business/,2024-10-03T09:20:48Z,"For more than three decades, I have witnessed firsthand how employee ownership can build business owner liquidity and enable succession planning while creating worker wealth. Over time, it has become increasingly clear to me that the transformative power of employee stock ownership plans, or ESOPs, lies in more than just their financial structure. Rather, they're a prime example of how businesses can align purpose, profit, and people in ways that benefit all stakeholders.

Recently, we've seen a groundswell of interest in more conscious and purpose-driven approaches to business. From B-Corps, purpose trusts, and 'conscious capitalism,' to the Tugboat Institute and the Expanding ESOPs Coalition, recognition mounts that the traditional stockholder-only model of capitalism is insufficient for the challenges we face in the 21st century.

These movements share a commitment to a more holistic view of business that recognizes the interdependence of financial success, employee well-being, community impact, and environmental stewardship. It's a multi-stakeholder view that aligns closely with the principles championed in the ESOP community.

Here's a closer look at the key players in this space that embrace the notion that profitability and purpose are mutually reinforcing:

· B-Corps: These for-profit companies are certified to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. They're legally required to consider the impact of their decisions on their workers, customers, suppliers, community, and the environment. B Corps run the gamut from retailer Body Shop and shoemakers Toms and Allbirds to opticians Warby Parker and the Taos ski area in New Mexico. KeHE foods recently became one of the largest ESOP owned B-Corps.

· Purpose Trusts: This innovative legal structure enables a company to be held in trust for the benefit of its stated purpose, rather than for shareholders' financial benefit. It provides a way for mission-driven companies to preserve their values and purpose over the long term. Yvon Chouinard, founder of outdoor apparel company Patagonia, transferred his voting stock to a purpose trust in September 2022.

· Conscious Capitalism: This movement embraces the notion of a business having a conscious culture that values being both ethical and profitable, benefiting society in the process. Its founders were John Mackey, co-founder of Whole Foods Market, and marketing professor and author Raj Sisodia. Take note of their October 24 CEO Summit where over 250 leaders will share ideas on business for good.

· Tugboat Institute: The 11-year-old membership organization supports purpose-driven, privately held businesses committed to the principles of ""Evergreen"" that prioritize long-term value creation over short-term profits.

· The Expanding ESOPs Coalition: This just-formed group, which I'm proud to be part of, advocates for policies that make employee ownership more accessible and educate business owners about its benefits.

ESOPs were ahead of their time in embodying principles of worker involvement and wealth-creating that align with key tenets of purpose-driven business. That's because ESOPs inherently create value for multiple stakeholders, creating opportunities for employees to benefit through ownership stakes and enhanced retirement savings.

A 2023 study from the National Center for Employee Ownership found that ESOP companies often see voluntary quit rates of their employees at roughly one-third the national average, increased productivity and profitability. Moreover, their communities benefit from the presence of stable, locally-rooted businesses committed to local prosperity.

ESOP companies also tend to take a longer-term view, investing in their people and operations rather than chasing quarterly profits. This aligns closely with the Tugboat Institute's ""Evergreen"" principles. Further, by distributing ownership broadly among employees, ESOPs create a more equitable distribution of wealth that addresses a key criticism of traditional capitalism, namely, that it concentrates wealth in too few hands.

Data show that when employees have a stake in the company's success, they tend to be more engaged and innovative. This creates a virtuous cycle of improved performance and increased value creation. ESOPs are less likely to be sold or relocated, providing stability to local communities, which embodies the stakeholder-centric approach of B-Corps and purpose trusts. And ESOPs' shared ownership model naturally fosters a culture of collaboration and shared purpose that mirror key elements of the conscious capitalism movement.

As these movements gain momentum, a new economic paradigm appears to be emerging. It recognizes the interconnectedness of all stakeholders and seeks to create value in ways that are not exclusively for stockholders. While their numbers are still relatively small, at 6,500-plus, ESOPs have decades of experience in operationalizing many of the principles the newer purpose-driven models aspire to. At the same time, ESOPs can learn from and be inspired by the innovations happening in the B-Corp world, the legal creativity of purpose trusts, the focus on conscious leadership, and the long-term orientation of Evergreen companies.

By building coalitions and sharing best practices across these various models, I believe the shift toward a more conscious, purposeful approach to business will accelerate. This isn't just about feel-good rhetoric - it's about creating more resilient, innovative, and successful companies that thrive in an increasingly complex and challenging business environment.

As we look to the future, I've become more convinced that this coalition of purpose-driven business models - with ESOPs as a pivotal example - represents the best path forward for creating sustainable, equitable prosperity in the 21st century. By working together, sharing our experiences, and advocating for supportive policies, we can build an economy that truly works for everyone. I love the momentum, particularly as we launch into Employee Ownership Month."
Why The Dock Workers' Strike Should Be A Cautionary Tale For Every Manufacturer,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ethankarp/2024/10/02/why-the-dock-workers-strike-should-be-a-cautionary-tale-for-every-manufacturer/,2024-10-02T22:02:54Z,"Dock workers across the East and Gulf coast are on strike and the stakes are frighteningly high. The economy stands to lose an estimated $5 billion a day. A prolonged picket line will wreak havoc on the supply chain. We've seen this movie in varying degrees already, after the Baltimore bridge collapse and, of course, the pandemic. We know all too well the paralyzing effect it will have on manufacturing -- preventing raw materials from getting to factories and products from getting to customers.

Dock workers, by and large, want more money. But, make no mistake, this is also a battle against technology. Look at the picket signs. Many workers believe they're going to be replaced by automation and AI. This is the first technology backlash to take to the streets at scale -- but it won't be the last. And if manufacturing isn't careful, it could be next. Here are four things our industry must do to avoid a tech revolt.

Focus On People First, Machines Second

At the end of the day, manufacturing runs on people, not machines. We can't afford to alienate our most precious resource. We also can't let automation or AI become the enemy. The truth is, American manufacturers simply can't compete with China without Industry 4.0 technologies. Just like at the docks, automation is inevitable. But for it to succeed, employees must be with us on the journey.

Manufacturers need to be crystal-clear about how they plan to invest in technology and what it means to their people. This requires transparent discussions (with workers and unions alike) and plenty of advance notice if it appears jobs could be automated. Change is hard and if you force buy-in -- as in, ""you need to buy the idea I'm selling"" -- you are setting yourself up to fail. If you engage stakeholders in your technology plan and ask them to co-create it for the good of the organization, you stand a much greater chance of finding a way forward that creates opportunity, not chaos.

Bridge The Human-Tech Gap

Fear of obsolescence is at the heart of the dock workers' strike, as automation threatens traditional roles. But technology transformation is not always a zero-sum game. It's not as simple as ""add one robot, take away one human."" It can be ""plus/and."" In fact, technology is already creating many more high-tech roles in manufacturing such as programming, running, and servicing collaborative robots on the production line. In factories, automation and robotics are most often used to take over dark, dirty, dangerous, and repetitive work -- freeing up humans to be retrained and upskilled for better, higher paying jobs.

Plus, in manufacturing, we have one major thing going for us that the ports do not. We've been short workers for decades. So, in most cases where automation has arrived, people have not been replaced. Manufacturing workers need to hear these stories and understand the new opportunities that are coming and how to get ready for them. This will reduce fear and set manufacturing up for a blended human-machine future that benefits everyone.

Cultivate A Change-Ready Culture

Factories aren't just automating. They're becoming total digital ecosystems. It's warp speed -- what took decades is now happening in months. It's not just technology and people who have to change. Our cultures do, too.

Manufacturing leaders should focus on fostering company cultures that are adaptable, resilient, and embrace change. This means not only promoting a vision of change but also supporting employees through that change. This could include technology and innovation programs, change management workshops, levelling up collaboration skills, and promoting a mindset of continuous growth and improvement. Since change is the only constant on the horizon, this will not only help companies navigate technology transformation, but also everything else that comes along, be it supply chain disruption, another pandemic, war, or anything else.

Lead For The Long Game

When anything becomes a battle, both sides lose. The dock workers' strike demonstrates the risks of drawing battle lines and forcing short-term agendas. Technology is changing fast, but it's actually better to start slow and steady: explain the vision, prove the case, engage employees in pilots, demonstrate small, quick wins. Then -- once the vision is understood, the support is strong, and the foundation is solid -- you can scale fast. Lead for the long game with a smart technology plan that balances productivity and workforce well-being, considers profits and people.

No one in manufacturing wants to go the way of the dock workers. Nor do we want to poison the well against the new technologies we desperately need to be globally competitive, keep the jobs we have, and create even more high-tech positions. This strike should be a cautionary tale for every manufacturer. This is what happens when automation is a surprise or a threat. Manufacturers can't afford to drive a stake between technology and the people who make their operations tick. But with transparent communications, a people-first strategy, and a balanced approach, automation can solve problems for manufacturing, not create them."
"Latino-Owned Business Revenues Grow, But Inflation Hurts Earnings",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rohitarora/2024/10/02/latino-owned-business-revenues-grow-but-inflation-hurts-earnings/,2024-10-02T21:47:00Z,"Revenues, credit scores and age-of-business of Latino-owned businesses all increased during the past 12 months, but expenses also rose, due to inflation.

Biz2Credit's annual Latino-Owned Business Study found that while revenues of Latino-owned companies increased (+11.6%), expenses rose more (+ 22.7%), resulting in lower earnings in 2023-24 than in 2022-23 (-$41.1K).

The analysis, released each year during Hispanic Heritage Month (Sept. 15 - Oct. 15) examined the performance of small to midsized companies in the U.S. from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024. It looked at financial indicators including annual revenue, operating expenses, age of business, and credit scores of both Latino-owned and non-Latino-owned companies.

Revenues for small businesses rose overall, largely because of inflation. Earnings were down overall, but the average drop for Latino-owned businesses was not as sharp as for non-Latino-owned businesses. Earnings performance of Latino-owned firms outperformed the others.

1. The average annual revenue of Latino-owned businesses increased by 11.6% from $601,636 in 2022-23 to $671,360 in 2023-24. Meanwhile, the average annual revenue for non-Latino Businesses increased by 11.5% from $667,204 in 2022-23 to $744,027 in 2023-24.

2. Average earnings (Annual Revenue - Operating Expenses) for Latino-owned businesses dropped from $113,268 in 2022-23 to $72,168 in 2023-24, a drop of $41,100. Meanwhile, non-Latino-owned businesses declined from $159,365 to $94,237, a drop of $65,128. Overall, earnings across all businesses decreased by 40% year over year.

3. Operating expenses for Latino-owned firms increased by 22.7% from $488,368 in 2022-23 to $599,192 in 2023-24, resulting in earnings decrease of 36.3% for Latino firms. Meanwhile, operating costs for non-Latino-owned companies increased 28% from $507,849 in 2022-23 to $649,790 in 2023-24, resulting in a 40.9% drop in earnings.

4. The average personal (FICO) credit score* for Latino owned business increased from 641 in 2022-23 to 647 in 2023-24. In comparison, the personal credit score for non-Latino-owned business increased from 648 to 659 during the same timeframe.

7. The percentage of financing applications submitted by Latino-owned businesses, relative to the total number of submitted applications, increased slightly from 14.8% in 2022-23 to 15% in 2023-24. In 2024, financing applications by Latino-owned businesses increased 14.13% (year-over-year) compared to 2023. That surpassed applications by non-Latino owned businesses, which grew 12.78% year-over-year.

8. The funding rate for Latino-owned businesses stands at 32%, slightly higher than the 31% rate for non-Latino-owned businesses. The average funded amounts were $62,371 for Latino-owned businesses and $76,503 for non-Latino-owned firms.

9. Construction accounted for the largest industry category of Latino-owned companies examined in the study, followed by Other Services (except Public Administration), Accommodation and Food Services, Retail Trade, and Transportation and Warehousing.

10. By state, nearly one-quarter (24%) of funding requests from Latino-owned firms came from Florida, followed closely by California (19.4%), and then Texas, New York, and New Jersey.

The numbers prove that inflationary pressures significantly hurt the earnings of all small businesses in the last year, and Latino-owned firms were not immune. Profits for Latino-owned firms seeking business financing were down 36% on average, as a result.

Many factors combined, including increased labor costs, rising fuel prices, and overall inflation. Rents continue to climb dramatically, especially for businesses located in cities. Meanwhile, insurance costs have skyrocketed. Rising costs of labor, rent, and insurance are unavoidable, and there unfortunately does not seem to be an end in teh near future. They are significantly hurting small businesses.

Further, high interest rates also pinched companies that borrowed money for working capital or expansion. The good news is that the growth rate of inflation has been easing a bit, and the Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates, thus bringing down the cost of capital.

Impact of Latino-owned businesses on the U.S. Economy

The U.S. is home to over 63 million Latinos, accounting for roughly 19% of the nation's population. Latinos contribute a staggering $3.2 trillion to the economy and own nearly 5 million businesses that collectively generate more than $800 billion annually, according to the Stanford Graduate School of Business Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative (SLEI).

Further, Latino entrepreneurs are starting businesses at more than twice the rate of the general U.S. population. This increase has led to a higher proportion of new businesses being owned by immigrants overall. In 2023, immigrants were responsible for 36% of new business launches, up from 25% in 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Latino immigrants significantly outpace other groups in business ownership, and they comprise 52% of all Latino-owned businesses. In contrast, only 7% of white-owned employer businesses are immigrant-owned, according to the SLEI. Further, Latino-owned businesses are set to revolutionize the U.S. economy, as Latinos are projected to make up 29% of the population by 2050 and contribute a staggering $1.4 trillion to the U.S. economy, according to JPMorgan Chase.

As the Latino population grows, it becomes more and more of an indicator of the health of the U.S. economy. Business owners are hopeful that with inflation starting to ease, their revenues may again be on the upswing."
43 Million People Watched Vice Presidential Debate On TV,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2024/10/02/39-million-people-watched-vice-presidential-debate-on-tv/,2024-10-02T20:54:39Z,"More than 43 million people tuned in to watch the likely only face-off between Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night -- marking a significant decline from people who tuned in to watch the last vice presidential debate in 2020 between Kamala Harris and Mike Pence.

Monday's debate between Vance and Walz was largely considered civil and policy-focused. The candidates touched on topics including the economy, the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot, health care, the southern border and abortion rights. Microphones were only cut once in a heated exchange after the moderators fact-checked Vance and he went on a tangent about the process for applying for an asylum appointment online following a discussion about migrants in Springfield, Ohio. An early poll from after the debate showed there was no clear winner: Forty-two percent of respondents to a CBS and YouGov poll said they felt Vance won and 41% felt Walz won, while 17% said it ended in a tie.

2.2. That's how many points Harris is leading Trump by as of Wednesday afternoon, according to RealClearPolitics' national polling average. FiveThirtyEight's national average has Harris leading Trump by 2.8 points.

Shortly after Walz and Vance's debate ended, Trump claimed on social media the Harris campaign ""just put out a request for another Debate"" and suggested the Democrats are seeking a rematch because Walz ""lost so badly tonight."" Trump reiterated in the post he does not plan to debate Harris a second time, adding: ""Votes are already cast - And I'm leading BIG in the Polls."" Harris' team suggested after she first debated Trump she would participate in a second debate, but did not publicly comment on Trump's claim Tuesday night."
Dubai Has A Plan To Double Tourism -- Here's Why It Might Succeed,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferleighparker/2024/10/02/dubai-has-a-plan-to-double-tourism---heres-why-it-might-succeed/,2024-10-02T18:29:58Z,"The desert city plans to become the world's most visited global hub. Issam Kazim, CEO of Dubai Tourism, shares the strategy.

A few short decades ago, Dubai was 'a dot in the desert.' Now a city of more than three million people, most of whom are expatriates, its growth trajectory is staggering. As is the spending.

Currently underway is the $35 billion renovation of the new passenger terminal at Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC), approved by Dubai's leadership in April. The futuristic structure, designed by Leslie Jones Architecture, will replace Dubai International Airport (DXB), already the world's second-busiest international hub, after Atlanta, Georgia's Hartsfield-Jackson airport. But the UAE is aiming higher. If it opens as planned within the next 10 years, DWC expects to become the largest (and most expensive) airport in the world.

Meanwhile, hoteliers are placing their bets, particularly in the luxury category. By the end of 2024, Dubai will welcome a new Delano Dubai (owned by Accor), a Jumeirah Marsa Al Arab, and a Six Senses The Palm, Dubai (IHG), while Ennismore's partner brands Rikas Group and Paris Society add five new beach clubs and restaurants to the region. By 2025, the city will unveil a new Gran Melia beach resort, just as SHA Wellness Clinic (famed for its sister resorts in Spain and Mexico) prepares for its 2026 Emirates debut.

If you're thinking 'Las Vegas on steroids,' just wait. MGM Resorts is building its own ""Dubai Sphere,"" a smaller version of the immersive Las Vegas Sphere, as part of a new $2 billion complex. Though no opening date has been announced, the construction contract has been awarded for the development of three new resorts: an MGM, Bellagio and an Aria, with a sphere in the middle.

Projects like these seem to solidify Dubai's reputation as an ostentatious, artificial desert oasis. But during his recent media blitz in New York, including a speech delivered at the Skift Global Forum travel conference, Issam Kazim, CEO of Dubai Corporation for Tourism and Commerce Marketing, insisted there's way more to his hometown than that. And he's launching a new campaign to convince U.S. travelers to take another look. Here, an excerpt from our conversation:

Dubai feels more accessible, in a way it wasn't 10 years ago.

Depending on the list, today we are the 3rd or 4th internationally most visited city in the world. When we started in 2014, we were number seven -- so we mapped out a complete strategy. [Dubai welcomed 9.31 million international overnight visitors from January to June 2024, a 9% increase over the 8.55 million tourist arrivals in the first half of 2023, according to the Department of Economy and Tourism].

We interviewed people in cities we were interested in targeting. There are 6-7 traditional strong markets. What are potential new markets we can open up? How can we match their needs? We quickly realized that the people visiting Dubai expected great beaches and hotels, and that's all they assumed was there. A lot of people didn't associate culture or heritage with Dubai.

It's an outlier in the United Arab Emirates, in that it was oil poor. It had to find other ways to attract wealth: mainly tourism and finance. Is that right?

Absolutely. It was a trading hub. There was an industry that relied on fishing and pearl diving. It was all built around the creek where traders came in. The first mega project was the dredging of that creek to allow ships to come and go. It started to open up a lot more business communities to come in. Today, you have close to 200 nationalities that have chosen Dubai to be home; they make up about 90% of the population, from all walks of life. We were blessed by not having natural resources; we were forced to look elsewhere to take tourism and trade to the next level.

From trade comes commerce, and from commerce comes banking...

Dubai thinks and acts like a company. We joke, we call ourselves Dubai Inc. Because the private and public sector work together hand-in-hand. If rules need to change because it's more conducive to business, we make those changes. It's that dynamic; it's that agile.

I'll give you an example: We have a good number of 3-4 star hotels; but maybe not enough to open up more markets. Luxury, we've got it covered. But we also need more affordable luxury. So, we created an incentive. We had a pipeline of investors coming in to build more hotels because there is demand. We told them: Anybody who develops new 3-4 star hotels, we will waive off the 10% municipality fees for five years. So developers shifted down from 5 stars, because everybody has a quicker ROI [return on investment] on 3 and 4 stars.

When we launched our strategy in 2014, we had 67,000 hotel rooms. Today we have over 150,000 hotel rooms. So, more than double in about eight years. On average, they are just shy of 80% occupancy. [Compared to the end of 2019, hotels across all categories are up 11.3%, with room inventory up 20.1% -- bringing the current total to over 820 establishments and 150,000 rooms, according to the Department of Economy and Tourism].

Are you open to travel-tech companies like Airbnb and Uber?

Yes, we're open and connected with the world. With Airbnb, we understand the challenges they face in New York. But at the end of the day, it's not about Airbnb, it's about Airbnb's customers. If that's the way they travel, we can't ignore them completely. We want to accommodate them as well.

The misconception that people have is that Dubai is too expensive. But that's not true. [In addition to Hotel Indigo Dubai Downtown, Rove Hotels', Avani+ Palm View and Al Seef Heritage Hotel, Mama Shelter hotels will add another mid-priced option to Dubai this year].

Where is future growth going to come from?

Palm Jumeirah island is a massively successful destination. We're bringing in properties and hotels within that space. There's a lot more coming up. Right next door is where the Al Maktoum Airport is going to be. Dubai International Airport (DXB) has reached its maximum capacity. So we soft launched Al Maktoum a few years ago to get people used to that area. That's where the new developers of Dubai are going.

When will it open?

Within 10 years. It will be done in phases, because that's where the future of growth is going to be for us. When it reaches full capacity, it can accommodate up to 260 million passengers annually. [By comparison, Dubai International has upped its forecast to 91.8 million guests for 2024, above the all-time high of 89.1 million recorded in 2018].

Plus, it's right next to the one of the largest port operators, DP world. Our hub is about connecting not just people but also goods. We're working to better serve business needs.

By allowing foreign companies to have full ownership?

Yes, the law changed in 2020. [Foreigners are allowed to establish companies with 100 percent full ownership, based on the provisions of Federal Decree-Law No. 26 of 2020 amending the provisions of Federal Law No. 2 of 2015 on Commercial Companies].

Businesses are setting up their global HQs in Dubai, because it gives them access to the rest of the world. Setting them up is part of our remit since we merged the department of tourism with the department of economy in 2022. Now, we're talking about becoming the number one city to live in, and the number one city to work in. In many ways, we're an incubator for what cities look like in the future.

What else are you doing to meet your goals?

When we started, we had 160-odd projects, but we simplified it with four key targets: We want to become one of the most visited cities in the world, increase the number of visitors every year, increase length of stay, increase spend within the city; we want them to explore everything Dubai has to offer and to increase repeat visitation.

Today, we've ticked all those boxes. Now, 25% of the visitors that come to Dubai will repeat their visit within 12 months. Within an 8-hour radius, two-thirds of the world's population is right there. So, we've made it easier to get a Visa, and we've made it easier for people to access Dubai by opening up more routes with our partners. Six months after we launched, we added 16 countries into a 'Visa on arrival' program. That's how quickly we move. Now, with Emirates you've got a lot of gateways in and out of the US. They created a co-chair with United Airlines. [United Airlines is currently the only U.S. carrier offering a nonstop flight to Dubai].

Says Kazim, ""In many ways, we're an incubator for what cities look like in the future.""

What are you doing to welcome female travelers?

We're very focused on changing perceptions about women in Dubai. The first thing that I'm always being asked is: Do I have to cover up when I go to Dubai? No, it's not like that. You have people from all walks of life. Everyone, as long as they are respectful of the other, they can live in Dubai the way they want to live.

Let's talk about food. Have things changed since the Michelin Guide arrived in Dubai in 2022?

Five years ago, I worked on a project to try and get Michelin to even consider Dubai; we were not on their radar. They weren't interested. Then, one day I get a call: ""Our team member flew with Emirates to Dubai. We asked them to survey the area. We were pleasantly surprised; Dubai is far more ready than we had assumed."" Now in its 3rd year, we have 106 restaurants listed in the 2024 Michelin Guide.

For me, the magic of Michelin is marketing. Pure and simple. Knowing that Michelin is talking about Dubai, I have another massive channel pushing the destination out there. When Michelin was announced, I saw with my own eyes when the restaurateurs and chefs of Dubai went up onstage, they were crying. They never imagined that Dubai would have that opportunity. Then, I felt the importance of it.

What's on your wishlist?

That people know Dubai as if they are living and breathing it on the ground. If I can make that knowledge available to them before they choose a destination, that would be the holy grail. When people come with an open mind, they not only end up coming back, they start asking, how can I live here? I want to get people to understand what Dubai is about."
National Disability Employment Awareness Month Promotes Access To Good Jobs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianewiniarski/2024/10/02/national-disability-employment-awareness-month-promotes-access-to-good-jobs/,2024-10-02T18:01:23Z,"National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM), an annual October event sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor, acknowledges that individuals with disabilities add value to workplaces across the country and to the economy. This year's theme, ""Access to Good Jobs for All,"" speaks to every American worker, but especially to those who are returning to work through Social Security's Ticket to Work (TTW) Program.

This year's theme also addresses the department's pledge to increase the quality and number of employment opportunities for people with disabilities. After a lengthy medical leave, many are searching for meaningful jobs, and NDEAM supports their efforts. ""Workers, including those with disabilities, have a right to pursue high-quality, well-paying jobs and be successful in those jobs,"" the department said. NDEAM's pledge complements the goal of the TTW Program - to empower individuals to return to work and move them toward financial self-sufficiency through meaningful employment.

Jobs Bring TTW Participants Self-Worth And Greater Income

With the combined benefit of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and TTW, former workers with disabilities have the opportunity to pursue employment without fear of losing their disability income or Medicare benefits for a period of time. While job searches and interviews can be stressful, TTW offers valuable support and work incentives that make attempting a return to work less daunting.

One of the most impactful TTW benefits is free assistance from Social Security-authorized Employment Networks (EN) and state Vocational Rehabilitation agencies (VR). These firms support TTW participants in returning to work. Experienced professionals explain the program details and help you identify your skills, interests and potential job opportunities. They offer guidance and resources so you can approach the job search and interview process with confidence. They will also guide you in requesting reasonable accommodations from your employer, if needed.

The support from ENs or VRs that helps TTW ticket holders find and obtain the right jobs is invaluable. Ticket to Work participants, employed by companies where they feel valued, report improved self-worth and a renewed sense of purpose, recognizing they have a lot to contribute. The program supports participants in moving toward financial self-sufficiency by enabling them to earn more than they can on disability benefits alone, which is the core goal of TTW. Beneficiaries say they feel a sense of accomplishment and, at the same time, are contributing to the organization.

A TTW participant explains, ""It was a difficult decision to return to work. But working helps me socialize with others. Staying at home can cause me to spiral downward. I needed some parameters and a controlled setting to get me back to work. My Employment Network provided that for me. I'm a huge success story for them.""

Another SSDI beneficiary says, ""The Ticket to Work Program provided the safety net I needed. It allowed me to earn more and get used to working again, at my pace.""

National Disability Employment Awareness Month is a reminder this October and every month that all workers, including those with disabilities, will benefit from more access to quality jobs. The TTW Program makes this possible for SSDI beneficiaries who choose to reenter the workforce. Employment Networks and VRs help workers with disabilities increase their income and gain greater self-worth as they find and thrive in good jobs. Ticket to Work supports NDEAM's mission by making these opportunities available all year long."
Is Quantum Computing An Unlikely Answer To AI's Looming Energy Crisis?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2024/10/02/is-quantum-computing-an-unlikely-answer-to-ais-looming-energy-crisis/,2024-10-02T16:12:27Z,"AI uses a ton of electricity. Just ask Elon Musk. He's investing billions in building out some of the largest supercomputers in the world to train his AI models to fuel future Tesla EVs, robotaxis, Optimus humanoid robots and Grok which is the large language model in beta test on X -- formerly known as Twitter.

And thanks to the seemingly ever-expanding iteration of AI services offered from Google, OpenAI, Amazon, Microsoft and others we can expect those power demands to continue to grow.

It's estimated that after decades of nearly zero growth in new demand for electricity within the US data centers, AI will double current data center usage by 2030 -- according to recent research from Barclays, co-authored by Will Thompson, senior thematic research analyst focusing on energy and industrial sectors.

""The proliferation of AI, coupled with manufacturing reshoring, electrification (e.g. EVs, heat pumps) and cryptocurrencies, have raised US electricity demand expectations. In our view, this presents risks to our AI and net zero ambitions. While there have been various top-down forecasts for AI and data center energy demand, they lack underlying assumptions, leading to more questions than answers,"" he wrote in an email exchange.

""Our analysis indicates a lot of imminent AI energy needs with data centers potentially exceeding 9% of US current electricity demand by 2030 versus only about 3.5% today,"" Thompson added.

Thompson explained that this is a problem because current infrastructure isn't built to sustain that level of data center energy production.

He further noted that both Republicans and Democrats want to ensure the US maintains a leadership position within the AI space for the sake of the economy, national security, as well as future safety and governance of the tech. But there isn't agreement on how to power the future of AI.

""Despite bipartisan support for infrastructure permit reform and investment, plus growing support for nuclear power, the parties remain divided on the future roles for renewables and fossil fuels, electrification policies, and what impact all this will have on climate change, economic growth, and energy affordability and reliability,"" he wrote.

Additional challenges he cited include AI's need for 24/7/365 uptime; the intermittency of renewable energy such as wind and solar; current geographic concentration of data centers as well as computing demands from AI outpacing energy-efficiency gains from available GPU tech.

However, there have been reports and studies that suggest -- in specific instances -- the use of quantum computing could be as much as 100 times more energy efficient than a typical supercomputer.

In fact, a recent article comparing the energy consumption spanning 20 years by the top 500 supercomputers in the world found that a publicly available quantum computer with the same compute power as the top-energy glutton on the list, consumed less than 0.05% of the electricity.

To understand how quantum computing works, we need to start with how a regular computer works. Bits are the smallest amount of computer information. Think of the bits on your laptop as nothing more than a series of tiny light switches that can be either ""off"" or ""on"" -- each position signified by a 0 or a 1 in computer speak. Everything a computer does is based on those bits flipping between being on and off.

In quantum computing, those systems operate on quantum bits, or qubits. A qubit is like a spooky, magical switch that can be both off and on at the same time - here's how. Imagine a spinning coin on a table. While it's spinning around, it's not just heads or tails - it's actually kind of both until it lands.

Similarly, a qubit can be in a state where it's both 0 and 1 at the same time - this is called superposition. The unique state that allows qubits to be both 0 and 1 at the same time, enables them to handle multiple possibilities all at once. That means quantum computers can solve certain problems - such as AI's linear algebraic equations - much faster than regular computers.

One more interesting tidbit about qubits is that they can be linked together in a special way called entanglement. So once a pair of qubits are entangled -- the state of one qubit depends on the state of another -- even if they're far apart. This allows quantum computers to linkup and process an even larger amount of information quickly.

IonQ is a leader in the quantum computing space offering a suite of solutions that span cloud-based quantum access, consulting applications, quant networking and hardware. In a Zoom call with IonQ President and CEO, Peter Campbell, he said quantum computing processors are uniquely designed to meet the computing challenges of artificial intelligence.

""Large language models operate on linear algebra, and that's one of the things quantum is good at, and we are busily working on looking at creating a hybrid version of a large language model where we move the linear algebra off of GPUs and CPUs and onto a quantum processor. That migration would then reduce the energy requirements,"" Campbell explained.

He said the company is likely six to nine months away from having prototypes of the hybrid quantum chip specifically for AI, noting that they have had hybrid quant processors in the field for years for other use cases like the transportation industry.

But he reiterated that quantum is the best technology available -- not just for AI's computational needs but its energy demands as well.

""For the things that quantum computing is good at -- such as AI processing -- there's no way for any GPU to compete against us. Those workloads are ultimately going to go to quantum and current technology just literally can't compete,"" Campbell said.

""Quantum computing -- our next generation chip -- to simulate what it's doing, you would need something like two and a half billion GPUs and it runs off a two standard wall sockets,"" he added.

He explained that his teams have been working to make quantum computers hardier and able to colocate within existing data centers without exotic absolute zero temperatures or customized shock-absorbing server racks. Campbell says their manufacturing capacity will be at scale within the next 24 months.

""We have been scaling up our manufacturing capability, but also just to make sure that these things are compatible with standard data centers. We don't want clients to have to put up a special building to install one of our quantum computers into it. So we've been working on putting them into standard racks. Working with the environmental specifications of the buildings and the power requirements so they're ready to go,"" said Campbell.

Despite the potential of quantum computing, Barclays' Thompson noted that solving AI's power puzzle will require more.

""In our view, there are no silver bullet solutions. It will require an above-all-approach of expanding and modernizing electric grid infrastructure, integrating renewables with utility-scale storage, utilizing our existing nuclear capacity, and scaling new forms of carbon-free energy. That will include geothermal, advances nuclear small modular reactors (SMRs) and fusion technology,"" he wrote."
Cold Frittatas: JetBlue Drops Hot Food On Transatlantic Flights In Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerdooley/2024/10/02/cold-frittatas-jetblue-drops-hot-food-on-transatlantic-flights-in-economy/,2024-10-02T16:01:53Z,"JetBlue is rolling out new menus for transatlantic flights, and there's one surprising feature on them: there will be no hot meals for flyers in economy class.

On just about all airlines, even passengers in the cheap seats on an ocean crossing could count on at least one hot meal, albeit one with sometimes questionable appeal. Now, JetBlue economy menus come with this chilling note: ""All items served chilled.""

A frittata with roasted zucchini and tomatoes sounds tasty for breakfast, but do you really want a cold frittata? A lunch/dinner menu offers a choice of Chicken Grain Bowl (cold) or Ginger Garlic Tofu (cold). Another lets flyers choose between Pesto Pasta Salad (cold) and Mushrooms & Lentils (cold). Sounds delicious, right?

I've predicted that, based on moves by various airlines, that customer experience might be how airlines seek a competitive edge. United Airlines, for example, just announced that it would upgrade WiFi on all of its planes to Starlink service, and offer it at no charge to all customers. In a recent interview, Customer Management Practice president Mario Matulich called CX an ""interesting competitive battleground.""

While nobody expects gourmet meals in economy, flyers do expect sustenance on a flight that lasts eight or nine hours. Some of JetBlue's chilled choices seem truly unpalatable, and I expect some flyers will feel the need to bring their own food on board.

Passengers bringing food onto airplanes creates customer experience problems beyond the mere inconvenience of purchasing and carrying potentially messy bags or boxes. One survey of 3,000 travelers found their third biggest annoyance was other passengers bringing smelly food onto airplanes. That's bad enough on a short flight, but would be even worse on flights that might stretch to ten hours.

For an airline that used to pride itself on service, JetBlue's cold food seems out of step with its heritage and with the industry as a whole.

For many flyers, ticket price is the most important variable. The survival of low-cost airlines that offer objectively terrible service proves this to be true. If JetBlue's prices for crossing the Atlantic in economy are low enough, no doubt many passengers will complain about the food but choose JetBlue anyway."
Don't Repeat History: Now Is The Time To Invest In AI Literacy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariaflynn/2024/10/02/dont-repeat-history-now-is-the-time-to-invest-in-ai-literacy/,2024-10-02T14:04:59Z,"Over the past decade, a wave of digital transformation fundamentally changed the skills needed for nearly every occupation, from home health aides to architects. And in many cases, workers and employers weren't ready. The rapid rise of digital tools in the workplace led to a ""digital blindspot"" where employers underestimated the technological impact and overlooked the importance of developing basic digital literacy skills. As a result, workers were left ill-prepared to benefit from the fruits of a digital economy, and businesses and economies missed out on the potential productivity gains that should have been realized. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence mean the country is now at risk of falling into a similar trap.

This transformation won't be limited to the tech sector; 88 percent of workers using generative AI are in non-technical roles such as cashiers and retail associates. Just as digital literacy is now table stakes for success in a digital economy, it's clear that the bar for AI skills and knowledge -- as well as durable human skills that can be augmented by AI -- will soon be raised for everyone.

Against this backdrop, it's crucial that business leaders, policymakers, and training providers work to proactively ensure that all employees, regardless of age or career stage, are equipped with basic AI literacy. Employers, in particular, will need to lead the way in creating a workforce that can thrive in an environment being continually reshaped by this technology.

While many workers are independently exploring and mastering generative AI tools like ChatGPT, self-driven experimentation is not going to solve the AI literacy challenge. Studies show that AI use is already divided by historic indicators of marginalization, like income and college attainment. When individuals are tasked with finding the time and money to invest in upskilling or reskilling, too many are left behind.

Despite the clear need, AI upskilling remains relatively uncommon. While we are seeing some progress in foundational and career-focused AI literacy training in K-12 schools and colleges, there remains a substantial gap among working adults, especially those disconnected from traditional educational systems. According to research from Multiverse, nearly half of workers say they have had no access to technical training in the last five years, let alone training specifically related to AI.

Euan Blair, Multiverse's CEO, recently shared with me their decision to offer all apprentices -- regardless of which field they're studying -- a course designed to build a working knowledge of AI: ""Every worker, in every line of work, will need a working knowledge of what AI is and how to use AI-enabled tools effectively. Employers and training providers have a responsibility to ensure all workers have the skills to extract value from these powerful tools, if we want to empower both businesses and individuals in the future of work.""

For employers, this training gap represents not only an opportunity to invest in their workers' growth but also a strategy to maintain their company's competitiveness in an AI world. Business leaders recognize the potential of AI to increase productivity, efficiency, and customer service, but they are often playing catch-up when it comes to implementation.

At the heart of the challenge is a shortfall of skilled workers. Demand is far outstripping supply, with the share of job descriptions mentioning AI fluency on the job platform Handshake more than tripling this year. If employers hope to cultivate an AI-proficient workforce, they must invest in AI literacy training that helps their workers better understand the technology's purpose, inner workings, and limitations.

Companies will need to allocate the necessary paid time and opportunity for employees to engage in AI training programs. Such efforts should go beyond tool-specific training and be embedded into existing processes and on-the-job learning initiatives, such as new employee onboarding. Training should also focus on AI fluency, empowering workers to use AI in their specific roles and responsibilities. These learning opportunities should be provided to all employees -- particularly low-wage hourly workers, who are often at higher risk of automation but remain shut out of many upskilling programs.

But as vital as employers are, they can't be the only leg of the stool.

Initiatives like Google.org's AI Opportunity Fund and AI Essentials course, Kapor Foundation's support for ethical and responsible AI, and Microsoft's AI literacy investments in Wisconsin all engage with community-based organizations to expand access to AI education and skill development. Intel, meanwhile has partnered with community colleges in dozens of states as part of its AI for Workforce programs. Philanthropies can further contribute by investing in the tools and computing power needed for AI training, as well as in the development of inclusive AI literacy content that is reflective of and accessible to all learners and workers.

Similarly, federal and state policymakers can help expand access to AI literacy by following the lead of President Biden's recent executive order and AI safety guidelines, which note that employers ""should support or upskill workers during job transitions related to AI."" They should consider supporting legislation such as the bipartisan AI Literacy Act, which would codify AI literacy as a key component of digital literacy and integrate it into existing government technology initiatives. Critically, policymakers must enhance support for incumbent training funding both for workers to acquire new skills well before their jobs change and for those who have already experienced job loss.

AI is poised to dramatically alter not only the future of work but its present. By ensuring universal AI literacy, we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and guarantee that every worker has an equitable opportunity to succeed in this swiftly changing landscape. This will require a concerted effort from all sectors, but the rewards -- a more inclusive, productive, and resilient workforce -- will undoubtedly justify the investment."
Preempting Bad Local Housing Policies: Indiana Shows How,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogervaldez/2024/10/02/preempting-bad-local-housing-policies-indiana-shows-how/,2024-10-02T13:38:26Z,"It is a thing of beauty, and so much so, that I am just going to quote it in full, right up front, Indiana Code 32-31-1-20 Local units prohibited from regulating rental rates and landlord-tenant relationship.

Sec. 20. (a) Subject to IC 36-1-3-8.5, this section does not apply to privately owned real property for which government funds or benefits have been allocated from the United States government, the state, or a political subdivision for the express purpose of providing reduced rents to low or moderate income tenants.

(b) A unit . . . may not regulate rental rates for privately owned real property, through a zoning ordinance or otherwise, unless the regulation is authorized by an act of the general assembly.

(c) A unit . . . may not regulate, through an ordinance or otherwise, any of the following aspects of a landlord-tenant relationship with respect to privately owned real property located in the unit unless the regulation is authorized by an act of the general assembly:

(1) The screening process used by a landlord in approving tenants to lease privately owned real property.

Any ordinance or regulation that violates this subsection is void and unenforceable.

What's happening here is that Indiana's legislature has taken tenant landlord law away from local governments. Over the last decade, something called the Eviction Lab based at Princeton University has been charging huge fees to have its director, Matthew Desmond, deliver speeches about the ""eviction crisis"" in the United States. What happens is that Desmond blows into town, declares the local jurisdiction to be among one of the cities with one of the highest eviction rates in the United States. Anecdotes follow. Then local City Councils and Mayors set about to ""fix"" the problem with really bad policies affecting the contracts between tenants and landlords. If you want to dig into that story, you can read an older post on this here.

The policies include bans on background checks, limits on deposits, sealing of eviction records, and disallowing the use of credit scores to determine eligibility for tenancy. Over time, there are an accretion of these measures, all of which serve only to raise the risk of renting to people with less money struggling to find an apartment. I took a closer look at the failed logic behind banning credit checks. This is from a post back in December 2020. I quote a Washington Post article that argues credit scores are supposed to be race neutral but aren't because most people of color have poor credit scores.

The logical failure here should be obvious. Population X has low credit scores. Population Y has average or above average credit scores. Credit checks reveal this, meaning members of population X often can't find a place to rent when credit scores are used. Therefore, we should ban credit scores.

If it is true that people of color have lower credit scores than whites, the question is, ""Why?"" and how can we address that through policy or other measures. Credit scores, reporting, and use to evaluate risk are not the problem, it's the underlying problems in the economy that result in a disproportionate number of people of color having poor credit scores. The argument is that, essentially, since the results favor whites, the credit score is racist and should be banned. The implication is, too, that anyone who uses a credit score to measure the risk of renting to someone is racist as well. This is logically absurd but understandable. Banning credit checks or other data to evaluate tenants is the equivalent of turning up your radio when your car starts making a terrible noise.

Yet politicians, especially local city elected officials grasping for the golden ring of higher office, absolutely love policies that bash landlords, seem to favor tenants, and cost no money and come with zero evaluation; do these measures even work? Of course, they don't. Take efforts to ban ""source of income discrimination,"" an effort to force housing providers to take vouchers. The truth is most housing providers would be happy to take vouchers if they weren't so hard to use, requiring too much red tape and inspections that are often arbitrary. If you look at any jurisdiction that has source of income rules, you'll find a jurisdiction with hundreds if not thousands of unused vouchers. These measures don't help the real problems but make things worse by making rental housing riskier; the only way to offset risk with no tools to measure it is to raise rents.

Enter Lynne Petersen, President of the Indiana Apartment Association and Brian Spaulding incoming President of the association. Back in 2020, they worked on a proposal to preempt cities like Indianapolis from setting the terms of tenant landlord contracts like leases and deposits. Spaulding explained that ""our language originally passed the House . . . and was then vetoed by the Governor. In 2021, SEA 148 (passed the House and Senate in 2020) was considered again to override the Governor's veto. It was successful.""

Some readers might remember back to a series I wrote on preemption, one that a friendly critic found to be too long even for policy wonks (you can read them here, in order, Preemption And Housing: Cooley's Rule And Rights Of Local Governments, Preemption And Housing: Local Governments Have An Important Role, Preemption And Housing: The Deep Roots Of The Dillon Rule, Preemption And Housing: Towards A Vertical Balance Of Power).

In that series I did an exhaustive review of why preemption is not like the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and how it could be wielded by legislatures to reign in local governments and politicians eager to score political points rather than address the single most important problems in rental housing, lack of supply and lack of fast cash subsidies to pay for rent when there is trouble. I did this because many legislatures think that the Tenth Amendment's prohibition of the federal government exercising anything but its enumerated powers is a bulwark for local control; this is a conceptual problem Petersen, Spaulding, and a veto proof majority of the Indiana State Legislature didn't have. And the Dillon rule means it isn't true. So, they did it! I only wish I could claim credit from them having read my boring preemption posts. Spaulding charitably said of my posts, ""Thanks Roger! This was a great read. We wish we had a few of your arguments when we were working on our testimony!"" They didn't need them. One down, 49 to go. Next up, preempting local eviction laws."
Netflix Stock: Will The Momentum Slow?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/02/netflix-stock-will-the-momentum-slow/,2024-10-02T13:01:44Z,"Netflix stock has had a pretty good year, rising by almost 45% year-to-date as the company successfully navigated a brief subscriber decline post-Covid-19. This compares to rival Disney, which has gained about 7% over the same time frame. Netflix is poised to report its Q3 FY'24 results on October 17, reporting on a quarter that is likely to see the company continue to expand its business led by its ad-supported plans and crack down on password sharing. We expect earnings to come in at about $5.10 per share, roughly in line with consensus estimates, and up by 37% compared to the last year. Revenues are likely to come in at about $9.85 billion, slightly ahead of consensus estimates, rising 14.5% compared to the last year. So what are some of the trends that could drive Netflix results?

Netflix is expected to see its paid net additions for the quarter lower on a year-over-year basis as the company sees a tough comparison with Q3 2023, which had the first full quarter impact from paid sharing. The password-sharing crackdown essentially forced customers to pay for users outside their households or sign up for a new account. However, the company should continue to benefit from its ad-supported tier which is enabling it to attract more price-sensitive customers with a price of just $7 per month in the U.S. The total subscribers on this tier grew by about 34% compared to the year-ago period. Moreover, the ad-supported plan is expected to generate more revenue per user than some of Netflix's ad-free plans as incremental ad revenue more than offsets the discount offered on the ad tier. Over the last quarter, Netflix said that it was discontinuing its Basic ad-free plan while migrating users to its entry-level ad-supported plan, which offers better video quality and has a lower price point. That said, Netflix forecasts that its global average revenue per member will be roughly flat year over year in Q3 due to currency-related headwinds and potentially higher net adds in international markets where monthly pricing is lower than the U.S.

Netflix has been increasingly focusing on boosting its margins. For Q3, operating margins are guided at 28.1%%, marking an increase from about 22% in the year-ago quarter. The margin expansion is driven by revenue growth that outpaces operating costs due to economies of scale and also due to potentially lower content spending growth. Netflix's continued price increases are also likely helping profitability. Margins are also likely to trend higher on a sequential basis.

The increase in NFLX stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -51% in 2022, and 65% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NFLX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

Although we think that Netflix stock could move slightly higher if it beats earnings, we believe the stock is overvalued. At the current market price of about $707 per share, Netflix trades at almost 37x forward earnings, which is a bit pricey in our view. While Netflix's recent performance has been strong, consumer spending growth appears to be slowing down Moreover, things also remain mixed in the labor market, with the U.S. economy creating slightly fewer jobs than expected during August. These trends could weigh on players such as Netflix who are dependent on strong consumer confidence. Netflix could also see subscriber growth cool, as the impact of its accelerated subscriber adds coming from the twin impact of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers continue to normalize, reducing momentum for the stock. We have a $572 price estimate for Netflix, which is about 20% below the market price. See our analysis Netflix Valuation: Expensive or Cheap for more details on what's driving our price estimate for Netflix. Also, check out the analysis of Netflix Revenue for more details on how Netflix revenues are trending.

While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy following the recent rate cuts, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

Yellen Is Wrong About Financial Regulation,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/norbertmichel/2024/10/02/yellen-is-wrong-about-financial-regulation/,2024-10-02T12:48:52Z,"One of the best ways to kill the vibe at any party is to bring up financial market regulation. Few people want to discuss the theory behind it, much less the details of our regulatory framework, and who can blame them?

On the other hand, most policymakers inside the beltway view this regulatory framework as sacred. They're happy to talk about it, but only if you want to expand it.

I'm positive, though, that only a select few members of Congress know many of the details. And if the rest did spend the time to dig in, they would recognize three things: There was no substantive deregulation of financial markets in the last century; regulating to safeguard financial stability was not invented after the 2008 financial crisis; and much of the theory behind the post-2008 regime is little more than wishful thinking.

For those interested, there is a great debate here.

On the establishment side, we have folks like Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Even though she claims to have ""focused on financial stability"" throughout her career, she believes it was productive to enact ""new macroprudential policies focused on mitigating systemic risk"" in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

She argues that these regulations have ""strengthened the financial system,"" but she offers no direct evidence. (Yes, many banks have higher capital now versus 2007, but that could have been achieved without passing any new laws, much less the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.) And if those new regulations worked so well, it stands to reason Yellen should not have had to bail out uninsured depositors in three banks that failed in 2023. If that bailout was necessary to save the world from financial catastrophe, those regulations could not have work as advertised.

Yellen also believes in Dodd-Frank's Financial Stability Oversight Council.

For those lucky enough to be unaware, the FSOC is the multi-regulator council that is supposed to reduce future government bailouts by, among other things, identifying threats to financial stability. As hard as it is to believe, Congress decided that even though the United States already had more than 10 financial regulators who failed to even see a financial crisis coming, a good solution was to give those regulators even more responsibility.

Yellen recently argued that the FSOC was necessary to give regulators ""a more holistic view of and approach to risks."" Again, the idea that nobody was regulating systemic risk prior to the creation of FSOC, in a holistic way or any other way, is undeniably false.

Regardless, here's the kind of riveting risk analysis the FSOC produces. It's 2019 annual report stated that ""Firms with high levels of debt may be vulnerable to unexpected financial or economic events that may negatively affect their repayment and refinancing capacity."" Who knew?

And in 2022, with Yellen as Treasury Secretary, the FSOC warned that the commercial real estate market ""faces a more uncertain outlook given elevated inflation, rising interest rates, a slowing economy, and the potential for structural changes in behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.""

If it really is too much to expect the folks at the Fed and the FDIC to know about this uncertain outlook, Congress has all the evidence it needs to restructure the regulatory framework.

I'm much more aligned with my colleague, Mark Calabria, former director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and former FSOC member. In his retrospective 2023 book, Calabria wrote ""This may be the FSOC's real strength, pointing out problems in our financial system for which none of its members bear any authority or responsibility.""

Although I do think the FSOC has been rather useless, I am still highly critical of the theory behind its creation. The last way to prevent large bailouts, for instance, is to have federal regulators pre-identify those firms they believe pose excessive systemic risk.

But that's what the FSOC is supposed to do.

The theory behind the FSOC is that regulators can impose regulations to prevent financial crises. But we already know that premise is false. Worse, we know that government policies tend to be a main contributing factor in virtually all such events throughout history.

That's all bad enough, but if we accept the theory behind the FSOC arrangement, we cannot possibly accept the theory behind the superiority of the free enterprise system.

It may not be so obvious, but the truth is that, if a massive bank were to fail, it would present no greater danger to people's ability to earn a living than the failure of a company like Walmart, Ford, or Home Depot. In each case, we're talking about millions of people's money and their ability to earn more of it.

If we accept the notion that financial firms cannot exist without heavy-handed regulation to prevent calamity, then we must also accept the same for nonfinancial companies.

More broadly, federal regulators should not be empowered to stop people from engaging in financial or economic activities the regulators believe are too risky. As I've argued for years, the mere existence of the FSOC is wholly incompatible with the functioning of a dynamic private capital market. Congress should eliminate it, reduce invasive federal regulation, and stop giving bureaucrats the power to micromanage financial risks."
6.5 Trillion Reasons Why This 6% Dividend Will Soar,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/10/02/65-trillion-reasons-why-this-6-dividend-will-soar/,2024-10-02T12:48:38Z,"Right now, there's $6.5 trillion in cash sitting on the sidelines -- and a big slice of it is about to drop straight into a select group of dividend stocks.

We're going to ""front run"" that cash wave today -- and set ourselves up for income (I'm talking 6%+ yields here) and gains as this cash wave starts to build.

In a sec, I'll name two dividend-payers sitting right in the path of this freed-up cash. One is a true ""dividend unicorn,"" shelling out an outsized 6% payout that grows. The other has doubled its dividend in just the last five years.

Let's start by breaking down that $6.5 trillion figure: It's the amount of cash in parked money-market funds today.

Here's why a big chunk of it is likely to shake loose: Rates on money-market funds float, and the Fed Funds rate -- which Jay Powell, of course, just started slashing -- has a strong pull on them.

As yields on money-market funds (and savings accounts and the like) fall, more ""new money"" will bypass them and go into dividend stocks instead. Meantime, today's money-market investors will ""stretch"" for higher yields and payout growth. Here again, dividend stocks will be the beneficiaries.

It's already happening:

Above you can see the rapid growth in money-market holdings since the Fed started raising rates in early 2022. Since the second quarter of that year -- or about two years ago -- the total has jumped a staggering 30%, to just over $6.5 trillion.

You can also see (at the top right), that the inflow has slowed. It's no coincidence that's happened as yields on money-market funds like the popular Vanguard Federal Money Market Investor Fund (VMFXX) flatline:

You can see the fund's yield stair-step higher as the Fed hiked rates to 5.25% to 5.5%, then go flat as the Fed held rates from mid-2023 till this month's 50-point cut.

Let me be clear: I'm not saying the entire $6.5 trillion is going to go into stocks.

Plenty of folks will always be drawn by the promise of a guaranteed principal. But even if money-market holdings simply drop back to where they were two years ago, we're talking about $1.5-trillion making a move here.

And that doesn't include new money that bypasses these lower-paying money-market funds. Or any freed-up cash in savings accounts and CDs as they mature.

In fact, this transition is already happening, and in a surprising place, too: riskier high-yield, or ""junk,"" bonds.

Check out these big gains from the corporate-bond closed-end funds (CEFs) we held in my Contrarian Income Report service from November 2023 to now:

These are big moves for bond funds, especially for our two municipal-bond funds, NEA and NAD. These gains happened in lockstep with the slowing flow into money-market funds, and this trade is still working in our favor -- though after these funds' strong runs, I do rate them as ""holds"" today.

While we wait, though, let's dive into those two dividend payers I mentioned earlier.

Our first stock, payment processor Mastercard (MA) is in the pole position not only as more cash moves into stocks but from another shift few people are talking about.

I'm talking about the rising odds we'll not get a soft or hard landing in the economy -- but no landing at all. In that setup, the economy ticks along and inflation comes back.

Not great, I know, and we discussed it in detail last Tuesday. The upshot is that government spending is out of control, outrunning tax receipts by almost $2 trillion.

Give me an extra $2 trillion and I'll show you a strong economy! But the resulting monetary inflation could flow back into consumer price inflation -- and overwhelm Jay Powell.

This is one reason why those bond funds I mentioned earlier are holds for now. As I said, the trade is still going our way, but we're watching it closely, as any move toward higher rates would hurt bond prices (as rates and bond prices move inversely).

But the other part of this story -- a humming economy -- is great for Mastercard (MA), which takes a slice of each payment that rolls down its network.

And talk about pricing power: The credit-card market is basically controlled by four companies: Visa (V), with a 53% share, Mastercard (MA), at 24%, American Express (AXP), at 20% and Discover Financial Services (DFS).

Mastercard doesn't win many income fans with its tiny 0.5% yield, but payout growth is the story here: This dividend has doubled in the last five years, pulling up the share price with it:

If you've followed me for a while, you know I talk a lot about the ""Dividend Magnet"" -- a stock's tendency to track its payout higher.

You can see it in action here. The current gap between the two is a snapshot of the stock's upside as it ""snaps back"" to the payout. The low payout ratio (Mastercard pays just 21% of free cash flow as dividends) virtually locks in further growth, even if I'm wrong and the economy does slow from here.

Mastercard is a great stock, but let's be honest, it'll take years for its payout growth to inflate the yield on a buy made today. That's where casino landlord Gaming and Leisure Properties (GLPI) comes in.

Before you say it, yes, I know a casino stock might sound like an odd pick to attract money-market-fund investors. But I'm pretty sure a growing 6% dividend won't take long to convince them! And hey, if folks really are migrating to junk bonds from money-market funds, why not a stock like GLPI?

Plus, the stock has lots of strengths that make it far from a gamble (sorry, couldn't resist).

For one, it's diversified across the country, with 65 casinos in 20 states. That's key, because if the job market continues to slow, concerned workers might cancel their Vegas trip, but they'll likely still hit up their local casino.

Second GLPI's tenants are signed under ""triple-net"" leases that provide a stable, predictable income stream.

Moreover, under these leases, the tenant pays the full cost of running and maintaining the company's properties. Which is great news -- can you imagine what this electricity bill looks like?

But the real standout for us income-seekers is that as a real estate investment trust (REIT), GLPI is exempt from corporate taxes so long as it pays out 90% of its profits as dividends. The savings help fund that high payout.

And as mentioned, GLPI has been quick to share its rising cash flow through payout growth -- including special dividends (the spikes and dips in the chart below):

The REIT's regular dividend was cut in the 2020 lockdowns, but that's understandable and the cut was modest: just 14%.

And GLPI quickly got back to its winning ways, boosting the payout since. And as with Mastercard, we've got a powerful Dividend Magnet working for us here, too.

More payout hikes are likely. GLPI's revenue rose 6.7% in the latest quarter, and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO, the key REIT profitability metric) rose 5.6%. The company also pays an estimated 81% of the midpoint of its forecast 2024 AFFO as dividends, a reasonable amount for a REIT."
Wars And Strikes Put Market On Edge,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/02/wars-and-strikes-put-market-on-edge/,2024-10-02T12:40:53Z,"Jerome Powell Hints At Smaller Rate Cuts Amid Rising Uncertainty

Stocks got off to an auspicious start for October as tensions in the Middle East ratcheted higher and a dockworkers' strike injected and extra dose of volatility. The S&P 500 fell 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.5%. Small cap stocks were also hit with the Russell 2000 dropping 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the best performing industry, but it too was down 0.4%.

Tuesday morning began with a mixture of economic news that showed prices moderating further but a higher than forecast number of job openings in the most recent JOLTs report. However, markets barely had time to digest that data before escalating hostilities in the Middle East took center stage when Iran launched a barrage of missiles aimed at Israel. While damage was limited, the increasing hostilities sent November crude oil futures higher by as much as 5% before settling down some and closing up nearly 4%. Israel has vowed retaliation against Iran and the question now becomes, just how bad the situation will become. In premarket, oil is trading higher by more than 3%.

At the same time, back here at homes, workers from the International Longshoremen Association (ILA) went on strike shutting down ports along the East and Gulf Coasts. According to The Wall Street Journal the ILA unloads around 60%, or $588 billion, of all containerized trade that comes through those coastal ports. Ports will often shut down for things such as hurricanes and therefore, a day or two of closures would have a nominal impact on the economy. However, as the strike lingers, estimates range widely for just what an extended work stoppage would mean.

For markets, I think the most concerning aspect of an extended strike and conflict in the Middle East is the potential for it to reintroduce inflation at a time where it seems like the Fed may have actually achieved a soft landing. In his remarks Monday, Jerome Powell talked about further rate cuts but suggested they may not be as aggressive as September's half-point cut. Currently, the CME Fed Watch Tool is assigning a 63% probability of a quarter-point cut in November and 37% chance of a half-point. This is something I'm keeping my eye on.

Some individual stocks I'm watching include Humana. That stock is down in premarket trading by 24% as membership in high-rating Medicare plans is expected to fall. Apple is lower by 0.5% after analyst downgrades. Meantime, Home Depot is higher following an increased price target of $455 from Piper Sandler. That is up from $387. The narrative here is that with interest rates lower, homeowners will look at making repairs prior to putting their homes on the market. If that does turn out to be the case, I'll be interested to see if other companies such as Lowe's also see upgrades. Finally, shares of Nike are down 7% in premarket following their earnings. Revenues fell 10% and profits were down 28% year-over-year. The company also was unwilling to offer a full year forecast after recently replacing their CEO.

For today, markets will likely be preoccupied with the situation in the Middle East, and the slightly stronger than expected ADP payroll number. The conflict between Israel and Iran is very much in danger of becoming more widespread as we await the next move. Between China's slowing economy and resultant stimulus measures, a strike that could reignite inflation, the upcoming U.S. election, wars on multiple fronts, earnings season just over a week away and wide-ranging speculation as to the state of our own economy, it should come as no surprise that volatility is increasing. The VIX is trading near 19.5 in premarket and with Friday's employment report looming, I would not be surprised to see it hold here or potentially even increase. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."
Oil Facilities In Iran That Could Be In Israel's Sights,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gauravsharma/2024/10/02/oil-facilities-in-iran-that-could-be-in-israels-sights/,2024-10-02T12:40:40Z,"After Iran attacked Israel with nearly 200 missiles late on Tuesday and the latter vowed to retaliate, oil prices surged upwards from their recent lows on heightened tension in the Middle East.

At 7:50am EDT on Wednesday, the Brent front-month futures contract was trading at $75.63 per barrel up $2.07 or 2.80% while the West Texas Intermediate was up $2.21 or 3.16% to $72.04 per barrel.

Iran said it had attacked Israel in response to its ""aggressive acts"", including the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had ""made a big mistake and will pay for it"".

This may be a coded warning that Israel will go after in Iran's oil facilities. According to industry data aggregator and research firm Kpler, Iran exported 1.194 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and gas condensate in spring 2023, a figure that rose to a five-year high of 1.65 million bpd in the first five months of 2024.

So, the industry is an obvious target for Israel should it choose to, and the extent of the market impact depends on chosen targets and the scale of the response. In this respect, four sites of strategic importance come to mind.

The first of these is the Kharg Oil Terminal, situated on Kharg Island, 15 miles off Iran's Northern Coast. It handles over 90% of the country's global crude oil exports.

The second could be a number of oil terminals in the Southern province of Hormozgan. It also has two free trade zones on Kish and Qeshm Islands. Kish is also home of the Iranian oil bourse - the only exchange of its kind that does not trade oil and derivatives in U.S. dollars.

The third, and more domestically focused site, is the Abadan Refinery located across Shatt Al-Arab River on the border between Iraq and Iran. Reliable up-to-date data on the refinery's production capacity is hard to find. But estimates and local sources suggest it could be producing around 400,000 bpd. As Iran's oldest processing facility, originally built in 1909 by Anglo-Persian oil (which later became BP), it services around 25% of Iran's domestic fuel demand.

Mahshahr Oil Terminal, an oil port located on the Khor Musa Channel, is the fourth site. It stores and shifts products from the Abadan Refinery, and serves as an engineering and jetty construction hub for Iran.

All these sites were targeted by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war and severely crippled the Iranian economy. It makes them obvious potential target for Israel and will likely have an impact on the global oil market to varying degrees.

The most devastating Israeli strike carrying global implications would be an attack on Kharg Oil Terminal. Such an attack will likely result in a short-term crude price spike of around 5% as it carries the potential for international disruption, primarily to Iran's exports to China - the world's largest importer of oil.

On the other hand, an attack on Hormozgan oil facilities will likely be more about symbolism given that many of the province's terminals are largely unused due to sanctions, creaking infrastructure and years of Western sanctions on Iranian oil. Israel may attack these to send a message.

Should Abadan Refinery be targeted, it will largely break Iran's domestic fuel supply chain but perhaps does not carry any significant international implications. However, should the nearby Mahshahr Oil Terminal be subject to an Israeli strike, again both crude and product supply chain issues will likely arise.

If these real-time geopolitical developments were clouding the market a decade ago, most observers would factor in a double-digit near-term uptick in oil prices. However, despite all what the current year has thrown at the oil market, prices - using Brent as a benchmark - are still nearly $10 lower than October last year, and at one point hit lows last seen in 2021 earlier this month.

That's because unlike a decade ago, oil production outside the Middle East has steadily risen. The U.S. is currently the world's largest crude oil producer. Production in Brazil, Canada, Guyana and Norway is also at record levels. Furthermore, the Saudis are holding back substantial spare capacity.

All of this is occurring at a time of uncertain oil demand and global macroeconomic challenges. Even the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) - considered to be among the more bullish demand forecasters out in the market - now expects lower demand growth both in 2024 and 2025.

As does the International Energy Agency (IEA), though both continue to offer vastly divergent oil demand growth forecasts for 2024 of less than 1 million bpd in the agency's case, and just over 2 million bpd in OPEC's case.

So while geopolitical tension in the Middle East may not be new, today's oil market doesn't even remotely resemble that of the last decade. Always remember that when oil futures reflect a geopolitical ""risk premium"", it is based on fears of a potentially imminent loss of supply as is the case at the moment.

Once the loss does happen - say following a potential Israeli attack - it morphs from being a risk to market reality and corrective mechanisms kick in both on the supply as well as pricing side. That's unless there is further loss of supply which is the unknown variable for the market.

Ultimately, elevated tension between Iran and Israel and the wider conflict in Gaza and Lebanon is something the oil market could well do without, but is one that it currently appears capable of handling with all eyes now on what Israel will do next."

Like many, I have watched in horror as countless friends in my former home of North Carolina have been unable to reach their loved ones.

Hurricane Helene wiped out communities and infrastructure in the Southeast, claiming more than 160 lives as one of the 10 deadliest storms in U.S. history, according to USA Today. AccuWeather estimates the damage will range between $95 billion and $110 billion.

It will be a long recovery, and the region is in need of support. To make sure your assistance gets to those who need it, be sure to check the credentials of potential organizations and use caution when donating to individuals to avoid any potential scams.

A few charities accepting Helene-specific donations include: the American Red Cross, World Central Kitchen and Airbnb.org, which helps people find a temporary place to stay.

Alice Walton, America's richest woman, just reported her largest known charitable gift to date, including $249 million to help fund a new medical school in her name in her family's hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. Forbes estimates that Walton, the only daughter of Walmart cofounder Sam Walton, has now given away $1.5 billion in her lifetime, making her one of the 30 biggest lifetime givers nationwide.

Iran fired rockets at Israel Tuesday, the Israeli military said, potentially escalating the war in the Middle East as Iran took responsibility for the attack and warned it is only a ""first wave."" In a statement read on state television, Iran said the attack was retaliation for the killings of multiple Hezbollah leaders, according to the Associated Press.

Aerospace and defense stocks reached all-time highs, a grim market reaction to the latest escalation of tensions in the Middle East, as the Israeli military reported missile strikes from Iran a day after Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon. Defense stocks typically see gains during times of heightened conflict as the companies' revenues rely heavily on U.S. government contracts.

Fred Thiel, the CEO of major bitcoin miner MARA, spoke with Forbes about how it is adapting to the wave of smaller miners gravitating towards artificial intelligence, as well as U.S. politics and the outlook for the crypto mining industry. He says that retail investors give small competitors too much credit for AI plays that will not pay off for years.

Since porn entrepreneur Leonid Radvinsky purchased OnlyFans in 2018, it has gone from being a little-known U.K.-based company to earning $485 million in profits on $1.3 billion in revenue in 2023. Its popularity unleashed a massive payday for Radvinsky, who debuted on this year's Forbes 400 list with an estimated net worth of $3.8 billion.

Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates has long ranked as either the richest or second-richest person on the annual Forbes 400 list, but even with his $107 billion fortune, he dropped to No. 9 this year, down from No. 6 a year ago. A major reason for his fall in the rankings is his 2021 divorce from Melinda French Gates, his wife of 27 years.

Less than 2,500 people live in the small town of Spruce Pine, North Carolina, but it's also home to several rare mines for ultra-pure quartz critical to semiconductor production. Operations have been shut down for more than five days due to impacts from Hurricane Helene, according to the News & Observer, but even when mines can reopen, extensive damage to surrounding roads and rail lines is expected to disrupt global supply chains.

In his latest feud with a government official, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has taken issue with the Federal Aviation Administration over launch date delays and fines related to alleged SpaceX violations, escalating to direct attacks on agency administrator Michael Whitaker. The dustup could preview how Musk might tackle government efficiency while working in a possible Trump Administration, an idea the former president has floated.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, faced off in a mostly polite yet policy-heavy vice presidential debate Tuesday night. But one of the more tense moments was a heated back-and-forth related to the false claims Vance spread about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, leading CBS News to cut Vance and Walz's mics.

MORE: Forbes recently looked at how the two candidates compare on assets like real estate, pensions, salaries and more. Vance's earnings from his bestseller Hillbilly Elegy helped him amass an estimated $10 million compared to former public school teacher Walz's wealth of about $1 million.

A massive dockworker strike that began Tuesday comes ahead of the holiday season and as policy makers look to turn the page on inflation, but experts are split on whether it will have a major impact on the economy. The strike could cost the U.S. economy between $3 billion and $4.5 billion daily, according to estimates from Jefferies and JPMorgan, but significant fallout would only occur if the strike lasts more than the ""base case"" of a ""few days,"" Bank of America analysts led by Nathan Gee noted.

TOPLINE Palantir, which builds software to help other businesses gather, manage and analyze their data, at first with secretive government agencies like the CIA and now also with commercial customers, had a banner year.

Palantir took off, with annual revenue increasing more than 20% over the last year to $2.5 billion, and it flipped the switch on profitability -- going from a net loss of $50 million in June 2023 to net income of $400 million a year later. The record year was capped by its addition to the S&P 500 in September.

The company's growth is in part because many of its data software products meshed with the wave of AI hype.

No surprise then that shares are up 134% over the past year, making Palantir the most expensive stock in the S&P in terms of revenue multiples -- more so even than chip design darling Nvidia. Palantir's meteoric rise has earned CEO Alex Karp a spot on The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans for the first time, worth an estimated $3.6 billion, thanks to his Palantir stake and $1 billion or so in cash from stock sales as of September 1, the day we finalized net worths for our list.

But should it be that expensive, trading at a market valuation that's 36 times its annual revenue? Analysts aren't sure: only five of the 20 that cover Palantir give the company a ""buy"" rating, with the remainder split between hold and sell ratings.

D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria drew a parallel between the company and Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, when the EV company was trading at all-time highs in 2021. ""Tesla for a very long period of time traded well above any valuation or comparable metric that you could point to. The reason was people were really excited about the mission and about the prospects.""

WHY IT MATTERS ""The Forbes 400, the definitive ranking of America's richest people, is important because enormous wealth comes with immense power, and the public should know who is doing what with their power,"" says Forbes reporter Phoebe Liu.

""As such, Karp's addition to The Forbes 400 and Palantir's too-high valuation show that what he and his company stand for -- Western values, American defense and artificial intelligence -- are especially relevant in today's economic, cultural and geopolitical landscape. It's worth watching what happens with the ever-controversial, ever-secretive (despite being publicly traded!) firm in the coming months and years.""

LGBTQ+ people who undergo ""conversion therapy"" are more likely to experience poor mental health than those who haven't, a new study found. While scientifically discredited, the practice is still prevalent in some states:

149: The number of participants studied who had experienced conversion therapy aimed at altering their sexual orientation

23: The number of states that ban conversion therapy for minors, including Washington D.C.

1,320: The number of conversion therapy practices across 48 states and Washington, D.C., according to 2023 research from the Trevor Project

A slew of new retirement rules and changes to tax law will affect almost everyone. For instance, starting in 2026, employees 50 and older who are deemed 'high-earning' will only be able to make catch-up contributions to an after-tax Roth account. And if you have money left over in a 529 college savings plan, a law went into effect this year allowing penalty-free rollovers from 529 plans to a Roth IRA.

Will Ford's Stock Recover,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/02/will-fords-stock-recover/,2024-10-02T12:07:48Z,"Ford stock has declined by about 10% year-to-date, compared to fellow U.S. auto giant GM which has gained close to 29% over the same period. The underperformance of Ford comes despite a reasonably healthy financial performance in recent years, with revenues and cash flows expanding. Ford's valuation is very attractive, with the stock trading at a mere 6x 2024 consensus earnings.

While Ford stock has actually risen in the last 3-years, the increase has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 137% in 2021, -42% in 2022, and 16% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could F face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

We value Ford stock at about $14 per share, which is around 30% ahead of the current market price. See our analysis on Ford Valuation: Expensive Or Cheap for more details on what's driving our price estimate for Ford. For more information on Ford's business model and revenue trends, check out our dashboard on Ford Revenue: How Ford Makes Money. So why exactly is Ford stock underperforming and what are some of the trends that could drive a recovery?

Higher Warranty Costs

Ford recently posted a weaker-than-expected set of Q2 2024 results. Adjusted profit for the quarter came in at $0.47 per share, below consensus estimates and a 35% decline from the $0.72 the company reported in Q2 2023. This is in contrast with GM which beat expectations. Although Ford saw revenues grow by about 6% over the last quarter, its earnings were hit by an increase in warranty repair costs amid issues with cars built in 2021 or earlier. Ford has faced multiple quality issues with its vehicles in the past years driving up the warranty costs. Moreover, these costs are sometimes recognized suddenly, without warning, leading to weaker-than-expected results. For Q2 for example, earnings fell almost 30% short of estimates as Ford's $800 million spike in costs caught investors by surprise. Now Ford is working on improving the quality of its vehicles, with the company noting that it was now testing vehicles to failure in order to discover quality problems. However, the process could take over a year to reflect on warranty cost improvements.

Rocky EV Transition, Mixed Economic Outlook

Separately, there have also been concerns about the demand environment. Ford saw its overall volumes for Q2 rise by just about 1% year-over-year amid high interest rates which have made vehicle financing expensive. Consumer spending has also been easing in the U.S. The average price paid for new vehicles declined by 3% for the first six months of this year, compared to last year, per research firm J.D. Power meaning that the pricing power that automakers saw post the Covid-19 pandemic is easing. Separately, Ford's plans of transitioning to EVs have hardly been smooth. Ford's Model E division, which sells electric vehicles, lost $1.3 billion at an operating level, compared to the traditional auto segments that earned a combined total of $3.9 billion. Ford has also pivoted its EV plans, moving away from larger vehicles and instead focusing on a smaller next-generation EV platform. These larger SUVs will now have hybrid powertrains instead. This led to Ford taking a non-cash charge to the tune of $400 million relating to the sunk costs.

Catalysts For A Recovery

However, we think there is an upside for Ford stock. One primary driver is the continued strong performance of its truck division, especially the flagship F-150 series. Sales of the F-Series trucks reached 199,463 vehicles in Q2 2024, marking a 30% sequential increase. Hybrid F-150 sales also saw a 38% year-over-year growth, with 33,674 units sold, reflecting consumer demand for a broader powertrain lineup. Trucks, with their higher margins, remain Ford's most lucrative segment, and sustained strength here could support profitability in the coming quarters.

Ford's potential to boost its capital return program could also add further to shareholder value The company's cash flows have been strong, with free cash flow generation for 2023 reaching approximately $6.8 billion, significantly surpassing initial projections. Ford has been paying dividends of about $0.15 per quarter, along with a special dividend of $0.18 in March. Given the robust cash flows, there is potential for additional special dividends. At present, Ford plans to distribute 40% to 50% of its annual free cash flow to shareholders. This year, the company has raised its adjusted free cash flow guidance to a range of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, up from the initial outlook of $6 billion to $7 billion.

Additionally, Ford's pivot in its EV strategy, which now focuses on a balanced mix of gas, hybrid, and electric vehicles could allow it to cash in on evolving consumer preferences without overspending on costly EV development. Slower industry-wide EV growth could also give Ford a chance to improve its profitability in the traditional segments as it invests in refining its electric vehicle offerings. Additionally, the market for hybrid vehicles is picking up, with Ford seeing its hybrid sales expand considerably, rising 56% year-over-year to a new quarterly record of 53,822 units in the U.S. for Q2. This should bode well for the company's profitability in the interim.

The recent monetary easing in the U.S. could also bode well for automakers like Ford. The Fed's 50 basis point rate cut earlier this month marked the first interest rate cut in close to four years. With the benchmark federal funds rate standing at 4.75% to 5% post the cut, there remains room for the central bank to lower interest rates further. Check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed's next move?

While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy following rate cuts, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes."
"Mortgage Rates Today: October 2, 2024 -- Rates Remain Fairly Steady",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-10-02-24/,2024-10-02T11:59:00Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

Today, the mortgage interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.70%, according to Curinos, while the average rate on a 15-year mortgage is 5.74%. On a 30-year jumbo mortgage, the average rate is 6.73%.

Today's average rate on a 30-year mortgage (fixed-rate) inched up to 6.70% from 6.65% yesterday. One week ago, the 30-year fixed was 6.68%.

The APR on a 30-year fixed is 6.71%. This time last week, it was 6.67%. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

At today's interest rate of 6.70%, borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $100,000 will pay $645 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included), the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. In total interest, you'd pay $132,181 over the life of the loan.

Today's 15-year mortgage (fixed-rate) is 5.74%, up 0.03 percentage point from the previous week. The same time last week, the 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage was at 5.71%.

The APR on a 15-year fixed is 5.77%. It was 5.72% a week earlier.

A 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage with today's interest rate of 5.74% will cost $830 per month in principal and interest on a $100,000 mortgage (not including taxes and insurance). In this scenario, borrowers would pay approximately $49,368 in total interest.

On a 30-year jumbo, the average interest rate is 6.73%, lower than it was at this time last week. The average rate was 6.74% at this time last week.

Borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage with today's interest rate of 6.73% will pay $647 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. That means that on a $750,000 loan, the monthly principal and interest payment would be around $4,855 and you'd pay around $997,627 in total interest over the life of the loan.

The Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy -- including its interest rate hikes, which it's using to restrain inflation -- is the primary factor that's pushing long-term mortgage rates higher. The state of the economy and housing market also affects mortgage rates. As for what interest rate the lender might offer you, this depends on your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and credit score, both of which indicate your risk as a borrower.

Related: Mortgage Rate Forecast & Trends For 2024

Shop around and talk to various lenders to get a sense of each company's mortgage loan offerings and services. Don't go with the first lender quote you receive; instead, compare the best mortgage rate quotes to get a deal. In particular, consider what fees they charge, what fees they're willing to waive and what closing assistance they might provide. Make sure any special offers or discounts don't come at the cost of a higher mortgage rate.

Be sure to apply with each lender within a 45-day window. During this window, you can have multiple lenders pull your credit history without additional impact on your credit score.

Mortgage rates remain elevated, and the nation's housing supply remains limited. The low inventory is preventing house prices from dropping. Meanwhile, the combination of high mortgage rates and appreciated home values will continue to present an obstacle for many prospective homebuyers seeking affordable housing.

Multiple factors affect the interest rate for a mortgage, including the economy's overall health, benchmark interest rates and borrower-specific factors.

The Federal Reserve's rate decisions and inflation can influence rates to move higher or lower. Although the Fed raising rates doesn't directly cause mortgage rates to rise, an increase to its benchmark interest rate makes it more expensive for banks to lend money to consumers. Conversely, rates tend to decrease during periods of rate cuts and cooling inflation.

Home buyers can make several moves to improve their finances and qualify for competitive rates. One is having a good or excellent credit score, which ranges from 670 to 850. Another is maintaining a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio below 43%, which implies less risk of being unable to afford the monthly mortgage payment.

Further, making a minimum 20% down payment can help you avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI) on conventional home loans. If you can afford the larger monthly payment, 15-year home loans have lower rates than a 30-year term."
Project 2025 Offers A False Choice: Climate Action Vs. Economic Growth,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/margooge/2024/10/02/project-2025-offers-a-false-choice-climate-action-vs-economic-growth/,2024-10-02T10:14:04Z,"When Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for a future Trump administration, came up in the presidential debate, Donald Trump equivocated, calling some of the ideas ""good"" and others ""bad.""

It's impossible to say exactly what policies a second Trump administration would pursue, but Trump embraced The Heritage Foundation's ""A Mandate for Leadership"" proposal in his first year in office. And in April 2022 he said Heritage was ""going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do.""

One of Project 2025's most alarming proposals targets public health as it would strip the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of its authority to set and enforce environmental standards. Before EPA was created, our country suffered pollution so bad that rivers caught on fire and our cities were choked by smog. EPA protections have cleaned up our air and water for 50 years and saved countless lives - the Clean Air Act alone prevented an estimated 230,000premature deaths in 2020.

These environmental protections are particularly important for low-income and marginalized communities that have historically borne the brunt of pollution and environmental degradation. Biden's EPA climate policies focus on public health and environmental justice by strengthening emissions standards and regulating air pollution, and are on track to save 200,000 lives by 2050.

Rolling back these protections, as Project 2025 proposes, would reverse these gains and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable Americans, causing 2,100 early deaths by 2030 by increasing air pollution - nearly as much as the total U.S. military deaths in the Afghanistan war.

Project 2025 targets climate initiatives implemented under the Biden administration. The authors falsely claim that EPA regulations are ""burdensome"" and stifle economic growth, particularly in transportation and energy. But that's not true. EPA policies drive innovation and growth.

In reality, the very rules Project 2025 seeks to dismantle have catalyzed unprecedented economic growth across America. EPA's climate policies -- combined with incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act -- have sparked unprecedented investment, particularly in clean energy and transportation. As of 2024, annual investment in new manufacturing hit $225 billion, a record high even after adjusting for inflation.

The electric vehicle market is a prime example. EPA vehicle tailpipe emissions standards, along with IRA incentives, have spurred $312 billion in EV and battery manufacturing, making the United States a global leader in clean transportation investments. Fueled by the incentives, the U.S. EV market grew 40% in 2023, to 1.4 million units.

These investments have tangible economic impacts, making the shift to clean technologies an engine of job creation and economic revitalization. EV and battery manufacturing has created 195,000 high-paying jobs from factories in Michigan and Ohio to tech development in California, directly boosting local economies in areas hit hardest by the decline of traditional manufacturing.

The IRA's economic benefits are so obvious that in July, 18 Republican Members of Congress wrote the Speaker of the House urging him not to repeal IRA provisions, saying ""energy tax credits have spurred innovation, incentivized investment, and created good jobs in many parts of the country.""

Biden administration policies have also supercharged job growth in the renewable energy sector, cutting fossil fuel dependence and reshaping the energy landscape to benefit our environment and economy. The solar industry added nearly 16,000 jobs in 2023 to hit 280,000 total jobs, the highest level in history, and wind turbine service technician is the fastest-growing occupation in America. Meanwhile utility-scale solar and onshore wind are the cheapest forms of electricity generation in the U.S., at $27-$29 per megawatt-hour. Compare that to oil and coal products, which along with oil and gas extraction have the highest indirect impact on inflation of any commodity in the U.S. economy

By 2023, renewables accounted for 21% of U.S. electricity generation, outpacing coal, which dropped to 16%. The Biden administration's policies, which include federal tax credits for solar and wind projects, are ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in the global clean energy transition.

Clean energy is the future: It's cheaper and cleaner than fossil fuels, providing long-term economic benefits that far outweigh the short-term profits of oil, gas, and coal. Failing to recognize this will drive our economy into economic stagnation - Moody's Analytics forecasts Project 2025 would trigger a recession in less than a year. That's not even considering Project 2025's climate change impacts, which would add 4.9 million metric tons of annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, about the same as Germany emits every year.

Today, the United States' global economic competitiveness is at stake, more than ever. Following Project 2025's prescription risks the future of EVs, renewable energy, and green jobs. That would cede America's progress on national climate goals and hand over the global energy economy to China and Europe.

Clean energy accounted for 10% of global GDP growth in 2023, and global clean energy investment hit $1.8 trillion last year. America can tap this potential -- unless we let Project 2025 derail our progress.

China is already the world's biggest EV producer with about 60% of global sales and is also the largest EV exporter, accounting for 19% of EU sales. In clean energy, China invested $890 billion in clean energy in 2023, almost as much as total global fossil fuel investment. Falling behind in the clean economic race means losing out on trillions of dollars in future market opportunities and millions of lost jobs in booming industries.

The core environmental argument of Project 2025 -- that we must choose between climate action and economic growth -- is a false choice. It simply doesn't hold up.

Between 1970 and 2019, the Clean Air Act reduced air pollution from vehicles, factories, and other sources by 77%. If Project 2025's authors were correct, those historic environmental gains should have cost grave economic contraction. Instead, during that same time, U.S. GDP grew 285% and job growth rose 223%. By comparison, implementing Project 2025's energy provisions would cost 1.7 million lost jobs by 2030 while imposing $32 billion in new energy costs on American households.

Biden's climate policies are not a burden -- they are the foundation of America's - and the world's - green future. These policies have driven innovation, created jobs, improved public health, and ensured America remains at the forefront of the global clean energy transition.

Project 2025's attempt to dismantle these critical protections and reverse decades of progress is wrong - we cannot afford to turn back the clock on climate action. The economic stakes are too high, the environmental risks too great, and the opportunities for growth and prosperity too vast to ignore. The future belongs to those who invest in clean energy, transportation and manufacturing, innovation, and sustainability.

Biden's climate policies have laid the foundation for that future, and we must embrace it, not scrap it."
Where America's Richest People Live: Forbes 400 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicahunter-hart/2024/10/02/where-americas-richest-people-live-forbes-400-2024/,2024-10-02T10:14:02Z,"Almost a quarter of all the wealth on The Forbes 400 is held by residents of one state. Two others tie for second for the first time ever.

alifornia is a symbol of wealth, famous for the luxuries of Hollywood and the riches of Silicon Valley. So it's perhaps no surprise that the world's fifth-largest economy is home to more of the 400 wealthiest people in the U.S. than any other state by far -- and has been for 34 years, since overtaking New York in 1991.

The Golden State is home to 83 members of this year's Forbes 400 list, four fewer than last year and nine fewer than a decade ago, but the state is still home to more than one out of five 400 members. As a group, these Californians are worth around triple the $489 billion the state's 92 members were worth a decade ago. But it's not the only hub for the three-comma club. Ranking behind California are New York and Florida, with 54 list members each, followed by Texas, with 43. Those four states are the most populous in the country, holding a third of all Americans -- but nearly 60% of the richest ones. The combined fortune of their 234 billionaires totals $3.3 trillion.

California's days at the top may be numbered. Florida's rise continues; the Sunshine State has eight more Forbes 400 members this year -- enough to tie the Empire State for the first time. Some of the recent gains are due to folks leaving their higher-tax hometowns for Florida's lower rates, like former Seattle resident Jeff Bezos and onetime Chicagoan Ken Griffin. Five New Yorkers have moved to Florida in the past decade. Those transplants include the state's most famous resident, Donald Trump, who returns to the 400 list this year thanks to Trump Media & Technology Group, the social media company he took public in March. New York, meanwhile, has eight fewer 400 members than last year as the state's richest couldn't keep up. Among the drop-offs: Wesley Edens and Richard LeFrak.

A handful of states have only one Forbes 400 member, including Maine (Susan Alfond), Oregon (Phil Knight) and Kentucky (Tamara Gustavson). Ten states aren't represented at all on the 400, including Alabama, Minnesota and Vermont. It was harder than ever to make the list this year due to a record-high cutoff of $3.3 billion, up from last year's $2.9 billion and eons away from the median American family's net worth of $192,900, per the U.S. Federal Reserve. That was enough to bump Mississippi off the map as its richest residents, James and Thomas Duff, though richer than last year, barely missed the cut with net worths of roughly $3.25 billion each.

Net worths are as of September 1, 2024

Ernest Garcia II, the largest shareholder of online used car sales platform Carvana and Arizona's richest resident, wasn't born in the Grand Canyon State, but his ties there stretch back decades. He attended the University of Arizona and developed real estate in Phoenix in the 1980s (a job that later brought him a criminal fraud conviction, thanks to his small role in the scandal surrounding the collapse of one of his lenders, Lincoln Savings & Loan). Other prominent Arizona listees include U-Haul heir Mark Shoen ($5.2 billion) and Arturo Moreno ($5 billion), who owns the L.A. Angels baseball team in neighboring California.

Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual fund behemoth, is responsible for three members of The Forbes 400: CEO Abigail Johnson, the state's wealthiest resident and America's sixth-richest woman, and her siblings Edward and Elizabeth Johnson. Their family frequently donates to Boston-area charities and to Harvard, where Johnson got an MBA. Other prominent Bay State listees include telecom billionaire and Massachusetts philanthropist Robert Hale Jr. ($5.8 billion) and Robert Kraft ($11.8 billion), who found fortune in paper and packaging, and fame as the owner of the NFL's New England Patriots.

S. Truett Cathy (d. 2014) founded Chick-fil-A in an Atlanta area mall in 1967; it's now spread to 48 states and his three children are Georgia's richest residents. The Peach State is also home to Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank ($8.9 billion), private equity mogul and 400 newcomer Neal Aronson ($4.1 billion) and two more notable heirs: Gary Rollins ($6.8 billion), who chairs the pest control company his family founded in 1948, Rollins, Inc.; and Jim Kennedy ($6.6 billion), who chairs the media and automotive conglomerate his grandfather founded in 1898, Cox Enterprises.

The Silver State's highest roller hails, fittingly, from the Las Vegas Strip: Miriam Adelson, whose fortune comes from the Las Vegas Sands casino company that her late husband founded in 1988. Two other Nevada listees who hail from the gaming industry are brothers Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta, the UFC cofounders who also inherited their father's casino business Red Rock Resorts in 1993 and took it public in 2016. The state also boasts fortunes in sectors like aerospace-defense (Sierra Nevada Corp.'s Eren and Fatih Ozmen, $4 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively) and fast food (Panda Express' Andrew and Peggy Cherng, $3.7 billion each).

The richest Pennsylvanians are together worth $126 billion, roughly equal to the Keystone State's total annual government spending. Wealthiest resident Jeff Yass cofounded trading firm Susquehanna International Group, headquartered on the Main Line. It owns an estimated 15% of TikTok parent company ByteDance. Yass is a Republican megadonor who often opens his wallet for state and local elections, everything from county judicial races to Philly's city council election. His Susquehanna cofounder Arthur Dantchik ($12.3 billion) is also a Pennsylvania resident on The Forbes 400 list, as is Victoria Mars ($11.9 billion), heir to the Mars candy and pet food empire, and Jeffrey Lurie ($5.3 billion), owner of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles.

Chicago is home to the youngest member of The Forbes 400, Lukas Walton, who is one of the eight grandchildren of Walmart cofounder Sam Walton. Aged 38, he's one of two listees under 40 (the other being New York-based venture capitalist Josh Kushner). Several list members from the Hyatt hotel brand's Pritzker family are also breezing around the Windy City, including J.B. Pritzker ($3.7 billion), the state's billionaire governor. Others in Illinois made their riches through industries like meat processing (Steve Lavin, $5.4 billion, and Joseph Grendys, $4.2 billion) and finance (Byron Trott, $3.7 billion, and Mark Walter, $6 billion).

Musk -- the richest person in the U.S. for the third year in a row -- is all-in on the Lone Star State, announcing this year that he's moving his companies SpaceX and X there from California. Texas is increasingly seen as a swing state, but Musk made his own political allegiances clear in July when he endorsed Donald Trump for president in a post on X. Texas produces more oil and natural gas than any other state, so perhaps unsurprisingly, nearly a third of its listees made their fortunes in energy, including Randa Duncan Williams ($8.6 billion; Enterprise Products Partners) and Kelcy Warren ($6.7 billion; Energy Transfer).

The Sunshine State keeps attracting big wealth. When Bezos recently relocated from Washington state, he spent $234 million on three homes on Indian Creek, the gated man-made island in Miami Beach dubbed the ""Billionaire Bunker."" Nearly 30% of Florida's listees made their fortunes in finance and investments, including the second-richest Floridian, Ken Griffin ($43 billion), who made headlines in 2022 for moving his family and the headquarters of his hedge fund Citadel there from Chicago. The second-most common industry that enriched the wealthiest Floridians is food and beverage, from which hails Subway's Elisabeth DeLuca ($8.6 billion) and LaCroix sparkling water's Nick Caporella ($4.1 billion).

The world's financial capital is still a finance billionaire hub. Nearly two-thirds of the Empire State's listees made their fortunes in the sector, including Michael Bloomberg, the former NYC mayor who started his career on Wall Street in 1966 at the investment bank Salomon Brothers, then made billions through financial information and media company Bloomberg LP. The state's second-richest resident, Julia Koch ($74.2 billion), is originally from Iowa and owes her fortune to Kansas-based conglomerate Koch, Inc., but has lived in the Big Apple for four decades. In June, she and her children bought a 15% stake in the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and WNBA's New York Liberty for nearly $700 million. Other notable New Yorkers on The Forbes 400 include George Soros ($7.2 billion), Ralph Lauren ($9.4 billion) and Bill Ackman ($9.1 billion).

Hollywood and Silicon Valley have made many Californians rich, but none more than Mark Zuckerberg, who officially resides in Palo Alto, though these days spends plenty of time at his 1,450-acre compound in Kauai, Hawaii. Nearly half of California's Forbes 400 wealth stems from tech moguls like Zuckerberg, including Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin ($136 billion and $130 billion, respectively), Nvidia's Jensen Huang ($104 billion) and Broadcom's Henry Samueli ($16.9 billion). But entertainment moguls like David Geffen ($8.5 billion) and Steven Spielberg ($5.3 billion) also call the Golden State home, as do real estate barons such as Donald Bren ($18.9 billion) and Edward Roski Jr ($7.8 billion), and private equity moguls like KKR cofounder George Roberts ($15.5 billion) and Jim Coulter ($4.9 billion)."
The Future Of Work: New Skills For Thriving In The AI-Driven Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyrubin/2024/10/02/the-future-of-work-new-skills-for-thriving-in-the-ai-driven-economy/,2024-10-02T04:16:38Z,"With insights from Shea Gopaul, John Frankel, Matt Greenfield, Kamal Mistry, Reza Safai, and Nick Bostrom

The IMF predicts that AI will affect 40% of global jobs, either through replacement or complementing human roles. Despite the potential disruption, AI is opening doors to new opportunities in STEM, healthcare, finance, entertainment, manufacturing and energy. The key challenge now is how governments, businesses, and educational institutions can collaborate to ensure that workers are prepared for this fast-evolving landscape.

Addressing the Global Skills Crisis

AI's global impact presents both opportunities and challenges, particularly in developing regions. Shea Gopaul, IOE Permanent Representative to the UN, highlights the global ""skills crisis,"" compounded by 2.6 billion people lacking internet connectivity, which exacerbates the digital divide.

Gopaul stresses that ""more action is needed."" The private sector must play a pivotal role in advancing internet connectivity, governance, and digital literacy. ""We need to foster trust and adopt a human-centric approach,"" she asserts.

Public-Private Partnerships as a Solution

Gopaul highlights the power of partnerships in addressing the skills gap. ""Apprenticeships, one of the oldest forms of collaboration, align education with current labor market needs,"" she says. Through initiatives like the Global Apprenticeship Network (GAN), businesses, governments, and institutions can reskill and upskill workers to meet evolving industry demands. ""Collaboration between the public and private sectors has never been more crucial.""

Future-Ready Skills for AI-Driven Industries

Gopaul underscores the role of multinational corporations in preparing workers for AI-driven industries through training in Generative AI and enhancing human skills like adaptability and collaboration. ""It won't be AI taking jobs; it will be people with AI skills,"" she explains. Job creation and AI skills development are paramount if we are to eliminate poverty.

Ensuring Compliance and Governance in AI-Powered Industries

AI is helping streamline tasks in industries like finance, such as risk monitoring and compliance reporting. While automation increases efficiency, human oversight remains crucial to ensure regulatory standards are upheld. Businesses must balance automation and human judgment to innovate responsibly and navigate legal and ethical challenges.

Opportunities in AI-Driven Sectors

John Frankel, founder of ff Venture Capital, highlights a shift in focus: ""The conversation has moved from being an AI startup to how any startup integrates AI processes to reduce costs and scale efficiently. The challenge for existing businesses is that new ones automatically start with AI processes -- such as ad generation, sales automation, code development, and quality assurance.""

On job loss, Frankel notes: ""The Luddite perspective that technology destroys jobs is very seductive, as the jobs lost are easier to grasp than those gained. But look where we are: tight unemployment in a deeply technological society."" He adds, ""Robotics and advanced AI applications will create jobs in areas that are harder to see, but the technology should be embraced, not rejected.""

Looking ahead, Frankel foresees major developments: ""There will be a huge increase in the deployment of technology into US manufacturing and energy sectors, creating massive efficiencies and many new jobs. The economy will be better for this.""

Innovating with AI in Immersive Storytelling

AI's impact on the entertainment industry is a clear example of how it is reshaping jobs and required skills. Volumetric video, which captures performances in 3D, is being transformed by AI to expand its applications and lower production costs. According to Kamal Mistry, ""AI enables us to capture volumetric video in more varied environments, opening up entire genres such as concerts, sports, and even training scenarios."" This shift is creating new career opportunities in content creation and interactive media.

AI-Driven Innovation: Merging Creativity with Technology

Reza Safai, filmmaker, actor, and founder of MASSIVE, highlights that creativity will remain indispensable in an AI-driven future. While AI can assist in the creative process, Safai emphasizes that pushing boundaries will still depend on human insight and innovation. ""The skills that will keep you relevant in the future aren't purely technical,"" he explains. ""It's about learning to think differently, to see possibilities where others see limitations.""

Educating Tomorrow's Workforce for AI-Driven Industries

As industries like entertainment continue to evolve with AI, preparing the workforce must start with education. Matt Greenfield, managing partner of an education-focused venture capital firm, stresses the need for educational systems to adapt. ""Schools need to figure out how to help students productively use AI in group projects. In our jobs, we will all be refining our work in iterative processes incorporating insights from multiple AI models and multiple humans.""

Greenfield emphasizes that the most critical skills for tomorrow's workforce won't just be technical but human-centered. ""The most important skills for most workers will be non-technical: the ability to ask catalytic questions, empathize, lead, solve multidisciplinary problems, and unlearn when they have been wrong.""

Next Steps: Preparing for the AI-Driven Workforce

To ensure a smooth transition into the AI-driven future of work, all stakeholders must take active roles in shaping how industries adapt and evolve. Here are actionable steps to consider:

The path to the future of work lies not just in mastering the technologies that will shape industries but in fostering the human-centered skills that will enable workers to thrive alongside AI. Creativity, empathy, critical thinking, and ethical decision-making are the qualities that will set professionals apart in the AI-augmented workforce.

As Nick Bostrom puts it, ""The future is big enough for both humans and digital minds to flourish, but we must work hard to ensure that relations between them remain friendly."" By embracing AI's advances while maintaining ethical oversight and fostering human-centered skills, we ensure that AI serves as a tool for empowerment, not disruption."
Educating for Europe's Unique Style Of Economic Growth,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanpenprase/2024/10/01/educating-for-europes-unique-style-of-economic-growth/,2024-10-01T22:59:44Z,"Europe's troubling lack of economic growth has been a subject of concern in widely read articles and an influential European Commission report headed by Mario Draghi, former president of the European Central Bank. The slow economic growth, only 0.5% in 2023 across Europe, compared to 2.5% in the US, and low investment in new technologies, has created an ""existential"" threat to Europe, and threatens its ""reason for being,"" according to Draghi. GDP growth has lagged behind the US in 7 of the past 10 years, and overall productivity in Europe is only 75% of US productivity. Many companies within Europe are beginning to relocate to the US to enable faster growth. A recent McKinsey report reports how US companies are outcompeting European corporations, with 1.8 times more R&D spending, 1.6 times more investment and 2.5 times more market capitalization in the US compared to Europe in 2022.

Europe's lagging behind the US and other dynamic economies arises from a slow recovery from the pandemic, lower emphasis on digital technologies, and a lack of investment in transformative technologies such as AI, according to a report by the European Central Bank. Europe's industrial policy strategy stresses radical expansion of R&D expenditures, more expansive investment in new technologies, and regulatory reform. The new Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) is intended to boost research and manufacturing in key areas such as digital technologies, AI, clean energy technologies, and biotechnology.

Europe's approaches to technological advances differ substantially from those in the US. For example, AI development in Europe is regulated by the 2024 EU Artifical Intelligence Act, which includes an Intelligence Board, regulatory sandboxes, and AI monitoring to detect and reduce how AI might alter the behavior of people, exploit vulnerable populations, and cause other forms of harm. The EU Digital strategy for future development of AI is creating ""AI Factories"" within the EU, shared datasets to promote new startup companies, and a dedicated AI office for enforcement of EU policies. This approach is one that appears to balance growth with a concern for social impacts of new technologies.

While the statistics show Europe's economy as lagging in some measures, it is also leading in others that track sustainability and inclusion. Europe emits less than half of the CO emissions per capita as the US, has a much lower rate of income inequality and a smaller population below the poverty line, and a higher life expectancy than the US. Income inequality in Europe, as measured by the Gini index is only 29.6, compared to 41.2 for the United States and 35.7 for China. The per capita GDP in Europe was indeed 27 percent less than in the US in 2022, but half of the gap reflects a difference in productivity and another half due to individual choices to work fewer hours in a lifetime than in the US. In the EU, only 36% of national income goes to the top 10%, compared to 49% in the US in 2022, according to the World Inequality Database. The Draghi report acknowledges the need to account for Europe's unique social fabric, and suggests avoiding ""hyperglobalization"" that can shift the balance of power between labor and employers.

Europe's unique educational system also arises from planning and policy to promote larger societal goals. The EU has developed numerous exchange programs between universities and industry, building on the 1987 COMETT program, which builds cooperative programs between universities and companies for developing and applying new technologies, and the 1987 ERASMUS program for inter-university cooperation. The 2021 ERASMUS+ program further expanded student mobility, reaching nearly 16 million students in 2024. Additional strategic education policies are being developed to streamline differences between countries, increase graduation rates across the continent and build additional programs for employment within the EU. Despite these measures, job vacancy rates in the eurozone are at an all-time high of 3% in 2023, Europe produces 20 percent fewer STEM graduates per thousand than in the US, and faces a declining working age population. To develop new talent in emerging technologies and increase Europe's shrinking workforce, new approaches will be needed.

Spain provides a specific case that illustrates the tensions between economic growth and traditional approaches in education and business. Spain's growth rate of 2.1 percent in 2023 is much higher than the 0.7 percent rate in the Eurozone, and the country has added over a million jobs per year in 2023 and 2024. The Spanish entrepreneurial ecosystem has increased by a factor of 20 in the past decade, and is now valued at over 83 billion Euros, and a recent report by the Spanish group GEM cites that 13.5% of adults in Spain are involved in an entrepreneurial initiative. Spain features over 11,000 startups employing over 140,000 people, and is fourth-placed in Europe in terms of startups. Despite these promising statistics, difficulties in starting a business from regulatory barriers persists, and a new 2022 Startup Law within Spain is seeking to ease business creation by reducing regulations and taxes, easing access to finance. A recent report from the Spanish business school Esade notes that productivity is still low in Spain compared to the EU, as is private investment, and high public debt could limit future growth.

Ivan Bofarull, Chief Innovation Officer of Esade, described Spain's ""very unique entrepreneurial culture"" as a ""legacy"" worth preserving in a recent interview. Bofarull distinguished between a negative legacy ""mindset that makes you stick in the past"" and a ""positive legacy that a business can leave for the next generation."" Developing a positive legacy requires innovation that is ""strategic with a long-term perspective."" Bofarull described the Esade education as one training students to ""understand how things work, but also to understand the people."" Bofarull prefers disruptive innovation that ""emerges from a synthesis"" and that provides ""continuity rooted in how humans behave"" and knowledge beyond ""hype and conventional wisdom.""

Bofarull also notes that Europe's style of business and education is a ""legacy that emerges from the Second World War"" that ""hedges ourselves against potential terrible downsides."" This approach differs dramatically from the typical US venture capitalist, which Bofarull describes as ""assuming a risk to reach an unlimited upside."" Growth within Europe should arise from what Bofarull describes as ""capabilities and capacities from your legacy that can be transformed into a force for the future."" It is hoped that as Spain and Europe build up their education system and economy, their growth will be rooted in a cultural legacy that will be a force for the future."
Build To Scale Funding Program Can Support Tech Small Businesses,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rhettbuttle/2024/10/01/build-to-scale-funding-program-can-support-tech-small-businesses/,2024-10-01T20:42:42Z,"The U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) recently announced that it is accepting applications for Fiscal Year 2024 for its  Build to Scale program, which will provide $50 million in grants for entrepreneurs who are building technology-driven businesses. In addition, new changes to the program are intended to increase flexibility for projects and improve the application process.

For Main Streets across the country to thrive, it is critical that entrepreneurs in communities are able to keep pace with innovations and be part of the current business ecosystem. The Build to Scale program drives inclusive and equitable access to capital for technology-based companies to not be confined to the East and West Coasts and flourish across the country. Not only does it make the economy more equitable, it also promotes high-skilled job creation alongside innovative products and services to help lower barriers for underserved regions.

The Build to Scale program seeks to meet this need by generating critical support for regional commercialization, access to capital, and the formation of competitive innovation economies across the country. It offers winners award amounts ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to a maximum of $5 million to support programmatic and operational costs related to growing regional technological advancement initiatives.

This is intended to create stronger pathways for underdeveloped regions to craft tech-based economies that are up to speed with global and regional markets. According to the EDA's recently released Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the program shortens the gap between idea formation and marketable technology by unlocking investment capital across sectors and accelerating growth for its recipients.

The program calls for applicants that are committed to ""challenging the status quo of established markets or commercializing technologies, as well as furthering job creation within their businesses,"" with a specific focus on projects that directly address traditionally underserved regions and communities with histories of systemic economic suppression. This year's changes eliminate the former dual competitions, Venture Challenge and Capital Challenge, consolidating both into a single ""Implementation Challenge."" Eligible applicants include state and local governments, Indian tribes, and entities whose application is supported by a state or local government, such as a nonprofit, university, or public-private partnership.

If you are looking to increase the growth of technology driven businesses in your community, this could be a good fit for you. More information can be found at the EDA's Build to Scale program center. Applicants have until 4:59 PM ET, Time on October 28, 2024, to apply."

5 Steps For Job Seekers To Shine In The Crowded 2024 Job Market,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2024/10/01/5-steps-for-job-seekers-to-shine-in-the-crowded-2024-job-market/,2024-10-01T17:00:57Z,"Job seekers are scrambling to stand out amid fierce competition in today's job market. The average monthly rise in new jobs fell by 28% in 2024, compared to 2023 with 118 candidates applying for each new job that is advertised. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 818,000 fewer jobs in March of this year than were initially reported.

An Aerotek study finds the average 2024 job searcher still enduring longer job hunts in an uncertain economy. The findings also reveal that job hunters are feeling vulnerable, and job stability is at the top of their priority list along with higher pay and job engagement. And, although 72% of job seekers say the job search has harmed their mental health, help is on the way to show them how to stand out.

""In today's competitive and over-saturated job market, simply sending your CV is not enough anymore,"" notes Natalia Shahmetova, the CEO and founder of Woofz. She told me by email that the actual issue is getting recognized before you even reach the interview stage. ""But here's the secret: you don't need dazzling tricks; you just need techniques that prove you think differently.""

To help candidates land their dream jobs, Shahmetova shared five tips to stand out in the application process and make a lasting impression in the minds of the recruiters.

Shahmetova points out that the majority of applicants focus on what the job description states. She suggest that you try to dig deeper. ""Look up the hiring manager's LinkedIn profile or the team's most recent initiatives and pain points,"" she advises. ""Then, tailor your CV to target these difficulties specifically. However, sometimes, you have to take a look at the pain points of the company's target audience as well.""

""When you mention a side project, make sure it ties into the role you're going for,"" she recommends. ""Like, if you're applying to Woofz, highlighting programming skills might not do much, but showing off photography skills or your knack for negotiation could be a game-changer. Maybe you ran a social media page for a hobby or organized an event where your attention to detail shined. Employers love seeing how your outside experience connects to the job, not just your nine-to-five.""

A case study is an effective tool, but Shahmetova believes you can make it stand out by including a ""What I Would Do Differently Now"" section. ""Choose a previous project or problem you worked on, explain the situation and how you addressed it, and then reflect on how you might approach it now, given what you've learned since. This small addition shows that you are always evolving, learning and contemplating how to improve rather than relying just on previous triumphs,"" she explains.

This one is bold, Shahmetova cautions, but insists it can make you stand out a great deal. So if you really want to get noticed, she advocates finding a polite way to criticize a component of the company's existing strategy and propose a solution. ""For example, if the company recently introduced a new product but has had customer complaints, highlight it in your cover letter and propose a change that would improve the user experience. The idea here is to be diplomatic; instead of simply pointing out flaws, provide meaningful answers.""

""If the company uses an Applicant Tracking System (ATS), go beyond simply 'optimizing keywords,'"" Her recommendation is to include hidden information that most applicants don't consider adding to their resume. As an example, she suggests including a ""Key Competencies"" section that describes your talents and how they relate to wider industry trends or future issues. She continues that this addition demonstrates that you are focused on the task at hand and on how your function fits into the company's long-term plan as well.

To stand out in today's job market, Shahmetova insists you need to show that you think differently, that you truly grasp the company's needs and that you can add value to their goals. She advises that you focus on their pain points and tailor your application around solving their problems. Show off your side projects that actually connect to the role you want, and when talking about your past work, don't just list achievements -- talk about what you've learned and how you'd do things differently now. And if you're feeling bold enough, she advocates pointing out a flaw in their current strategy and offer a fix. And instead of just playing the keyword game with ATS systems, show you're thinking long-term by highlighting how you can help with future challenges too, she concludes."
How The Accountant Shortage Impacts CFOs And Financial Hires,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/10/01/how-the-accountant-shortage-impacts-cfos-and-financial-hires/,2024-10-01T16:48:57Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

Driving technology, embracing of the strategic importance of a company's financial functions and an emphasizing corporate sustainability are all transforming the CFO's job. But they're also reshaping other jobs in a company's financial operations. A new report from EY zooming in on the financial controller's position found that 86% of people in that role expect significant changes in their career in the next five years. The majority of controllers told EY they expect their role to shift from one focused on value protection -- paying attention to internal controls and regulatory compliance -- to one that looks for value creation -- using technology, strategy and data to find new opportunities and recommend new policies.

""The controller of the future will be a trusted partner to the CFO right across the transformation spectrum,"" Mike Verbeck, EY Global deputy vice chair for Assurance, said in the report. ""They will create value in their capacity as analysts, collaborators, innovators, storytellers and leaders of talented teams, as well as in their capacity as accounting and compliance experts.""

The report makes clear that this is seen as a natural evolution of the controller's role, fitting with how most companies utilize their financial teams in the foreseeable future. But it's also clear that the report found technology -- including AI -- gives the controller the ability to pivot toward more of a focus on strategy and opportunity. The report found that nearly nine in 10 controllers already use AI, which is powerful on two fronts. It can do many of the basic tasks controllers spend their time on now, and also leverage data to find powerful insights.

EY suggests that controllers take advantage of the opportunity to look for value-creation opportunities by embracing data and AI and inspiring team members to see themselves as problem solvers. CFOs should empower their controllers, and also provide training in future-focused skills that build on technology use and responsibilities to climb the ranks at a company. And the CFO should also focus on an innovative and transformational spirit in potential new hires to work under the controller.

Regardless of how financial roles are created and recruited, the entire financial sector is struggling to find talent. Many college students today aren't pursuing accounting degrees, and even fewer are becoming CPAs. That makes recruiting for any financial position harder, from junior-level to CFOs. I spoke with Keith Giarman, president of the private equity and principal investing practice at executive search firm DHR Global, about how this shortage is impacting things right now. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are now open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Unionized port workers on the East Coast began their first strike in more than 45 years at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, stopping trade traffic at ports in Baltimore; Boston; Charleston, South Carolina; Jacksonville, Florida; Miami; Houston; Mobile, Alabama; New Orleans; New York/New Jersey; Norfolk, Virginia; Philadelphia; Savannah, Georgia; Tampa, Florida; and Wilmington, Delaware. About 45,000 union members represented by the International Longshoremen's Association want a wage increase of 77% and a ban on new automation as part of their new contract with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX), the organization that represents shipping companies. West Coast port workers earn over $30,000 a year more than their East Coast counterparts. Union members are refusing to meet with the USMX until their wage demands are met.

The strike could have fast and far-reaching impacts on the U.S. economy, with some analysts projecting it costing $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion a day. If the strike continues for long enough, it could impact consumer prices and the availability of goods. President Biden has urged the two sides to resolve the issue quickly and fairly, sending Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard to meet with USMX on Monday. While Biden can defer the strike for 80 days through the Taft-Hartley Act, he said over the weekend he will not ""because it's collective bargaining.""

While West Coast ports remain open, Boeing machinists remain on strike. The 33,000 unionized employees at the aerospace manufacturer's Pacific Northwest facilities rejected Boeing's ""best and final offer"" last week. From the union's social media posts, the sticking point appears to be the reinstatement of Boeing's pension plan, which the company did away with in favor of a 401(k) plan in 2014, according to Quartz. It's unclear from media reports what's happening currently with negotiations, but according to KING5, Boeing released a statement Monday saying it is ""committed to resetting our relationship with our represented employees and negotiating in good faith and want to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We are prepared to meet at any time.""

The interest rate cut that everyone was waiting for happened last month. And yet there's already lots of talk about how big the next one will be at the Federal Reserve policy-making committee's next meeting in November. (According to CME FedWatch, as of Tuesday morning, 38.4% of economists project another half-percentage point cut.) This isn't just a case of impatient analysts and investors, writes Forbes' Derek Saul. After the rate cut was announced, yields on the 10-year Treasury note increased. These notes are the basis for interest rates on things including mortgages, auto loans and corporate borrowing -- meaning financing might not be getting cheaper after all.

There are many reasons for Treasury yields to be increasing, some benign and some ominous. Some analysts say investors had already priced in the rate cut, especially since its yields are down compared with earlier this summer. But CNBC spoke with analysts who see uncertainty through the federal deficit and the Fed's willingness to cut interest rates, even with inflation a bit higher than the 2% it sees as tolerable. On Friday, reports showed the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index -- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- to be at 2.2% in August.

The stock market on the whole is responding well, however. The first nine months of 2024 were the S&P 500's best start to a year since 1997, writes Forbes' Derek Saul. The S&P's year-to-date gain is 20.3%, and the other markets have also fared well this year: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 12% in the first three quarters of 2024, and the Nasdaq is up 20%. Buoying the markets so far are last month's interest rate cuts -- insurers, home builders and utilities saw some of the best returns in recent months -- and optimism-fueled AI stocks.

Last week, the Chinese government announced several broad measures to boost its economy, which has been sputtering and looks unlikely to meet its government's annual growth target. The multi-pronged effort includes an interest rate cut from China's central bank, a potential capital injection into its biggest banks to increase lending capacity and governmental economic stimulus, reports Forbes' Derek Saul. Chinese stocks traded on U.S. markets rallied on the news and have continued to trade higher.

However, the rally -- and any benefit to China-based businesses -- may be short-lived for those in the U.S. In a note on Monday, JPMorgan Chase strategists said that if Donald Trump wins the presidential election, it's likely to slow down. Trump has campaigned on strict trade policies toward China, including a tariff of 60% or more on all Chinese goods, phasing out imports of essential goods and revoking China's most favored nation trade status. Vice President Kamala Harris has said in her campaign that she wants to enact policies that ensure the U.S. keeps its economic foothold above China, but she has not presented anything specific that is as restrictive. Analysts believe Harris will continue the Biden administration's approach of more targeted Chinese economic policies, including limiting imports and exports from high-tech industries.

As the nature of work has changed and new fields related to finance have cropped up, there's been a shortage of accountants on all levels -- especially with fewer young people opting for accounting degrees, and even fewer choosing to work at traditional firms and pursue the CPA path. This has immediate and potential long-term implications for finance departments and CFOs. I talked to Keith Giarman, president of private equity and the principal investing practice at executive search firm DHR Global, about what it means. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

It's hard to find the right talent today. What are companies doing to keep the talent they have?

Giarman: A lot of the compensation has gone north. It is a different level skill set that [companies] are asking for. There are a few [qualified employees], and they know that. They know that their price tag and their market value have gone up. Especially in private equity, where they've got a hopefully three-year timeline to improve operations and sell a company, they have to have the absolute best and invest in that role. They're working with the CFO more than the CEO.

For everybody else [in finance], if you accept my logic, there's fewer of them. Whether it's somebody running FP&A or somebody lower down in the organization, you've got to pay up.

That doesn't fix it, though, because people come for more than money. [Companies] have to create great working environments and be more flexible, including remote [work]. As a company, we have the same challenges. We've tried to create an environment for our research and associate staff where we emphasize things like wellness and the things that the younger generation wants to focus on and feel good about in terms of the community they're building around them. If you're not doing those other soft HR things, all the money in the world isn't going to make a difference. They'll stay for a couple of years, and they'll go.

Much of the attention of the accountant shortage is focused on lower-level employees. Are you seeing related challenges with recruiting CFOs?

The answer is a very loud yes, with an exclamation point. The CFOs who will make the cut, where the client will not bend on the requirements, seems like [there are] fewer and fewer as we move along.

It's also dependent on the cycle of the market. CFOs have been in assets in private equities for a while. We're finally starting to see the Fed lower interest rates. There could be some exit liquidity opportunity in a year or two. If more transactions are getting done, there's more folks who have proven themselves: They're able to flourish in these environments and get the job done. We haven't been in that for the last 12 to 24 months.

When we do a CFO search today, something that might've taken 90 days can take 180. There's a timing issue with candidates. There's a compensation issue. There's a flexibility issue in terms of where they are in the investment cycle, too, because if you're going to sell the company in two years, are you going to expect somebody to move their entire family on a plane three hours away?

The good news is at that level, you're thinking about wealth creation and longer-term things that take care of your family and your career. You're even more disposed to the financial element of the opportunity, and you're willing to put in the hard work to get it. If [companies] can make the numbers work and people can see a path to the end zone, there's a better chance you're going to land those bigger fish, and they're going to stick.

What does the future look like for this shortage?

The thing that's going to make it better is selling a bunch of companies, where good people free up. There's $8 trillion of private equity money floating around out there, and a lot of that's in companies that have CFOs that are waiting to exit. [After interest rates drop enough to restart more dealmaking, probably in 2025], that's when you're going to see more IPOs. You're going to see more deals, you're going to see more M&A. The people that are really good, there's going to be more freed up that you can get access to. They're going to be looking for their next great CFO opportunity.

67%: Proportion of those on the list who are self-made -- either founding their own company or helping build one

23: People on the list for the first time. Together, they're worth $163 billion -- just 3% of the total net worth of the list

What Is The Consumer Price Index  And How It Impacts Investing,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/what-is-cpi-consumer-price-index/,2024-10-01T16:40:33Z,"The Consumer Price Index ""is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services,"" according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which issues the monthly report. In this article, you will learn about how the CPI is put together, the different types of CPIs and the part it plays in investing trends and monetary policy.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average fluctuation over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of what consumers typically buy and use, such as food and beverages, housing, clothing, transportation, medical care and entertainment, and the sales and excise taxes consumers pay. The CPI does not include income or Social Security taxes. Nor does the CPI report investments, such as stocks, bonds, real estate and life insurance because those items are not day-to-day consumption expenses.

Because of the ways the CPI data on those items is applied, it affects nearly all Americans.

The CPI has three major uses, according to BLS. They are as an:

The BLS describes the CPI as a ""measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a representative basket of consumer goods and services."" It also publishes other economic indexes, broken down by region, population and goods, but the one most widely quoted and consequential is the CPI-U, usually called simply the CPI, which covers the purchases of urban consumers and reports each month. A second large survey is the CPI-W, which is a monthly accounting of the average change in the prices that urban wages earners and clerical workers pay for a market basket of consumer goods and services.

To measure data, the BLS continuously collects information to come up with the CPI and other indexes. Its data collectors go in person or work through the Web and with apps to contact thousands of retail stores, service establishments, rental units and doctors' offices, all over the country to compile information about prices on thousands of items used to track and measure price changes in the CPI; it also records prices of some 80,000 items each month representing a ""scientifically selected sample of the prices paid by consumers for goods and services purchased.""

The list of items and services in the CPI basket include the following.

The indexes from BLS have many breakdowns. To better evaluate costs, the BLS presents the CPIs in two ways. They are:

It ""represents all goods and services in the report; in other words, 'the whole shebang,' "" wrote Britannica Money. ""It represents the average inflation rate across the entire economy.""

It ""strips out food and energy prices. Why? Food and energy prices tend to be more volatile than other products in the CPI mix,"" noted Britannica Money. Weather, international prices and geopolitics impact those two product categories. Even some economists at the Federal Reserve choose to leave them out of the equation to come up with a more constituent view on price inflation.

BLS publishes a family of price indexes covering regions and specific industries, which include the four Census regions, nine Census divisions, two sizes of city classes, eight cross-classifications of regions and size-classes and for 23 local areas as well as those for the major groups of consumer expenditures, such as food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation, medical care, recreation, education and communications, and other goods and services for items within each group, and for special categories, such as services. By studying sectors, too, the BLS is able to make educated guesses about the economic state of industries.

It also collects prices for goods and services in 75 urban areas and from about 23,000 retail and service establishments and data on rents from some 50,000 landlords or tenants

The CPI has wide-ranging implications for hundreds of millions Americans and the government, including Congress, the White House and the nation's central bank the Federal Reserve, as well as for Wall Street and investors.

The CPI is used to help adjust income eligibility for levels of government assistance, federal tax brackets, federally mandated cost-of-living increases, private sector wage and salary increase, poverty measures and consumer and commercial rent escalations. ""CPI indexes are used to adjust income eligibility levels for government assistance, federal tax brackets, federally mandated cost-of-living increases, private sector wage and salary increases, poverty measures, and consumer and commercial rent escalations,"" according to the BLS.

According to Cooke Wealth Management LLC, because the CPI gauges inflationary trends, ""it can lead investors to anticipate higher consumer goods and services prices in the future. This expectation can lead to adjustments in investment portfolios, potentially reducing stock market prices due to anticipated reduced purchasing power and demand.""

Dan Raju, CEO of the brokerage platform Tradier, told me that the recent Fed rate cut coupled with CPI movements have led to market volatility and posed a surprise for his traders, who didn't expect an interest rate cut until the inflation rate hit 2%, as suggested by the Fed. ""Lower interest rates typically encourage borrowing and spending, which can lead to increased market activity, but also heightened risk. For our clients, this means a potential for higher returns, but with amplified volatility,"" he added.

The ups and downs of inflation impact the various asset classes differently.

""When the CPI rises and inflation concerns increase, capital often shifts from bonds to stocks or other inflation-resistant assets, such as energy infrastructure, commodities and real estate,"" Jon DuPau, managing director at SuperDex, told me.

""Bonds have an inverse relationship with interest rates, and companies who utilize lending or discretionary spending may experience some uncertainties. Investors reassess the growth potential of companies under inflationary pressure. With CPI considerations, investors may seek safer, more conservative assets as a hedge,"" John Jones, investor advisor representative, at Heritage Financial, told me. Bonds can provide that hedge.

During the early years of the Biden-Harris administration, both the CPI and PPI (Producer Price Index) statistics reported monthly by the U.S. Government were running at nearly 30-year highs,"" Adam Ferrari, CEO of Phoenix Capital Group, noted.

He added that, ""This erosion of value has resulted in elevated home prices, stock market valuations and hard assets like gold and other industrial metals also reaching higher levels. Overall, elevated CPI levels in the U.S. economy has caused investors to seek reprieve in hard assets like real estate, gold or even oil and gas properties.""

""Retreating prices for some commodities are contributing to lower inflation today,"" according to U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Rob Haworth, the bank's senior investment strategy director noted that although food and energy prices rebounded in early 2024 and were ""raising inflation risks,"" prices later in the year leveled off a downturn in the inflation rate.

""The Consumer Price Index in the United States averaged 124.59 points from 1950 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 314.80 points in August of 2024 and a record low of 23.50 points in February of 1950."" according to the tradingeconomics.com from data reported by the BLS.

""Investors must carefully analyze CPI reports, considering that government-released numbers are often revised later, potentially creating credibility issues,"" Chris Hite, regulatory compliance manager at Nurp LLC, the software company that develops algorithmic software for Forex trading, told me.""A nuanced approach is key. Looking beyond headlines to understand core trends is vital. Some assets, like commodities, real estate and inflation-protected securities, can hedge against inflation. However, high inflation and sticky interest rate hikes can negatively impact stocks and bonds.""

The CPI is meant to paint the economic picture in broad strokes, so by its very nature, it doesn't address individual variations. In a post, the economic site Quickonomics addressed what it views as the CPI's four limitations.

They are:

The Federal Reserve Board has long looked for trends in the CPI to help to formulate fiscal and monetary policy and gauge inflation. However, in January 2012, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adopted PCE [personal consumption expenditures price index] as its primary measure of inflation over CPI.""

James Bullard, former president of the St. Louis Fed, wrote in 2013 that the PCE, issued by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, is a better way to gauge the prices that consumers face and determine inflation rates than the CPI.

Market reactions mean that investors can get spooked by the unexpected, or even the expected, which can be a number of events, including the CPI report. Most recently, in August 2024 when the latest report came out, stocks were ""briefly plunging as much as 743.89 points, before ending with its biggest intraday comeback in almost two years,"" according to MarketWatch. Other times, the CPI has virtually no impact on the market.

When you hear the results of the monthly CPI, you're getting a short-hand version of what's happening in the economy and what the average person is dealing with financially. Of course, the CPI doesn't present a nuanced picture, but it can suggest to you and the U.S. government when prices are static, falling or rising and where to make adjustments."
Reality Check: Building A Profitable Career In The Creator Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gustavlundbergtoresson/2024/10/01/reality-check-building-a-profitable-career-in-the-creator-economy/,2024-10-01T16:20:49Z,"The opposite of a microtrend, the creator economy is here for good. Set to grow to almost half a trillion dollars by 2027 (compared to $250 billion today), it's an increasingly enticing industry for young people. One in three between 18 and 30 aspire to be influencers, and as influencer marketing continues to ramp up, it's a more viable career option than ever.

But while effortless overnight success seems to come to many creators, social media can often be nothing more than a highlights reel, showing an unrealistic version of events. For every breakout internet personality, thousands of young creators are failing to succeed and struggling with an unpredictable freelance career. And with every viral video, millions of Gen Zers' perceptions of financial success are being warped.

Enter the social finance app Frich, whose co-founders Katrin Kaurov and Aleksandra Medina are on a mission to provide Gen Z with real, data-driven insights into how their peers manage money.

Gen Z has ""skewed ideas of what it means to manage a budget"" because of what they see on social media, explains Kaurov. Being constantly exposed to financially aspirational content - whether it's ""creators like Mr Beast, who regularly gives away huge amounts of money, or 17-year-old TikTokers buying their own house"" - makes it easy for Gen Zers to believe that's the norm for their age and life stage. With Frich, users enter their age, city, profession and salary before seeing benchmarking data on what their peers are spending on items such as rent, concert tickets and clothing.

""You might go to a bar with your friends, for example, and not feel like you can afford to buy a round of drinks; but if you're on Frich, you can discover that you might be earning above average for someone your age in your city, and therefore you probably can afford those $17 espresso martinis,"" Medina says.

The Frich founders built their company out of lived experience. Kaurov and Medina saw ""unattainable, extravagant lifestyles"" online while ""grappling with the realities of budgeting, worried our cards would get declined"" when they shared a student apartment in New York. They felt the effects of negative comparison and wanted to make money more transparent.

Behind the alluring influencer lifestyle lies a different reality - as Kaurov puts it, ""it's essentially a freelance job, which comes with its own unique financial challenges."" A career in content creation is unpredictable, with fluctuating income and instability based on ever-changing algorithms and audience desires.

For the Frich co-founders, financial literacy is a key skill for all Gen Zers, particularly those wanting to be influencers or planning to monetise their social followings. The skills for managing ""inconsistent income and no benefits"" are as crucial as building an audience, says Kaurov, who has over 40,000 Instagram followers herself thanks to a previous career as a teen model. From her perspective, building a personal brand requires the same time, money and dedication as building a business.

As the creator economy matures further, the Frich co-founders are seeing a counterbalance to the unattainable wealth springing up on TikTok and other social platforms. The rise of the micro-influencer - which Medina describes as a creator with ""a smaller but more cultivated and tailored audience"" - is shifting the financial dynamics online for content creators. Unlike the early days, when influencers became millionaires within months, micro-influencing can be a more sustainable way of building and retaining an audience, and therefore a more sustainable way of building a career in content creation. Creators who are more relatable or on a more typical salary can ""encourage more transparent and open conversations about money online,"" according to Medina.

Such influencers are a breath of fresh air in contrast to widespread misinformation on social media. A recent Moneysupermarket study found that 74% of financial advice given by influencers is incorrect, dangerous or misleading. Frich seeks to puncture misinformation online and direct its users to influencers who are ""sharing how they repay their debt, how they maximise their credit card points and negotiate their phone bill contracts,"" according to Medina. 82% of Frich users have never used a buy now, pay later scheme, for example: evidence that its financial literacy resources are working. Although the Frich co-founders advise exercising caution when consuming social media content, Kaurov caveats that ""social media can be a great resource for finding life hacks or inspiring personal stories if you follow the right accounts.""

Ultimately, whether creating or consuming content, Gen Z feels adrift financially. Medina sums it up: ""You don't know what you don't know. Most Gen Zers have no idea how they're doing when it comes to finances, and what they're searching for is the affirmation that they're normal, and that they're doing OK. They don't want to compare themselves to luxury influencers and feel like they're failing all the time. Instead, they want a vibe check from their peers that they're on the right track."""

Could Dock Worker Strike Spike Inflation? Experts Are Split.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/01/could-dock-worker-strike-spike-inflation-experts-are-split/,2024-10-01T15:08:19Z,"The massive dock worker strike beginning Tuesday comes at an inopportune time for the U.S. economy, as the potential uptick in shipping prices comes ahead of the holiday season and as policy makers look to turn the page on inflation, though experts are split on whether the strike will have a major impact on inflation and the economy more broadly.

""The port strike could disrupt the data, essentially creating a smoke screen for the Fed when trying to stick the soft landing,"" wrote Essaye. The strike crucially comes two weeks after the U.S. central bank initiated the first interest rate cuts since March 2020, essentially declaring victory over inflation. The Fed has signaled it intends to continue cutting, meaning its toolkit is far more limited to stifle another inflation outbreak.

How an extended strike impacts retailers as the holiday quarter kicks off. UBS analyst Arpine Kocharyan wrote Monday retailers had already adjusted import activity in ""anticipation of supply chain disruption"" from the strike.

The East Coast accounts for 40% of U.S. shipping container volumes and about 5% of global volumes, according to Bank of America. The port-related inflation concerns evoke bad memories of the late 2021 supply chain snarls which came as ports globally dealt with significant backlogs due in part to COVID-19 outbreaks among workers. That contributed to the global inflation crisis, and inflation peaked in 2022 at a 41-year high of more than 9% in the U.S."
What Talent Executives Should Be Asking Themselves In The Age Of AI,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwinsor/2024/10/01/what-talent-executives-should-be-asking-themselves-in-the-age-of-ai/,2024-10-01T14:57:09Z,"The democratization of expertise and knowledge is not new; it's been accelerating for centuries. From the advent of the printing press to the internet and now to artificial intelligence (AI), the tools that once belonged exclusively to experts are increasingly available to all. AI is the latest -- and perhaps the most profound -- development in this ongoing trend.

Historically, access to expertise was the privilege of a few. Guilds and institutions held tightly to their knowledge, offering it to select members. The Industrial Revolution began to chip away at these barriers, and the digital revolution obliterated them. Today, knowledge creation, sharing, and application tools are increasingly decentralized. AI continues this trajectory, making vast amounts of data, insights, and capabilities available to anyone with the technology.

So, what does this mean for talent executives? As AI reshapes the workforce, executives must think strategically about five key questions to remain relevant and impactful.

1. Are We Embracing Continuous Reinvention?As Brian Glaser points out, the BANI (Brittle, Anxious, Nonlinear, Incomprehensible) world has replaced the VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) era, requiring companies to constantly pivot. Talent leaders must ask: Are we building a culture that embraces change and encourages rapid reinvention? Like companies such as Netflix and YouTube, which have successfully reinvented themselves in response to market shifts, HR must develop mechanisms to pivot quickly, not just reactively but proactively. HR teams should lead by example, constantly evaluating and updating their processes and systems.

2. How Are We Leveraging Co-Intelligence?The concept of Co-Intelligence, as defined by Ethan Mollick, suggests that humans and AI should collaborate, each amplifying the strengths of the other. AI can provide unprecedented data and insights, but human intuition, creativity, and judgment will unlock its full potential. HR must ask: Are we fostering a culture where AI is used to enhance human decision-making rather than replace it? This might mean upskilling the workforce in technical AI competencies and areas such as emotional intelligence and creative problem-solving.

3. How Are We Rethinking Traditional Job Structures?The traditional notion of the ""job"" is being increasingly questioned. Susan Cantrell writes that organizations are shifting from rigid job descriptions to fluid roles based on skills, autonomy, and project-based work. HR needs to ask: Are we moving toward a skills-based organization that aligns talent with the evolving needs of the business? This means investing in internal talent marketplaces, where employees can match their skills with dynamic organizational needs.

4. Is Our Technology Stack Aligned with Our Talent Strategy?Just as Chief Marketing Officers embraced digital tools to transform marketing from a tactical function into a strategic powerhouse, HR must now embrace AI, data analytics, and digital platforms. McKinsey's report highlights that technological adoption is crucial for HR's future. HR must ask: Do we have the right technology stack to manage and empower talent? This might include AI-driven talent platforms, advanced performance management analytics, and personalized employee development tools.

5. Are We Prepared for the Open Talent Economy?The freelance economy and open talent platforms are transforming how organizations source expertise. Executives must ask: Are we ready to tap into a global, on-demand workforce to meet our organizational needs? This is not a stop-gap measure but a strategic shift. Firms across the globe have demonstrated the power of integrating open talent to solve complex problems. HR leaders must build frameworks seamlessly integrating freelancers, contingent workers, and in-house teams.

AI represents the latest chapter in democratizing expertise, but its true power lies in how organizations leverage it. Talent executives must focus on continuous reinvention, embrace human-AI collaboration, rethink traditional structures, align their technology stack, and embrace the open talent economy. Those who do will not only navigate the AI-driven future but lead it."
African Immigrant Startups: From Student To Success In Global Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2024/10/01/african-immigrant-startups-from-student-to-success-in-global-economy/,2024-10-01T14:23:21Z,"Americans can learn a great deal about the global economy and the U.S. immigration system from successful African students. Africans who strive to achieve their dreams in the United States bring unique perspectives. Albert Owusu-Asare, a former international student, became a successful entrepreneur, and his story provides insights about America, the immigration system and the global economy.

Albert Owusu-Asare was born in Ghana and decided early on to study in America as an international student. Owusu-Asare became interested in U.S. universities after he noticed that students from his high school had gone to the United States for college. He wanted to be an aerospace engineer, and Ghana did not offer the kind of education he wanted. ""I learned about the schools in the U.S., the high caliber, and the offer of financial aid was also a factor,"" he said in an interview.

For U.S. universities and the American economy, Africa will be a significant source of international students in the years ahead. The number of students from China applying to American universities has stagnated, and low population growth in many countries limits the potential supply of future international students.

High visa denial rates for African students continue to raise concerns among U.S. lawmakers and universities wishing to attract more students from Africa. In a July 3, 2024, letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, members of Congress wrote, ""We believe all qualified applicants, regardless of where they come from, should have an equal opportunity to continue their academic journey in the United States. However, we are concerned that students from developing countries may be at a disadvantage when interviewing with State consular officers.""

The letter from Senators Peter Welch, Alex Padilla, Cory Booker, Ralph Warnock, Mark Kelly, Chris Van Hollen, Elizabeth Warren and Kyrsten Sinema stated that recent changes to the State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual did not alleviate their concerns: ""Between 2015 and 2023 . . . data obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request shows that State denied students from African countries at a significantly higher rate than those from other regions of the world."" They cited a recent report. The U.S. for Success Coalition and several of its members, including NAFSA, the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration and the Council of Graduate Schools, endorsed the letter.

Americans may not realize that international students can be denied visas even if a U.S. university accepts them for admission. ""It's a nerve-wracking process just preparing for your visa interview,"" said Owusu-Asare. ""That may lead to mistakes. The most stressful part for me was to go to another city to do the interview, and then you have to cross your fingers that you have a successful interview and come back home.""

His advice for students looking to study abroad is to start early. Begin researching all possibilities for universities before your junior year in high school.

Who you meet in college could be as important as what you study. Albert Owusu-Asare attended Grinnell College in Iowa, earning an undergraduate degree with a double major in computer science and physics. During the international student orientation program, he met his future cofounder, Ameer Shujjah. ""So, a guy from Ghana, a guy from Pakistan, the first day of college we meet each other, had classes together and eventually we started a business together,"" said Owusu-Asare.

For most Americans, graduating from college means finding a job. The stakes are higher for international students. As he completed his studies at Grinnell, Owusu-Asare remained in F-1 student status, which permitted him to stay in the United States only so long as he pursued a full course of study. He obtained Optional Practical Training, which lasts only 12 months but can be extended 24 months in a science, technology, engineering or math field.

While working on OPT for his employer, Goldman Sachs, the company entered Owusu-Asare's name in the annual H-1B lottery. The effort proved unsuccessful. In recent years, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services selected only about one in four applicants or registrants. The annual H-1B limit of 65,000, plus an exemption of 20,000 for graduate degree holders from U.S. universities, is low, equaling only about 0.05% of the U.S. labor force. ""Some people get lucky in the lottery, but I was one of the unlucky ones,"" he said.

Goldman Sachs wanted to retain Owusu-Asare and gave him the opportunity to work for the company in London. After more than three years at Goldman Sachs, he took an opportunity to become chief technology officer at Esusu, a successful startup company founded by an African international student.

Wemimo Abbey, an international student from Nigeria, cofounded Esusu in 2018. Esusu, with a headquarters in New York, is valued at $1 billion. The company ""helps renters build their credit histories and scores for free by reporting on-time rent payments to credit bureaus."" One-quarter of the billion-dollar startup companies in the United States have a founder who first came to America as an international student, according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis.

Finding niches in the global economy may include finding a job that provides services internationally or even starting a company that serves the international market. Many businesses begin after an entrepreneur sees a problem that the marketplace has failed to solve. That was the case with Albert Owusu-Asare. While working at Esusu, Owusu-Asare discovered that diverse laws and banking rules challenge companies attempting to manage workers in other countries.

In 2021, Owusu-Asare and his former Grinnell classmate Ameer Shujjah founded Cadana, which provides several functions for employers trying to pay employees and contractors working in other nations. ""Pay compliantly to millions of local banks, mobile money accounts, and e-wallets in Africa, Latin America and Asia,"" is how Cadana describes its payment platform.

To manage the company in the United States, Owusu-Asare, Cadana's CEO, obtained an O-1 visa for ""individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics."" (O-1 visa filings have expanded since the Biden administration issued new guidance in January 2022.) An attorney has applied for a green card for Owusu-Asare through the employment-based immigration system.

The company recently hired U.S. citizens in New York and Maryland and now pays their customers' workers in more than 30 countries. Cadana navigates for clients the foreign rules and government regulations that can trip businesses and frustrate workers who want to be paid on time. The company's platform and mission seek to align business needs with the desire of talented people to participate in the global economy. ""We're running the company pretty lean and close to profitability,"" said Owusu-Asare. ""So, it's been a successful journey so far.""

Heck, even if you're not leaning on your CEFs for income, those big payouts are gold -- you just reinvest them to boost your portfolio's value and book an even bigger income stream going forward.

But of course, not all CEFs are great investments, with some best avoided unless they trade at big discounts to net asset value, or NAV, the key indicator of value for these funds. And sometimes even a great fund isn't the best one to buy, despite a big yield and an impressive record.

That's the situation with two CEFs that many income investors love: the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Income Fund (ETG) and Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK).

Both have their merits, starting with their payouts: ETG yields 8.1% and STK pays a solid 5.6% as I write this. But in today's market, one fund is clearly the better buy, and it's all about what lies beneath those dividends.

With that in mind, let's stack these two solid funds up and see how they compare, starting with ...

ETG makes a splash early in our matchup with a portfolio that's incredibly well-diversified, with exposure to sectors like financials, consumer staples, energy and, yes, the sector everyone's talking about today: tech.

The fund focuses on resilient large caps like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), pharma giant AstraZeneca SA and Nestle SA, the latter of which is best known for sweets in North America but makes a range of foods and ingredients you'll find in just about any kitchen.

As just those samples from the fund's top-10 holdings list tell us, ETG also goes beyond the US, where we all know stocks have been on a tear lately, with a bit more than a third of its portfolio overseas.

This level of diversification gives ETG an edge because it spreads risk across the global economy, insulating the fund from the volatility of any single sector or from another big turn in the US stock market.

And the roughly 12% of the portfolio in fixed-income investments (mainly investment-grade bonds) adds even more ballast. It helps support that big dividend, too.

Now let's switch over to STK, whose portfolio is in many ways the opposite:

You can clearly see that almost all of the categories in the table above are tech-related. The fund's top holdings read like a who's who of the tech elite and include Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research Corp. (LRCX).

These are all great companies, but when tech hits a rough patch, STK feels the brunt of it. NVIDIA's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is now over 70, highlights the risk here, reflecting how pricey some of these stocks are.

When tech goes up, STK soars -- but when tech stumbles, like it has recently, STK's performance suffers. Then there's the volatility.

Don't get me wrong. STK has performed strongly over the long term, with a five-year annualized return of 17.6%. But the flipside is clear: This is a high-risk, high-reward play. That's not ideal for income-focused investors looking for steady, reliable payouts -- especially when we look at the price you'll pay for STK now.

As I write this, ETG trades at a 10.4% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), so you can buy its portfolio for quite a bit less than it's worth.

This kind of deal is what we love to see in CEFs -- it sets you up for upside and provides a margin of safety in case the market wobbles (since the fund is already cheap, it's harder for it to get a lot cheaper).

In contrast, STK trades at a slight premium to NAV. In other words, you're paying more for a portfolio of tech stocks that's already trading at higher prices. With the tech sector well-known for its volatility, paying a premium doesn't make sense, especially when we can get ETG at a discount and lock in a higher yield at the same time.

Over the past decade, ETG has proven itself as a steady performer, delivering a 9.1% annualized return. That's impressive, especially for a diversified income fund that's built to withstand the market's ups and downs.

ETG's ability to provide consistent returns across various sectors gives it an edge when the market gets choppy. And choppiness is very much on the table after 2024's outsized stock-market gains, especially in the tech sector.

This also means STK is like a rollercoaster just at the top of a peak. Sure, its annualized return of 17.6% over the last five years looks fantastic on paper, but that's largely because it's been riding the wave of tech's explosive growth.

While STK has a portfolio perfect for those willing to ride the tech waves, ETG is simply the better buy for income investors now. Its 8.1% yield, combined with a double-digit discount to NAV and a diversified portfolio, make it a safer, more consistent play for those of us who prefer to sleep soundly at night while collecting reliable dividends."
"What To Know About JD Vance's Policy Views -- On Abortion, Economy, Immigration And More -- Before Tonight's VP Debate",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/01/what-to-know-about-jd-vances-policy-views-on-abortion-economy-immigration-and-more-before-tonights-vp-debate/,2024-10-01T14:19:54Z,"Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, will likely be asked about his opinions on abortion and other major policy issues when he faces off against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at Tuesday's vice presidential debate, amid controversy surrounding his stances since being named as former President Donald Trump's running mate over the summer.

Vance told The New York Times in February that his populist economic vision can be described as ""applying as much upward pressure on wages and as much downward pressure on the services that the people use as possible."" The senator said he supports raising the minimum wage as an incentive to get workers back in the workforce -- and has co-sponsored legislation to raise it -- and other government intervention to boost industries, like providing subsidies or tax credits. He does not support more stringent government regulations on private businesses, however, telling The Times that to boost the economy, ""there's a lot you can do on the regulatory side -- make building nuclear facilities easier, make building natural gas pipelines easier, make building housing easier -- that doesn't cost money and in fact brings in money."" Vance also supports tariffs that impose taxes on foreign goods, saying that while that can result in higher prices, ""when you are forced to do more with your domestic labor force, you have all of these positive dynamic effects."" He told The Times that while he wouldn't want to raise taxes on middle class Americans, he isn't necessarily opposed to raising taxes on the wealthy, but asked, ""How much revenue does that actually raise?"" Vance is also a big proponent of cryptocurrency, holding bitcoin himself and drafting legislation that would help the cryptocurrency industry.

Vance told The Times he supports Social Security, saying, ""I don't know why people think that you solve many problems by taking a bunch of elderly people and saying, 'You're on your own.'"" The senator suggested he believes in raising more money for the program through a combination of tariffs and bolstering the American labor force, arguing that if more Americans are working rather than relying on public assistance, it would mean more money can go toward Social Security.

Vance has been widely criticized for his views on abortion. In 2022 he said he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally"" and opposed the idea that pregnant people could simply cross state lines to obtain an abortion if the state where they reside banned the procedure. He has also compared abortion to slavery, saying in 2021, ""While the people who obviously suffer the most are those subjected to it, I think it has this morally distorting effect on the entire society."" The senator was part of a broader group of GOP lawmakers who asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to enforce the Comstock Act in 2023, a long-dormant law from the 19th century that would ban the mailing of anything related to abortion. While the letter specifically asked to stop the mailing of abortion pills, experts have suggested the law could be interpreted more broadly to ban the mailing of abortion-related equipment altogether, which would effectively ban the procedure in practice by ensuring physicians can't get the necessary materials to perform it. Vance has more recently downplayed his former support for restricting abortion and endorsed Trump's view of leaving the issue up to the states.

Vance has echoed Trump in calling for mass deportations of immigrants from the U.S. and criticized the Biden administration for allowing an influx of undocumented immigrants. He also helped spread false rumors against Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, and disapproved of the Biden administration extending temporary legal protections to Haitian migrants. The senator has denounced using immigrants for cheaper labor in the U.S., saying business owners should instead increase incentives to lure American workers.

Vance has perhaps garnered the most attention for his attacks on childless Americans, with comments resurfacing from 2021 in which he complained about Democrats being ""childless cat ladies"" who ""want to make the rest of the country miserable too"" and don't have a ""direct stake"" in the country's future. While Vance has claimed his comments were a joke, they do reflect his broader views, as the senator has pushed policies that would incentivize people to have children and benefit families. He has suggested there should be a higher tax rate for childless adults and even said in 2021 parents should have more voting power than voters without children, and has touted a policy in Hungary that provides loans to married couples and then forgives those loans if the couple has children. Vance has supported ""universal childbirth"" policies that would provide healthcare coverage for childbirth, though he has opposed ""universal childcare"" proposals, which he said in 2021 are a ""massive subsidy to the lifestyle preferences of the affluent over the preferences of the middle and working class."" He has also supported expanding child tax credits for low-income families, but has been criticized for missing a Senate vote on the issue. The senator made comments in 2021 suggesting he was against no-fault divorce -- though he did not explicitly call for repealing it -- claiming that ""children suffered"" because of more relaxed views around divorce and calling for a return to viewing marriage as ""sacred"" in order to preserve American families.

Vance has deep ties to the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank spearheading the controversial Project 2025 policy agenda proposing an extreme overhaul of the executive branch should Trump win the election. The senator authored the introduction to Heritage president Kevin Roberts' forthcoming book -- which calls for a ""second American Revolution"" and says ""it's time to circle the wagons and load the muskets"" -- and has long been allied with the organization, with Roberts telling Politico in March Vance is ""absolutely going to be one of the leaders -- if not the leader -- of our movement."" Prior to joining Congress, Vance penned the introduction to a Heritage Foundation report that endorses many of the policies also mentioned in Project 2025, promoting heterosexual nuclear families and decrying abortion and public assistance programs. He has also expressed support for a key pillar of the Project 2025 agenda, which calls for replacing career civil servants with political appointees. Vance has not explicitly endorsed Project 2025, however, particularly as the Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from its proposals. He said in July, prior to becoming Trump's running mate, that he thinks ""there's some good ideas in"" Project 2025's policy blueprint, but it also has ""some things I disagree with.""

LGBTQ+ advocacy groups criticized Vance's nomination as Trump's running mate due to his record on LGBTQ+ rights. As a senator, Vance introduced legislation opposing transgender rights, authoring bills that would classify gender-affirming care for minors as a felony and ban ""X"" from being used as a neutral gender designation on U.S. passports. Vance also said in 2022 he would vote no on legislation to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, and has voiced support for policies like Florida's law known as ""Don't Say Gay,"" which restrict what schools can say about sexual orientation and gender identity.

Vance is one of the GOP lawmakers who has vocally opposed providing additional aid to Ukraine, and has come under fire for saying in 2022 that he ""do[esn't] really care what happens to"" the eastern European country. The senator called at the Republican National Convention for the U.S.'s allies to ""share in the burden of securing world peace,"" saying there should be ""no more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,"" and told The Times in June the U.S. ""should be dealing with other countries based on whether they're good or bad for America's interests."" He criticized the Biden administration's Ukraine policy to The Times, saying the U.S. was not sufficiently working to deter China from invading Taiwan because ""we're sending all the damn weapons to Ukraine,"" though also acknowledged that handling the situation in Ukraine means ""there's going to have to be some American security assistance over the long term."" Vance also agreed that Russia gaining control of Ukraine is ""is not in our interest."" The senator has expressed strong support for Israel in its war against Hamas, saying at a rally on Saturday that his peace plan is ""elect Donald Trump"" and suggesting he aligns with Trump's view that ""the only way to get to peace is to destroy Hamas and let Israel finish the job.""

Vance's views stand in stark contrast to Democratic rival Walz, who has championed progressive policies including abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights and opposing climate changes. Walz is a gun owner but is strongly in favor of gun control measures like universal background checks and banning bump stocks, in contrast to Vance, whom the National Rifle Association described as ""a true Second Amendment champion"" and has opposed gun control reforms. As governor of Minnesota, Walz has signed bills into law that include free meals for school children, expanded protections for workers, restoring voting rights for the formerly incarcerated, climate change initiatives and legalizing marijuana, among other measures. Like Vance, Walz supports expanding the child tax credit, and he helped enact a nation-leading $1,750 tax credit in Minnesota after a federal tax credit expired. Walz's administration also eliminated many beneficiaries' income taxes on Social Security benefits, which Trump has also called for.

While Vance's economic philosophy has a strong emphasis on bolstering the American worker, the senator has come under fire from the left for his mixed record on supporting labor unions. Though Vance made headlines for visiting striking United Auto Workers union members on the picket line, the senator opposed the PRO Act that would have strengthened protections for unionized workers and codified the collective bargaining process. He told Politico in March that he opposed the legislation in part because he favors a system where industries negotiate union deals, rather than individual workplaces or companies, and because he ""think[s] it's dumb to hand over a lot of power to a union leadership that is aggressively anti-Republican.""

Vance has reached across the aisle for several of his efforts in Congress, working with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, on a bill to improve rail safety standards after the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on legislation regarding banking regulations. The vice presidential candidate told Politico in March that his wariness of big corporations often aligns him with progressive Democrats even as he disagrees with them on other issues, saying, ""If you look at the people that I've worked with most successfully, it's people who, even though they're from the left, recognize that something's pretty fundamentally broken about American society."" Warren, for example, is ""at least thinking deeply about what's going on in the country and why things seem to be going off the rails,"" Vance said. In his June interview with The Times, Vance said ""Bernie Bros"" are the group on the left ""whose politics I'm open to,"" while criticizing ""center-left liberals who are doing very well,"" arguing them and their center-right counterparts ""have an incredible blind spot about how much their success is built on a system that is not serving people who they should be serving.""

34.7%. That's the average number of U.S. adults who have a favorable view of Vance as of Monday, according to a compilation of polls by FiveThirtyEight, versus 45.7% of Americans who have a negative view of him. Polling suggests the Ohio senator is the least popular non-incumbent vice presidential candidate in at least the past 20 years, according to FiveThirtyEight."
"Panama Is Paradise For Rainforests, Wildlife, And Potential Partners",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2024/10/01/panama-is-paradise-for-rainforests-wildlife-and-potential-partners/,2024-10-01T14:00:01Z,"During my eight-day visit to Panama in September, the Minister of Environment, Juan Carlos Navarro, described his country as a ""little paradise"" where the continents of North and South America meet. Panama is a 480-mile-long strip of land, known as the isthmus, that extends from Costa Rica to Colombia, separating the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Panama is carbon-negative because its rainforests absorb more CO2 than its economy emits. Despite its efforts to preserve its trees, it has suffered from the effects of climate change. In 2023, the country experienced a drought that decreased the water levels of the Panama Canal, resulting in a $1 billion revenue loss. Scientists worldwide believe that the use of fossil fuels is worsening the greenhouse effect, leading to intense warming, extreme climate events, and longer dry spells.

""Even though we are victims of climate change, we have an ambitious climate agenda,"" Minister Navarro told me. ""We are losing the planet, and won't achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement"" -- to limit temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050. ""The only way to stop climate change is to involve the private and philanthropic sectors to deploy clean energy, electric mobility, conservation, and protection initiatives in Panama. There are tons of investments that private companies can make to generate financial returns.""

For example, Navarro founded Panama's Solar Energy Association, which has 62 companies building solar farms and investing in electric vehicle chargers. Panama is considered a developed country, driven mainly by the Panama Canal, which earns about $6 billion yearly and attracts companies such as Maersk and Proctor & Gamble. The Panama Canal Authority pays the government about $2.5 billion yearly.

The Panama Canal is a conduit for 6% of the global maritime traffic. It is amid Panama's rainforests covering 68% of its land or nearly 12.7 million acres -- natural CO2 vacuums. Roughly 32 ships pass through each day, taking 8-10 hours. It's one of the seven ""Wonders of the World.""

The country's gross domestic product is $76.5 billion, growing by 4% to 5% yearly. It is based on banking, insurance, container ports, medical, and tourism. Renewable electricity, mainly hydro, accounts for 80% of its electricity portfolio.

Without ample rainfall, the canal suffers the consequences. The forests act as a sponge, feeding two lakes that fill the locks and allow ships to pass through. Panama safeguards its trees, home to indigenous peoples as well as biodiversity and precious wildlife. I visited a few of the islands and saw various kinds of monkeys and bats.

Moreover, Panama just signed the High Seas Treaty to protect the ocean and its biodiversity. Roughly 60 other nations endorsed it.

""This is a perfect example of sustainable development,"" says Navarro, referring to the Panama Canal and the country's environmental strategies. ""Without this, the economies of the United States and Asia would suffer"" because the supply chains would get cut off. ""This would be an economic catastrophe.""

Climate change risks Panama, its natural wonders, and the global community. I spoke with Andres Diaz, a fellow for the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and a paleontologist who studies fossils. He explained that CO2 levels are now at 423 parts per million, and we risk hitting 500 parts per million by 2050. Since the Industrial Revolution began 200 years ago, CO2 levels have escalated, causing temperature increases of 1.2 degrees Celsius.

He studies plants and pollen, analyzing rainforest sediments using artificial intelligence to discover prior warmer periods. The study of fossils helps to understand and predict the future of the Amazon. Some analyses suggest that the rainforest's diversity will enable it to survive, while others indicate that it will transform into a savanna or grassy land. This modification would have a significant impact on the Amazon's freshwater reservoir.

Trees and plants take in water and release it into the atmosphere, delivering it worldwide. ""If the freshwater reservoir changes, we will have longer dry seasons and more trouble everywhere,"" says Diaz.

Therefore, the most advanced countries should not take Panama's treasures for granted. Last year, Panamanians protested the expansion of a Canadian copper mine -- the most significant display of public outrage since the people challenged General Manuel Noriega's military dictatorship in 1987. They feared that expanded exploration would displace indigenous populations and negate efforts to preserve the rainforests and keep CO2 releases in check.

Panama's Supreme Court sided with the protestors, saying that biodiversity and ecosystems remain paramount. However, this fight continues as Canada's First Quantum Minerals is appealing to an international court, arguing it paid Panama more than half a billion dollars.

""Panamanians are becoming more aware of the importance of nature in their lives, and this is a positive development,"" Minister Navarro says. ""I have dedicated my life to this cause. We are committed to promoting sustainable development for companies that contribute to our economy without harming the environment.""

The world's most developed economies contribute at least 80% of global CO2 emissions, while the poorest nations make up 1% to 3%. The most significant sticking point at climate negotiations is about how the major economies will compensate the less developed ones; South America, Asia, and Africa have sizable rainforests absorbing CO2.

Panama seeks international partnerships -- corporate or philanthropic investors who will bet on its future. Preserving its rainforest is a priority, which keeps its economy purring along with global commerce. But attracting risk-takers and benefactors is a high-stakes venture.

""We are in a great logistical area, but we have not linked that to other assets such as our forests and biodiversity,"" said Mirei Heras, former environmental minister for Panama, during dinner. ""And there is competition from various countries also aiming to attract funds. However, our location, along with our forests and their ability to reduce emissions, is a win-win strategy that could enable us to prosper.""

The Isthmus of Panama is celestial, offering maritime transportation, lush rainforests, and wetlands harboring diverse biodiversity and wildlife. But climate change is an omnipresent threat. Therefore, Panama strives to draw sustainable economic development with partners that could earn financial returns and environmental rewards.

Reporter's Note: This story is the first part in a three-part weekly series. The second story will focus on the symbiotic relationship between the rainforests and the Panama Canal. The third one will examine how to assess rainforest preservation using artificial intelligence and satellites -- information that could be shared globally at no expense to developing nations."
Driving Into The Future: Exciting Career Paths In The Autonomous Vehicle Industry,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/10/01/driving-into-the-future-exciting-career-paths-in-the-autonomous-vehicle-industry/,2024-10-01T13:45:58Z,"The rise of autonomous vehicles is not just transforming our means of transportation, but it is also creating a new ecosystem of job opportunities at the intersection of traditional automotive expertise and cutting-edge technology.

While job displacement is top of mind for today's workers, a report by the Chamber of Progress, a trade association that advocates for technology firms on matters related to self-driving cars, revealed a promising job market on the horizon for the AV industry.

The study, conducted by consultancies Steer and Fourth Economy, projects that the deployment of self-driving vehicles in the United States could create up to nearly half a million jobs over the next 15 years. The report estimates that for every 1,000 autonomous vehicles produced and deployed annually, approximately 190 workers will be needed for manufacturing and servicing.

The growth in employment will encompass a wide range of sectors. These include roles in production, distribution, maintenance, upgrades and repairs. Additionally, there will be a demand for software engineers specializing in machine learning and simulation, hardware engineers developing sensors and systems, research scientists working to advance autonomous driving technology and operations professionals managing vehicle deployments.

Moreover, careers in this field offer interdisciplinary collaboration, where engineers, data scientists, designers and policy experts come together to tackle complex challenges. This collaborative environment not only nurtures professional development, but also positions workers at the apex of groundbreaking innovations.

Workers in the AV space will have the chance to shape the future of mobility by contributing to initiatives that improve road safety, enhance accessibility and develop sustainable transportation solutions.

The development and deployment of driverless vehicles is currently being led by three major players: Waymo, Cruise and Tesla -- among others.

Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, has been a pioneer in the field since its inception as Google's self-driving car project in 2009. The company has developed the Waymo Driver, a comprehensive autonomous driving platform that has enabled the world's first fully driverless commercial ride-hailing service.

Cruise, backed by General Motors, is another key player in the AV industry, focusing on developing and deploying self-driving taxis in urban environments. Both companies leverage a multi-sensor system including LiDAR, radar and cameras, combined with high-definition maps to navigate pre-mapped areas.

Tesla, in contrast, pursues a vision-only approach using cameras and neural networks, aiming for a more scalable solution that can potentially work anywhere.

According to the Chamber of Progress, 82% of workers in the AV industry make more than the U.S. median wage. Additionally, many of these well-paying positions are available to individuals who do not have a college degree.

By pursuing these emerging career opportunities, prospective candidates can position themselves at the forefront of a rapidly evolving industry:

Companies like Vay offer ""teledriving"" services, where remote operators control vehicles from a distance. This role combines elements of traditional driving with technical skills, creating a new category of employment.

As autonomous fleets grow, there's an increasing need for specialists who can maintain and service these high-tech vehicles.

The autonomous driving industry requires experts who can process and improve high-definition maps, as well as develop and maintain advanced sensor technologies. These roles are crucial for enhancing the perception and navigation capabilities of self-driving vehicles.

The core of autonomous driving technology relies on sophisticated AI systems. There's a growing demand for engineers who can develop and refine the algorithms that power self-driving cars.

With the complex regulatory landscape surrounding AVs, there's a need for professionals who can navigate safety standards and ensure compliance with evolving legislation.

As the interface between humans and AVs evolves, there's a need for designers who can create intuitive and user-friendly experiences for passengers interacting with these new transportation systems."
Dubai Tourism BrandVoice: Dubai's Visa Solutions Attract The Global Yachting Community,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dubai-tourism/2024/10/01/dubais-visa-solutions-attract-the-global-yachting-community/,2024-10-01T13:20:32Z,"The range of visa options introduced as part of the U.A.E.'s wider tourism strategy is a boon for the yachting industry, offering international visitors seamless procedures and ease of access.

The rise in global wealth has fueled the appetite for luxury assets among ultra-high net worth individuals. In addition to investing in luxury homes, cars, watches and art, these affluent consumers are also driving yacht sales globally. Yacht ownership now spans from wealthy retired Baby Boomers to Millennials, especially those who have amassed their fortunes in tech. Today's yacht owners are on average 10 to 15 years younger than they were two decades ago. According to industry experts, Millennials are poised to become the primary buyers of superyachts in the coming years.

These trends have led to a growing fleet of superyachts -- vessels over 30 meters in length. Currently, there are about 5,700 superyachts in operation worldwide, according to SuperYacht Times. On average, around 150 superyachts are built each year, with a total value exceeding EUR 4 billion (US$4.4 billion). The yachting economy is projected to continue expanding.

Dubai is well-positioned to capture this growing market, thanks to its world-class maritime infrastructure, continued development of state-of-the-art facilities, strategic location and excellent climate. Its 5,000 berths across 22 marinas can accommodate a wide range of vessels, from pleasure craft and luxury yachts to gigayachts. Additionally, the city's live-work-play lifestyle has attracted global attention, including from the yachting community.

As part of its economic roadmap for the decade up to 2033, Dubai aims to be the best city to visit, live and work in. To achieve this, the emirate has introduced various visa options designed to attract international visitors, encourage long-term residency and foster business opportunities.

Tourist, crew and special yacht tourism visas cater to the specific needs of international yacht visitors docking in Dubai. These visas, such as the six-month renewable cruising permit and six-month multi-entry crew visa for all nationalities, are designed to ensure seamless entry for yacht owners, crews and passengers, allowing them to explore the city at their leisure.

Meanwhile, the virtual working visa is a one-year residency ideal for those working remotely, while the five-year multiple-entry visa enables tourists to enter the U.A.E multiple times and remain in the country for 90 days each time. Visas on arrival are also available for visitors from over 87 countries.

The coveted golden visa is designed for high net worth entrepreneurs, investors and highly skilled professionals, allowing them a 10-year residency anywhere in the U.A.E. This visa opens up new opportunities for investors and gives them the ability to sponsor their family members, enabling them to plan for the long term.

""The 10-year residency offers long-term security without the hassle of frequent renewals, allowing me to fully concentrate on growing my yacht management business. It has also given me peace of mind to focus on long-term business goals and investments, knowing that I have a stable base here in Dubai,"" says Ian Harris, CEO of PHOENIX Yacht Management LLC.

Harris received his golden visa in 2022 and moved to Dubai with his family from the United Kingdom. ""Relocating to Dubai was an easy decision for me, given the city's visionary approach to business and lifestyle. I saw Dubai as a relatively untapped yet highly promising market for large superyacht management,"" he says. ""While Europe has a well-established contingent of yacht management companies, there is a clear gap in the Middle East. The U.A.E, and Dubai in particular, has the infrastructure, luxury market and global connectivity that make it the ideal location to launch and grow this kind of venture, especially given the region's increasing appeal to high net worth individuals and luxury yacht owners,"" Harris adds.

The economic freedom that Dubai provides businesses is a major draw for global companies seeking to establish a local presence in the region. Camper & Nicholsons International (C&N), one of the oldest yachting companies in the world, opened its proprietary office in Dubai in 2022.

""We have many clients across the GCC and have been considering investing locally for many years,"" says Giovanni Alessi Anghini, Managing Director for Camper & Nicholsons Yacht Services FZE, and Chief Innovation and Technology Officer for Camper & Nicholsons International. Anghini moved to Dubai from Italy in 2021 for personal reasons, which provided C&N the opportunity to leverage his relocation and officially establish an office in the region. He received his golden visa in 2023.

""Our local presence allows us to manage relationships with our existing clients and connect with new ones, including yacht owners and family offices that have recently relocated their operations here. While they may not necessarily keep their vessels in Dubai or the region, they spend their winters here,"" Anghini says.

Dubai is the perfect jumping-off point for yachting enthusiasts looking to explore the wider region. Dubai's strong international air connectivity, both commercial and private, makes it an ideal gateway for yacht owners and their guests traveling to and from their vessels. The proposed GCC unified tourist visa will pave the way for increased regional connectivity, enabling yacht owners and their guests to explore not only Dubai and the wider U.A.E. but also other GCC countries, including Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

This initiative is expected to be rolled out by the end of 2024. It aims to drive a cohesive regional effort to position the Middle East as a leading global tourism destination and, ultimately, to further deepen economic integration within the region.

As the yachting industry in Dubai continues to flourish, these visa solutions will significantly benefit the city as a superyacht capital. Harris says, ""Dubai's innovative visa options, particularly the golden visa, have played a crucial role in the growth of the yachting industry. These long-term residency options provide the stability and confidence for yacht owners to base their vessels in Dubai, knowing they have security and a strategic location.""

He adds, ""The marinas in Dubai serve as hubs for a range of complementary businesses, from luxury retail and hospitality to yacht maintenance and charter services. This creates a thriving ecosystem around superyachts and the yachting community, spurring further development of related businesses. With these attractions and continuous investments in infrastructure, Dubai is positioning itself as a global destination for large superyachts and luxury lifestyle experiences, further boosting the regional yachting market."""

About 70-80% of the region's adult population are Internet users, while 50-60% regularly purchase digital products and services.

The digital economy in Southeast Asia is steadily growing and projected to reach US$1 trillion by 2030. The online media market, which includes video-on-demand services, online gaming, advertising and music streaming platforms, is expected to hit US$34 billion by the end of 2025.

To capitalize on the immense growth opportunities in the region, content providers such as music and video streaming platforms, gaming companies and hyperscalers -- businesses that require large-scale data centers and cloud infrastructure -- are partnering telecommunications and technology companies to expand their market reach into this highly competitive region.

Headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, TM Global, the domestic and international wholesale business arm of TM, is an infrastructure-based business that delivers cutting-edge connectivity and digital solutions, leveraging its extensive global connectivity and network infrastructure.

TM Global has regional offices in key locations worldwide, catering to the needs of organizations in major centers, including the U.S. (TMUS). This is among TM Global's six regional offices that includes Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai, Australia and UK.

TMUS established its first U.S. office in Washington D.C. in 2000. In 2014, it strategically expanded closer to the Silicon Valley by opening an office in San Francisco. This move provided opportunities for TM Global to work closely with leading hyperscalers, tech partners and over-the-top (OTT) players who are expanding their presence and services into Southeast Asia.

TMUS delivers a comprehensive range of solutions from connectivity to content delivery, and platform services. It also provides hosting services via its six data centers in Malaysia and one in Hong Kong, positioning its facilities as carrier-neutral and highly reliable hubs. These data centers are supported by TM Global's extensive global submarine cable systems spanning over 340,000km (211,266 miles), connecting Southeast Asia to greater Asia, the Middle East, Europe and the U.S.

""Our expansive network and extensive range of platform solutions uniquely position us to empower U.S. businesses seeking to capitalize on the burgeoning market opportunities in Southeast Asia. We aim to become the preferred partner for global digital infrastructure projects, providing seamless connectivity between the two regions,"" says Khairul Liza Ibrahim, Executive Vice President of TM Global.

Most recently, TM Global partnered Nxera, another leading telecommunications provider in the Southeast Asia region, to develop an advanced, AI-ready data center in Johor, Malaysia. This joint, hyperconnected data center will drive development of the region's digital ecosystem, enabling real-time information sharing that will benefit businesses of all sizes, while nurturing future digital talents.

When it comes to delivering seamless, low-latency content, hyperscalers and content providers must decide on their data hosting strategy. Typically, there are two options: setting up data centers in the targeted region, which is a capital-intensive model, or adopting an operating expenditure model by partnering with a strategic partner in that region.

Should they opt to set up their own data centers, there are several challenges that may arise. It is important to secure a reliable and uninterrupted power supply, to ensure continuous operation and data safety. This requires robust infrastructure and often backup systems to mitigate power outages. Finding the right location and obtaining approvals from local authorities can also be challenging, which may delay timelines.

Another key challenge they could face is retaining talent. While Southeast Asia boasts a highly skilled workforce, the competition for top talent is fierce. Key stakeholders, including governments and private sectors, are continuously working to grow digital talent pools.

Considering these challenges and the demands to scale quickly, partnering with established telecommunications companies such as TM Global is often a more viable option in entering this dynamic region.

Engaging a strategic telecommunications partner can help content providers and hyperscalers deliver low-latency, high-bandwidth content and reduce data bottlenecks to enhance user experience. TM Global's Edge services efficiently address these challenges, enabling content providers to bring their content closer to end users and processing data closer to its source, thereby ensuring high-quality digital experiences.

U.S. enterprises can also take advantage of TM Global's Platform-as-a-Service (""PaaS"") solutions, infrastructure and support to provide seamless content distribution across Southeast Asia. To better serve the entertainment and gaming industries, TM Global has expanded its TMUS operations to Los Angeles and Las Vegas, strategically positioning its offices closer to these key markets.

""The opening of two new offices in Los Angeles and Las Vegas demonstrates our dedication to provide best-in-class solutions and services to content providers and hyperscalers in that dynamic market. While our commitment to enhance connectivity infrastructure remains unwavering, we are also driving value for our stakeholders through continuous innovation to better serve the entertainment and gaming industries,"" Khairul Liza explains.

To date, TM Global works with more than 160 partners world-wide. This is a testament of its commitment to excellence and dedication to delivering innovative and sustainable solutions, marking a pivotal step in TM's aspiration to become a Digital Powerhouse by 2030."
Saudi Strategic Shift Raises Specter Of Another Oil Bust,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2024/10/01/saudi-strategic-shift-raises-specter-of-another-oil-bust/,2024-10-01T12:35:52Z,"After several years of relative stability in global crude oil markets, speculation is rising that strategic shifts from Saudi Arabia, OPEC, and the larger OPEC+ oil cartel could presage another period of higher market volatility in the months to come. If it happens, the good times enjoyed by US shale producers since the COVID pandemic could come to a quick end.

OPEC and OPEC+ - a combination of OPEC members, Russia, and other non-OPEC producing countries - have defended crude prices with relative success in recent years. But the ability of these cartels to support a target price floor has diminished during 2024 as rising volumes of crude have entered the market from places like the United States, offshore West Africa, and Guyana.

Saudi Arabia, a cornerstone OPEC member and the cartel's biggest producer, has signaled a notable shift in strategy in recent weeks. The Kingdom has traditionally maintained an unofficial target price of $100 per barrel, aiming to balance high revenue with market stability. However, faced with market dynamics including lower demand forecasts and pressure from other OPEC members, Saudi Arabia has now indicated a readiness to abandon this price target. This strategic pivot became evident recently as Saudi Arabia prepared to increase oil output, aligning with broader OPEC+ decisions to gradually unwind some production cuts starting in December 2024.

In an email, Josephine Mills, analyst at Enverus Intelligence Research EIR), said EIR views ""a potential rollback of production cuts as a recalibration of Saudi Arabia's desired leverage in the market. Doing so today provides allowance for potential cuts in the future. It is not lower prices for longer. Instead, it's lower prices to become stronger in terms of OPEC leverage.""

It must be pointed out that the last time Saudi Arabia sent this 'preservation of market share' signal was in 2014 when they and OPEC flooded the market with millions of barrels of additional crude. That move was in response to the then-nascent boom in US shale oil production coming mainly from the Permian Basin, the Bakken Shale, and the Eagle Ford Shale. Saudi and other OPEC officials at the time saw this US shale oil cutting into their market share and decided to mount a defense.

The result was a dramatically oversupplied market, a supply surplus that some believed reached as high as 8 million barrels of oil per day, and a collapse in crude prices. Over the next two years, more than 200 US shale producers were forced into bankruptcy, creating the worst depression in the domestic oil and gas industry since the mid-1980s. By the end of 2016, Saudi Arabia was coordinating with Russia and other big oil producing countries to form the OPEC+ cartel to raise prices to more economic levels.

This current shift in Saudi sentiment likely reflects a more complex set of factors. First, it probably reflects Saudi Arabia's acknowledgment of the changing global energy landscape, where the demand for oil might not rebound as robustly as once expected, due to shifts towards renewable energy and changes in consumption patterns in China and other major consumers. This move also indicates a tactical retreat from sustaining artificially high prices through production cuts, a hallmark of OPEC and OPEC+ strategy in past years.

Economically, for Saudi Arabia, this could mean immediate revenue implications. The $100 per barrel target was not just about profit but was crucial for funding ambitious domestic projects like NEOM and Vision 2030, which aim to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil dependency. Globally, it could also lead to higher market volatility as the anticipation of increased supply, even if modest, has already shown its impact with oil prices dropping significantly in response to the news.

Mills says EIR anticipates this current strategy shift will create a more modest impact on global markets than seen in 2014. ""EIR assumes in our base case view that OPEC rolls back the cuts by largely following their phase out plan. Due to the current overproduction this only adds ~ 1 MMbbl/d by exit-2025,"" she said. ""If no compensation for the overproduction is completed and cuts are rolled back, our Brent price forecast would be pushed down to $75/bbl for 2025. However, our current assumption is that OPEC will defend prices.""

For US shale producers, the implications are clear: After several years of living in a sweet spot created by focus on cost containment, scaling back drilling programs, and returning capital to investors, the prospect of another potential bust cycle now looms on the horizon. If the Saudi/OPEC/OPEC+ strategy shift is not carefully managed, this era of good feelings in the domestic oil business could come to a fast and painful end."
'Expect Fireworks' -- BlackRock CEO Issues Serious Fed Warning As A China 'Tsunami' Is Predicted To Hit Crypto And The Bitcoin Price,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/01/expect-fireworks-blackrock-ceo-issues-serious-fed-warning-as-a-china-tsunami-is-predicted-to-hit-crypto-and-the-bitcoin-price/,2024-10-01T12:18:02Z,"Bitcoin Bitcoin has swung wildly over the last few months as Donald Trump, China, BlackRock and the Federal Reserve fuel a perfect storm for crypto.

The bitcoin price has dropped after surging back toward its all-time high of over $70,000 per bitcoin as the market weighs the impact of a China earthquake.

Now, as Elon Musk reveals the details of his secret meeting with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink has warned he thinks the market needs to temper its expectations of Fed interest rate cuts -- while analysts think China's central bank will create ""fireworks"" with a ""tsunami of liquidity.""

""The amount of easing that's in the forward curve is crazy,"" Fink, who's led BlackRock to become the world's largest asset manager looking after $10 trillion on behalf of clients, told Bloomberg on the sidelines of a Berlin conference. ""I do believe there's room for easing more, but not as much as the forward curve would indicate.""

Traders are betting there's a one-in-three chance the Fed will cut another 50 basis points from interest rates at its November meeting, with a further 190 basis points shaved off before the end of 2025.

The market was caught somewhat off guard by the Fed's 50 basis point interest rate cut earlier this month -- its first post-pandemic era reduction -- widely expected to kick off a monetary policy easing cycle that could boost risk-correlated assets such as bitcoin and crypto.

However, Fed chair Jerome Powell played down chances of another 0.5% cut in a speech on Monday, saying officials ""are not on any preset course.""

Meanwhile, traders have been told to ""expect fireworks"" by analysts David Brickell and Chris Mill, who wrote in their newsletter that they see the bitcoin price hitting fresh all-time highs this week, pointing to China's long-awaited announcement of huge stimulus measures designed to reignite its stalled economy.

""The steps taken from China this week will unleash a tsunami of liquidity. Alongside the Fed more aggressively cutting and a global easing cycle, we're pumping in anticipation of that, but against this short term liquidity drain,"" Mill and Brickell wrote.

"Forbes Daily: Ahead Of Debate, How Much Are Vance And Walz Worth?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/10/01/forbes-daily-ahead-of-debate-how-much-are-vance-and-walz-worth/,2024-10-01T12:11:37Z,"You don't just need to be a billionaire to make this year's Forbes 400 list. The cutoff for the 2024 list of America's 400 wealthiest is $3.3 billion.

In fact, for the first time, there are more American billionaires not on the list than are on it. But many of those who did make the cut are familiar faces: Elon Musk is the richest person in America for a third-straight year, followed by Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.

Perhaps the most notable person to make the list, despite falling off of it last year, is Donald Trump, who has cashed in on the presidency more than anyone else, and benefitted from the shaky stock market run of Truth Social's parent company.

The S&P 500 had its best start to the year through September since 1997, gaining 21% so far this year. Big tech stocks benefitting from the generative AI boom have performed best, though the market has shifted slightly in recent months as investors anticipated and reacted to this month's supersized interest rate cut.

Dockworkers along the East and Gulf Coasts walked out on strike early Tuesday, a stoppage that one economist estimated could cost the economy up to $7.5 billion per week. The International Longshoremen's Association is requesting a wage increase as part of a new contract with the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents shipping companies.

If former President Donald Trump wins in November, it could hamper the Chinese stock market's recent rally, JPMorgan Chase strategists cautioned Monday. The risk of a Trump presidency for emerging market stocks is tied to his hawkish trade policies, especially toward China. Still, the strategists noted that emerging market stocks could be at a ""turning point.""

Fintech heavyweights like Jack Dorsey's Block and payments giant Stripe are joining a new compliance coalition for fintechs, in an effort to avoid the missteps of recent years -- which have led to everything from the dramatic collapse of Synapse to a surge in regulatory enforcement actions against fintech sponsor banks. ""Fintechs need to step it up and understand that regulatory requirements are real,"" says former startup CEO Sima Gandhi, a lawyer and former Department of Treasury official who organized the effort.

Aerospace and defense firm Sierra Nevada Corp. landed a $13.1 billion contract to build the next nuclear-ready 'Doomsday' planes, a game-changer for the privately-held company. The Doomsday project will help define the legacy of chairwoman and co-owner Eren Ozmen and her husband, who are worth a combined $7.8 billion. ""Taking smart risks is very important,"" says Ozmen. ""Without that, really, you're just following what's happening -- you're not leading.""

Video game company Epic Games accused Google and Samsung in a federal lawsuit of colluding to harm third-party app stores on smartphones running Google's Android operating system. Epic has taken on both Google and Apple in recent years, alleging that the companies abused their dominant position in the smartphone market to charge excessive fees to app makers.

X, formerly known as Twitter, is worth a little more than one-fifth of the $44 billion Elon Musk paid to acquire it in 2022, according to Fidelity. Fidelity's stake in the social media platform is now worth about $4.19 million, valuing X at $9.4 billion, according to recent disclosures from the financial services company.

Before JD Vance and Tim Walz face off in the vice presidential debate tonight, Forbes took a look at how the candidates stack up financially. While Vance is worth $10 million, exceeding Walz's net worth of just over $1 million, both candidates are less wealthy than their potential bosses: Donald Trump is worth $3.9 billion, while Kamala Harris has a net worth of $7 million.

As Donald Trump became perhaps the most polarizing and controversial president in recent memory, hotels began removing the Trump brand -- but he still made millions. The most likely explanation? Breakup fees. It's tough to say exactly how much all the breakup fees add up to, but Forbes estimates it was at least $15 million and could have been as high as $25 million.

The Israeli Defense Forces began ""limited, localized, and targeted ground raids ... in southern Lebanon"" against Hezbollah targets and infrastructure Monday -- escalating the conflict in the Middle East after Israel killed a number of Hezbollah leaders. The IDF said that the operations were ""approved and carried out in accordance with the decision of the political echelon.""

TOPLINE It was another great year to be rich, especially for the select few at the very top. With markets roaring, nearly all of the 25 wealthiest people in America got wealthier over the past 12 months -- some by billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars.

In all, the top 25 billionaires on The Forbes 400 list are worth a collective $2.5 trillion. They hold nearly half of the $5.4 trillion in total wealth of the entire 400.

This elite group is $471 billion richer than in 2023, with each of the top 25 up 31% on average, outpacing the 18% jump in wealth across list members overall and the S&P 500's 27% return.

Much of the gains come from two people: Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, who added $75 billion to his net worth thanks to rebounding Meta stock, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, who has ridden the AI wave to $63.3 billion in additional wealth since the 2023 ranking. They're two of a record 12 members of The Forbes 400 who are also in the $100 Billion Club, the lucky group of tycoons whose fortunes stretch a dozen digits.

Only three members of the top 25 got poorer over the past year: Elon Musk, whose fortune dropped by $7 billion but who remains the richest person in America; Bill Gates, after Forbes increased our estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement with Melinda French Gates; and Phil Knight, following a rough run for Nike stock since last year.

WHY IT MATTERS ""The Forbes 400 is a roadmap of America's great wealth,"" says Forbes senior editor Chase Peterson-Withorn. ""The 400 richest people in the nation are richer, and thus in many ways more powerful, than ever. It's crucial to investigate who they are, how they made it, where they spend it and how they choose to (or, as is often the case, choose not to) donate it.""

Scotland's Brewgooder Releases World's First Full-Time Fonio Beer,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dontse/2024/10/01/scotlands-brewgooder-releases-worlds-first-full-time-fonio-beer/,2024-10-01T11:49:08Z,"""When we started Brewgooder in 2016, our vision was to use beer to build a better world,"" said Alan Mahon, founder, on a video call. ""Over the years, we've generated opportunities from the United Kingdom to different parts of the world."" Through its Brewgooder Foundation, Brewgooder estimates that it has impacted over 150,000 people, mostly with clean water initiatives. According to Brewgooder's website, in 2018, it became the first Scottish brewery to become B-Corp certified.

Brewgooder's latest efforts include fair trade sourcing, starting with the first full-time beer brewed with fonio, an ancient African grain and possibly the original cultivated cereal. Brewgooder first brewed with fonio as part of a collaboration with New York's Brooklyn Brewery. While Brooklyn Brewery would go on to collaborate with other breweries around the world to promote fonio, Brewgooder is the first to add such a beer to its permanent lineup.

Brewgooder plans to brew between 2,000 and 3,000 hectolitres of Fonio Session IPA per year -- the equivalent of between 560,000 and 845,000 12-ounce cans. Brewgooder estimates the new beer will annually contribute £2 million to the fairtrade economy.

To make this much beer, Brewgooder had to establish a new supply chain to ensure access to the grain. Working with Fairtrade Africa, Fairtrade Foundation UK and FLOCERT, Brewgooder is making Fonio Session IPA with fonio grown by Groupement des Producteurs de Fonio au Foutah, a farming cooperative based in Guinea which includes 67 farmers. With the help of the new beer and the new supply chain, those farmers may be able to produce up to ten times as much fonio than they currently do, impacting not only the farms, but their surrounding communities.

Brewgooder has also partnered with Terra Ingredients of Minneapolis and the Michigan State University to help the fonio cooperative with improving seed systems, strengthening gender-inclusivity, and boosting crop quality. The trio of organizations is aiming to develop stronger seed systems that help the fairtrade-certified cooperative in Guinea grow better crops while ensuring everyone has a chance to benefit from these advances.

As for the beer itself, approximately 10% of the grain used to make the beer is fonio, a proportion Brewgooder settled on having experimented with amounts varying from 5% to 12%. ""You'll 100% notice the difference between this and another session IPA,"" said Mahon. ""We're trying to introduce this in a way where people get some exposure to a grain they didn't know about before."" Mahon says fonio imparts flavors of candied oranges, cherries and Gewürztraminer grapes.

Accordingly to Mahon, the fonio supply chain has been purposefully overbuilt so that other brewers and food manufacturers can have access to the grain, which some consider to be a superfood. The WWF has named fonio one of its Future 50 Foods.

""We've done the hardest part,"" said Mahon. ""It's great to be a category first, but not a category only."" Mahon hopes other breweries will make fonio beers to increase knowledge of the grain."
The Human Cost Of Efficiency And Why It Should Matter To All Investors,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bhaktimirchandani/2024/10/01/the-human-cost-of-efficiency-and-why-it-should-matter-to-all-investors/,2024-10-01T11:12:29Z,"A Closer Look at the Spread of Algorithmic Management Systems -- Which Contributed to $8 Billion in Turnover Costs and a 45% Injury Rate at Amazon -- Across Corporate America

With the help of digital technology, machines can perform complex managerial tasks, like supervising employees and assessing job candidates. It is no wonder that 57% of workers expect AI to change the way they do their current job, and 36% expect it to go as far as replacing their current job. With employees often described as a business's most important assets and human capital a key factor in economic competitiveness, investors and policymakers alike must understand and manage the risks to businesses and workers stemming from the deployment of digital technologies. And because JUST Capital research shows that 51% of workers at Russell 1000 companies, who make up 15% of the employed population in the US in 2021, are not earning a living wage, defined as sufficient to afford a decent standard of living for the worker and his or her family in a particular place, long-term investors must also understand and mitigate the harms that AI can cause to low-wage workers.

While there has been a recent surge of interest in and funding for AI safety or mitigating catastrophic societal-scale threats of uncontrolled AI systems, ex/ante founder and managing partner Zoe Weinberg explains that more proximate harms -- like discrimination, bias, and fairness -- are taking back seat. The time has come for long-term investors to take the drivers' seat to first understand and address these harms.

The ways in which AI can impact job quality are manifold. This article -- the first in a series on AI and the workplace -- focuses on algorithmic management, the delegation of managerial functions to algorithms in an organization, which is becoming an important part of AI-driven digital transformation of companies. This article closely examines the impact of algorithmic management on Amazon to illustrate why algorithmic management systems should matter across portfolios to all investors.

Organizations increasingly rely on algorithmic-based HR decision-making to monitor employees, driven in part by the technology industry's claims that its decision-making tools are efficient and objective. Algorithmic management systems can increase the scale of management operations: matching Uber's 149 million riders with its over 7 million drivers in 10,000 cities across 70 countries through algorithms is indeed unprecedented. Companies also harness algorithms to increase efficiency: UPS trucks have long been equipped with computers that give drivers advice and filled with sensors that record when drivers open doors, buckle their seat belts, and back up their trucks. In addition, algorithmic management systems can make employees more effective: MetLife call center workers receive real-time feedback from AI on whether they are not empathetic enough, sound tired, or speak too quickly.

However, researchers from MIT find that focusing solely on efficiency can lower employee satisfaction, wellbeing, and performance in the long-run by treating workers like ""cogs in a machine"" or triggering employees to continue working to the point of exhaustion.

As Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), a coalition of faith-based and values-based investors, and OpenMIC, a nonprofit focused on responsible use of digital technologies, explain in their new report, Dehumanization, Discrimination and Deskilling: The Impact of Digital Tech on Low-Wage Workers, a critical element of algorithmic management systems is the monitoring and surveillance of workers in violation of their human rights. More specifically, the report outlines a number of human rights impacted by digital technologies, including right to privacy (Article 12 in the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights) and occupational safety and health (ILO Convention 155 in 1981 and 187 in 2006).

Worker well-being, satisfaction, and human rights should matter to all investors. When algorithmic management systems detract from them, the resulting higher worker turnover, higher injury rates, increasing regulatory fines and sanctions, and increasing regulation can materially dampen long-term value creation.

Tying Worker Satisfaction and Safety to the Financial Statements at Amazon

Amazon -- the second largest private employer in the US and the fourth largest US company by market capitalization -- is worth closely examining because of the scale of the impact of algorithmic management on labor wellbeing and shareholder value. The lessons learned from this close examination are relevant to other companies that also use algorithmic management.

Over the past couple of years, researchers, investigators, lawmakers, and workers have been reinforcing each other's claims that Amazon's high injury rates are linked to the company's workplace productivity quotas and surveillance practices. For example, Amazon warehouse worker Daniel Olayiwola, who became the first warehouse worker in corporate history to present his own resolution at Amazon's annual shareholder meeting in 2022, highlighted the dangers of Amazon's ""Time Off Task"" (TOT) policy, which tracks the amount of time per day to the minute that workers do not scan products (including during bathroom breaks), its rate system, the number of products that employees scan per hour, and algorithmic firing based on TOT and rates.

During the pandemic, the New York Times reported 3% turnover a week or 150% turnover a year, which means that on average Amazon had to replace its entire workforce every eight months. According to leaked internal documents marked ""Amazon Confidential"" that tech news website Engadget reviewed and reported on, the cost of attrition was an estimated $8 billion annually for Amazon in 2021 -- nearly 25% of Amazon's 2021 net profit of $33 billion. Engadget further reported that regretted attrition, or workers choosing to leave the company, occurred twice as often as unregretted attrition, or layoffs and firings, and that only one out of three new hires in 2021 stayed with the company for 90 or more days. Amazon's announcement last week to increase the average total compensation package for fulfillment and transportation employees in the US to over $29 per hour -- Amazon's largest ever investment of over $2.2 billion in pay and benefits -- may be a cost-effective way to reduce the $8 billion cost of employee turnover or said differently, it may be hazard pay.

Because it's challenging to update information gleaned from leaked confidential documents, and we must try to understand worker satisfaction and algorithmic monitoring following the pandemic, let's also discuss the interim report released by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which was investigating workplace safety.

According to the report, during Prime Day week in 2019, Amazon's rate of recordable injuries -- the injuries that Amazon is required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) -- was over 10 injuries per 100 workers. In addition, the report explains that Amazon's total injury rate, which includes injuries that the company is not required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), was nearly 45 injuries per 100 workers during the week of Prime Day in 2019. That is almost half of the company's warehouse workers! The report highlighted that although Amazon's total injury rate includes minor injuries, such as bruises and superficial cuts, it also includes serious injuries, such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions, which the company should have treated as recordable injuries.

Amazon examined the issue closely in a memo titled ""2021 Prime Day Lessons Learned,"" which analyzes staffing performance for the period leading up to Prime Day in 2021. As context, Amazon had 117,300 employees in 2013, growing steadily to the peak of 1.6 million in 2021 before declining in 2022 and 2023 to 1.5 million. The document states that Amazon had only a 54.7% success rate meeting its hiring target from the end of March through the beginning of May in 2021. That means Amazon filled barely more than half of the positions it needed to fill to have fully staffed warehouses during that period. From the beginning of May through the end of June -- ending the week of Prime Day -- the company met only 71.2%. Indeed, worker satisfaction and worker safety are deeply intertwined.

Tying Worker Satisfaction and Safety to Regulatory Risk at Amazon

Several states, including New York and California, passed bills that require companies to disclose production quotas to warehouse workers and prevent companies from retaliating against employees for failing to meet undocumented quotas. US Senator Edward Markey (D-Mass) earlier this month introduced the Warehouse Worker Protection Act at a federal level, which if passed would require companies to provide written notice to workers of quotas and prohibits dangerous quotas, including those that rely on constant surveillance.

In addition, the Stop Spying Bosses Act, introduced by US Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Brian Schatz (D-HI), would require any employer collecting data on employees or applicants to disclose such information in a timely and public manner, prohibit employers from collecting sensitive data on individuals (i.e., off-duty data collection, data collection that interferes with organizing, etc.), create rules around the usage of automated decision systems to empower workers in employment decisions, and establish the Privacy and Technology Division at the Department of Labor to enforce and regulate workplace surveillance as novel technologies evolve and grow.

As a case in point, two warehouses violating California's Warehouse Quotas law cost Amazon $5.9 million in June 2024 alone. If passed, the federal bills would expand the scope of costly fines. The biggest threat to Amazon is likely to be action by government regulatory bodies. Amazon's largest regulatory fine was EUR 746 million (US$887 million) in 2021 for violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a European privacy law. More recently, in January 2024, French regulator CNIL fined Amazon France Logistique EUR 32 million (US$35 million) for an ""excessively intrusive"" surveillance system: CNIL said that tracking the inactivity of employees' scanners was illegal and that the system set up to measure the speed at which items were scanned as ""excessive."" As US regulation catches up to EU regulation on AI and privacy, regulatory risk could weigh down Amazon stock price, which at $187.99 per share nears all-time highs.

Amazon is not alone. Algorithmic management systems are pervasive. According to researchers at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, across the country, employers are increasingly using data and algorithms in ways that stand to have profound consequences for wages, working conditions, and equity.

Countless workplace surveillance systems collect data about worker activities through a wide variety of means, including handheld devices, point-of-sale systems, mobile phones, fingerprint scanners, fitness apps, wellness apps, smart cameras, microphones, and body sensors, according to Aiha Nguyen, who explores the future of labor for Data & Society, a nonprofit research organization. Nguyen says algorithmic management systems enable ""work speedups, employment insecurity and instability, a shift of risks of and costs from employers to workers,"" among other issues.

The AI-driven digital transformation of companies is only beginning, and it would behoove long-term investors to understand and shape it. This series of articles -- which will also cover exploitation of data workers, the gig economy, and automated hiring tools -- aims to do just that. Investors that can proactively identify and reduce exposure to these harms in their portfolios should be better able to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and immunize their portfolios from regulatory risk."
IPhone 16 Off To A Rocky Start. What It Means For Apple Stock.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/01/weak-iphone-16-sales-dont-tell-the-whole-story-for-apple-stock/,2024-10-01T11:06:45Z,"Apple stock (NASDAQ: AAPL) has remained largely flat over the past month, underperforming the Nasdaq-100, which gained about 4% in the same period. The company recently launched its iPhone 16 series, and early signs suggest weaker-than-expected demand. For instance, Morgan Stanley estimates that the average lead time for iPhone 16 orders is around 15.2 days, compared to 25.7 days for the iPhone 15 and 18 days for the iPhone 14 series within the first 11 days after Apple started taking orders. But should investors be concerned? We don't think so.

It's important to note that the shorter lead times could be attributed to improved supply chain conditions rather than weak demand. Unlike the last two years, when Apple faced supply constraints due to post-Covid semiconductor shortages, supply has likely caught up. This could mean Apple has simply ramped up production to meet initial demand more efficiently. The iPhone 16 lineup, while solid, offers relatively incremental improvements over last year's models -- mainly camera and processor upgrades. The Pro models come with slightly larger screens, but the real game-changer for this upgrade cycle lies in the upcoming Apple Intelligence software updates. These features, which include enhancements to Siri, new writing assistance tools, and AI-powered image generation, are expected to roll out gradually over the next few quarters. Many customers may be holding off on buying until these features are fully available, potentially driving an uptick in sales later in the cycle. The Apple intelligence features could eventually drive an upgrade cycle. Although primarily a software update, these AI capabilities will be exclusive to the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro models. The only exception is last year's iPhone 15 Pro, which will also receive the update. This limited backward compatibility is likely to create an incentive for users of older iPhones to consider upgrading. Another factor that could work in Apple's favor is the improvement in U.S. wireless carrier deals for the iPhone 16 Pro. Trade-in credits for the Pro models are higher compared to last year, which could drive more customers toward these premium devices. Given that the Pro models carry higher margins, this could boost Apple's profitability in the longer term.

The increase in AAPL stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 35% in 2021, -27% in 2022, and 49% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could AAPL face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

Apple's revenues are expected to scale to record highs this year, with sales projected to grow 9% to $390 billion, per consensus estimates, led by growth in emerging markets such as India. Apple has also been astute at managing its costs. Apple also grew its gross margins to 46% for the first nine months of this fiscal year, reaching near all-time highs, up from about 44% in the year-ago period, driven by a more favorable product mix, and higher service sales. Apple's solid balance sheet and services business cash cow could make the company a relatively safe haven in an uncertain market. See our breakdown of Apple's services business revenues. We have a $219 price estimate for Apple stock, which is about 3% below the current market price. However, Apple stock trades at a P/E of about 34x currently, based on FY'24 consensus earnings, which is slightly high in our view, given the company's mixed growth rates in recent years. See our analysis on Apple Valuation: Is AAPL Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for an overview of what's driving our price estimate for Apple.

While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy following rate cuts, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes."
Above The Clouds: Discover SAS Business Class,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sandramacgregor/2024/10/01/above-the-clouds-discover-sas-business-class/,2024-10-01T10:49:09Z,"Wondering if splurging on business class is worth it? It can certainly be a huge cost when compared to flying economy but some top-flight airlines make the extra expense very much worth it. Read on to discover for yourself whether Scandinavian Airlines (more commonly known as SAS) is one such airline.

The airline is certainly a popular choice for those jetting between North America and Scandinavia, as the carrier offers many direct flights from numerous major cities. One particularly convenient route for Toronto-based Canadians is their non-stop service from Toronto Pearson International Airport to Copenhagen. But regardless of where you're flying, SAS Business Class does its best to encapsulate the essence of Danish hygge: coziness, contentment and well-being -- sensations one does not normally associate with air travel.

First Impressions

As you step aboard the SAS aircraft for your flight from Toronto to Copenhagen, you're immediately struck by the sleek and modern Scandinavian aesthetic of the Business class cabin. The elegant and relaxing hues of grey and black create an inviting space that puts you at ease and hints at the thoughtful attention to detail you'll enjoy throughout your flight. The journey begins with your choice of drink, with champagne being the drink of choice for many travelers, setting the tone for a luxurious and serene travel experience. Best of all, soon after the flight takes off, you'll be served a cocktail with warm nuts, a small touch that embodies the Danish concept of hygge of cozy indulgence.

Seating

Many SAS Business Class flights feature Thompson Aero Vantage XL seats, which convert into fully flat beds at the touch of a button. On the A330s and A350s, the seats are arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration, ensuring direct aisle access for every passenger. The seats offer a generous 22-inch width and convert into a 77-to-80-inch lie-flat bed, providing ample space for relaxation and comfort.

On the A321LRs, used for the Toronto-Copenhagen route, the business class cabin features spacious lie-flat seats but in a less-appealing, alternating 2-2 and 1-1 seating configuration across seven rows, with 22 seats in total. This layout means that there are ""throne"" seats in even-numbered rows, which are perfect for solo travelers, while couples can enjoy neighboring seats in odd-numbered rows. However, if you get placed in the 2-2 seating configuration beside a stranger, it can be a less-than-ideal situation as there is no way to exit your seat (to use the washroom, for example) without disturbing your neighbor. This can be especially vexing if your neighbor is sleeping in the lie-flat seat position as they would be required to move the seat into an upright position to let you exit. All this to say, if you are traveling solo, be sure to select a throne seat.

The seats are easy to position, with intuitive controls that allow you to find your ideal comfort level. The seat adjustment works electronically and also includes adjustable lumbar support. The real show-stopper is a massage feature (SAS is one of the few airlines in the world that offers this function). Throughout the flight, you can enjoy a wide range of entertainment on a 15.4"" HD screen, as well as free Wi-Fi (normally a rare perk even for Business class), as well as extra power and USB outlets.

Food and Drink

SAS Business Class offers an impressive range of delicious Scandinavian-centric dishes. Each course is served from an open-top cart trolley (a charming, old-school touch that adds to the personalized ambiance) that is wheeled down the aisle. To add a sense of panache to the proceedings, one of the flight attendants wears a chef's uniform during the main meal service.

The menu is carefully curated to highlight Scandinavian cuisine, with a focus on local and seasonal ingredients. Dishes include elevated fare, such as braised beef cheeks with red wine sauce and fried potato rosti, as well as Nordic risotto with grilled artichokes. The meal service is ends with a selection of regional cheeses, fresh fruits, and desserts, including scrumptious delights like panna cotta with red currants and peach and berry crumble. Be sure to save a little bit of room for a box of chocolate truffles from Hedh Escalante (a Swedish chocolate maker) to finish off the meal service.

The wine selection is equally impressive, with a focus on old and new world wines. SAS offers a minimum of two whites and two reds, as well as Champagne, including the Charles Heidsieck Brut Réserve MV. Passengers can also enjoy a range of beers, including Mikkeller Celebration IPA, which was specially made for SAS. The airline also has a selection of spirits that showcase Scandinavian distilleries, such as Hernö Gin from Sweden and Harahorn Gin from Norway. SAS's fun signature drink is the ""SASmopolitan,"" a twist on the classic cosmopolitan cocktail, made with Absolut Citron vodka, lingonberry juice, lime, and cranberry. There's also a refreshing non-alcoholic cocktail aptly called ""Above the Clouds"" which contains cranberry juice, apple juice and sprite. Cheers!

It's worth noting that if you are sitting in the back of the Business class section, it's possible that they will run out of your first meal choice. Apparently, according to information provided on the menu, you can preselect your meal to ensure you get your first choice. A thoughtful addition to SAS Business class service would be to do what Delta does, which is to proactively email passengers in Business Class and Premium a few days before their flight and invite them to preselect their meal. This proactive and thoughtful step ensures everyone gets their first choice.

Amenities

There is a dedicated washroom that is reserved for business class passengers. There is also a very small section in the galley (the size of the snack section depends on your flight and plane type) where you can help yourself to snacks like nuts, chocolate and chips. Business class passengers also receive a well-appointed amenity kit featuring popular Scandinavian brands.

The kit (which comes in a playful striped Dux laundry bag or shoe bag) includes:

Service

Scandinavians may have a reputation as being reserved, but warmth and a welcoming energy are what the Business class crew on SAS exudes. Throughout the flight, service is friendly and professional and the crew is proactive in anticipating your needs, whether it's refilling your glass, offering a snack or asking if you'd like an extra pillow.

Overall, flying business class with Scandinavian Airlines is an incredibly enjoyable experience with comfortable seating (yeah massage feature!), delectable cuisine and attentive service."
The Best Performing Energy Stocks Of Q3 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2024/10/01/the-best-performing-energy-stocks-of-q3-2024/,2024-10-01T10:29:20Z,"Robert Rapier is a chemical engineer covering the energy sector.

The S&P 500 finished the third quarter of 2024 with a gain of 5.5%, with all three major U.S. indices recording quarterly advances, though the Nasdaq lagged behind.

Typically, the S&P 500 is somewhere in the middle of the overall sector performances, but not this time. Because the S&P 500 is top-heavy with technology companies -- and because the technology sector was flat in Q3 -- nine of eleven S&P 500 sectors outperformed the S&P 500 in Q3.

Leading all sectors for the first time in quite a while was the utility sector, which gained 19.4%. Close behind was the real estate sector, with a 17.1% gain for the quarter. The only sector in negative territory was energy, which nevertheless managed a 7.3% return year-to-date.

Several factors contributed to strong stock performance in Q3 2024. Many companies reported solid earnings, boosting investor confidence, while stocks of companies involved in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies saw substantial gains, continuing a trend from earlier in the year.

Globally, the economy showed signs of stabilization, with disinflation trends and easing monetary policies in several regions. The quarter ended with the first interest rate cut in four years, which provided an additional boost to stocks.

The energy sector experienced a broad-based decline in Q3, although the midstream segment managed to eke out a small gain. According to data provider FactSet -- which I use to analyze companies -- the Big Three refiners -- Marathon Petroleum MPC , Valero, and Phillips 66 PSX -- were down an average of 8.3%. Valero was the hardest hit, with a loss of 13.3%, followed by Phillips 66 (-6.1%) and Marathon (-5.6%).

The average upstream company -- the pure oil and gas producers -- lost 8.6% in Q3. However, there were several double-digit losers among the upstream companies. Of the 48 public companies FactSet classifies as ""upstream"", 47 turned in a negative return. Two companies that bucked the upstream trend in Q3 were PrimeEnergy Resources, up 29.6% for the quarter, and Viper Energy, which gained 21.9%.

The midstream segment outperformed the broader energy sector in Q3. Among the 39 companies that FactSet classifies as ""midstream"", the average return was 1.2%. TC Energy led the midstream segment with a gain of 27.4%, followed by Golar LNG, which gained 18.2%.

The integrated supermajors were mostly lower, losing 4.8% on average. Among this group, the best performer (and only positive performer) for the quarter was ExxonMobil, which gained 2.6%. TotalEnergies SE was the second-best performer with a decline of 2.1%.

Energy prices have remained moderate in recent months, with record U.S. oil production helping to stabilize global prices. Although OPEC+ had hinted that it might begin easing production cuts this month, current oil prices are likely to delay that move. Global supply and demand are relatively balanced, and OPEC+ will likely prefer to avoid disrupting the market."
Investors Urged To Address Toxic Chemical-Related Financial Risks,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiehailstone/2024/10/01/investors-urged-to-address-toxic-chemical-related-financial-risks/,2024-10-01T10:15:07Z,"Investors could face $20 billion in corporate liabilities associated with plastic-related pollution in the U.S. alone, according to a new analysis.

The report by the financial think tank Planet Tracker urges investors to review their investments and reduce their ""toxicity debt"".

It also urges investors to assess the risk premium associated with toxic chemicals, which can leave companies financially exposed to lawsuits for decades.

And it claims investors face an estimated $20 billion near-term corporate liabilities from plastic-related pollution in the US. alone, as the chemical industry is increasingly exposed to fines and litigation costs.

In addition, it adds legal risks can also trigger profit warnings, asset sales and dividend cuts.

The analysis comes after California's attorney general, Rob Bonta announced the state was filing a lawsuit against ExxonMobil for allegedly engaging in a decades-long campaign of deception that caused and exacerbated the global plastics pollution crisis.

The Planet Tracker report focuses on the financial risk posed by what are described as novel entities, which are artificial chemicals and other human-made pollutants.

The study also warns a new chemical substance is being registered every 1.4 minutes somewhere in the world with the Chemical Abstracts Service.

According to the report, there is a ""significant risk"" to not knowing or disclosing the toxicity of these chemicals.

In Europe and North America, it adds more than 350,000 chemicals and mixtures of chemicals have been registered for production and use.

And it warns most of these chemicals are untested.

For example, it claims around 80% of these chemicals have been in use for at least 10 years without yet having undergone an EU safety assessment.

Planet Tracker's head of data Chris Baldock said novel entities pose a"" real financial risk"" to companies and their financiers in an interview.

""Novel entities are everywhere,"" added Baldock. ""Around 80% of all the chemical stock that has ever been produced is still in products that are currently in use.

""And then there is the pervasiveness of novel entities in all the sectors of the economy, from packaging to textiles.

""This is not an area which has had a lot of focus before, but we have tried to gather as much evidence to point investors and financiers to the risks""

Baldock told me the production of chemicals and goods containing toxic additives is not slowing down, with hundreds of companies producing new products every year.

He added Planet Tracker recently launched its petrochemical investor statement, whereby signatories call on companies to transparently disclose and define strategies targets to reduce the impacts of plastics.

The statement also calls on signatories to identify and address hazardous polymers and chemicals of concern in their products.

Planet Tracker's director of research, John Willis said from a financial point-of-view, novel entities are a ""complete and utter nightmare"" in an interview.

Willis added it is ""almost inevitable"" that some chemical producers face litigation and pointed to the ongoing controversy of PFAS or ""forever chemicals"" in drinking water and the recent developments in California as two recent examples.

""The longer companies exposed to novel entities delay transitioning to sustainable alternatives, the greater their liabilities are likely to become,"" added Willis.

""Investors need to ensure they are valuing these risks accurately and transition to more sustainable substances."""
Culture Wars And Unconstitutional Laws: The Threat To America's Future,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffraikes/2024/10/01/culture-wars-and-unconstitutional-laws-the-threat-to-americas-future/,2024-10-01T10:03:58Z,"Ill-advised and unconstitutional ideological crusades by conservative state legislators are infringing on the rights of American businesses and endangering America's future.

The Climate Crisis is Here...

It's no secret that the accelerating impacts of climate change are being felt worldwide. 2024 is likely to be the warmest year in recorded history, and nine of the hottest years on record have all been in the last decade. To take just one example, residents of Phoenix, Arizona experienced 113 days in a row this summer with over 100-degree temperatures.

With hotter days come more extreme weather events. In what was billed as a once-in-a-1000-year event, Sarasota, Florida and its environs experienced as much as ten inches of rain in just 24 hours this past June. (This followed once-in-a-millennium rainstorms in St. Louis, Kentucky, Death Valley in 2022, and Fort Lauderdale in 2023.) July saw Hurricane Beryl become the earliest-ever Category 5 hurricane to develop in the Atlantic. Last week, after another once-in-a-thousand-year rainstorm in Western NC, Hurricane Helene devastated the Southeast, bringing catastrophic flooding to Appalachian cities.

As climate impacts become increasingly extreme, we are collectively racing against time to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions before we reach 1.5 degrees of warming. The good news is the global renewable energy boom is here. With costs coming down and technology improving, the world will install an estimated 593 gigawatts of solar capacity this year, nearly 30% more than in 2023 and six times more than in 2019. Here in the U.S., led by California and Texas, we now have eight times more solar power and twice as much wind power as a decade ago. Battery storage capacity is also expected to double this year, meaning more renewable energy can be saved and used whenever needed.

...But Texas Legislators Would Halt Our Progress

Since its oil boom days, Texas has always been an energy leader, and these days are no exception - Texas now leads the country in wind power and is second only to California in solar. The clean energy transition is crucial for the Lone Star state since Texas is especially threatened by warming temperatures and hurricanes. Its statewide energy grid is also increasingly overwhelmed: Texas suffered 210 power outages between 2020 and 2023, more than any other state.

So, given the urgent necessity of decarbonizing our energy grid and Texas's role as a renewable energy leader, why have its lawmakers been trying to sabotage progress against climate change?

In 2021, Texas conservatives passed S.B. 13, a misguided and arguably unconstitutional law requiring all state entities, like pension funds and the K-12 education endowment, to divest any business that has moved away from supporting fossil fuels. Meant as an ideological attack against the growing move towards Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing, S.B. 13, according to a study by the Texas Association of Business, cost Texas nearly $700 million in lost economic activity, $181 million in annual earnings, more than 3000 full-time jobs, and more than $37 million in tax revenues in F.Y. 2022-2023.

S.B. 13's ideological crusade also prompted five of the largest underwriters for municipal bonds in Texas - JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Fidelity - to exit the Texas market, meaning much higher borrowing costs for Texas cities. These five banks ""used to underwrite about 35% of the debt in the market,"" notes Wharton Business professor Daniel Garrett, ""so they've left a really big gap."" The Texas public school fund also pulled $8.5 billion from Blackrock to comply with the law.

Last month, supported by Democracy Forward, the American Sustainable Business Council (ASBC) filed a lawsuit against S.B. 13 and a similar law, S.B. 19, which forces state funds to divest from companies that restrict business with gunmakers. ""SB-13 is not just a misguided policy,"" says David Levine, president and co-founder of ASBC. ""It is an unconstitutional attack that stifles free speech and punishes businesses for prioritizing responsible investments."" In fact, an Oklahoma District Court Judge has already struck down Oklahoma's anti-ESG law for similar reasons.

As Chris Tomlinson wrote in the Houston Chronicle of this ""unconstitutional, authoritarian power grab that hurts all Texans,"" ""whether you worry about climate change or not, the real issue is whether the government should dictate any company's investment strategy. True conservatives believe elected officials should stay out of private sector decisions.""

It's Not Just Texas.

Unfortunately, Texas lawmakers are not alone in these attempts to hamstring American businesses. Per Reuters, 2022 saw at least 44 new bills or laws in 17 red states that attempted to penalize companies for investment strategies or behaviors they deemed too progressive, up from a dozen in 2021.

Among these was Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's infamous ""Stop WOKE Act,"" which attempted to ban workplace trainings on improving race relations and which a federal judge permanently blocked in July. Similarly, the Republican-controlled House in Georgia passed a bill cutting tax breaks for Delta Airlines, the state's largest private employer, after its CEO lambasted new voting restrictions there. (The bill failed to pass the Senate.)

Even more frightening, the anti-ESG push has now been taken up by the authors of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation blueprint to supercharge a second Trump presidency. In their report, they call for Trump's Department of Labor to ""remove ESG considerations from ERISA,"" the law setting minimum standards for pension and health plans. After deriding ESG for taking into account woke causes like ""reducing greenhouse gas emissions,"" the Project 2025 report decrees that ""DOL should prohibit investing in ERISA plans on the basis of any factors that are unrelated to investor risks and returns."" However, considering the impacts of climate change is precisely the type of long-term risk that businesses and investors should be evaluating to protect their returns and financial health.

Of course, the government plays an indispensable role in regulating companies, so they follow the law, do right by their workers and communities, and don't conduct business with America's enemies. But trying to force U.S. companies, by law, to uphold far-right conservative ideology is simply a bridge too far. It is, in a word, unconstitutional. And amidst a global climate crisis that threatens all Americans, especially those most vulnerable in our society, these misguided ideological crusades don't just jeopardize our future prosperity and global competitiveness -- they endanger our communities, economy, and planet."
"The Next U.S. President Won't Define Crypto's Future, Congress Will",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2024/10/01/the-next-us-president-wont-define-cryptos-future-congress-will/,2024-10-01T10:03:54Z,"The national conversation around cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and U.S. innovation leadership has centered on the White House this election cycle. Presidential candidates Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have both made notable shifts regarding this emerging industry of financial technology. Harris has pivoted from President Biden's antagonistic approach, led by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and prudential regulators, to a more pro-innovation tone focused on blockchain and digital assets. These technologies, she claims, are crucial to her ""Opportunity Economy,"" aimed at empowering middle-class families and small businesses.

Meanwhile, Trump, who once called bitcoin a ""scam,"" now vows to make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and pledges to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler (the head of an independent agency who can only be removed for cause) on his first day in office. Although these promises grab attention, the reality is that the President's influence over the future of digital assets is limited. It is Congress that holds the real power to shape the regulatory framework for crypto.

Congress Holds The Real Power

Congress, as the first branch of government, holds the key to determining the future of digital assets in the U.S. While presidential candidates may dominate headlines, under Article II of the Constitution, the President's powers are limited. The President cannot unilaterally enact laws or overhaul regulations for digital assets; their role is primarily to enforce the laws passed by Congress and oversee regulatory agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

Executive orders, while impactful, are not laws and can be undone by future administrations. For long-term stability in the digital asset industry, Congress must pass legislation. Yet, much of the public and crypto advocates tend to focus on presidential races, overlooking Congress's critical role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation.

The ""Do-Nothing"" Congress And Regulatory Bottlenecks

The current Congress has been criticized for inaction, having passed fewer than 230 bills into law during the 2023-2024 term, well below prior legislative sessions. This delay has hindered the development of a modern legal framework for digital finance, leaving regulatory agencies like the SEC to rely on outdated laws from the 1930s, ill-suited for today's digital asset landscape.

Without clear legislation, these agencies continue to enforce old frameworks, leading to regulatory confusion, inconsistent enforcement, and stifled innovation. Democratic and Republican leaders have pledged to change this, with support from figures like House Leader Mike Johnson. However, without decisive action, the U.S. risks falling behind in global digital asset innovation.

Congress's Crucial Role In Shaping Crypto Policy

Congress holds the unique authority to craft laws that reflect the country's evolving needs, particularly in emerging sectors like blockchain and digital assets. The SEC operates under laws such as the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 -- long before the internet or digital currencies existed. Applying these outdated laws to digital assets has led to friction and uncertainty, as many assets -- often dynamic in nature -- do not fit neatly into existing categories and twentieth century legal frameworks.

Agencies like the SEC and CFTC are forced to apply outdated laws in ways that extend beyond their original intent, leading to concerns of regulatory overreach. A recent federal court ruling highlighted this issue, finding that the SEC acted arbitrarily and capriciously in its denials of bitcoin exchange-traded funds. This kind of regulatory overreach hampers innovation, creating uncertainty around compliance and making it challenging for startups to succeed. Industry leaders continue to call for clear rules of the road from the SEC. However, executive agencies get their rulemaking and enforcement powers from Congress. Accordingly, the clearest rules will come from Congress.

The FIT21 Act and Securities Clarity Act

A significant step in this direction occurred with the passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which included Representative Tom Emmer's Securities Clarity Act. This act aims to provide much-needed legal clarity for the digital asset industry by distinguishing between an asset and the securities contract it may be part of. As Emmer stated, ""This is an important opportunity for the United States to lead... The FIT21 Act will give entrepreneurs the clarity and assurance they need to build here, in the United States.""

Before the FIT21 Act, one of the biggest regulatory hurdles for digital assets was the confusion over how they were classified under existing securities laws. Many cryptocurrencies start as part of a securities contract but may evolve into something else once a project becomes fully decentralized. The Securities Clarity Act, now Title II of the FIT21 Act, addresses this by providing the flexibility for a digital asset project to transition from centralization (controlled by developers or investors) to decentralization, where it operates independently.

Emmer emphasized this point during his remarks on the House floor, saying, ""Among the many important provisions in this bill is my Securities Clarity Act... which provides the legal flexibility for a digital asset project to transition from centralization to decentralization. This transition is critical to the future peer-to-peer digital economy.""

This legislative clarity is crucial for allowing digital asset projects to grow without unnecessary regulatory hurdles. By passing FIT21, Congress aims to keep U.S. innovation onshore and ensure the country remains competitive in the global digital economy.

The Limits Of Leaving It To The Executive Branch

While Congress often delegates authority to executive agencies, this does not give those agencies free rein. Agencies like the SEC are tasked with executing the laws passed by Congress, not creating new laws through regulation. When Congress fails to act however, as it has with respect to the crypto asset industry, agencies like the SEC are left to make judgment calls, leading to inconsistent enforcement that chills innovation.

The SEC's approach of enforcing regulations on a case-by-case basis, without setting clear industry-wide guidelines, has been particularly problematic for digital asset companies. Ongoing legal battles over the classification of certain tokens as securities have cast a chilling effect on the industry. The absence of comprehensive legislation has left both regulators and businesses in a state of uncertainty. Even agency heads disagree on the best approach. While Gensler criticized FIT21, CFTC Chair Rostin Benham commented that with successful passage of the bill, he was ""confident"" his agency could build a regulatory framework within 12 months.

Congress must have the last word and settle these issues by passing comprehensive legislation, such as FIT21, that provides clear guidance to both agencies and businesses.

Shifting Congressional Attitudes Toward Crypto

Key members of Congress are increasingly supporting digital asset innovation. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), once a critic, now acknowledges the importance of engaging with technologies like AI and crypto, stating, ""We've got to move forward with AI, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency... we have to learn more.""

At the recent Crypto4Harris town hall, aimed at strengthening ties between Harris's campaign and the crypto industry, several pro-crypto lawmakers voiced their support. Rep. Wiley Nickel (D-NC) called for Harris to adopt a more pro-crypto stance, while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) expressed optimism about passing bipartisan crypto legislation, stating, ""Crypto is here to stay no matter what. So, Congress must get it right.""

Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) also demonstrated support, signaling growing bipartisan backing for a regulatory framework that balances innovation with consumer protection.

Industry leaders echo these sentiments. Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, emphasized the importance of bipartisan efforts, noting that many in Congress already understand how critical digital assets are to the U.S.'s financial future. Will Schweitzer, co-organizer of Crypto4Harris, added, ""Bipartisan Congressional support for Digital Asset legislation continues to gain momentum.""

The StandWithCrypto.com database shows over 50 Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-PA), and Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), are now somewhat or strongly supportive of pro-crypto legislation. This growing base of support suggests that Congress is ready to proceed with bipartisan long-term regulatory changes in the digital asset space.

Why Congress Must Lead on Crypto

To keep the U.S. at the forefront of blockchain technology, Congress must prioritize policies that foster innovation. This goes beyond regulatory reform that tinkers at the edges -- it requires a fundamental shift in how emerging technologies are approached.

Unlike the Executive branch, Congress holds the power to create laws specifically tailored to the needs of the crypto industry. By collaborating with stakeholders, experts, retail investors, and innovators, lawmakers can design frameworks that foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection.

As G. Clay Miller of Penrose Partners noted, ""We will have a pro-crypto President no matter who wins in November, but the real work begins in January."" The future of digital assets in the U.S. depends on the legislative framework Congress creates, as only Congress can provide the long-term stability the industry needs.

Now is the time to focus where the real power lies -- on Congress."
"Emmanuel Perrin, CEO Of Richemont's TimeVallée, On First USA Location",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertanaas/2024/10/01/emmanuel-perrin-ceo-of-richemonts-timevalle-on-first-usa-location/,2024-10-01T10:03:26Z,"The fate of luxury retail in America, especially as it pertains to watches and horology, has been in a state of flux over the past decade or so. Many brands have shifted from selling their fine timepieces via retail jewelry stores to opening their own mono-brand boutiques, operated in house. Some also recognize the importance of teaming with experienced retail partners for their mono-brand stores. Now, though, Richemont-owned TimeVallée brings the retail partnership to new heights in America -- collaborating with local, family operated retailer The Kodak Group -- to open its first American-based Swiss multi-brand luxury watch shopping destination.

In a rare one-on-one interview with Emmanuel Perrin, CEO of TimeVallée, he noted that the opening of this store was a long time coming. While America was on the radar for a while, finding the right partner and location (as Perrin calls it, finding the right white space) was key.

Richemont's TimeVallée started just about a decade ago, with its first stores in Asia. The idea was to create a luxury shopping destination, with top-notch client care, for Richemont to showcase many of its brands, sometimes even alongside non-Richemont brands. In all instances, these stores are operated by retail partners, not by the Richemont Group. As the TimeVallée concept grew, stores opened outside of Asia -fanning throughout Europe, the United Kingdom, the Middle East and elsewhere.

As of earlier this year, TimeVallée, with more than 50 stores in 14 countries, had yet to enter the American market. Now, after joining forces with New Jersey-based The Kodak Group, TimeVallée opened its first USA store this past July (with a grand opening event slated for late fall), in the American Dream Mall in East Rutherford, NJ.

One of America's largest and most lavish malls, American Dream, a stone's throw from New York City, is billed as the place where fashion, food, experiences and more come together. The malls boasts theme parks (think water parks, snow parks and even Nickelodeon), hundreds of iconic brand-name stores, and a luxury wing, called The Avenue, dedicated solely to the world's most renowned brands.

In this wing, shoppers will find a glamorous champagne bar, sculptures and topiaries, a balcony beneath a canopy of string lights - all alongside glamorous retail stores. Cartier, Montblanc, Dolce & Gabbana, Hermes, Gucci, Rolex, Tiffany & Co, and a host of others draw the attention of the most elite shoppers.

It is in this luxurious atmosphere that TimeVallée, operated by The Kodak Group, has opened its doors. The 2,540-square-foot luxury store was bult from the ground up, as no previous store existed in its space in the still-fledgling Avenue wing. The outcome is a deft blend of cream colors, generous waves and circular patterns that seem to ebb, flow and come together for an open and inviting feel.

There are no doors to walk through here; instead, the generous entryway spans about 15 feet, and the façade boasts meandering curved lines reminiscent of the Swiss mountains and valleys, but all in gold tones. One can easily enter to look at a single brand or peruse the entire selection of seven of the most prestigious brands that run the gamut from Vacheron Constantin to IWC Schaffhausen, Panerai, Piaget, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Baume & Mercier, and Roger Dubuis.

Each brand has its own representation, not just in selection of product, but also in terms of image and design that melds beautifully with the overall flow of the store. With a desire to offer personalized experiences for shoppers, TimeVallée boasts open spaces, lots of seating and even the Time Café' for drinks and small bites.

""It took us a while to come to America because this is the biggest economy of the world. It's the biggest market. America has always been a bit more mature and more qualitative, as well. You have fantastic stores throughout the US, so we needed to find a white spot where we could extend the reach for several maisons at once and do it with the right partner who is able to reach those pockets of clients that aren't as reachable through existing stores,"" said Perrin, noting that certain Richemont brands had already been working with The Kodak Group in its Hoboken store and there was very good rapport.

Once the partnership with The Kodak Group to open the TimeVallée store was established, the building of the store, from the ground up and according to the TimeVallée designs, took nearly two full years. As mentioned, the store opened in July as the first TimeVallée store, with plans to open another three stores over the next year or so already in the works. Additionally, says Perrin, TimeVallée just opened a store in Montreal - marking another country to call hom.

So, who is the client shopping at American Dream's TimeVallée? It isn't New Yorkers. According to Bradley Kodak, co-founder of The Kodak Group, ""We're getting a huge amount of clientele from Bergen County, which is one of the wealthiest counties in the state. And the traffic that we're seeing here is very, very qualitative. So, we're excited to attract these new customers.""

Another big draw to the TimeVallée store, in addition to the client care there, the American Dream mall's reputation and the great location, is the fact that customers can experience multiple brands at different prices. As opposed to having separate salons for each maison, seven brands are all housed under the same roof here, says Perrin. The store is warm, welcoming and open and there is plenty of opportunity to bring clients back to experience another brand or event."
Mortgage Rates 1 October 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-01-10-24/,2024-10-01T10:02:55Z,"Bank Rate was held at 5% in September by the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steadying interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Good news on inflation and interest rates has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy. We will know more in its Autumn Budget on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.58%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.56% and 4.23% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 3.73%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 3.99% and 3.71% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.39%, with the best in this category priced at 5.14%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stands at 7.24%, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 September there were 6,460 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,657 last month. But the number has largely grown. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

Nationwide's latest house price report (published 30 September) reported that average property values in September were 3.7% higher than the previous year. It marks the strongest annual house price growth since November 2022. On a monthly basis, the rise was 0.7% when compared to August. Nationwide, which bases its index on mortgage data, puts the cost of the average home in September at £266,094.

The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before. It marks the fifth consecutive month of rises. On a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."
What's New With AMD Stock?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/01/whats-happening-with-amd-stock/,2024-10-01T10:00:44Z,"Advanced Micro Devices stock (NASDAQ: AMD) has fared well over the past month, rising by close to 20%. This is roughly in line with rival Intel stock (NASDAQ: INTC) which has gained about 19% over the same period. AMD has benefited from a couple of factors, including the Fed's recent interest rate cut as well as recent customer wins for its GPU business. Here's a closer look at some of the recent developments for AMD.

The Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points earlier this month, marking the first interest rate cut in close to four years. Also, check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed's next move? With the current benchmark federal funds rate standing at 4.75% to 5% post the cut, there still remains room for the central bank to lower interest rates further. Lower rates are typically beneficial for growth sectors including technology, which have higher earning potential in outer years, as lower discount rates boost the present value of future earnings. Lower interest rates could also reduce financing costs for builders of large data centers, potentially driving up capital spending in the space, and helping players like AMD which sell CPUs and GPUs for servers.

AMD has also seen some tailwinds from the generative AI trend. Graphics processing units are becoming the de-facto chips for running AI-related workloads. AMD has launched new chips, such as the MI300X chip, targeted at large language model training and inference for generative AI workloads. AMD recently upped its guidance for MI300 sales this year to $4.5 billion and the number could be still higher. Oracle recently chose AMD's accelerated computing chips to power its latest supercluster for high-intensity AI workloads, after testing showed that AMD's GPUs delivered low latency and strong performance at a competitive price. With Nvidia's GPUs costing upward of $25,000 each, customers like Oracle are actively seeking more cost-effective alternatives, positioning AMD to grow its GPU business for data centers. To be sure, Nvidia has been the hottest of the AI stocks, rising by roughly 2.5x this year. But did you know that there is a lesser-known AI name that could offer more upside than Nvidia?

Besides this, there have been reports that AMD has secured the contract to design the processor for Sony's yet-to-be-announced next-gen PlayStation 6, edging out Intel. The deal will help AMD to continue its long-term relationship with Sony, as the company designs the chip for the PlayStation 5. Although the PS6 is expected to launch in 2027 or beyond, it could be a reasonably large money spinner for AMD, given that Sony has already shipped about 62 million PS5 consoles.

Now the increase in AMD stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 57% in 2021, -55% in 2022, and 128% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could AMD face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

AMD trades at about 48x consensus 2024 earnings, which is a relatively high multiple. although the ongoing recovery in the PC market and surge in demand from AI applications could justify this. We value AMD stock at about $168 per share, roughly in line with the current market price. See our analysis on AMD Valuation: Is AMD Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for more details on what's driving our price estimate for AMD. Also, check out our analysis of AMD Revenue for more details on the company's key revenue streams.

While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing for the U.S. economy following rate cuts, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes."
Huge Spike In Russian Drone Attacks For Winter With Chinese Help,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2024/10/01/huge-spike-in-russian-drone-attacks-for-winter-with-chinese-help/,2024-10-01T09:16:27Z,"Russia's strategic drone assault on Ukraine is has reached a new intensity. Attacks which were rising gradually through 2024 but have spiked dramatically, with over 1300 Shahed long-range drones reported in September, far higher than any previous month. This is the first month that drone attacks have been recorded every single day, as the details painstakingly compiled by ShahedTracker show. While most drones are shot down, some get through and cause significant damage.

Although Ukraine reports all these drones simply as as 'Shaheds' there are increasing signs that the Iranian-designed Shahed are being supplemented by at least three other types, some reportedly supplied directly by China.

These attacks are of critical strategic importance. Ukraine's power infrastructure is already severely damaged. As the Washington Post noted this week: ""The best-case scenario is just four hours of power cuts a day, but it could also end up being 20 hours of darkness or more a day in the depths of Ukraine's frigid winter.""

If the attacks continue at this increased level through the winter they could have a major impact on Ukraine's economy and morale. What weapons is Russia bringing to bear in this long-range bombardment?

The mainstay of the assault is the Shahed-136, known in Russia as Geran-2 (""Geranium-2""). The Shahed-136 is a one-way attack drone developed by Iran, with a seven-foot wingspan, a warhead of around 100 pounds and a range in excess of 600 miles. A propeller engine with 115 mph cruising speed means the Shahed is slower, less powerful and easier to shoot down than traditional cruise missiles, but it costs much less and can be produced at scale. Russia makes Shaheds in a giant new factory in Alabuga with cheap labor -- students drafted in from a nearby technical college and workers brought in from Africa.

We have seen several modifications from the basic Shahed. New versions have at least three types of warhead, and some carry 4G cell modems which communicate via the Ukrainian cellphone network; more recently a Shahed was found with Starlink communications. Black, supposedly radar-absorbing coating, probably to make them less visible at night is now standard.

Earlier waves of Shaheds came in at very low level, now with the prevalence of mobile air defence groups they approach at high altitude until they reach their target, so they can only be brought down by expensive missiles or by aircraft and helicopters.

According to an estimate in the Wall Street Journal, Russia aims to produce 500 Shaheds per month. The numbers of drones now being launched suggest other types are now involved.

As we reported in August 2023, the tenants were evicted from the Italmas shopping mall, 700 miles east of Moscow when the Aersocan company acquired it as a drone factory. The factory is for a new model, Izdelie 54 ('Product 54') described a loitering munition with a range of over 200 kilometers. Product 52 and Product 53 from Aersocan subsidiary ZALA are two versions of the highly successful Lancet tactical kamikaze drone, while Product 55 is a 'jam-proof' kamikaze FPV.

Product-54 was seen in the background of TV news footage when Putin visited an Aersocan facility in September 2023. It has a delta-wing layout similar to the Shahed.

Towards the end of 2023 Russian media reported the new drones in action though this was not confirmed. The drones were described as being smaller than the familiar Shaheds, and their engine makes a different noise; this was identified at Product-54 and has been given the nickname Italmas. Others call them 'lawnmowers' from the engine sound, to distinguish them from Shaheds, which are called 'mopeds'.

The Italmas has a DLE 60-type engine, a popular 60 cc engine for hobby drones from Chinese makers DLE engines. This delivers a fraction of the power of the Shahed's MD550 engine, reinforcing the impression that Italmas is a lighter, cheaper drone with a small warhead, thrown in to add to the numbers and confuse defenders.

Images of another new Russian drone appeared on social media sites in July. This is also smaller than the Shahed and as a different configuration with a conventional tail.

A Russian unit called Stalin's Falcons posted further details in a video later that month. They say the new drone is called Gerbera (another flower), and can carry out reconnaissance or decoy missions in addition to kamikaze attacks. Gerbera has a camera in its nose, and the video shows it can be guided visually to the target. A captured unit also had a SIM card and modem, so in theory it could be guided from long range via the cellphone network. It is a product of the Gastello Design Bureau, rather than any of the majors; the name 'Gastello,' from a famous Soviet pilot, was previously used for a Russian FPV which may be from the same makers.

Gerbera is described as Shahed's 'little sister', again implying a smaller payload. Further details such as warhead and range are unknown, but given that a Gerbera was brought down outside Kyiv it can travel several hundred kilometers at least. Ukrainian sources suggest that Gerberas main role is as a decoy.

The most alarming new drone is the Garpiya-3 (""Harpy-3""). According to a report in Reuters, the Garpiya-3 was designed by a subsidiary of Russian state-owned weapons company Almaz-Antey and has a range of about 2,000 km / 1200 miles with a warhead of 50 kilos / 110 lbs .

According to Reuters, Garpiya-3 does not just use Chinese components but will be produced ""at scale at a factory in China.""

We already knew that China made Shahed-type attack drones. A video from September 2023 shows the test of a Chinese Sunflower-200 drone - another flower name, and apparently a straight copy of the Shahed. One Chinese company even briefly offered another Shahed clone in the Ali Baba online marketplace. Officially sold for 'surveying, mapping, inspection' the $57,000 XHZ-50 with its 50 kilo / 110-pound payload offered strategic attack capability for the price of an SUV.

If China actually uses its industrial drone capacity to supply Russia with strategic weapons, then the number of drones will be limited only by Russia's ability to pay for them. Reuters have seen documents indicating that two Garpiya-3s have already been delivered to Almaz-Antey in Russia via a Russian intermediary. The delivery dates were not known, so larger shipments may already have been made.

Ukraine has beaten back waves of 400-600 Shaheds a month. Fighting off twice or three times that number with dwindling reserves of surface-to-air missiles will be a bigger challenge. The infrastructure has taken a pummeling over the last two and a half years, and further intense bombardment could tear holes in it.

Greater discrimination is important. If the defenders can separate the smaller Gerbera and Italmas they can concentrate their efforts on the real threat. And if new FPV interceptor drones, which have been effective against Russian reconnaissance drones, prove effective against Shaheds they will be a game changer.

Two things are clear. One is that Ukraine needs better air defenses, something the West can help with. Another is that no country, except possibly Israel, is ready for the sort of massed long-range drone barrage likely to feature in any future war anywhere in the world."

Google Doubles Down On Southeast Asia Investments With $1 Billion Data Center Project In Thailand,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/yessarrosendar/2024/09/30/google-doubles-down-on-southeast-asia-investments-with-1-billion-data-center-project-in-thailand/,2024-10-01T04:03:24Z,"Alphabet's Google will spend $1 billion to build new cloud computing and data center infrastructure in Thailand, deepening its digital investments in Southeast Asia.

Google said it will develop the digital facilities in Bangkok and the eastern province of Chonburi. The project aims to improve access to artificial intelligence applications and equip Thai's with digital skills, it said in a statement released on Monday.

""Google's investment in its data center and cloud region in Chonburi and Bangkok, respectively, coupled with growing Thai expertise in cloud computing and AI, are perfectly aligned with our national Cloud First Policy,"" Paetongtarn Shinawatra, Prime Minister of Thailand said in the statement. ""This synergy will accelerate the development of innovative digital services and in turn unlock economic opportunities and enhance the quality of life for all Thais.""

A recent Deloitte study projects that Google's latest investment in Thailand can add $4 billion to the country's GDP by 2029 and help create an average of 14,000 jobs annually from 2025 to 2029.The facilities in Bangkok and Chonburi are expected to meet the growing demand for cloud computing capabilities and AI innovations, as well as drive usage of the company's popular digital services like Search, Maps, and Google Workspace.

In June, Google partnered with Thai billionaire Sarath Ratanavadi's Gulf Energy to offer Google Distributed Cloud services in the country. The duo also plans to develop additional services within the Google Cloud ecosystem, including potential future ventures into AI and cybersecurity solutions.

Apart from its Thai initiatives, Google has commenced construction of a $2 billion data center and cloud infrastructure project at Elmina Business Park in Selangor, north of Kuala Lumpur. The project, which was originally unveiled in May, is projected to generate over $3.2 billion in Malaysia's economy and create 26,500 jobs by 2030.

""Google's investments in infrastructure, digital skilling, and sustainability represent progress on our joint efforts with the Government of Malaysia to create high-value jobs and bring the benefits of AI to local communities and companies,"" Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Alphabet and Google, said in a separate statement. ""Together, we will empower individuals and businesses in Malaysia to innovate, grow, and fully harness the potential of the digital age.""

Google Cloud also announced a partnership with Dagang NeXchange Berhad (DNeX) to support its data center facility in Malaysia. As part of the deal, DNeX will offer cloud solutions in Malaysia specifically designed to meet the digital needs of organizations in regulated sectors, including public services, healthcare, and energy.

Underscoring Southeast Asia's growing importance, Google has been stepping up its investments in Southeast Asia. In June, it announced plans to will boost its data center and cloud infrastructure spending in Singapore to over $5 billion, a more than five-fold increase from $850 million in 2018.

Other tech giants including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have been ramping up investments across the region with a population of about 675 million people. with Malaysia becoming the region's fastest growing data center hub. Malaysian tycoon Francis Yeoh's YTL Power has partnered with billionaire Jensen Huang's Nvidia to build an AI-powered data center in the southern Malaysian state of Johor, north of Singapore."
The Surprising Deregulation Legacy Of Jimmy Carter -- And Why It Still Matters,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/waynecrews/2024/09/30/the-surprising-deregulation-legacy-of-jimmy-carter-and-why-it-still-matters/,2024-10-01T03:33:36Z,"In the Wall Street Journal, former Texas Sen. Phil Gramm shared a compelling account of how President Jimmy Carter -- who turns 100 October 1 -- has not received the credit he deserves for the economic deregulation of the 1970s and early 1980s. Outlining the transformative legislative efforts of that era, Gramm wrote:

Without Mr. Carter's deregulation of airlines, trucking, railroads, energy and communications, America might not have had the ability to diversify its economy and lead the world in high-tech development when our postwar domination of manufacturing ended in the late 1970s. The Carter deregulation helped fuel the Reagan economic renaissance and continues to make possible the powerful innovations that remake our world.

Carter also deserves recognition for promoting the concept of a regulatory budget -- a notion now commonly associated with Republicans, but which Carter pioneered during his presidency.

A New Era of Expanding Regulation

While Carter's era saw a significant rollback in economic regulation, today's policymakers seem incapable of creating a similar sustained program for downsizing government spending, subsidies and the sprawling regulatory state. In fact, we've seen a return to, and even an expansion of, the regulatory frameworks that Carter helped dismantle with surges in economic, technology and social policy regulation.

Budget battles have been put on temporary hold with winks and secret handshakes ahead of the 2024 election, but trillion-dollar interest payments and a looming debt ceiling crisis await in early 2025. The successor to the Congress that just scooted out of town after approving yet another signature stopgap spending extension must acknowledge the urgent need for sweeping eliminations of federal departments and agencies as a prerequisite for meaningful spending and regulatory reductions.

As Gramm noted, Carter's elimination of the Civil Aeronautics Board was a significant triumph; however, new proposals for airline regulation have gained traction in the Biden administration. This underscores the reality that departments, agencies, commissions, and offices responsible for allocating spending and administering regulations are created far more frequently than they are eliminated.

What Happens to Regulations When Agencies Are Abolished?

As Congress confronts the reality that the federal government cannot -- and should not -- do it all, the question arises: What happens to the rules and regulations administered by a shuttered agency?

This is a key question for the 119th and future Congresses. The answer will depend on the specifics of ""Terminator"" legislation aimed at abolishing agencies. Such legislation should also explicitly repeal or sunset the rules and regulations once enforced by these agencies, ensuring that their regulatory influence and legal effect vanishes alongside. The aim would be for administrators to pursue other interests in the private economy or spend more time with their families. But it has not quite worked out that way.

Carter's Civil Aeronautics Board Example

Conscious nullification was uppermost in mind when the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 shuttered the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). The CAB's then-chairman Alfred Kahn, an ""avowed liberal"" according to Gramm, was unimpressed by the fact that ""Nobody could fly an airplane commercially on any route without specific permission from the Civil Aeronautics Board, and price competition, cutting prices, was illegal."" These restraints were ridiculous to Kahn, who memorably remarked to Time magazine regarding his tenure as CAB chairman, ""I will consider myself a success in this job if there is no job when I leave it.""

You don't find that sentiment much anymore. Under the Deregulation Act, government control over fares, routes, and market entry and exit was lifted. Without needing to ask Mother-may-I of the CAB, competition increased, prices fell and air travel -- once a luxury -- became democratized.

But exploitable regulation did remain. While many aviation regulations were abolished or modified during the Carter era, others resumed, such as certain consumer protections and safety regulations. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) -- within the Department of Transportation -- continued to oversee aviation safety (inspections and audits), aircraft maintenance, pilot training and certification, air traffic control, airport operations. Some of FAA's safety oversight practives have come under scrutiny today. FAA requirements also apply to advertising practices, and to compensation and remedies with respect to flight cancellations and delays, denied boarding, baggage handling and related procedures.

In addition, the Transportation Safety Administration's rise after 9/11 amplified security regulations governing passenger and baggage screening. Some sought to abolish the unwelcome TSA's ""security theater"" and privatize its functions. But the TSA remains entrenched, just as the FAA's regulatory authority has expanded to encompass new technologies like drones. Most recently, the Biden administration's Competition Council seeks to restore price regulation and other controls to the airlines -- and beyond.

Carter's CAB example implies that while legislation or administrative reorganization can end an agency, its regulatory footprint may survive or be transferred to other government bodies even when consumer protection and safety can best be secured by competitive disciplinary processes rather than administrative default. As CEI founder Fred L. Smith Jr. cautions, ""a pruned weed is a healthy weed"" -- regulations, once embedded, are notoriously difficult to fully uproot.

What Other Departments and Agencies Have Been Abolished?

Carter's elimination of the CAB stands as a rare example of agency abolition, yet even that has not been permanent. In the decades before and since, there have been few instances where agencies were truly abolished, with most functions instead simply transferred elsewhere. Consider the following:

1940s: Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration were abolished -- only to be revived in spirit by Biden's American Climate Corps.

1970s: The Atomic Energy Commission, the Energy Research and Development Administration and the Federal Energy Administration were disbanded, with their functions transferred to the newly created Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Energy.

1990s: The U.S. Information Agency was abolished, but its functions were absorbed by the Department of State. The Interstate Commerce Commission was abolished, but its functions transferred to the Department of Transportation and the Surface Transportation Board.

2000s: The Homeland Security Act disbanded the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) but transferred its functions to three then-new creations: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

2020s: We saw the abolition of the obscure Board of Tea Experts, decades after the Federal Tea Tasters Repeal Act of 1996.

These examples demonstrate that while agency names may disappear, the underlying functions -- and often the regulatory burden -- persist through other federal entities.

Takeaways for the Termination of Departments and Agencies

The primary lesson here is that true agency abolition is rare, and the corresponding deregulation rarer still. When Congress places departments or agencies in its crosshairs, such as the Department of Education termination being spearheaded by Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie, it will need to be exceptionally diligent to ensure that the government's reach is genuinely reduced, both in terms of spending and regulation.

The ideal outcome when abolishing an agency is the complete disappearance of its regulations. But achieving this requires clear legislative intent and mechanisms to prevent the transfer of regulatory authority to other entities, and to follow through with privatizations or restorations of authority to states and localities to prevent the regrowth of ""weeds."" Carter's deregulation of the CAB and the paltry inventory of examples otherwise show that while deregulation is possible, its legacy must be carefully guarded.

As part of the broader spending de-escalation and abolition of agencies, rolling back federal grants, subsidies, and the gargantuan contracting state would go a long way toward addressing both the budget crisis and regulatory overreach. These categories of reductions are the real weedkillers, and will be necessary for any successful ""Terminator"" legislation.

Vigilance: Upholding Carter's Deregulation Legacy

New champions of deregulation need to be ever-watchful, ensuring that reforms are lasting and that privatization, competitive disciplines, and federalism are reinforced and fully replace federal steering. As part of these reforms, new institutions such as a Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis (CORA) less inclined toward administrative control than the current Office of Management and Budget (now self-neutered by its new ""Circular A-4"" guidance on regulatory review) could help maintain focus. Naturally oversight hearings, reports, and consistent legislative action will be needed to ensure that agency terminations aren't undone by future administrations.

As Alfred Kahn wisely observed, success in the downsizing endeavor means creating an environment where the agencies themselves are no longer necessary. However, agencies are adept at protecting their turf, so we should anticipate resistance to any serious efforts at termination. The federal debt, projected to exceed $36 trillion, will ultimately compel Congress to make difficult choices, however. When that time comes, lawmakers can draw inspiration from Jimmy Carter's legacy. To him, we say thank you, and happy birthday."
How To Protect Your Mental Health While Staying Informed During Election Season,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nomanazish/2024/09/30/how-to-protect-your-mental-health-while-staying-informed-during-election-season/,2024-10-01T02:07:09Z,"Elections can be stressful for many reasons. More so when the electoral battle is as polarizing and bruising as the one currently unfolding.

Do your shoulders tense up when you hear a candidate speak? Does your stomach twist into knots when a family member brings up politics over dinner? You're not alone.

According to a recent poll by the American Psychiatric Association, nearly three-quarters (73%) of Americans report feeling anxious about the upcoming presidential election. Another survey by Pew Research Center found that about two in three U.S. adults find politics exhausting.

""Election season can be stressful because there are a lot of unknowns,"" says Dr. Dakari Quimby, LA-based psychologist and assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Southern California. People worry about who will win and how their decisions will impact policies, the economy, and, in turn, voters' daily lives.

This anxiety is further fueled by fear-based campaign messaging. Dr. Reneé Carr, clinical psychologist and host of Politics & Psychology podcast, explains that when you internalize these threats and feel helpless to protect yourself or others, your stress response is activated. And it increases as the final election day draws near.

Given how politics has become more intertwined with personal identity, many people also find it difficult to separate political beliefs from their overall sense of self, leading to more intense emotional reactions, notes licensed clinical psychologist Dr. Amanda Mead. This can make you feel more strongly about those with opposing views, which can strain relationships and add to the emotional distress, says Dr. Mead.

""Staying mentally well during election season is important, particularly for BIPOC communities, who might feel more deeply affected by the rhetoric of campaigns and outcomes of elections,"" says Dr. Quimby.

With political frenzy about to hit crescendo in coming weeks, here are a few coping strategies to protect your mental health while staying informed during this election cycle and beyond:

If you notice that election-related anxiety is impacting your ability to function normally, consider talking to a licensed mental health professional asap, as they can help you cope."
"The ""Saving Grace"" Of Today's Community Colleges",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brunomanno/2024/09/30/the-saving-grace-of-todays-community-colleges/,2024-10-01T01:42:00Z,"""Community colleges may prove the saving grace of college-level learning in America,"" wrote historian Sean Trainor in a 2015 article in TIME magazine.

Today, almost a decade later, two recent reports echo this notion in their call for community colleges to up their game and make a major contribution to improving the futures of young people and working-class Americans who don't have college degrees.

Both reports describe the role these institutions should play in expanding America's workforce education and training efforts, especially by greatly increasing the number of employer-connected apprenticeships and creating a new learning campus that combines paid work and education.

The first report from a group of economists is Toward a Potential Grand Bargain for the Nation, commissioned by the Center for Collaborative Democracy and published by the Bipartisan Policy Center. Its chapter on ""Growth and Mobility"" describes five strategies to improve economic growth and upward economic mobility. It includes a proposal for creating a more highly skilled workforce that involves community colleges and apprenticeships.

The approach described in the Grand Bargain has its complement in a report from Apprenticeships for America on How Community Colleges Can Help Scale U.S. Apprenticeships. It is written by four experts on community colleges and apprenticeships.

Both reports fit into a larger conversation in America on how young people and workers can be better prepared for careers and social and economic mobility. Vice President Kamala Harris has described this larger context as ""an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and the chance to succeed.""

She also has defined the problem we face doing this and a practical solution: ""For far too long, our nation has encouraged only one path to success: a four-year college degree. Our nation needs to recognize the value of other paths -- additional paths, such as apprenticeships and technical programs.""

I call this approach to creating additional paths to success opportunity pluralism. Creating more earn-and-learn apprenticeships through community colleges is a pivotal way to realize an opportunity economy where opportunity pluralism flourishes.

The federal government's authority over apprenticeship programs began in 1937 with the National Apprenticeship Act. It also gave states the option to register and oversee programs. Today, about half the states exercise that option.

These registered apprenticeships provide individuals with on-the-job training, pay for work and classroom instruction, and a nationally recognized credential when the program is complete. This approach has received bipartisan political backing at the federal level from Democratic and Republican administrations and in states as diverse politically as California, Colorado, Tennessee, and Texas.

Today, 27,000 registered programs enroll around 600,000 individuals, with roughly 70% in construction trades. That's only 0.3% of the U.S. workforce, the bottom of apprenticeship enrollment among developed countries.

Federal financial support is growing for apprenticeships and other workforce training programs. But it's far short of the billions of federal dollars spent on postsecondary education and training. A Progressive Policy Institute analysis of fiscal year 2022 shows that out of $139.5 billion allocated for federal postsecondary education and training, only $28.2 billion, or 20%, was spent on workforce development.

The Grand Bargain proposal for investing in workers' education and training through community colleges calls for expanding work-based learning, especially through apprenticeships. It also would expand other employer and occupational-connected training like sectoral programs. Doing this requires two elements: more education and training partnerships between community colleges and employers and additional federal and state financial support.

Financial support could come in the form of employer tax credits for training and federal and state program funding that is linked to pay for performance in achieving outcomes like program completion and job placement. While not often the case with economists, they add a word of caution: ""Economists do not have a good understanding of how to 'scale-up' these programs, so we recommend additional experimentation with rigorous evaluations.""

The Apprenticeships for America report argues that community colleges are uniquely positioned to experiment, scale up apprenticeship programs, and work with analysts to evaluate how these programs are working. It describes a four-part framework that community colleges should use to expand apprenticeships that includes:

1. Working with employers to design and deliver related technical instruction or RTI, which is made-to-order classroom instruction for apprentices.

2. Adding value to RTI by, for example, offering structured apprenticeship degree pathway programs or including the college's career guidance and support services in apprenticeship programs.

3. Sponsoring federally registered apprenticeship programs, relieving employers of the application process.

4. Creating apprenticeships across industries and occupations, reducing costs to employers.

The report includes other recommendations.

For example, rules for federal Pell Grants to students should allow them to use financial aid to pay for quality short-term workforce training programs not now eligible for support. Additionally, federal and state programs that fund apprenticeships should change from one-off grant programs to recurring formula grant programs. These would support a larger array of occupations and industries and use a pay-for-performance contracting model, similar to recommendations found in Grand Bargain.

Vice President Harris's idea of an opportunity economy for all Americans has earn-and-learn apprenticeship pathways as central to that economy's education and training agenda. Both reports recommend that community colleges play a major in creating these earn-and-learn apprenticeships. They assume a viewpoint that fosters opportunity pluralism, an education and workforce training approach that creates multiple pathways to jobs and human flourishing rather than a singular, preferred college degree pathway.

This opportunity program is built on an opportunity equation with three related elements that form the basis for individuals pursuing pathways to opportunity: Knowledge or what individuals know + Relationships or whom they know + Identity or who they are = Opportunity.

Community colleges can be that saving grace where apprenticeships make the workplace the new learning campus for young people and working-class Americans."
"Harris' ""Opportunity Economy""  Closes The Economic Gap With Trump",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardmcgahey/2024/09/30/harris-opportunity-economy--closes-the-economic-gap-with-trump/,2024-10-01T01:18:25Z,"With just over 30 days left until the presidential election, Kamala Harris is emphasizing an ""Opportunity Economy"" as a centerpiece of her campaign. Although Donald Trump held a substantial polling lead over Joe Biden on economic issues, Harris is now virtually even with Trump on economics. What's in her program that's closing the gap?

Harris' economic vision continually emphasizes the middle class -- not the poor, or minorities, or immigrants. They aren't central to her message and policies. Her campaign website says ""she will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans."" And the ""Issues"" page on her website leads, in big bold letters, with ""Build An Opportunity Economy and Lower Costs For Families.""

Why ""lower costs for families?"" Because the biggest economic problem faced by Joe Biden -- and still faced by Harris -- is inflation. An August CBS News poll found that ""76% of registered voters said it (inflation) was a major factor in their choice for president."" And in May, an ABC News poll found Trump trusted over Biden on inflation ""by a margin of 14 percentage points.""

Inflation was driven by the Covid-19 pandemic's ""supply shock,"" with disruption to supply chains, the economy, and prices. The inflation rate has been trending downward, with the current rate of 2.5% the lowest since February of 2021. But consumers remain heavily scarred by the pandemic inflation, which reached an annual rate of 9.1% in June of 2022, a rate not seen since the oil shock inflation of the early 1980s.

Harris doesn't duck away from inflation. Her program calls for bringing down housing costs by building more, but also for ""legislation to outlaw new form of price fixing by corporate landlords."" Another major provision would ""take down bad actors and bring down costs,"" calling for the ""first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on food and groceries.""

Economists are skeptical about these policies. Yes, investors buy many homes to rent them out. But the vast majority of housing investors are small local landlords, not big corporations.

And even some Democratic economists don't endorse the attack on price gouging. Jason Furman, chair of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, says ""this is not sensible policy...there's no upside here, and there is some downside."" But economists like Isabella Weber at the University of Massachusetts argue that large and powerful firms took advantage of the pandemic shock to raise prices and generate profits beyond covering their costs -- what she calls ""sellers' inflation.""

Of course, Harris is running for president, not leading an economics seminar. And her attacks on price gouging are very popular. A new poll for The Guardian did a blind test of Harris' and Trump's economic ideas, and found Harris had ""four of the top five most popular proposals."" The most popular of twelve policies tested in the poll? A ""federal ban on price-gouging food and groceries.""

That's one reason Harris' has closed the ""trust gap"" with Trump on the economy. A recent Morning Consult poll found Harris and Trump were equally trusted on the economy, a major gain for the Democrats compared with Biden's double-digit polling gaps with Trump.

Harris' economic plan goes well beyond managing prices. She promises to continue (and perhaps expand) Biden's support for US manufacturing, using trade policy (including tariffs) and subsidies to support critical industries like semiconductors, electric vehicles, and clean energy. She ties these to other specific policies to lower energy costs and help with the climate crisis.

Although Harris endorses strategic, limited tariffs, she opposes Trump's plan to raise tariffs on all imports by 10 to 20%, and on imports from China by 60% or more. She calls this a ""tax"" on American households, and economists agree with her. Economists at Goldman Sachs, the Peterson Institute, the Tax Foundation, and the Tax Policy Foundation all find Trump's draconian tariffs would slow the economy, penalize households, and cause higher inflation.

Harris also want to focus on care work, both for children and for the elderly, as important for the economy. Better care would help workers -- the vast majority of them women -- better balance care responsibilities and their careers. And it would help the women workers who provide paid care work while suffering inadequate wages and working conditions.

Although commentators criticize Harris for not providing enough detail on her economic policies, her proposals are a model of clarity compared with what Trump offers. The New York Times reports Harris has distributed an 82-page booklet on her proposals, compared to Trump who has ""coughed up a string of four- or five-word slogans promising tax cuts, some of which his advisers cannot fully explain."" '

Harris also is battling complex economic views held by voters. In spite of continued job creation, rising real wages, slowing inflation, and continued GDP growth, consumer confidence is sending mixed signals. September's Survey of Consumers from the University of Michigan rose 3% above August, ""as consumers' expectations for the economy brighten."" But the Conference Board's consumer confidence index suffered its largest drop ""since August 2021"" between August and September.

We're in the home stretch of the election, so don't expect significantly more policy details from Harris. Rather, she will continue emphasizing economic security and opportunity for the middle class, contrasting her optimistic vision against a bleaker and less coherent approach from Donald Trump. So far, that's working in her favor."
