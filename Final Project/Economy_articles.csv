3 Top Stocks To Buy Now After The Fed Rate Cut,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-stocks-to-buy-now-after-fed-rate-cut/,2024-10-08T21:13:42Z,"The Federal Reserve committee inaugurated the much-anticipated interest rate cut cycle in mid-September, slashing half-a-percentage point off its benchmark rates without waiting to hit its actual 2% inflation target. The objective of the bigger-than-expected rate cut was to avert a recession, when a weaker-than-expected July jobs report officially triggered the Sahm Rule-a historical recession indicator that has a consistent 100% (well, almost) accuracy rate for every recession since the early 1970s. This gives rise to a few questions like:

The Federal Reserve launched its interest rate cut cycle on September 18, by aggressively slashing 50 basis points off benchmark rates, lowering the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%. The federal funds rate represents the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans to fulfill their reserve requirements. Banks are mandated by law to hold a reserve equal to a specific percentage of their deposits, referred to as the reserve requirement to ensure that bank is capable of meeting sudden withdrawals.

This is the first rate cut in four years since the Fed's emergency response to pandemic shutdowns in March 2020. Another half-percentage point reduction before this year-end is likely in the cards with an additional percentage-point cut anticipated in 2025.

The Fed raised interest rates from March 2022 to July 2023, to ease inflation that surged to the highest levels in more than four decades. In June 2022, inflation in the U.S. reached a whopping 9.1%, as prices and demand soared amid pandemic-disrupted supply constraints and unprecedented government stimulus programs that pumped about $5 trillion into the economy. When inflation shoots up, the Fed Reserve typically steps in to cool the inflation by raising interest rates and making borrowing more expensive. This brings down spending and demand thereby inflation.

The corollary to rising interest rates is an increase in borrowing costs for businesses as well, which in turn triggers cost-cutting, slowdown in expansion initiatives, layoffs and lesser new hires. This leads to an increase in the unemployment rate, which was 4.1% in September, up from 3.8% in the same month last year. A rise in unemployment rate alongside a slowdown in hiring has renewed recession concerns.

With the half-a-percentage cut, the Fed is hoping for a soft landing, a scenario in which the economy slows sufficiently to reduce inflation without entering a recession. The Fed's mandate is to restore price stability, while trying not to increase unemployment, even as its 2% inflation target appears within reach. Experts opine that a soft landing is plausible but far from guaranteed.

The current inflation rate is 2.5%, the lowest since February 2021, and lower than the long-term average of 3.28%. The fact that the Fed did not wait until the 2% inflation target was hit clearly shows where its priorities lie now-to avoid a recession.

Historically accurate and reliable recession indicators like the Sahm Rule are now facing skepticism because the pandemic has disrupted normal business activity and complicated forecasting efforts. The Sahm Rule, named after former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, states that a recession may happen when the three-month moving average of the national unemployment rate rises by 0.50 percentage points or more when compared to its low during the previous 12 months. The Sahm Rule has maintained an impressive accuracy rate of nearly 100% for every recession since the early 1970s. The only exception occurred in November 1976, when the rule was triggered without a corresponding or subsequent recession.

The Sahm Rule reading was 0.53% for July when the unemployment rate hit 4.3%. However, the rule's inventor Sahm herself rebutted the surge of catastrophic narratives, stating that ""I am not concerned that, at this moment, we are in a recession."" in an interview with Fortune. However, she also added later ""I think the recession odds, given what we're seeing in the labor market, are increasing."" While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was slightly dismissive of the Sahm Rule as more of a ""statistical regularity"" than an ""economic rule."" Sahm believes the rule shouldn't be dismissed as it's been very accurate over time and noted that ""recessions can build slowly, and then come quickly.""

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dipped from 4.3% in July to 4.2% in August and 4.1% in September showing improvements ahead of the upcoming elections in November. In September, the U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs exceeding estimates for 150,000 new jobs. The upbeat September jobs report should silence concerns about an impending disaster at least for now.

Nevertheless, unemployment rates will be a key data point to watch going forward. Any material rise in unemployment and fall in hiring may likely hit consumer spending, which has thus far been resilient because of strong wage gains. It is natural for people to cut back on spending when facing unemployment or the threat of losing a job.

High interest rates incentivize the consumer to save money, while lower interest rates tend to influence the consumer to borrow, spend and invest. Consumer spending is the main driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

Fed rate cuts are expected to be most impactful for credit cards that have variable interest rates. The previous Fed rate hike cycle has pushed the variable interest rates on credit cards close to all-time highs of above 21% currently, from around 14.6% in March 2022 when the rate hikes began. As the rate cut cycle unfolds, credit card rates will likely ease below 20%, offering some degree of relief for borrowers.

Mortgage rates for both 15-year and 30-year fixed loans are typically linked to Treasury yields and the overall economy, are likely to decrease slightly but are unlikely to return to the lows seen in the last decade. Currently, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage hovers around 6.2%. Experts predict these rates will remain between 6% and 6.5%, with the possibility of dipping below 6%. However, elevated home prices may still deter potential home buyers.

Auto loans are fixed with the average rate on a five-year new car loan being 6.8% in the second quarter, sharply higher than the 4% levels at the beginning of rate hikes. While the easing of rates may encourage car buyers who have pushed-out on purchases, the limiting factor could still be higher vehicle prices and lack of incentives for buyers.

The fixed nature of Federal student loan rates also means that a rate cut may have no impact on these borrowers, because these interest rates don't change over the loan term.

Savings rates have benefitted from the rate hike cycle. A high-yield savings account (HYSA) offers nearly 5% interest, while top interest rates from certificate of deposit (CD) instruments range from 4.00% to 5%. While these interest rates could decline, the opportunity still exists to secure a HYSA or CD before rates drop further.

A research study by Hartford Funds shows that 7 of the 11 Fed rate cutting periods from 1980 to 2024 were accompanied by recessions. While recession is not a desirable condition, how does it impact the stock market? Here are some interesting observations.

An analysis by Hartford Funds of 22 Fed rate-cutting cycles since 1928 revealed that the S&P 500 benchmark index on average outperformed government bonds and corporate bonds in the 12 months after the Fed started cutting interest rates. The average 12-month real return (after adjusting for inflation) from the date of first rate cut for U.S. stocks (represented by the S&P 500 index) has been 11% vs. 5% returns for government bonds and 6% returns for corporate bonds and 2% returns for cash.

The average returns of the stock market in the 22 rate cut cycles is even more impressive considering that in 16 out of 22 cycles the U.S. economy was already in a recession when the rate cuts were initiated or entered a recession within a 12 month period.

During the non-recessionary, rate-cut cycles the stock market returned a solid 17% on average (in the 12-month period after the first rate cut) vs. 2% for government bonds, 4% for corporate bonds and 3% for cash. In the event of a recessionary, rate-cut period, the stock market still returned a positive 8% on average vs. 7% for government and corporate bonds and 2 % for cash (in the 12-month period after the first rate cut.)

While these stock market returns seem solid, investors should remember that this is an average value for 22 rate cut cycles. The stock market suffered heavy losses too during recessionary periods. In 6 out of 22 rate cut cycles, stock market returns fluctuated widely between a negative 10% to negative 45%.

After the much touted ""great rotation"" into small-cap stocks, the focus is shifting to mid-cap stocks, because investors may be looking at a situation where small-caps may still be risky and large caps still too expensive. Until the Fed achieves the targeted soft landing, recession worries will continue to linger at the backdrop. Besides, the longer-for-higher interest rates have also triggered concerns about a slower-than-anticipated Fed rate easing cycle.

With stronger fundamentals (higher profitability and solid balance sheet) vs. small-caps and attractive valuations vs. large-caps, mid-caps seem better positioned to benefit from the present Fed rate cuts. Yet another solid reason for the pivot to mid-caps is the historical outperformance of mid-caps vs. large caps and small caps in the first 3 and 12 months subsequent to the first Fed rate cut. According to Goldman Sachs, the S&P 400 mid-cap index has been an outperformer since 1984 vs. the S&P 500 (large-caps) and Russell 2000 (small-caps) in the 3 and 12 months following the first Fed first rate cut. Presently, Goldman Sachs projects a 13% return for the S&P 400 index over the next 12 months.

Elf Beauty qualifies as a high growth beauty company, having grown sales and market share for 22 straight quarters, and averaging at least 20% sales growth per quarter. Over the past five years, Elf has expanded its top one/two positions from across eight segments in the color cosmetics category to 18 segments, which now account for over 80% of its Elf cosmetics sales. The company's ""Holy Grail"" approach centers on creating value versions of prestige products to align with consumer preferences. For reference, the average price point for Elf is about $6.50 vs. around $9.50 for legacy mass cosmetics brands and more than $20 for prestige brands. Elf's recent Bronzing Drops is comparable to a prestige product in the market at a third of the price. This strategy has helped solidify Elf's outperformance in the cosmetics category.

Solid market share gains: Elf Beauty's color cosmetics business continues to be a category outperformer. A 26% growth across track channels in the first quarter vs. a 1% decline for the category, has helped ELF grow its cosmetics market share to 12.3% presently. This represents a more than 2x increase from 5.7% market share in the same quarter three years ago. ELF expects to double its cosmetics market share again in a few years.

Shelf-space gains with Walmart, top share with Target, Opportunities at groceries, drug stores: With Target, a long-standing customer, Elf Cosmetics is the number one brand for six quarters in a row with its share rising from 13% to 21%. A 50% shelf space gain from 8 feet to 12 feet at Walmart is commendable, but still underpenetrated vs. legacy brands that have a 16 feet to 20 feet shelf space. The opportunities for expansion are attractive at Target, Walmart and Alta, alongside growth at grocery and drug stores, where ELF currently has a much smaller footprint.

Maximizing Brand Performance with Retail Partners: Elf proactively refreshes up to 20% of its retail assortment annually, leveraging insights from its digital business and beauty squad loyalty programs. This strategy has doubled its average sales per SKU over the past five years, making it a highly productive brand in terms of dollar sales per foot basis with retailers.

Growing Skincare business: Elf Beauty hopes to replicate the success in its cosmetics business across its skincare segment. For the latest first quarter, Elf SKIN grew 45% in track channels, vs. category growth of 1.4%. Elf SKIN has roughly 2% market share as of the first quarter vs. 14% share for the leading skin care brand. ELF's Naturium acquisition from last year should also help unlock growth in the skin category.

International expansion opportunities: International sales accounted for 16% of ELF's total first-quarter sales, up from 13% a year ago, but is still underpenetrated vs. global peers that have a 70% exposure to international sales. International expansion represents a key growth runway for ELF.

Upbeat Guidance: ELF recently raised guidance for fiscal 2025 (ending on March 31, 2025), now expecting adjusted EPS of $3.36 to $3.41, on sales of $1.28 billion to $1.30 billion, from prior expectations of $3.20 to $3.25 EPS on sales of $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion. The revised guidance compares more favorably with year-ago EPS of $3.18 on revenues of $1.02 billion.

ELF Stock Sell-off presents opportunity: Despite these positive developments, ELF stock trades way off its 52-week intra-day high of $221.83 reached in early March. After a couple of attempts in late June and mid July to recapture the highs of the year, the stock has fallen sharply amid concerns regarding the sustainability of its growth rates above 20%. However, it still has a Strong Buy rating from 16 Wall Street analysts.

Medpace is a full-service clinical contract research organization providing Phase I-IV clinical development services for the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Medpace calls itself as a CRO trusted by biotechs with a focus on small to mid-sized biopharma customers that represented more than 95% of its 2023 revenues. With an estimated 5% market share in the small and mid-sized biopharma space, Medpace sees an estimated core addressable biopharma CRO market of $28 billion.

Solid growth trends in revenue, profit: Top line has grown at a nearly 22% CAGR from $704.6 million in 2018 to $1.89 billion in 2023, while net income has grown four-fold from $73.2 million or $1.97/share in 2018 to $282.8 million or $8.88 per share in 2023.

Attractive Free Cash Flow characteristics: Medpace has attractive free cash flow (FCF) characteristics with FCF growing from $138.7 million in 2018 to $396.7 million in 2023. Ebitda-FCF conversion has remained above 100% since 2019.

Upbeat outlook: For 2024, revenue is expected to be between $2.125 billion and $2.175 billion, representing year-on-year growth of 12.7% to 15.3%. Net income is expected to be $361 million to $383 million or $11.24 per share to $11.93 per share and Ebitda to be $430.0 million to $460.0 million.

Concerns over cancellation appear baked into stock price now: While announcing second-quarter earnings results, the company cited some order cancellations that brought its book-to-bill ratio to 1.04 for the quarter vs. prior expectations for 1.2. Medpace also cautioned that the book-to-bill numbers could be flat to slightly higher sequentially in the third quarter. Some analysts downgraded the stock to a Hold/Neutral rating in late September citing weaker bookings growth coupled with cancellations as one of the reasons.

Are the concerns overrated? In the earnings call, Medpace said it does not see a prolonged pullback, or does not view the cancellations as a pattern that's going to continue. Besides, a book-to-bill of 1.04 for one quarter is not earth shattering, because it is still above 1, implying strong demand. Medpace sees the third quarter book-to-bill to be at 1.04 or slightly higher and in the first quarter the number was at 1.2. Also, Backlog as of June 30, 2024 was a solid $2.9 billion, up 13.7% year-on-year, and Medpace expects to convert about $1.585 billion of this backlog to revenue over the next twelve months. Medpace even raised its profit guidance for 2024 to show that it continues to anticipate industry-leading organic revenue growth and profitability despite the challenges in backlog growth. The backlog concerns appear to be priced into the MEDP stock that is already trading well below its mid-July highs of $459.77.

Upcoming catalyst: A key catalyst for the Medpace stock is the upcoming third-quarter earnings report, slated for release on October 21, after market close. Overall the MEDP stock has a moderate buy rating from analysts.

Skechers, dubbed as the comfort footwear giant, is a Fortune 500 company that makes lifestyle and performance footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. International sales represented more than 60% of its 2023 top line. The comfort footwear maker operates via wholesale and direct-to-consumer (DTC) business segments, with wholesale representing 56% of sales in 2023, and the rest coming from DTC.

Record second-quarter sales: Despite currency and supply chain headwinds, regulatory obstacles in India, and a lackluster 6/18 holiday in China, Skechers delivered record second-quarter sales of $2.16 billion, up 7.2% year over year driven by continued strength in its international DTC business and significant improvement in its domestic wholesale business.

Solid growth trends in revenue, profits: Skechers has grown sales from $5.2 billion in 2019 to $8 billion in 2023, and earnings per share from $2.25 to $3.49. Fiscal 2024 outlook is even better with sales expected between $8.88 billion and $8.98 billion and EPS expected to be $4.08 to $4.18.

Expanding margins: Skechers sells at affordable price points, yet gross margins have remained above 47% since 2019 exceeding 50% in 2023, while operating margins have been mostly in the mid-to-high single digits, with the exception of a drop to 2.9% in 2020. The margin story gets even better in the first half of 2024, with gross margins at 53.7% and operating margin at 11.5%.

One shoe does not fit all but Skechers fits all into one shoe: Considerable thought goes into the design of Skechers footwear to meet the needs of every walk of life. Under a partnership with John Deere, Skechers recently launched a footwear line for agricultural professionals, construction workers, and outdoor enthusiasts. Made of waterproof materials, the footwear line has interesting features like composite toe protection, nano carbon safety and Poron XRD metatarsal protection-Poron XRD being a flexible, lightweight, breathing foam, which hardens when impacted and forms a protective shell around the foot, absorbing up to 90% of the impact energy. Skechers has also integrated its slip-resistant and electrical hazard-rated technologies into the new offering.

Reasonably attractive valuation: Skechers stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 16.2x based on $4.08 eps guidance for 2024 (at the low end of the range). This is lower than its own five-year historical average of 21.2x. If the multiple re-rates to a conservative 19x (at the midpoint of the multiple range), it would still represent about 17% upside from current price levels. The footwear maker's expectations to achieve $10 billion in sales by 2026, also implies 13% upside potential from current stock levels, upon applying the current forward price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 1.13x. The stock may have 13%-17% upside potential from current levels.

The U.S. economy is currently not in a recession. The Fed rate easing cycle may likely achieve a soft landing of the economy, although there are no guarantees and historical evidence points otherwise, at least most of the time. Monthly Jobs data will continue to be a critical watch point. Even as recession fears linger, mid-cap stocks could be a preferred investment over large-cap or small-cap stocks, as mid-caps are at the confluence of reasonable valuations and stronger fundamentals. The mid-cap stocks highlighted in the article enjoy profitable growth with upbeat future prospects."
Prospects of a deal with Israel fade away as Saudis invite Iranian foreign minister to visit,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/iran-foreign-minister-saudi-arabia-deal-israel,2024-10-08T20:45:15Z,"One year ago, Saudi Arabia and Israel were supposedly on the brink of a deal to normalize relations.

That deal has seemingly evaporated as Iran's foreign minister visits the kingdom on Tuesday to discuss efforts to halt Israel's incursions into Gaza and Lebanon.

""Our dialogue continues regarding the developments in the region to prevent the shameless crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon, in continuation of the crimes in Gaza,"" Iran Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a video broadcast on state media.

He added: ""Starting today, I'll begin a trip to the region, to Riyadh and other capitals, and we will strive for a collective movement from the countries of the region... to stop the brutal attacks in Lebanon.""

The Saudis share a longtime strategic partnership with the U.S. and are the largest purchaser of its weapons. But in recent years, they've had a political rapprochement with Iran.

9/11 FAMILIES URGE TRUMP, HARRIS TO OPPOSE SAUDI DEAL UNTIL KINGDOM ADMITS INVOLVEMENT IN TERROR ATTACK

Last week, Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, reaffirmed their neutrality in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Iran has warned that if ""Israel supporters"" intervene directly, their interests in the region would be targeted. That could mean missile strikes on their oil facilities.

Iran rained some 200 missiles down on Israel last week, many of which were intercepted by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with U.S. assistance.

""The Gulf states think it's unlikely that Iran will strike their oil facilities, but the Iranians are dropping hints they might from unofficial sources. It's a tool the Iranians have against the U.S. and the global economy,"" Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator close to the royal court, said.

In 2019, drones attacked Saudi Arabia's key refinery at Abqaiq, briefly shutting down around 5% of the world's oil supply. Those drones originated in Iran, according to U.S. intelligence.

Prior to Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Biden administration considered a proposed deal, akin to the Abraham Accords, a major priority. This deal aimed to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, including security guarantees and cooperation on civil nuclear matters. For months, the White House had been saying the deal was nearly done.

The prospect of a deal was largely blamed as a catalyst for the Hamas attacks.

OPINION: WHY SAUDI ARABIA MATTERS MORE THAN EVER TO THE US

""I don't think we were ever really that close,"" Robert Greenway, former senior director of the National Security Council, told Fox News Digital.

""We were closest probably in the waning days of the Trump administration, but we knew that that would be a second-term issue if there was to be one, and obviously that didn't play out. I don't know that the Biden-Harris administration ever took it that terribly seriously.""

Just before the Hamas attack, a group of 20 Democratic senators made clear their opposition to the treaty, voicing concerns over Saudi Arabia's human rights record and that a peaceful nuclear energy program might one day be converted to a military one to produce a nuclear weapon.

And Oct. 7 changed the Saudis' calculus: they now demand a plan for a Palestinian state.

""If anyone believes there was a chance of getting the House or Senate in an election year with virtually no majority, getting anything as controversial as a security treaty, with Saudi Arabia - permission for them to enrich with our blessing and support - I don't know if anyone credibly believes that that was ever possible.""

Former deputy national security adviser Victoria Coates was optimistic that the Saudis could be brought back into the fold.

""From what I'm hearing from both sides, it's when, not if,"" she said. ""There are various reasons you might want to wait to find out what the makeup of the Congress is going to be... you're going to need supportive majorities in the Senate to get [a civil nuclear agreement] through."""
Pennsylvania 2024 Trump-Harris Polls: Harris Has Less Than 1-Point Lead In Polling Averages,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/08/pennsylvania-2024-trump-harris-polls-harris-has-less-than-1-point-lead-in-polling-averages/,2024-10-08T19:37:17Z,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are nearly tied in Pennsylvania, according to two new polls this week in the battleground state, where a win for either candidate could pave the way to the White House.

No Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948. If Harris wins Pennsylvania, and the trend of also winning Wisconsin and Michigan holds, she's all but certain to win the White House.

82%. That's the share of registered voters in Pennsylvania who said the economy is a major factor in their 2024 vote, followed by inflation at 78% and the state of democracy at 70%, according to the CBS/YouGov survey. The results are on par with the national electorate, according to a recent Pew Research survey of registered voters that found 81% of registered voters rate the economy as ""very important"" in the election.

Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Harris over her previous endorsement of a fracking ban -- Pennsylvania is the country's second-largest natural gas producer. ""Fracking? She's been against it for 12 years,"" Trump said during Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. Harris, who said during a 2019 CNN climate town hall while she was running for president ""there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,"" has said she's since changed her stance. During Tuesday's debate, she said she made ""very clear"" in 2020 that she's against a fracking ban, presumably referring to her vice presidential debate with Mike Pence, and noted the Inflation Reduction Act opened new gas leases -- reiterating a stance she took in a CNN interview last month. Harris didn't actually say she changed her own position on the issue during the 2020 debate -- instead she said then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden ""will not end fracking.""

Pennsylvania has a divided state legislature. The state's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, is widely popular in the state. Democrats also control the House, but Republicans hold the majority in the Senate.

Harris leads Trump in four of seven battleground states, while Trump is ahead in North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling averages that show margins of less than two points in all seven battleground states (Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin). If Trump maintains his leads in Arizona and Georgia, and wins North Carolina, as he's expected to, he would need just one of the ""Blue Wall"" states (Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin) to win the White House.

Walgreens Is The Latest Employer To Embrace Student Loan Benefits,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2024/10/08/walgreens-is-the-latest-employer-to-embrace-student-loan-benefits/,2024-10-08T18:18:19Z,"Plus, another 'September surge' in the job market, managers are willing to pay higher starting salaries for in-office personnel and how Marianne Markowitz climbed the financial corporate ladder.

Did you know that employers can match your student loan payments with contributions into your 401(k)? Thanks to Secure Act 2.0, which took effect January 1, employers can now offer extra retirement savings to young workers making student loan payments, even if the employee is not contributing to their retirement account on their own.

On Thursday, Walgreens became the latest large employer to embrace this benefit, offering it to the company's more than 300,000 employees. This means that Walgreens will match up to 4% of eligible pay for workers who are paying down student loans, even if they have not contributed directly to their 401(k) themselves.

Employees who've worked at Walgreens for one year and have completed 1,000 hours of work are eligible.

The program has been lauded as a win for young workers who have to choose between saving for retirement or paying off debt. At Walgreens, roughly 30% of the company's employees are facing financial debt from higher education, according to the company, including more than half of its pharmacists. On average, pharmacists have $170,000 of student debt, according to the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, making it one of the professions with the highest debt.

While other major employers--including Verizon, Kevin Hart-owned Hart House, Chipotle and Abbott Laboratories (a medical devices and healthcare company)--are offering the same benefit, its adoption has been slow, according to Bloomberg. The hesitance is largely due to employer's compliance and logistics concerns in its implementation, even after the IRS issued additional guidance in August.

As the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness plan moves through the courts, student loan 401(k) matching could be a major help to the 42.8 million Americans paying off student loan debt. But the key question remains: Just how many employers will implement it?

In other news, another hurricane is scheduled to make landfall in the south this week. To all of those in the path of Hurricane Milton, please listen to local officials and I hope you stay safe.

Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week!

A career financial expert, Marianne Markowitz is the founding CEO of First Women's Bank, a Chicago-based bank focused on serving women. Fresh off the heels of announcing the launch of the FWB Collective, a resource hub for women to launch their own businesses, I spoke with the First Women's Bank CEO to speak about her career in finance and focus on banking for women, working with small businesses, and what she learned working in both the private and public sectors. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Before starting First Women's Bank, you had some impressive stints as a risk and treasury manager in the private sector before heading up the Small Business Association. What did you find was the biggest pain point in the transition from private to public employers?

You know, it's interesting because I expected there to be more pain points than I actually experienced. Up until that point, the Small Business Administration (SBA) was the smallest organization I'd ever worked for--even Barack Obama's presidential campaign was larger. So as a federal agency, you were able to actually shape that agency, which was really interesting as an entrepreneurial-focused group. So I didn't experience that many pain points. Now, if I'd joined a much larger agency that would have been different! But the SBA is a unique agency in how it mirrors the private sector more because most of its partners are in the private sector, and works with over 4,000 banks.

Oh interesting! What's your advice to someone who may be considering a similar move, jumping into working with federal or government agencies?

There's a lot of doors into the public sector, so it's likely there is one that fits most people's backgrounds. I would say if you're inclined to serve at all, then it's a fit for you. It's all about service, and it's an amazing way to build a career. It's hard to explain, and you can't understand the scale of your impact when you're in the public sector (almost like you can't explain what it's like having a baby until you do!). You get to touch and impact so many lives with the work you do, it's an amazing place to build a future.

Between starting First Women's Bank and working in banking, you've had the experience of both being a founder but also climbing the corporate ladder. What is one thing you learned during that time that really helped you reach the C-Suite both as a CFO at the Obama presidential campaign and now as the founding CEO?

The next step is not only the one that is right above you. Sometimes I think we only see our careers linearly. But often moving side to side and gaining other experience will prepare you to move up, and it may not be the immediate channel that you see right ahead of you.

The other thing is sometimes, our work doesn't give us the opportunity or positions that we're ready for. Sometimes, it doesn't give us the opportunity to lead, or that's not part of your particular job at the time. So look outside your day job and find opportunities. We don't make the time to do that early enough in our career. Go find a nonprofit, get on a board, because when I look at a résumé I look at all of that. Where is the leadership in this résumé? It may not be in your position, but it happened because you did something that was really important to your job that aligned with your values outside of work.

Also, show up to the employee resource groups!

That's a good point -- leadership doesn't have to be in your job description to become a leader. What is one unique thing you look for in not only new hires, but women who come to the bank looking for funding or loans?

As women, we can often have disruptions in our career. We've got live events that we're balancing with that, and those disruptions can make for zig-zags in our résumés. That's something we really understand at First Women's Bank, and we give a lot of credit to the portability of experience and how we underwrite someone's ability to lead a business. It's something we really acknowledge, even if their career doesn't play out in a linear fashion. That's one way we really acknowledge and show up for women.

News from the world of work

September's jobs report smashed analyst expectations as 254,000 new jobs were added to the economy, according to the Labor Department, over 100,000 more than expected. The unemployment rate also dipped, falling to 4.1% from 4.2% in August. Revisions for June and July jobs reports also saw an increase of 72,000 jobs added over the summer.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is launching a formal inquiry into an Impact Plastics facility that employees say ignored warnings about Hurricane Helene and required them to report to work. Eleven workers were washed away by the flood waters, and five have been confirmed dead.

The National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint Wednesday alleging that Amazon illegally refused to bargain with the union representing drivers hired by a contractor. Amazon, the complaint says, broke the law by terminating its contract with the contractor after the drivers unionized without first bargaining with the Teamsters union that represented them.

Retail, hospitality and food service managers are planning to hire more seasonal workers as the holiday season approaches. Current staff, they say, lack the skills and experience for seasonal demand--61% of surveyed managers by Axonify say the quality of applicants is worse this year.

Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet and Samsung Electronics topped Forbes' World's Best Employers 2024 list, a ranking of the best 850 companies to work for around the world. Though banking and financial services dominated this year's list, companies providing career development and upskilling opportunities climbed up the ranks.

Hiring managers are willing to pay in-office premiums: At least 66% of managers surveyed by Robert Half in its 2025 Salary Guide are willing to increase starting salaries for new hires willing to work in the office. Of those, over half are willing to bump starting salaries by 20% to come in four to five days a week.

Markets Project Smaller 2024 Interest Rate Cuts On Better Jobs News,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/08/markets-project-smaller-2024-interest-rate-cuts-on-better-jobs-news/,2024-10-08T17:17:05Z,"With recent, stronger jobs data, markets expect the remaining anticipated interest rate cuts of 2024 to be 0.25% moves. That's down from expectations that both November and December Federal Open Market Committee meetings could see 0.5% cuts. Fixed income market expectations are tracked by the CME FedWatch Tool.

There was concern that the U.S. unemployment situation could weaken further. However, the Employment Situation Report for September showed clear improvement. Unemployment fell slightly for the second consecutive month to 4.1% and nonfarm payrolls rose 254,000. That's over 200,000 jobs added for the first time since May.

Now, the FOMC will see another jobs report on November 1 before its next meeting on November 6-7 and that data could change things. Inflation numbers will matter too. Nonetheless, for now, U.S. unemployment data is more positive than generally anticipated and inflation continues to trend lower.

This matters because if unemployment were to rise significantly, then the FOMC may be prompted to cut rates quite rapidly. That would be to try and reduce the risk of a recession. On the most recent data, a steep rise in unemployment is not happening.

Of course, inflation appears to be returning to the FOMC's 2% annual target, so that creates some momentum for less restrictive monetary policy. However, if the jobs market continues to appear robust, then there's perhaps a little less urgency for interest rate cuts.

The remaining scheduled FOMC interest rate decisions of 2024 are on November 7 and December 18. Currently, fixed income markets expect both to result in 0.25% interest rate cuts. That would leave short term interest rates at 4.25% to 4.5% by the end of 2024 or 0.5% lower than current levels. The risk of a slightly larger or smaller interest rate move is balanced, but currently further 0.5% cuts in 2024 are viewed as unlikely just as is the scenario of the FOMC choosing to hold rates steady at either meeting.

In two recent speeches, policymakers have signaled confidence in monetary policy and advocated for a more gradual approach to interest rate cuts.

New York Fed President John Williams said that: ""The current stance of monetary policy is really well positioned to both hopefully keep maintaining the strength that we have in the economy and the labour market, but also continuing to see that inflation comes back to 2 per cent,"" in an interview with the Financial Times on October 7.

St Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, said: ""My baseline outlook is for continued economic expansion over the next several quarters, supported by a gradual easing of monetary policy and accommodative financial conditions."" At a speech in New York on October 7.

There is still more key economic data to come before the FOMC's next scheduled meeting on November 6-7. Primarily, that's the jobs report for October and inflation reports for September.

So far, the jobs markets appears to be performing better than expected since the FOMC last met, and inflation continues to trend lower. If that economic outlook continues, then it appears likely the FOMC will cut interest rates at its two remaining meetings of 2024, but only by 0.25% at each, rather than the previously estimated 0.5%."
How CFOs Are Preparing For The Future Amid Election Uncertainty,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cfo/2024/10/08/how-cfos-are-preparing-for-the-future-amid-election-uncertainty/,2024-10-08T16:05:40Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

CFOs are taking on bigger leadership roles and more responsibility throughout the business world. A new IDC InfoBrief study commissioned by Billtrust that focuses on the order-to-cash area of business shows one area in which CFOs are leading: AI adoption.

The study surveyed several top leaders in businesses, which included some CFOs. Nearly nine in 10 respondents said CFOs are becoming more critical to their organizations because of the economic downturn and financial uncertainty, and almost as many said that digital transformation across the OTC process is critical to the survival of their businesses. More CFOs agreed that digital transformation is needed, and more are optimistic about generative AI's potential to bring some of that transformation. Two-thirds of CFOs said generative AI will have a large impact on their organization, as opposed to 59% of all people surveyed. And 44% of CFOs said generative AI will help them do their jobs faster, 9% more than the 35% of all surveyed positions.

These results show that it's time to let CFOs lead on generative AI. They've researched the possibilities and know what it can do. And as a virtue of their position and expertise, they know the financial and strategic options their companies should take to weather the current uncertainty. Companies that want to see the financial part of their business become more effective and efficient should give the CFO the respect the position is now commanding. A bonus: Other studies have shown that CFOs who are able to lead on company strategy tend to significantly outperform their peers.

Deloitte conducts a quarterly CFO survey and found in its latest results that 58% think next month's election will be at least very consequential to their organizations. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global and U.S. leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what this means for CFO planning in Q4 and beyond. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are still open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Last month, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs, a huge increase over economists' estimates of 150,000, according to government data released on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, an improvement of a tenth of a point over August. This level of job growth didn't just happen in September. The government revised its summertime job growth figures, adding 55,000 more jobs to July's total -- reaching 144,000 jobs -- and 17,000 more jobs to August, for a total of 159,000.

The upbeat job data also turned the stock market upwards on Friday, but markets came crashing down Monday afternoon as crude oil prices and government bond yields rose to multiweek highs. Monday was the anniversary of the current Israel and Hamas war in the Middle East, which has recently escalated to include Lebanon and Iran, and has sent defense stocks and oil prices up. The rise in bond yields has been somewhat unexpected, though some analysts have predicted it's in response to increasing oil prices, while others have predicted it's responding to the dwindling likelihood of another big interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets early next month.

According to CME FedWatch, 88.2% of economists now believe interest rates will be cut by a quarter percent, with the remaining 11.8% not expecting a rate cut at all. Forbes' Derek Saul talked with Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, an alternate member of the Open Market Committee, about what he'll be paying attention to as the Fed closes out the year. The unemployment rate going forward is important, he said. ""After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?""

Last week, organized labor seemingly notched another victory as 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association returned to work, reopening 36 East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports after a three-day strike. On Thursday, the U.S. Maritime Alliance offered a 62% wage increase over six years and extended the current union contract until January 15, 2025, to allow for further negotiation.

The contract extension means that the nation's ports will remain open for Q4 -- which includes the presidential election and the all-important holiday shopping season. But the new contract isn't even fully negotiated yet, so it's hard to say whether port workers will ultimately support it. Port workers wanted a 77% wage increase and a ban on many kinds of automation. There are no proposals made public from USMX on automation, and as Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly notes, it's a huge issue for the union. The cranes used to remove containers from cargo ships and move them to wherever they need to go next can be automated, meaning fewer people are needed to do the work. Union members are essentially negotiating for their job security -- at least for the time being.

Meanwhile, Boeing is back at the bargaining table with members of the International Association of Machinists union, though local news station KOMO reported negotiations appear to be at a standstill. More than 30,000 members of the union that work in the aerospace giant's factories have been off the job going on four weeks. In a note reported on by Quartz, analysts at Oxford Economics wrote the Boeing strike could impact GDP growth in Q4, similar to the aftermath of Hurricane Helene -- which caused a wide swath of devastation in the Carolinas and Florida.

The roller coaster ride for Nvidia stock continues, with the company surging to become the world's second most valuable, surpassing Microsoft, on Monday. At the close of markets on Monday, Nvidia was worth $3.132 trillion. Nvidia's stock and market capitalization has seen dramatic rises and falls in the last month and a half. After its most recent earnings report at the end of August -- in which the AI processor company delivered record earnings and smashed expectations -- its stock price tumbled because it didn't project as much growth in the next quarter as some might have wanted to see. But since then, relatively small events have caused Nvidia's stock to spike. At a Goldman Sachs conference in mid-September, CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Nvidia's soon-to-come Blackwell processors was ""so great,"" leading the stock value to pop 8%. And another leap in value came last week when Huang said on a CNBC interview that demand for the new chip was ""insane."" Monday's rally came courtesy of Super Micro Computer's announcement that sales for its liquid cooling products alongside Nvidia's GPUs were strong. This seems to be proof that the AI effect is still strong on markets. The sell off in August looked like investors were stepping back until they saw that Nvidia was worth the share price. But their behavior since then -- buying up the stock whenever there is any potentially positive news -- shows they are still overly eager about the technology's possibilities.

Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey showed that most people in the position view November's election as consequential to their organizations. Even if there weren't an election featuring two candidates with wildly differing policy ideas, there are a host of significant geopolitical and economic issues CFOs need to deal with. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what that might mean. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

Considering the state of U.S. politics, geopolitics and the economy, was there anything surprising about how CFOs responded to the survey?

Gallucci: There were some things that we pulled from the data that were interesting. For example, while CFOs are still very risk averse -- less than 15% said that this was a good time to take risk -- a lot of them were actually upbeat quarter-on-quarter around the capital markets. This data was collected before the rate cut, but there was a strong expectation [of one], and all signals indicated that rates will continue to trend downward in the next four quarters. That was a pivot over the last seven or eight quarters, as rates were rising, the capital markets were very inactive. When capital markets are inactive, there's less capital spending, there's less M&A.

More than half -- 58% -- said the election will be at least very consequential for their businesses. How does that impact how CFOs run their businesses and planning?

On the day-to-day running of the business, that particular stat has not shifted. In the longer term, a lot of scenario planning is happening. When you step back and think about where we might be from a policy perspective in six months to a year, it could look different from a tariff perspective. It could look different from a labor perspective.

CFOs more broadly have built into their psyche, [and] they approach their roles with an expectation that there will be shocks to the system that come from all angles: geopolitical shocks, certainly elections. [About] 45% of the world's GDP is electing a new leader this year. CFOs have built in an attribute of being agile and able to pivot. If you trace that back, you're going to go to the pandemic. That shock threw everybody for a loop. We haven't had a world pandemic in a hundred years, per se. [Consider] how that impacted business and supply chains, particularly things like semiconductors and computer chips, and being able to get that type of product. When you lob on top of that some of the geopolitical conflicts that we've been dealing with the last couple of years, all have contributed to a much more dynamic type of environment that chief financial officers across all industries and sectors have had to manage.

Do you think most CFOs have been expecting this wildly changing stock market, and are considering that when they're looking ahead?

Without question. They're looking at a whole host of factors in terms of making decisions around capital spending, M&A, new projects. [There is] a lot of variability in all those areas -- the economy, geopolitics, consumer spending -- which gets back to some of the data that we're taking in around being less risk averse, less bullish, et cetera. You put all these factors in a basket and then you have to make business decisions.

Let's take interest rates, for example. As the Fed was on a plan to raise interest rates to fight inflation, there was a lot of unpredictability: When is it going to peak? When is it going to top out? What we have right now is a little more clarity in terms of it's on the way down. They've stated that they want to get to somewhere around two point half percent and the FOMC rate. That gives a little more certainty towards CFOs in that particular area of the private markets. They can start to plan around that. Once you have clarity in a particular area and a sense that things have less unpredictability, you'll start to see some more actions on the part of corporates and CFOs, specifically, around things like M&A and capital spending.

Some of these big question marks will be figured out six months from now. We will have another president. That person will be in office and their economic policies could be stabilizing. How do you see CFOs responding to a similar survey then?

If you look historically post-election, there's a little more certainty in terms of where things will go in the near to medium term. It's hard to handicap what all that will look like. We'll continue to be in a descending rate capital market. With that, you'll see all indications are a much more robust capital market in the way of M&A and bond issues and whatnot.

History would tell you that there could be some type of bounce and there could be more optimism. There could be another geopolitical conflict that could send the markets into a tizzy. We're dealing with things like natural disasters throughout the globe, and that has an impact. I have to hedge with what we know and we don't know.

"Hungary's Orban interrupted, accused of 'selling out' country to Russia, China during EU news conference",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hungarys-orban-interrupted-accused-selling-out-country-russia-china-eu-news-conference,2024-10-08T16:04:12Z,"During the disruption, he yelled accusations at Orban, questioning how much he had ""sold out"" Hungary.

An activist and municipal councilor for a Hungarian opposition party disrupted a news conference in Strasbourg, France, on Tuesday as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was laying out his plans for Hungary's six-month presidency of the European Union.

The activist, Márton Gyekiczki, interrupted Orbán as he was speaking about his opposition to immigration, running toward the podium where Orbán sat and throwing a stack of what appeared to be banknotes at the prime minister.

""How much did you sell out the country for? How much did you sell out the country for, Mr. Prime Minister?"" Gyekiczki yelled as the papers scattered. ""He sold out to Putin, he sold out to Xi Jinping!"" -- referring to the leaders of Russia and China.

TRUMP TOUTS EUROPEAN 'STRONGMAN' AS CLOSE ALLY DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: WHO IS VIKTOR ORBAN?

The disruption came as Orbán was set to address the European Parliament on Wednesday during Hungary's six-month rotating presidency of the bloc. His government has long been at odds with the EU over what it sees as his curtailing of democratic rights, and has increasingly come under fire for his close relations with autocracies like Russia and China.

Gyekiczki, the activist, who was taken to the ground by a security guard and led out of the room, is a member of Hungary's Democratic Coalition party and a local council member in a Budapest suburb.

The president of that party, former Prime Minister Ference Gyurcsány, later wrote on social media that he was ""proud"" of Gyekiczki for his actions.

""We will say it everywhere and always: Hungary has a traitorous government!"" he wrote.

Orbán is expected to receive a mixed reception in the EU parliament on Wednesday. Many lawmakers have pushed for his government to be deprived of EU funds over what they see as rule-of-law and corruption violations.

HUNGARY LAUNCHES EU PRESIDENCY WITH TRUMP-LIKE CALL TO 'MAKE EUROPE GREAT AGAIN'

Two years ago, the parliament declared that Hungary under Orbán had become ""a hybrid regime of electoral autocracy,"" taking it out of the community of democracies.

Yet Orbán this year successfully formed the Patriots for Europe group within the parliament, uniting far-right parties from around the continent to form the third-largest group in the EU legislature.

During the news conference on Tuesday, Orbán lamented what he sees as a declining EU economy and lagging competitiveness with the United States and China, saying that he saw that as ""the most serious challenge we have to face.""

He also argued against recently adopted EU tariffs on Chinese-produced electric vehicles, and railed against immigration which he said was resulting in the destruction of the EU's visa-free Schengen area as countries like Germany, Austria, Italy and Slovenia have introduced temporary border checks along their frontiers.

""These individual attempts will actually break up the Schengen system,"" Orbán said, adding that he proposed a regular ""Schengen Summit"" for member countries to meet and discuss border policy.

Responding to the disruption by the activist, Orbán offered ""a word of explanation for Hungarian political culture.""

""When a Hungarian politician tells another one that he is a scoundrel, all it means in our culture is that 'I disagree with you,'"" he said."
America The Tax Haven? Exploring The U.S. Trade Deficit,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/taxnotes/2024/10/08/america-the-tax-haven-exploring-the-us-trade-deficit/,2024-10-08T15:38:08Z,"In this episode of Tax Notes Talk, Professors Kenneth Austin and Hillel Nadler discuss the policies that they believe make the United States a tax haven, and the resulting effects on the economy.

Tax Notes Talk is a podcast produced by Tax Notes. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

David D. Stewart: Welcome to the podcast. I'm David Stewart, editor in chief of Tax Notes Today International. This week: just like haven.

Tax havens and financial secrecy are regular topics of discussion in the tax world. We've previously looked at tax havens from an international perspective, and you can find those episodes in the show notes. But today, we're turning the lens around and considering if the United States is a tax haven.

Here to talk more about this are two authors who have recently considered this topic in-depth in the pages of Tax Notes. Kenneth Austin is a retired Treasury economist, and an adjunct professor at American University's International School of Service, and Hillel Nadler is an assistant professor at Wayne State University School of Law.

David D. Stewart: Let's start off with the big question of why should we look at the United States as being a tax haven?

Hillel Nadler: Well, there are really two aspects to this. One is that, on the U.S. side, in terms of the U.S. tax burden on financial inflows, foreign investors can hold U.S. financial assets while paying minimal U.S. tax on the profits from those assets, so that's one aspect of it. The second aspect of America being a tax haven in this sense is that the U.S. has a unique financial secrecy position, which means that foreign investors can not only avoid paying tax to the U.S., or pay minimal tax to the U.S., but they can avoid paying tax in their home countries on their profits from U.S. financial assets.

David D. Stewart: In your article about this subject, you talked about this affecting the trade deficit. Could you explain that?

Kenneth Austin: Yeah. Basically, the way it works in today's world, and particularly for the U.S., our trade deficit is equal to how much money we borrow net from the rest of the world. When I say borrow, it's not exactly like we go down to the People's Bank of China and fill out a loan application. It's just that any foreigner, or I guess in the tax code, nonresident alien, can simply buy U.S. assets on, say, the bond market, stock market, deposit it in a bank.

That's lending internationally. It may not be to a particular individual, and the money may already have been borrowed. Say the U.S. Treasury sells a bond, and that bond is sold to an American, but that American sells it to a nonresident alien, then we are borrowing internationally. That will affect the exchange rates. And as we borrow, the exchange rate appreciates, which causes the U.S. trade deficit to grow.

David D. Stewart: How did we start going down this road?

Hillel Nadler: These provisions have accumulated over time. These provisions that offer favorable tax treatment to foreign investment, many of them made sense in a different exchange rate situation, when the United States' financial situation was different.

If you start by addressing each provision, one provision that's favorable to foreign investors in the United States is that capital gains from the sale of most U.S. investment assets, including stock buybacks by U.S. corporations, aren't taxed at all to foreign investors. They pay no U.S. tax on those. Then in the early 1930s, all the way back then, the U.S. Treasury actually tried to collect tax on capital gains of foreign investors. If you looked at the code then, there was no specific exemption. But doing that was difficult because, if the foreign investor didn't actually file a tax return, Treasury had no way of knowing what they had earned. And Treasury was also concerned about discouraging foreign investment.

Eventually, Congress responded by introducing what we currently have now, which is an exemption for capital gains for foreign investors. I think this historical episode, the following historical episode illustrates our point nicely, which was that the exemption was actually broadened in the 1960s, by adding what's known as the securities trading safe harbor, which says that capital gains of foreign investors would be exempt even if they're present in the United States, they're trading in the United States, or acting through a U.S. agent.

Previously, doing so would have been considered engaging in a trade or business in the U.S. and would have subjected the foreign investor to U.S. tax. But this change was made explicitly to encourage foreign investment in the U.S.

The context was this was in response to the then balance of payments crisis. At the time, the U.S. was trying to prop up the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates and wanted to encourage foreign investment inflows into the United States. They wanted to encourage investors to turn U.S. dollars into longer-term investments. That's just one example, but a lot of these provisions were specifically designed to attract foreign investment into the United States.

Kenneth Austin: May I interject one thing? I know this may sound rather picayune. But in English, the word ""investment"" has more than one meaning. And words have multiple definitions, eventually they lose meaning. Because I say one thing, you hear another. You can talk about a foreigner buying a share of GM, and we'll call that an investment in the stock market. What congressmen tend to hear is creating some form of productive capacity, like plant and equipment, and something especially with an employee parking lot. When really, what they've done is made a bank deposit in the U.S. and then used that bank deposit to buy a stock. No real productive capacity was created.

As long as you say the word ""investment,"" I think a lot of people, and particularly politicians, will hear, ""We're going to have bigger employee parking lots."" That's just not necessarily true. Most of the money that's come into the U.S. in the last 30 years has not built productive capacity. Yeah, we have some Honda factories, and BMW factories, etc. But overwhelmingly, the money has just gone into the banking system. It's bank deposits. A lot of it winds up just financing dodgy consumer debt.

David D. Stewart: Now, is the U.S. unique in the way that it treats these foreign inflows? You're mentioning this nontaxation of capital gains.

Hillel Nadler: The U.S. isn't unique in the way it treats foreign financial inflows. At least, not now. But in some ways, the U.S. has been a leader on this.

If you go back to the 1980s, the U.S. introduces this exemption for interest income on portfolio debt. If you're a foreign investor, you hold a U.S. issued bond, then the interest on that bond is going to be, in most cases, going to be exempt from tax in the U.S. At the time when this exemption was introduced, the U.S. was alone, but other countries wanted to follow suit with the U.S., and other major economies, and they were worried about losing capital flows to the U.S., so they followed suit and also abolished their taxes on interest paid to foreign investors.

David D. Stewart: Now you mentioned this Bretton Woods, the fixed exchange rates. Since the collapse of that, what have been the results of the U.S. treatment of foreign investments since then?

Kenneth Austin: Well, I would say that there's really two periods. When the Bretton Woods system first collapsed, most of the Western countries, the advanced countries, whatever we want to call them -- Europe, the U.S., Japan -- just gave up on trying to control their exchange rates. The Japanese backtracked on that and it became a problem. But we backed up on that. We just let currencies move against each other. The Europeans didn't like that, and that started a movement towards the European Union.

A lot of other countries continued to control their exchange rate. The way you do that is you buy and sell foreign currency. Particularly, the U.S. dollar was very valued because we had big financial markets. You can move your money in and out quickly. If you wanted to make your own currency more valuable, you would buy it and pay for it in dollars, but you needed dollars to do that. Or if you want to depreciate your currency so you could run a larger trade surplus or smaller deficit, then you bought foreign currency. The price of foreign currency would go up, and that would encourage your exporters to earn more of the more valuable foreign currency, and discourage imports. If the price of foreign currency went down, it had the opposite effect. It was less valuable to you as an exporter, and it was cheaper to buy foreign goods.

That was a way to control your trade balance. For a long time, that mostly worked. I don't want to go in too much detail here, but things started to change when we had the oil crises of the '70s, because a lot of countries in the Middle East that had not previously had a lot of money to invest, they just started buying U.S. dollars. We allowed that. We actually encouraged that. Then the Reagan administration came along, did a lot of huge tax cuts, tried to cut the budget expenditures, but we still had a huge deficit. We were issuing a lot of U.S. government bonds, and that attracted more. Our interest rates went very high. A lot of people bought dollars around the world. Then that gradually tapered off.

By the late 1990s, America actually had a small fiscal surplus. But then, something new started to happen. There was what was called the global savings glut. A lot of countries, particularly in Asia, were growing very rapidly, and they were saving more than they were investing, actually finding uses for those savings. When the Asian financial crisis came, a lot of money came to the U.S. It also came from Europe, which was trying to reduce its budget deficits. So it all came here. The U.S. current account deficit, which is the trade deficit with some extras thrown in, basically tripled within about two, three years. Now all this money flowing into U.S. financial markets blew up the dot-com bubble, and we had a recession in 2000, two, three years after the Asian financial crisis.

Normally, that would have caused the trade deficits to shrink. It just shrank for a little bit. And then it started growing, because the rest of the world needed a place to put their money and it came to the U.S. That financed a larger and larger trade deficit. Because there are basically two ways you can get foreign currency. You can earn it by exporting; you can borrow it. Whether you want to borrow it or not, if you borrowed it, it causes your currency to become more expensive on world markets. That encourages trade deficit, because more is coming in than is going out.

Actually, what'll happen almost immediately is that the amount that you're borrowing and your trade deficit will be equal. It's actually to the penny because the balance of payments is a double-entry bookkeeping system, and that's the way it has to work.

David D. Stewart: What is the negative to the U.S. economy of having a lot of this money coming in?

Kenneth Austin: Well, one thing is our financial system can't always handle it. We just had a huge amount of money came in in the first decade of the 21st century. All of a sudden, you're watching all these TV ads, ""Don't have to fill out paperwork, get our mortgage."" A lot of these mortgages were bad. All sorts of ridiculous things happened in U.S. financial markets because interest rates started to go really low. People became desperate to find something they could actually put their money in. That led to a lot of the abuses that caused the great financial crisis.

At the same time, all this money was raising the price of the U.S. dollar. It was just not profitable to invest in U.S. production facilities anymore, because things could always be made cheaper elsewhere, particularly in China, and this was the China shock. There's some economic work that actually said this China shock, all these people who got thrown out of work in what are now the swing states -- Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, all across the Midwest, the old Rust Belt -- a lot of these people, the children and grandchildren of New Deal Democrats, they voted Trump because somebody had to help. And if you look at the areas where that trade impact was the biggest, where the most jobs were lost, not only in the factories but in the surrounding towns that depended on the factories for the money that would be spent there, they were terribly harmed by this. It's very tangible, particularly to the people who lost their job.

David D. Stewart: Turning back to the tax policy underlying this, you mentioned the treatment of capital gains. Are there other things that the U.S. government is doing that are allowing inflowing dollars to escape taxation?

Hillel Nadler: Yeah. The basic structure of the U.S. tax code, especially as it relates to inbound investment, or inbound financial flows if you don't like to use the word ""investment,"" is that it's very favorable towards passive investment by foreign taxpayers.

Your listeners are probably familiar -- there are basically two different tax regimes that apply to foreign taxpayers: one that applies to passive investment income, and another that applies to active business profits from an active business in the United States. Very broadly, foreign taxpayers, if there's income that's derived from a U.S. trade or business, or in the lingo of the tax code, effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, then on that income, they're going to be subject to the same graduated tax rates that apply to U.S. taxpayers. When it comes to passive investment income, nominally, that type of income is subject to tax at a flat rate of 30 percent on the gross amount of U.S.-sourced passive investment income.

But when it comes to that passive investment income, there are large gaps in that flat rate tax. For one, as we mentioned, capital gains from the sale of most U.S. investment assets, other than real estate, aren't taxed at all because they're not considered U.S.-source income. Also, interest from U.S. bank deposits, and most importantly, from U.S. portfolio debt, bonds, most other debt instruments, are also going to be exempt from U.S. taxation. And these two categories, capital gains and portfolio interest, account for the majority of passive income earned by foreign investors in the United States, and they're exempt from U.S. tax.

Kenneth Austin: Yeah. This is a bit I'm going to tread here on the tax part. But you can think of, if I own a Treasury bond, at the end of the year, I'm going to have some interest and a 1099 form. If I sell that bond to a German resident, then they get the interest on that bond, but it's disappeared from the U.S. tax base. And they pay nothing. And the U.S. isn't necessarily going to share the information with the German government that your resident or citizen earned this income on a U.S. bond. It's very hard for them to get it, and we made that system deliberate. Your choice is, ""OK, I could buy a German bond, but I'm going to pay interest on it. If I buy an American bond, I won't."" I could voluntarily pay some German taxes, but I may not.

If you look at, for example, a lot of Europe, you can find 40, 50, 60 percent marginal interest rates there. In the U.S., the worst you could do is pay the 30 percent withholding, but you don't have to. It's a much better deal from the tax point of view to put your money in the U.S. That is a result of U.S. policies designed to bring that money in. I think you can discuss what the politics is, but a lot of congressmen really believe that that money coming in is investment, in the sense it creates jobs and employee parking lots, when really it's just a bank deposit. What happens to that money after it gets here is anybody's guess, particularly the bankers.

Hillel Nadler: Just to add another wrinkle there, it's not just the statutory provisions of the code that offer favorable treatment, U.S. tax treatment, to foreign investment. The U.S. also has a network of bilateral tax treaties, which also exempt a lot of passive foreign investment from U.S. tax. But if you look at where financial inflows are coming, it's not just from those treaty countries. It's also from jurisdictions with which the U.S. doesn't have those bilateral tax treaties.

And that's because the other leg of the U.S. status as a tax haven, which is that the U.S., or U.S. financial institutions, can offer financial secrecy to their clients in a way that other jurisdictions can't, or other major economies and financial centers can't because other major economies signed up for the common reporting standard, which is reciprocal and provides for the automatic exchange of information between different jurisdictions and different tax authorities.

The U.S. has FATCA, which it adopted unilaterally, which provides the U.S. with a lot of information about U.S. taxpayers, but doesn't provide the same information to other jurisdictions and to other tax authorities. The U.S. financial institutions aren't required to collect and the U.S. isn't required to share information with other countries, for example, about the identity of controlling persons or beneficial owners of certain entities that are used to hold passive investments. Foreign investors can avoid tax reporting to their own tax authorities by holding U.S. accounts through U.S. entities, like LLCs or trusts, and things like that.

Kenneth Austin: If you'd spoke to the lobbyists behind a lot of these provisions, they'd say, ""We're just trying to prevent double taxation."" Double taxation isn't the issue. It's zero taxation.

If all the foreign financiers who bought these Treasury bonds paid tax somewhere, the full amount, particularly to their home government maybe in Denmark, or Switzerland, or Germany, they'd keep more of it at home, they'd be less inclined to bring it to the U.S. But the U.S. says, ""Bring it here, and there won't be double taxation. There won't any taxation.""

In some ways, double taxation might be unfortunate. But remember, nobody is forced to put their money somewhere else. They could always just keep it at home and pay their own taxes. They made a choice. Now I think one country collecting the tax makes sense. But to exempt these interest or other portfolio income from all taxes is a bit ridiculous. Since it's not symmetrical, it attracts more of that money here, which triggers a higher U.S. trade deficit.

David D. Stewart: It sounds like the policy of trying to get more money in was very effective. Maybe too effective. How would we go about unwinding that and making the U.S. less of a tax haven?

Kenneth Austin: We could theoretically eliminate the trade deficit overnight, but that would be a terrible idea. We want the economy to adjust. We don't want to shock it. We would have to rebuild an awful lot of factories and companies that were destroyed in the last 30 years. That would take time. Maybe four years, maybe 10 years. It's a guess now; we haven't started that project. We would want to do this gradually. Just gradually unwind this. We don't know how fast it would go, but as we get a little bit of experience, we should be able to do that. As long as we are, as I say, we want to do this carefully. It's not something we do overnight.

But during that period, we're going to be rebuilding all of these companies, all of these factories, and that will create a lot of jobs. That transition period will be a period of prosperity.

I'll let Hillel talk about how he would wind it down.

Hillel Nadler: Sure. I think, for starters, reversing some of these exemptions, the current exemptions for portfolio interest, for example, would be a first step towards making U.S. financial assets and foreign financial inflows less attractive. Providing reciprocal exchange of information so that, even if these foreign investors aren't paying tax in the U.S., we can at least help ensure that they're paying tax to their home governments.

But I do want to caution, our argument isn't that the only reason investors are holding U.S. financial assets is because of favorable tax treatment. There are a lot of reasons why someone outside the U.S. might want to hold a U.S. asset. This goes into the status of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, and all sorts of other reasons why people might want to hold U.S. financial assets. We just think the tax treatment is part of the picture. If we're trying to reduce foreign financial inflows, part of the solution is to start thinking about reversing some of the favorable tax treatment that foreign investors get.

Kenneth Austin: There are other things we could do. A few years ago, I think it was 2018, there was a bill introduced into the U.S. Senate, the Baldwin-Hawley Bill. That would have introduced, I think, the market access charge -- I think Hillel calls it a transactions tax -- which was a small payment every time you converted another currency into the dollar. Unfortunately, the bill went nowhere, but it was the right approach.

The thing is, you can't reduce the trade deficit by imposing tariffs. It doesn't work. It just results in same trade deficit, just at a more appreciated dollar. What you have to do is attenuate the financial inflows. I think ideally, we might want to bring those to zero. Now lots of people would still own dollars abroad, but they just on net wouldn't be buying more. If you got to that point, U.S. current account deficit, which is, as I said, a larger definition of the trade deficit, would go to zero.

David D. Stewart: The issue of extra money coming into this country doesn't seem to be something that is talked about as a negative. Why is it that you're viewing this as a negative, but we don't generally hear that from other people discussing the issue of trade imbalances?

Kenneth Austin: That's a very good question I ask myself. I say, ""Why am I one of the few economists that wants to do this?"" I am a retired Treasury economist, and nobody wanted to talk about it.

But I think part of it is, among mainstream economists, there seems to be an ideological taboo against this. One reason is mainstream economists hate the idea of what used to be called capital controls. It's still actually called capital controls, although once again, it's not little factories flowing across the world. It's just bank deposits.

They keep saying, ""Oh, well this is investment."" And actually, some pretty good economists confuse this flow of bank deposits with, they say, ""Real, productive capacity."" New factories, new electrical generation facilities, ships, transport, all this stuff. It's not. It's bank deposit. But by this verbal ambiguity, they convince themselves of it.

But they do know that this is really a question of financial flow. In 2016 Alan Blinder, who I think is probably almost the definition of mainstream esteemed economists, wrote an op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal on five important facts about trade. He said, ""A trade deficit isn't so bad because we're getting real goods and services, and the rest of the world is just getting our IOUs"" of bonds, stocks, corporate bonds, treasury bonds. ""It's just paper. It's just paper. Is that so bad?""

Well, that is ridiculous in the sense that it's something worthy of ridicule. And for an economist of his stature to say that, I don't even know if it's plausible he believes it. It's an astonishing thing to say. But I can give you other examples of economists just twisting themselves in knots, not to acknowledge that the U.S., if we stop borrowing -- the one exception that I find is when the other party holds the White House, then everybody comes really worried about the budget deficit, and blames all the borrowing and the budget deficit for the trade deficit. But that's not necessarily true.

When these large trade deficits began in the late '90s, the U.S. actually had a small fiscal surplus. But the rest of the world had the global savings glut. They just had a lot of money that they couldn't use at home. So it came here.

David D. Stewart: Well, this has been fascinating. Ken, Hillel, thank you so much for being here."
There's No TikTok If It's 'A Tool Of Chinese Communist Propaganda',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/10/08/theres-no-tiktok-if-its-a-tool-of-chinese-communist-propaganda/,2024-10-08T15:11:58Z,"Bikes were ""as indispensable to a Chinese as a car to twentieth century Americans."" Those are the words of Fox Butterfield from Alive In the Bitter Sea, his 1982 book about communist-era China. Call Butterfield's account of just some of communism's myriad horrors essential reading when it comes to attaining a tangible grasp of how little communism associates with anything related to competition or prosperity.

As Butterfield went on to report, ""To buy a bike you also had to have a special bike purchase coupon"" that was exceedingly difficult to come by. Butterfield interviewed one factory worker who indicated that, ""out of every one hundred workers, only two were given these treasured certificates each year."" Such was brutal life amid the CCP's control of China's economy from the proverbial Commanding Heights.

The China of old came to mind while reading a recent Wall Street Journal column by the great Andy Kessler. He quoted Sen. Tom Cotton as saying that ""TikTok is a tool of Chinese Communist propaganda."" Let's just say they don't make cold warriors like they used to. Is Cotton aware of just how hideously cruel communism was, and much more important, how little production there is when governmental bodies (including the CCP) manage economic activity, when property is owned by them, and when people allegedly work according to their abilities and needs?

The questions about Cotton (along with a myriad of other TikTok critics in the commentariat) are asked mainly because communist rule is defined by unrelenting desperation. As was made apparent during the Soviet Union years for Russia, communist rule and its bitter fruits is the stuff of empty shelves, not to mention that if there's anything on the shelf, it's what no one wants. It's worth thinking about as Cotton and others of his ilk claim TikTok is but a puppet for the CCP. You mean the TikTok that is headquartered in Singapore and Los Angeles, and that is substantially owned by American investors?

If TikTok were a tool of any government, let alone a CCP the rule of which so awfully correlated with immense dysfunction, it's safe to say it would in no way be a global powerhouse. Evidence supporting this claim isn't just vivified by what economic life was like when the CCP arrogated to itself command-and-control powers, but also by the relative freedom of the U.S. economy that has logically gifted Americans (and the world) with the most dynamic, customer-leading businesses in the world.

It's just another reminder that TikTok's critics can't have it both ways. They can't make baseless claims about TikTok being a ""a tool"" of the CCP when it's remembered just how awful and inept commerce was when the CCP was actually running the Chinese economy. In short, if TikTok were ""a tool of Chinese Communist propaganda,"" it not only would have no voluntary users as is the case with all government-operated entities of any kind, it also wouldn't exist as evidenced by the scarcity of nearly every necessity when the CCP ran China."
I went to a classic Wisconsin supper club to talk politics. This is what I learned,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5138314/wisconsin-supper-club-harris-trump,2024-10-08T15:11:27Z,"The Packing House in Milwaukee caters to diners of all political persuasions. Keren Carrión/NPR hide caption

When we started planning an election reporting trip to swing state Wisconsin, locals told us we had to include a visit to a supper club to experience a unique part of the state's culture. So when I finally met Chris Wiken, whose family opened The Packing House in Milwaukee 50 years ago, my first question was, ""What on earth is a supper club?""

""This is the elusive question,"" he says. ""The whole idea of a supper club is somewhere that you're going to come and spend the evening at.""

Typically, a supper club will include a few things: a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned cocktail at the bar, seafood or prime rib in the dining room and then live music and a boozy ice cream drink to close out the night.

Even though The Packing House was remodeled about a decade ago, it still has a classic old-time aesthetic with dark wood and dim lighting. Walking through the doors feels like going back in time.

Milwaukee's main airport terminal was just across the street when The Packing House opened in 1974. Now, that terminal serves private jets where former President Donald Trump, Vice President Harris or their running mates park every time they come to town.

""The police and Secret Service come over and go, 'Hey, Chris, they have to close down the street again.' And then I go and shake my fist at them,"" he says, joking that he'll vote for whoever shuts down the street in front of his restaurant fewer times.

You won't see a Harris or Trump sign in front of The Packing House. Wiken doesn't want to alienate his customers, who have a wide range of views, as the All Things Considered crew and I discovered when we started chatting people up at the bar.

Janine Collette, having dinner with an old friend, remembers growing up in Wisconsin before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in the state.

""In high school, we used to raise money in the girls' bathrooms to help girls go to the state of New York to get an abortion,"" she says. ""We're not going back."" Collette is excited to cast her vote for the candidate she expects to become the first female U.S. president.

At the other end of the bar, Ron Raasch says that he has voted for Democrats his whole life and that this election may be the first time he doesn't. He's disillusioned with the two-party system and is considering a vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

""It's very hard to see the difference when both of the major parties are going to continue shipping arms all over the world and especially to Gaza,"" he says. Raasch isn't concerned that in 2016 and 2020 the margin of victory in Wisconsin for Trump and Biden, respectively, was less than 1% of the vote. ""People are throwing that as a fear tactic,"" he says. ""And I'm trying to [more so] make a statement that the two-party system is showing its age and its frailties.""

Wearing a Packers hat at the bar, Lee Cielonko is nursing a beer while he waits for his food to arrive. ""I want the economy to be put back together. I want energy. I want to drill, baby, drill, man,"" he says.

He's supporting Trump and is concerned about immigration, saying: ""People come here and they don't have the same culture as us. They don't understand and know a lot of the way our culture works.""

So much about the future, as well as this election, is uncertain; there can be something comforting in the familiar: fish fry Friday, a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned at the bar and live music in a place that has been doing pretty much the same thing since before most Americans were born."
5 key takeaways from Kamala Harris' '60 Minutes' interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/5-key-takeaways-from-kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview,2024-10-08T15:03:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program.

Here are some standout moments from the Harris interview.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Whitaker asked Harris about the ongoing crises in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, with Israel under assault from Iranian proxies and Ukraine persevering in the fight against Russia's invasion. In her answers, Harris did not do much to distinguish her foreign policy from that of the current administration.

On Israel, Harris echoed Biden's call for the war with Hamas to end, though she acknowledged the Jewish nation's right to defend itself after the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, when terrorists slaughtered 1,200 people and took 250 captives back to Gaza.

""I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end,"" Harris said.

Whitaker pointed out that although the United States has handed billions of dollars to Israel in military aid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted the Biden-Harris administration's call for a cease-fire with Hamas. When asked if the U.S. holds no sway over Netanyahu, Harris dodged the question and stayed on message, emphasizing the current administration's diplomatic efforts.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" she said.

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

Whitaker pressed, ""but it seems Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.""

Harris declined to answer that point. ""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""

On Europe, Harris stuck with Biden's position that Ukraine must be involved in any resolution to the war with Russia.

""There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the U.N. charter participating in what that success looks like,"" she said.

In a definitive statement, Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war unless Ukrainian representatives were present. However, she was less specific on whether Ukraine should join NATO.

""Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression,"" Harris said. ""Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREET TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Whitaker confronted Harris on her apparent flip-flop on immigration, noting that she supported Biden's efforts to reverse Trump's strict policies even as a historic flood of illegal immigrants crossed the border. Now, the vice president has ""embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers,"" he said.

Whitaker asked, ""If that's the right answer, now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?""

Harris responded by pointing to congressional Republicans who backed out of a bipartisan agreement on a border security bill negotiated by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. ""Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed. And he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress kill the bill. Don't let it move forward,"" she said.

However, Whitaker pushed back on the vice president, observing that in the first three years of the Biden-Harris administration, border arrivals quadrupled and there was no action from Biden or Harris.

""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?""

Harris did not answer the question but asserted that her administration has offered solutions ""from day one, literally.""

""We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem,"" she said, again echoing Biden.

To fight inflation, Harris said she intends to ask Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries. She would expand the child tax credit to $6,000, give first-time homebuyers $25,000 in down payment assistance and offer generous assistance to people starting a small business.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that the total cost of her economic proposals would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

""How are you going to pay for that?"" asked Whitaker.

""Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it,"" Harris answered. ""But my plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.""

HARRIS SAYS WEALTHY AMERICANS, CORPORATIONS WILL PAY HIGHER TAXES TO FUND ECONOMIC PLAN

Whitaker pressed again. ""Pardon me, madam vice president. The question was, how are you going to pay for it?""

The Democratic candidate's answer was that the rich must ""pay their fair share in taxes.""

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations, and I plan on making that fair,"" Harris asserted.

Whitaker followed up again, stating, ""we're dealing with the real world here"" and observing that Congress has shown no inclination to raise taxes.

""I disagree with you,"" Harris responded. ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

""None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy,"" she continued. ""Let me tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that I am also a capitalist, and I know the limitations of government.""

After a discussion on foreign policy, Whitaker took ""a hard left turn"" and asked Harris about her recent admission that she is a gun owner.

""I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time,"" Harris said after he asked what kind of gun she owns. ""And, I mean, look, my background is in law enforcement, and so there you go.""

Harris served as the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004-2011 and was California's attorney general from 2011-2017 before she was elected to the U.S. Senate and later selected as Biden's 2020 running mate.

She told Whitaker she has fired her handgun ""at a shooting range.""

Though Harris had served in government for decades before becoming vice president, she remains a largely unknown figure in national politics. She did not run for president in the 2024 Democratic primary and only became a candidate two and a half months ago, when Biden decided to drop out of the race amid mounting pressure from Democrats concerned that he was too old to win.

""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you,"" Whitaker told Harris. They don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""

""It's an election, Bill,"" Harris replied. ""And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support."
Trump's Tax Plan Will Be Fine,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanlewis/2024/10/08/trumps-tax-plan-will-be-fine/,2024-10-08T14:53:15Z,"The Great Depression got started with the passage of the Smoot Hawley Tariff in the United States, by the Republican Party, which immediately set off a cascade of retaliatory tariffs worldwide. This alone did not cause the Great Depression, but it did cause the initial downturn. This was followed by a long string of bad decisions in reaction to that downturn, such as Republican Herbert Hoover's 1932 tax increase which took the top income tax rate from 25% to 63%.

After World War Two, the whole world came to recognize that the Trade War of 1930 was a major contributor to the Great Depression. At the 1944 meeting in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, they began a long postwar movement toward Free Trade, with a proposal for an International Trade Organization, to go along with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank also established at the same time. The ITO was not passed, but evolved into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which then became the World Trade Organization in 1995.

Conservatives thus have some trepidation when they see a move by presidential candidate Donald Trump, representing the Economic Nationalist wing that includes Patrick Buchanan, move again toward tariffs and restrictions on trade. The reasons for this are well known, and include the corrosive effects on the US's middle class since China entered the WTO in 2001; or arguments that the US, as a continental superpower, needs to retain a large measure of self-sufficiency in key industries including electronics.

Tariffs are taxes; basically, they are a variant of sales taxes. Trump's proposals, mirroring those of Patrick Buchanan, are for a single-rate across-the-board universal tariff of 10% or perhaps later 20%, instead of the troublesome item-by-item and country-by-country approach of the past. This is actually no different than most countries in the world already have, as a component of their value-added-tax -- also of 10%-20% -- which also applies to imports.

Nevertheless, more taxes typically have a negative economic effect. This is offset, in the Trump proposals, with lower taxes on business.

The Corporate Income Tax rate would be lowered to 20% from 21%; possibly to 15% for businesses making their products in the US. This is the right idea, but certainly very small. A reduction in the Corporate Income Tax rate to 15% for everyone would be more effective at boosting the economy, and is not that far from the 19% corporate income tax rate now enjoyed by Britain. When you add Corporate taxes in some States, it would mirror Britain's rate. Forty-four States have their own Corporate taxes; the rate in Alaska, Illinois, Minnesota and New Jersey is nine percent or higher.

Much of the rest of Trump's tax proposals consist of extending his 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act -- which led to a noticeably stronger economy, particularly among the lower income brackets. Some tax technicians think that this would lead to some disastrous decline in revenue, compared to if the tax cuts were allowed to expire; but this assumes that these taxes would, in 2027, produce a much higher revenue/GDP figure than the exact same taxes produced before the reform, in 2016. The Congressional Budget Office thinks that revenue from the Individual Income Tax will reach 9.8% of GDP in 2027, with the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts -- a whopping 18% higher than the 8.3% actually received in 2016, before the TCJA, and a figure that has never been exceeded except for two years (2000 and 2022), when tax revenues were momentarily boosted by capital gains from huge stock market rises the year earlier. Not gonna happen.

My impression is that the smallish reductions in corporate tax rates would not provide much of an advantage, compared to the potential drag from higher tariffs, especially if they are matched with higher tariffs on US goods from other countries worldwide.

The best and easiest way to produce an economic advantage would be to eliminate all capital gains taxes. To this we could eliminate double-taxation of corporate income via dividends, which should be tax-free. An important distortion between debt and equity financing should be ameliorated by making corporate income taxable before interest, known as the ""VAT base."" Along with this, interest income should be untaxed at the personal level.

The main argument against eliminating capital gains taxes might be the categorization of some forms of income as capital gains. This is particularly true of investment funds. Income from fund management should be taxed as regular business income, when it is realized. This mirrors the tax treatment of employee stock options today, which are subject to the regular personal income tax (not capital gains) when they are exercised.

Many of the more successful countries in the world do not tax capital gains. These include Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Belgium, Germany, Malaysia, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Switzerland. It used to include Japan, which did not tax capital gains until 1989.

Trump also introduced the idea of a 60% flat-rate tariff on Chinese imports. Besides potentially providing relief for US workers from international wage competition, this is motivated by geopolitical concerns, with supply lines for key military and other industries compromised by dependence on Chinese and Taiwanese sources. Implementing such a plan would increase the need for more business and growth-friendly tax reductions elsewhere to compensate.

Trump even floated the idea of eliminating the Income Tax altogether, and replacing it with the Tariff as a revenue source. This was actually the regular state of affairs in the United States before the Sixteenth Amendment was passed in 1913. There was no Income Tax.

But, the Federal government was much smaller then. Today, a more realistic idea is to replace the Income Tax with a VAT, which is an indirect tax that resembles both the retail sales tax and various Flat Tax income tax proposals that have been made since the 1980s.

Since the flat-rate tariff is already an inherent part of the VAT found in most countries worldwide, I think Trump is testing the waters for a much more important reform -- eliminating the Federal Income Tax altogether, both Individual and Corporate, including a full repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment, and replacing it with a VAT, with a rate of probably around 15%.

For many decades, we've avoided the VAT because we don't want to have an income tax and VAT together, like high-tax European socialist governments. But, adopting a VAT is the best way to replace the income tax.

This resembles the ""FairTax"" national sales tax proposal popular among conservatives, but would be much better in my view. The VAT is a proven and effective system worldwide, while retail sales tax rates above 10% have been problematic. Replacing the problematic and destructive Income Tax with a VAT is actually the solution offered by President George W. Bush's economic advisor Lawrence Lindsey, in his 2013 book The Growth Experiment Revisited.

In the nineteenth century, the United States had high tariffs, domestic excise taxes (sales taxes), and no income tax. It was the most successful country of that century."
Inflation Reduction Act 2 Years Later: Building Clean Electricity Faster Than Ever,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/10/08/inflation-reduction-act-2-years-later-building-clean-electricity-faster-than-ever/,2024-10-08T14:27:54Z,"In August 2022, when the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, it became the most significant investment in climate that the United States has ever made, making long-term, transformational investments in clean energy deployment, manufacturing, electric vehicles and buildings, and targeted investments to support communities disproportionately impacted by our energy system.

America's electricity sector is the IRA's cornerstone, making up 30-44% of the bill's expected economy-wide emissions reductions. Now, two years after the IRA's passage, signs of progress are emerging.

Before the IRA passed, clean electricity incentives were caught in a cycle of short-term extensions and expirations, creating enormous clean energy industry uncertainty. The IRA invested in the clean energy industry's long-term economic health by creating a decade's worth of certainty for electricity providers, developers, and investors solidifying that clean energy was the better deal for electricity consumers, shareholders, and the planet.

The IRA owes its name to the era of rising prices in which it passed. Global fossil fuel price volatility and supply chain constraints were driving up inflation and interest rates. With clean energy costs largely coming as upfront capital expenditures, the industry was in a period of moderating growth when the bill passed.

Key policies included extension and expansion of clean electricity tax credits, providing up to 60% off the cost of clean energy for ten years, the creation of manufacturing tax credits that bring clean energy manufacturing to the U.S., and billions of dollars to grant and loan programs to make sure upfront funding is there for projects that will save money in the long-term.

The effect of the IRA has only just begun to show up in clean energy deployment. While the first half of 2023 was still relatively slow on installs of solar, wind, and energy storage, 2023 ended with a new record of over 35 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity added, and the first half of 2024 saw a 91% increase over installs in the first half of 2023 at 19 GW. Not only were installations in the higher than 2023, but they were 10 GW higher than average of the previous five years. The U.S. Energy Information Agency expects a total of 59 GW of wind, solar and energy storage to come online in 2024. The growth in renewable energy installations is only expected to rise, with planned projects reported to the EIA overwhelmingly comprised of wind, solar, and batteries in coming years.

Since 2021, utility plans have also become increasingly bullish on adding new clean energy. An RMI analysis of 121 utilities representing 48% of U.S. electricity demand showed utilities are now planning to add 34% more wind and solar than they were as of August 2022. Unfortunately, plans to add gas have also increased, as utilities respond to rising electricity demand while they work to modernize their planning assumptions. Utilities don't need to rush to gas, however, as good planning and procurement practices can help utilities meet growing demand with cleaner and cheaper resources.

The IRA extended support for clean electricity across the whole sector, but publicly owned and non-profit electricity providers saw some of the most significant changes. First, tax credits that were previously inaccessible due to lack of tax liability were converted to direct pay, so non-profit entities could take direct advantage.

Rural electric cooperatives in particular are set to receive significant direct funding. Rural electric cooperatives provide electricity to 42 million people across 56% of the nation's landmass. They serve a disproportionately low-income segment of the population, but lag behind the rest of the nation in moving away from coal power, with 30% of their electricity coming from coal in 2022 compared to 19% nationwide. However, the IRA breathed new life into these non-profit utilities, setting aside $9.7 billion in funds to help cooperatives reduce emissions and install clean energy projects.

The first round of funding announcements into this program were made in September, with $7.3 billion awarded to 16 utilities across 23 states, leveraging an additional $29 billion in private investment. These funds are expected to support 10 GW of new clean energy projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from rural electric cooperatives by 43.6 million tons each year, or about 30% of cooperatives current annual emissions. Projects are also expected to reduce electricity rates substantially compared to a continued reliance on fossil energy, according to several of the awardees.

The IRA didn't stop at driving new clean energy investment - it sought to create a positive feedback loop between the clean energy transition and the health of American manufacturing via a new set of tax credits that can be earned by producing components that go into clean energy projects.

Since the bill's passage, manufacturing facility announcements rolled in, with over $112 billion in investment slated for batteries, electric vehicles, solar, and wind. Batteries are by far the largest share of investment at 68%, shared between batteries for the electric grid and for electric vehicles which utilize slightly different chemistries. However, solar manufacturing boasts no small stake with $14 billion in announcements, which will continue to abate supply chain delays that have lingered after the pandemic.

The power of the IRA does not lie in its direct investment alone. The bill's clean energy provisions also enabled state action with four states implementing 100% clean energy targets for the first time in 2023. Minnesota and Michigan passed legislation requiring 100% of electricity sales to come from clean sources by 2040, while the New Jersey governor signed an executive order requiring 100% clean electricity by 2035. Delaware, too, passed clean energy legislation, requiring a 100% clean economy by 2050.

While interest in clean energy from states, utilities, and investors has increased, many bottlenecks remain, namely in interconnection queues, or the projects waiting to connect to the grid. Research by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that at the end of 2022, over 2,000 GW clean projects were waiting to connect, and at the end of 2023, that number had skyrocketed to over 2500 GW. Overall U.S. energy capacity is about 1,400 GW, meaning significantly more projects are waiting to connect to the grid than are currently connected.

Reforms by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aim to shorten these wait times and reduce costs, but regional approaches have shown that much more can be done in the effort to connect clean energy projects as quickly as possible. For example, Texas uses an approach to interconnection that avoids lengthy studies and costly upgrades across the transmission grid any time a project wants to connect.

This has reduced Texas' timeline to connect projects compared to other regions by 2.5 or more years, and shows why the state is predicted to add 35% of all solar projects and 44% of all battery projects this year, despite only producing 13% of the nation's electricity.

Further improvements to transmission planning, bolstered by recent FERC action, are also expected to prepare the grid to handle more clean energy, faster, but short-term actions like upgrading existing infrastructure to carry more electricity on the transmission pathways we already have can help meet our current needs.

The investment approach of the IRA is not enough to bring electricity sector emissions down to zero - it was never expected to do so. However, it has created tailwinds, bringing industry forward and creating momentum far into the future. Now, it's time to focus on the next piece of the puzzle and make sure the momentum translates into clean power."
China Bets On Massive Blockchain Infrastructure,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/08/china-bets-on-massive-blockchain-infrastructure/,2024-10-08T14:16:02Z,"In October 2019 Chinese President Xi Jinping noted: ""We must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies, clarify the main direction, increase investment, and accelerate the development of blockchain technology."" according to the study in the Journal of Physics: Conference Series.

The speech resolved the uncertainty of blockchain technology development in China and delivered a strong signal that the central government will support and devote more resources to this area according to a study published in Research in International Business and Finance journal. Following this, the Communist Party of China made a decision, recognizing data as an equal factor of production alongside traditional inputs like labor and capital.

A key component of China's blockchain strategy is the Blockchain-Based Service Network launched in 2020. According to a CoinDesk report from March 2021, BSN offers a government-controlled framework for blockchain developers, supporting applications built on multiple blockchain networks. The system provides two versions: one for users inside China and another for international developers.

Notably, the domestic version allows authorities to censor or delete entire blockchains if deemed necessary, with CEO Yifan He of Red Date, the company behind BSN, stating, ""If they do something wrong we can delete the whole chain,"" as reported by Coindesk.

In March 2021, the Chinese government formally incorporated blockchain development into its national strategy with the approval of the ""14th Five-Year Plan"" (2021-2025). This plan includes blockchain industry development initiatives for 29 provinces and cities across the country. This push aims to enhance China's global competitiveness in critical economic sectors through what officials term ""Chinese-style blockchain"" - blockchain without cryptocurrencies, according to a research article published in the Big Data & Society journal.

The Chinese city of Shanghai issued an implementation plan on July 31, 2023 to promote the development of its urban blockchain digital infrastructure system for the period of 2023-2025. The plan aims to strengthen blockchain applications in Shanghai's economy and governance, supporting municipal affairs and coordinating resources in the Yangtze River Delta to create an international blockchain hub according to an article on Cointelegraph.

The government views blockchain through the lens of 'state techno-solutionism,' a technological tool to boost national competitiveness and modernize agriculture. This approach aligns with broader national goals, including what Chinese officials refer to as the 'rejuvenation' of the nation. Such a perspective stands in contrast to the Western cypherpunk blockchain movement's vision of decentralization and freedom from governmental and corporate control according to the article in Big Data & Society journal.

According to various news on the Chinese government website, the country is integrating blockchain technology into various sectors. Among these, in 2024 China uses blockchain to propel its foreign trade, in social and economic development, the digital trade sector, and the creation of new information infrastructure. Additionally, courts at all levels are exploring the use of blockchain to improve judicial processes. This integration is happening alongside other advanced technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and big data analytics.

In May 2023, China established a national blockchain research center with the goal of training at least 500,000 blockchain professionals for the country. For comparison, there are currently only about 26,000 active blockchain developers worldwide, according to data from the Developer Report website.

In August 2023, at the Hangzhou Summit, officials unveiled a blockchain-powered data exchange platform. The Hangzhou Data Exchange uses distributed ledger technology to enable enterprise IT data trading, providing a system for immutable and traceable transactions, according to a report by China News Network. Over 300 enterprises, including Alibaba Cloud and Huawei, participated in its debut.

In December 2023, China's Ministry of Public Security launched RealDID, a blockchain-based platform to verify the real-name identities of China's 1.4 billion citizens. This system aims to provide a form of ""pseudonymity"" where users can register and log in to websites using DID addresses and private keys, keeping their real identities hidden from other users and businesses. However, the government retains the ability to link these digital identities to real individuals when necessary, according to a report by CoinDesk.

On March 30, 2024, China launched its national key R&D program for an ultra-large-scale blockchain infrastructure platform for the Belt and Road Initiative - China's global strategy to expand its economic and political influence through improved trade routes and infrastructure across Asia, Europe, and Africa.

The Belt and Road Initiative, estimated to cost between $1-8 trillion, is one of the largest economic development projects in history. It includes the ""Information Silk Road,"" a digital dimension comprising deep-sea internet cables and satellites. This digital infrastructure overlays the physical BRI corridors, creating a foundation for advanced software-based services, including blockchain applications. The integration of physical and digital elements positions the BRI as a comprehensive system of land, sea, and space connectivity, potentially revolutionizing global trade and economic cooperation, according to Wolfgang Lehmacher's study published in the Port Technology International journal.

""The time is now to view geopolitics through the lens of blockchain technology,"" writes anti-financial crime expert Douglas McCalmont in his LinkedIn post. He notes that ""China will soon maintain a powerful and insular global (parallel) economy to challenge all things US.""

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has issued guidelines encouraging social capital investment in innovative agricultural technology enterprises, with a specific focus on key agricultural technology research and blockchain application promotion.

The agricultural sector implements social credit systems in rural areas using blockchain technology. For instance, in 2020, Qingyuan, Guangdong province, introduced a blockchain-based system called ""Persimmon Points"", according to a study published in the Big Data & Society journal. This system allows participants to earn points for ""positive actions"" and lose points for perceived negative behaviors, with the data transparently recorded on a public blockchain.

Another example is the GoGoChicken project, a collaboration between local governments and a blockchain technology company, uses blockchain and IoT devices to record and monitor the entire chicken production process, from breeding to sales. Positioned as a poverty alleviation tool, the project caters to safety-conscious urban consumers willing to pay premium prices for traceable food products. However, the article in Big Data & Society journal raises questions about the project's potential impact on farmers' data control and empowerment. The study argues that ""Blockchain fortifies the extraction and exploitation of data, granting businesses greater access and control over information belonging to vulnerable groups.""

China's rapid advancement in blockchain technology has raised concerns in the United States, leading to legislative action. According to a report by CoinDesk, in November 2023, U.S. lawmakers introduced the CLARITY Act, proposing to bar federal government officials from doing business with China-based blockchain firms and using China-based blockchains. The bill prohibits transactions with iFinex (Tether's parent company), The Spartan Network, and The Conflux Network. It aims to prevent foreign access to national security intelligence and private information. The Act also directs U.S. agencies to develop a plan addressing risks from China's blockchain technologies.

China's approach to blockchain technology demonstrates a strategic duality. On the mainland, Beijing has banned global crypto networks while developing and promoting versions of next-generation monetary technology that provide greater control to the Chinese Communist Party's government. Meanwhile, through Hong Kong, China maintains a presence in global crypto markets, leveraging the city's special administrative status as a financial gateway. This two-pronged approach allows China to take advantage of blockchain's potential while maintaining tight control over its financial systems on the mainland.

As noted in the article by Ben Schreckinger in POLITICO, this strategy enables China to ""exert internal financial controls on the mainland while impeding capital flight to bet on the potential of global crypto networks to disrupt money and finance."" Schreckinger further observes: ""Inside China, Beijing will be able to keep the world's biggest population and second-largest economy running on financial networks it designs and controls (and push trading partners to join them) -- without giving up its ambitions to make China a player in the more unruly crypto networks used elsewhere."""
14 Attorneys General Sue TikTok As Its Future In The U.S. Is On The Line,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandralevine/2024/10/08/attorneys-general-sue-tiktok-ban/,2024-10-08T14:07:59Z,"ipartisan attorneys general from more than a dozen states and Washington are suing TikTok in separate but coordinated complaints alleging TikTok is a deliberately addictive platform that is psychologically harming and financially exploiting kids.

The suits were filed by attorneys general in New York, California, New Jersey, Oregon, Mississippi, Kentucky, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Vermont, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Washington state and Washington D.C.

At least one of those lawsuits, from D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, takes aim at problematic ways that money changes hands on TikTok, alleging the app is running an ""unlicensed virtual currency system"" that has made its popular livestream feature the equivalent of ""a virtual strip club"" for teens. The complaint, filed in D.C. Superior Court, cites and quotes the Forbes investigation ""How TikTok Live Became 'A Strip Club Filled With 15-Year-Olds,'"" along with internal TikTok materials that support it. The district accuses the company of violating consumer protection and money transmission laws by making false or misleading statements about how safe the platform is for young users, and it's demanding a jury trial.

""TikTok's platform, designed to be dangerously addictive, inflicts immense damage on an entire generation of young people,"" Schwalb said in a statement. ""In addition to prioritizing its profits over the health of children, TikTok's unregulated and illegal virtual economy allows the darkest, most depraved corners of society to prey upon vulnerable victims.""

After the state of Utah sued TikTok on similar grounds in June, company spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement: ""TikTok has industry-leading policies and measures to help protect the safety and well-being of teens. Creators must be at least 18 years old before they can go live, and their account must meet a follower requirement. We immediately revoke access to features if we find accounts that do not meet our age requirements."" (The follower requirement means that only users with an audience of more than 1,000 can go live.)

TikTok's future in the United States remains in limbo after President Joe Biden signed a law earlier this year that will ban the app nationwide come January over national security concerns -- unless its China-based parent, ByteDance, sells TikTok to an American owner. TikTok and ByteDance subsequently filed a lawsuit challenging that law, as did a cohort of TikTok creators, calling it unconstitutional and a move to simply shutter a platform used by 170 million Americans. Just last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington heard their arguments against a looming shutdown (both sides asked the court to issue a ruling by December 6, so the losing party can appeal). But against the backdrop of this high stakes legal fight in the Capitol, which could see a foreign-owned social media app barred from this country for the first time ever, states have steadily been building their own arsenal against TikTok. A bipartisan group of attorneys general launched an investigation into TikTok's alleged harms to underage users back in 2022. And after many months of individual states jockeying for internal TikTok documents in their respective probes, the new lawsuits filed today reveal some of the early results of that work.

Child safety and mental health concerns related to social media are now well-known and well-documented, so much so that schools across the country have started banning smartphones from their classrooms and campuses. More overlooked are the ways that minors are earning and spending money on these platforms, and the potential dangers that can create.

TikTokers regularly earn and spend money through TikTok Live: Those watching the broadcasts can use real money to purchase TikTok coins, which can then be used to buy and send digital TikTok gifts directly to those hosting livestreams, who can redeem them for actual cash.

TikTok policies state that users must be 18 or older to go live, and that those under 16 are blocked from hosting livestreams altogether. But like every major social media platform, TikTok has struggled to verify the ages of its users, making it easy for them to gain access and freely use Live and its monetization features. Forbes reporting has brought to light the ways they have been misused to lure young girls into performing suggestive, and potentially illegal, acts for adult men on TikTok Live -- one of the key issues highlighted in the D.C. attorney general's complaint.

""The company knows that Live is unsafe, exploiting children financially and sexually,"" the filing says. ""Operating in part like a virtual strip club, Live provides young streamers with a performance stage, and allows other users to entice streamers into sexual acts in exchange for virtual money.""

In one TikTok Live detailed in the Forbes investigation, a 14-year-old in a bralette fielded requests from strangers on a 2,000-person broadcast, some offering ""$35 for a flash,"" asking to see her feet and telling her they'd send money to her Cash App. ""You're paying my bills,"" the young girl told viewers.

In another, a teen slowly cut off her shirt with a pair of scissors as an audience of 3,000 egged her on. ""IF U DO THE BLACK PART IM GONNA SEND TIKTOK LIVE 35.000 TIKTOK COINS (400$),"" one commenter wrote, urging her to snip her bra. On other TikTok streams, often filmed from girls' bedrooms and bathrooms, they were offered financial rewards if they'd kiss each other or spread their legs for the camera.

The D.C. filing describes TikTok's ""virtual economy"" as ""similar to a casino that facilitates the exchange of money for poker chips."" It says that the fact that TikTok gifts -- which include hearts, ice cream cones and lollipops -- look like ""plush toys"" and ""cute, colorful animated emojis reminiscent of cartoons and Disney characters,"" they distract children and parents from how much money is being exchanged and the reality of what may be going on (a tactic it calls ""currency confusion"").

""Despite TikTok's representations, it has knowingly created a system on Live that allows youth who view live streams to be taken advantage of financially and youth who live stream themselves to be sexually exploited by adults on the platform,"" the complaint says.

It also alleges that despite TikTok offering a mechanism for people to send money to each other and facilitating ""billions of dollars in transactions,"" it is not licensed to do so, as is required by district and federal laws. It argues TikTok should be registered with the district's Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking, and the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which work to ensure that payment platforms are adequately protecting users from illegal activity like sexual exploitation, drug trafficking and money laundering.

""By not registering as a money transmitter, TikTok not only masks criminal activity on the app from regulators, but also tricks its most vulnerable and unsuspecting users into using its platform for monetary transactions without sufficient safeguards,"" the complaint says. ""At no time has TikTok clearly told users -- many of whom TikTok knows are children -- that TikTok Live is littered with known criminals and that TikTok knows users are at heightened risk of fraud and other financial crimes.""

TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
This $1 Billion Michigan RIA Shuns Alternatives In Favor Of Dividend Stocks,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2024/10/08/this-1-billion-michigan-ria-shuns-alternatives-in-favor-of-dividend-stocks/,2024-10-08T13:51:33Z,"Background: Steinberg graduated from Michigan State University in 1984 with a degree in accounting and began his career specializing in tax preparation and planning at Deloitte. He went back to law school at the University of Michigan and then worked for a couple years as an estate-planning attorney for Honigman, Detroit's largest law firm. In 1993, he started as an advisor with many of his early clients being former colleagues from the law firm. Steinberg eventually started Blue Chip Partners in 2004 and brought on his longtime partner, Daniel Seder, a year later. Today the firm has 33 employees servicing roughly 800 clients.

Building Relationships: Blue Chip Partners has positioned itself to do the whole range of planning for clients -- from investments to taxes to estate planning -- all under one roof, with different subsidiaries of the business to help specialize in each segment. The firm also focuses on educating clients through a very active social media presence and even has its own podcast.

Competitive Edge: Steinberg says excellent employee hiring and retention as a pillar of the firm's success. Prospective hires all take the Caliper Profile assessment, a rigorous personality test designed to predict future job performance. This not only allows the team to hire from outside the business, but also to find 'team players' such as former college athletes, for instance, who understand the importance of working together or not winning every game of a match, says Steinberg.

Investment Philosophy/Strategy: Blue Chip uses an independent investment department of which the primary equity portfolio strategy is dividend growth. Instead of an ETF- or mutual fund-heavy model, the team's core approach to equities is investing in companies that have a track record of paying and growing dividends. ""Every time a company raises their dividend we will send clients an email... because clients own individual stocks in their portfolio they have higher risk tolerance,"" says Steinberg. ""These companies have a track record, so in down markets clients are still getting positive emails that they raised their dividend and that helps their confidence."" In terms of asset allocation, Blue Chip generally favors a 70/30 allocation of equities with the rest a mix cash and fixed income. ""We tend to be more plain vanilla on fixed income, with some ETFs and lower cost mutual funds,"" says Steinberg. ""Trying to get too smart with bonds just doesn't work -- that portion of a client's portfolio should be defensive."" When it comes to alternatives, the firm has very limited exposure: ""We have chosen to keep things simple from a client standpoint.""

Investment Outlook: ""Unless one party sweeps the election and gets rid of the filibuster, we're unlikely to see dramatic changes that will have an effect on the market,"" says Steinberg. He and his team remain optimistic about the direction of the economy as inflation is likely to continue to moderate, though they don't anticipate interest rates to come down too quickly. ""Personally, I was surprised they did 50 basis points,"" says Steinberg. ""I thought with the presidential election they would maybe be a bit more conservative.""

Best Advice: ""You're going to have snow storms, but snow melts and things will continue to do well,"" Steinberg often tells clients. He recalls early in his career, he once called up a client to congratulate him for his portfolio losing less than the market during a downturn: ""He told me, 'Never tell a client they're doing well when they are losing money.'"""
From Small Town Kansas Advisor To Managing $86 Billion For Clients In Over 30 States,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2024/10/08/from-small-town-kansas-advisor-to-managing-86-billion-for-clients-in-over-30-states/,2024-10-08T13:51:08Z,"Background: Marty Bicknell grew up in a small town in southeastern Kansas called Pittsburg. Though he was at first studying pre-law while attending nearby Pittsburg State University, Bicknell landed an internship at a small, single practitioner Edward Jones location, where he fell in love with the business. After graduating in 1991, he moved to Kansas City and got a job with wirehouse A.G. Edwards, where he worked for more than 15 years. He founded Mariner in 2006 with seven other partners on the idea that operate according to the fiduciary standard, which stipulates that advisors must work in a clients best interest, rather than the ""suitability"" standard used by many wirehouse brokers, which requires products must be suitable even if they are high cost. Bicknell says that during the financial crisis his team was able to triple in size by recruiting high-quality people who were leaving bigger firms. Mariner has also been active with M&A deals, buying about 50 small RIA practices since 2012 alone. Today, the firm has grown to 1,800 advisors and 120 locations across more than 30 states, serving roughly 45,000 clients from all over the country.

Building Relationships: ""One of the most overused words in our industry is holistic planning,"" says Bicknell. ""In order for us to truly be holistic the service and talent has to be in-house, so culture, client experience and deliverables are cohesive and not spliced together."" He points to Mariner's long list of in-house offerings including such things as owning their own trust and insurance companies, a boutique investment bank for closely held business owners and dedicated institutional offerings for retirement plans. ""At this size, we have the ability to serve all client segments,"" he adds.

Investment Philosophy/Strategy: ""Our philosophy is to create access -- so if there's a unique or exclusive strategy we want to utilize our size and skill to get access to those for clients,"" says Bicknell. From an equity and fixed income standpoint, his firm likes to allocate mass affluent client portfolios into ETFs in order to bring down expenses and allow for easy access. Once a client portfolio has more than a couple million dollars, however, Mariner likes to use in-house equity and fixed income strategies primarily geared towards limiting client expenses. A majority of the firm's client base are also invested in alternatives such as private equity or real estate, making up anywhere between 10% and 30% of portfolios.

Investment Outlook: ""In general, even with the market near all-time highs, we're still very constructive with our investments,"" says Bicknell. He remains optimistic going into 2025, adding that the market and the economy are in a good place. ""We always think there could be some short term volatility, which may present short-lived buying opportunities,"" he adds. ""With a Federal Reserve that is reducing rates, the over-talked about recession has never come: All of those things bode well for companies in general and therefore the economy.""

Best Advice: The key to success is bringing in and training young talent, says Bicknell. He points out that for every acquisition Mariner makes, he and his partners may talk to a dozen or more firms in the process.

FamilyOfficeHK BrandVoice: Hong Kong: Key Link Between Mainland China And The Middle East,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/familyofficehk/2024/10/08/hong-kong-key-link-between-mainland-china-and-the-middle-east/,2024-10-08T12:46:03Z,"Hong Kong stands to benefit from strengthening Sino-Arab ties, drawing family offices and investors from the Middle East.

The global balance of economic power is undeniably tilting eastward as the strengthening ties between China and the Arab states are a testament to this seismic shift. This deepening cooperation extends beyond two-way trade to encompass a multifaceted partnership reaching political, cultural and technological dimensions.

During the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in May 2024, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to step up the building of a China-Arab community with a shared future. The effort was fortified when Premier Li Qiang visited the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) and Saudi Arabia in September 2024 when Li urged enterprises to seize new investment opportunities as partnership with China entered a crucial historical juncture.

In the past two decades, the trade volume between China and Arab states surged from US$36.7 billion in 2004 to US$398 billion in 2023. This exponential growth reflects the deepening economic integration between the two regions, underpinned by shared interests, complementary strengths and a collective vision for a prosperous future.

At the forefront of this transformation stands Hong Kong, a unique and strategic jurisdiction that bridges the East and West, empowering Middle Eastern investors to capitalize on China's rise.

""China is Saudi Arabia's first economic partner. Trade between the Kingdom and China is equivalent to 90% of the total trade of the G7 countries,"" Saudi Minister of Investment Khalid Al-Falih says. The ties between the two countries have gradually grown beyond trade.

China built the Haramain High-Speed Railway that links Makkah and Madinah in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the Arab states are important partners to China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative, and this solidifying partnership aligns with other significant national rejuvenation policies in the Middle East, such as Saudi Vision 2030. Under which, energy-transition investment into Chinese companies in areas including electric vehicles, batteries, energy storage, renewables and industrial technology has been focused on by Saudi investors.

The latest China-Arab States Cooperation Forum also agreed to set up 10 joint laboratories covering fields such as life and health, artificial intelligence, green tech and agriculture. China is leveraging its existing institutions for training satellite management and other aerospace projects. For example, China is set to help Oman build its first satellite.

These are but a fraction of the breadth and depth of the evolving partnership between China and the Arab world, covering key high-tech and strategic sectors that present significant investment opportunities for Middle Eastern investors looking to access China's growth potential through Hong Kong.

At the heart of this dynamic landscape stands Hong Kong, a city with a GDP surpassing US$380 billion in 2023 and the world's 10th largest trading economy. It is China's largest source of overseas direct investment, as well as the leading international asset management hub, and the largest cross-border private wealth management and hedge fund center in Asia.

The city is uniquely positioned to serve as a conduit between the Middle East and mainland China's vast opportunities. Strategically located at the mainland's southern doorstep, Hong Kong's status as the gateway to China and the Greater Bay Area is reinforced by its world-class infrastructure, including the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and the high-speed rail link to Guangzhou.

Beyond its geographic advantages, Hong Kong's distinct governance framework under the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle, coupled with its robust legal and financial institutions, endows the city with a unique competitive edge.

It is home to the world's largest offshore hub in renminbi (RMB) settlement, allowing businesses convenient access to a wide variety of RMB services from banks and financial institutions. The city's free market economy, low taxation and international orientation make it an attractive destination for Middle Eastern businesses and family offices seeking to establish a foothold in China and the broader Asia-Pacific region.

The bilingual international city has also emerged as a crucial Middle East connector, serving as a vital link between the two regions in areas such as trade, investment and cultural exchange.

Between 2017 and 2021, Hong Kong and the U.A.E. enjoyed an annual average growth of 4.1%, and about 9.5% of the buoyant and growing trade between the U.A.E. and mainland China was routed through Hong Kong in 2021.

Hong Kong also boasts the highest number of ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) in Asia and a long-standing tradition of family wealth management, providing a compelling ecosystem for Middle Eastern family offices to thrive.

As of 2023, there were around 2,700 single-family offices in Hong Kong, with over half of them set up by UHNWIs with wealth of US$50 million or above. The city is actively working to attract at least 200 more single-family offices by 2025, with the Middle East region remaining a key target market in its strategic vision to cement its status as Asia's single-family office hub.

Moreover, Hong Kong's development advantages as a crucial node in China's Belt and Road Initiative have further solidified its position as an indispensable conduit between the Middle East and the world's second-largest economy.

By leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages, Middle Eastern businesses and family offices can position themselves at the forefront of this dynamic regional transformation."
Markets In The Balance: Election Impact Hinges On Sweep Or Gridlock,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreyschulze/2024/10/08/markets-in-the-balance-election-impact-hinges-on-sweep-or-gridlock/,2024-10-08T12:40:55Z,"I write about financial market trends and recession risk indicators.

With a month to go before election day, the presidential race remains tight with Kamala Harris maintaining a slight lead over Donald Trump. Based on the prediction markets, the two most likely outcomes are either a Republican sweep or a Harris presidency with a divided government. This is due to races for the Senate favoring the Republicans.

Different presidential and congressional configurations will dictate how much legislation can be passed and ultimately how much an effect politics will have on stocks and the economy. A sweep scenario can lead to drastic changes in tax and spending policies. With a divided government, regulation and trade policy will come into play, because those are the areas where the president can act unilaterally.

Taxes

The new president will face a unique tax situation because major elements of the TCJA, the Trump tax cuts, are sunsetting in 2025. If nothing is done, almost every taxpayer will see a higher average tax rate. This should act as an incentive from both sides of the aisle to negotiate and extend some of these expiring provisions.

Kamala Harris recently released tax proposals to dramatically increase the tax rates on corporations and high-income households while leaving most Americans taxes unchanged, promising to protect households making under $400,000 from higher taxes. Her tax goals are unlikely to become reality, however, unless the Democrats retain control of the Senate and flip the House of Representatives.

Meanwhile Donald Trump would likely prioritize extension of the TCJA, including reinstating individual provisions that expired, including business depreciation allowances such as immediate expensing for equipment, property and research and development.

Regulation

From a regulatory standpoint, Harris is focused on prescription drugs, more affordable housing, a higher minimum wage, lower grocery costs and a supportive stance toward clean energy. She has also talked about accelerating Medicare negotiations on more drugs and cracking down on pharmacy benefit managers, creating more risk in health care.

Trump significantly dialed back regulation in his first term. Most of the former president's efforts on the deregulation front will likely be focused on labor, education, the environment and health care, with a slowdown in the transition to EVs. Energy production and fracking in particular should increase. A potential negative, at least from a labor market perspective, is more stringent immigration policies, which could hurt labor-intensive companies.

It's worth noting, however, that the expected election outcomes due to regulation are usually very different from what ends up occurring. The consensus thought energy would thrive under the Trump administration, yet it was one of the worst-performing sectors in his four years. Under Obama, health care was expected to be a tough sector, but it performed well on a relative basis. So, it's important not to read too much into higher regulation and what the impacts will be for these sectors.

Trade

Harris is expected to mostly maintain the status quo on trade policy from the Biden administration. Changes are expected to be more surgical compared to the broad brush approach Trump has discussed. Harris would likely remain firm on China to protect industries like solar and semiconductors.

From a Trump perspective, we expect a repeat of what we saw under his first term. He is proposing two types of tariffs: a 10% across the board tariff on all imported goods and increases on Chinese tariffs to 60%. According to a Tax Foundation analysis, a 10% tariff and retaliation from U.S. trading partners would be expected to contract the economy by 1%. From a trade perspective, equities would face more headwinds under Trump while a Harris win would continue the status quo.

Fiscal Spending

The most bipartisan view right now is that government spending will keep growing. Neither candidate wants to rein in spending. Deficits are forecast to be in the 6%-7% of GDP range for the foreseeable future and potentially even higher in a sweep scenario where more legislation gets passed. Harris would prioritize spending on health care, housing, childcare, clean energy and infrastructure.

Trump is expected to keep spending focused on defense and infrastructure. The fiscal thrust from a Republican administration will come in the form of tax cuts, while the Democrats will likely lead with more spending. We expect such policies to boost the economy in either scenario.

Impacts of a Trump Victory

In aggregate, we view a second Trump presidency under a sweep scenario as net positive for equities. The expectation is for a more favorable corporate tax regime and less of a regulatory burden, both of which should boost corporate profits. Conversely, there is the potential for increased tariffs and retaliation from U.S. trade partners. A gridlock scenario where the House is under Democratic control would be mildly negative as fewer provisions of expiring tax legislation would get extended.

We view U.S. stocks as best placed under Trump, with banks and capital markets, as well as the oil and gas complex, well positioned due to lighter regulation. Aerospace and defense is also likely going to benefit as well as biopharmaceuticals.

Impacts of a Harris Victory

We see a Harris win as mildly negative to equities should she preside over a divided Congress. It will be more of a headwind to the markets should we see a Democratic sweep as she will then be able to implement higher taxes on corporations and high-income individuals, as well as push a more ambitious regulatory agenda. However, tax credits for low-income individuals would provide an offset, creating an economic boost to this segment of the economy.

Tighter regulation could weigh on biopharmaceuticals, banks, capital markets, energy as well as mega cap technology. Areas to be bullish about under Harris would be consumer discretionary, specifically restaurants & leisure, home building and building products.

It's easy to categorize each candidate as bullish or bearish, but markets have gone up regardless of the party in control. In our view, economic momentum will be a bigger driver of equities over the medium to long term."
Harris takes slim lead over Trump in new poll as voters view her as candidate of change,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-takes-slim-lead-over-trump-new-poll-voters-view-her-candidate-change,2024-10-08T12:30:58Z,"Reason senior editor Robby Soave and syndicated columnist Josh Hammer on the media interviews agreed to by Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton suggesting social media censorship.

Vice President Kamala Harris has taken a slight edge over former President Donald Trump in a new poll released Tuesday that looked into which candidate voters view as the candidate representing change. Trump, however, maintained his lead among male voters and has kept the trust of most voters on economic issues.

The latest New York Times/Sienna College national poll found that if the election were held today, 49% of respondents would vote for Harris while 46% would vote for Trump. It marks the first time Harris has led Trump in the Times/Sienna poll since President Biden dropped out in July.

Harris took a slim lead among respondents who saw the vice president, not Trump, as a break from the status quo, garnering 46% compared with 44% for the former president.

Harris' lead in this category was greater when broken down into non-White and younger voters, garnering 61% and 58%, respectively, compared to 29% of non-White and 34% of younger voters favoring Trump, according to the poll.

Despite the slight change for Harris, the poll found Trump still maintained the majority of voter trust on what they consider their most important issues, such as the economy, with 48% compared to 46% for Harris.

Trump is also leading Harris with male voters by 11 points, a group which also favored Trump over Biden in the 2020 election, according to the poll.

While national polls are often a good indicator of the general mood among Americans, they don't always predict who will win elections, which often come down to important battleground states.

In the latest Fox News survey of registered voters in North Carolina, viewed as one such battleground state, Harris has a 2 percentage-point edge over Trump, 50% to 48%. A month earlier, Trump was ahead by 1 point (50% to 49%), for a 3-point shift in the presidential race.

"Author Post: Live, Work, and Play at Sea: Fast Internet Revolutionizes Cruise Life",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbooksauthors/2024/10/08/live-work-and-play-at-sea-fast-internet-revolutionizes-cruise-life/,2024-10-08T12:09:08Z,"The world changed in 2020 with the pandemic. We all had to find a way to change the way we worked. ""Zoom meetings"" became the standard, our wardrobes evolved to focus on comfort, and our time with family became important again.

Fast-forward a few years, and we are beginning to see how we might have appreciated the pandemic work environment: working wherever and whenever we wanted to.

Since then, our lives have become our top priority, and smart companies have learned to wrap their companies around their employees' lives, as opposed to the traditional work environment where employees suit up and cube up in a vast office universe.

When traveling on Royal Caribbean's Jewel of the Seas last year in the North Atlantic, probably one of the most remote places on the planet, I was surprised to discover that they had high-speed internet.

I could do Zoom calls, podcasts, and interviews. They installed the new ""Starlink,"" developed by Elon Musk's firm Space X. It is a low-orbit, freakishly fast satellite. Typically, satellite internet is not very responsive, slow, and frustrating. Anyone who has tried to use the internet in the past knows exactly what I am referring to. It's expensive, and you can't get it to work properly, so you just give up after a few too many coffees and swear words.

The cruise lines seem to be doubling down.

I reached out to Royal Caribbean for their thoughts on the matter, and it seems they are going 'all in' to a universe of high-speed internet. ""Seamless connectivity has been a game changer in the onboard guest experience,"" said Martha Poulter, SVP and Chief Information Officer of Royal Caribbean Group. ""Starlink enables us to provide high-speed internet across our fleet so that our guests can be connected, no matter where they sail with us.""

This innovation begs the question- is Starlink a tech shift that could transform the way we work to a whole new level? With Starlink, anyone can use the internet for business or pleasurethe world. Are we on the verge of being able to work ""whenever"" and ""wherever"" we want, including the North Atlantic Sea?

The book Start. Scale. Exit. Repeat. discusses how tech shifts can transform the world and how that shift can impact humanity. Tech shifts happen all the time. We saw how internet access in the 90s connected the world, how broadband created online cloud computing, and how the internet enabled a sharing economy with companies like Airbnb connecting renters with homeowners.

Today, we are seeing AI transform industries. The advent of high-speed internet anywhere by SpaceX and similar startups will unleash another paradigm shift: Live, Work, and Play anywhere in the world.

Today, you can book a cruise and continue to work at your company. Hammer out a few deals and hit the afternoon cocktail hour overlooking the icebergs in Alaska.

I was impressed with the speed of the internet, but I have to admit I was also frustrated with the lack of privacy needed to conduct my meetings. I would usually be found in the suite lounge doing meetings and podcasts, only to find other like-minded workaholics punching keys on their laptops and doing video meetings. At one point, I even tried to find space in the closed casino, but too many people were walking by and giving me strange faces.

My room wasn't that much better, as my wife and kids really didn't want me working there. In the near future, I predict cruise companies will begin to build some office infrastructure to allow people to work at sea, extending the time people can spend on a cruise ship.

The idea that youally work at sea prompted my wife and decideision to purchase a condo on a ship called Storylines MV Narrative, due to launch in 2027.

The ship comes fully equipped with all the amenities you would expect with a cruise ship: restaurants, a gym, and a theater, but it also includes private and shared offices in a facility dedicated to remote workers. Think of it like a ""We Work"" at sea. The ship is not a typical cruise ship but a residential ship -- a mobile lifestyle where your home travels with you all over the globe.

The notion that we need to work in an office from 9 to 5 has gone out the window with the pandemic. Now, the notion that we need to live in one location has changed with the advent of the internet everywhere on the planet.

At Storylines, they think about the importance of living and working at sea. ""There are many workspaces onboard, including meeting rooms, office spaces, the recording studio, hobby and makers center, artist studio, the medical lab, and more,"" says Alister Punton, the CEO of Storylines.

Storylines is committed to installing the most advanced internet available, making it possible to work at any location on the globe. ""Starlink is high on our list of suppliers. We are working towards providing at-home, at-work levels of connection for all the ship's residents, which will be provided utilizing a combination of methods, including LEO, VSAT & MBB.""

The ship, which tends to attract retirees, also appeals to families and entrepreneurs who want to live a traveling lifestyle while still building wealth.

My wife and I plan to travel three to six months yearly. Along with connecting with a community of fellow travelers and exploring the world, I see it as a unique opportunity to advance my mission of speaking globally about helping entrepreneurs start, scale, and exit their companies."

Forbes Daily: Nvidia Overtakes Microsoft As Market Cap Hits $3.19 Trillion,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/10/08/forbes-daily-nvidia-overtakes-microsoft-as-market-cap-hits-319-trillion/,2024-10-08T11:57:16Z,"When inflation spiked in the wake of the pandemic in 2021 and 2022, the Federal Reserve was ""behind the curve"" in its response, one official from the central bank told Forbes.

Forbes recently spoke with Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and an alternate member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which votes on the target federal funds rate. The Fed began hiking rates in March 2022, and then raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to over 5% -- the fastest interest rate increase in four decades.

Looking ahead to the second half of the decade, Goolsbee is keeping a close eye on growth in productivity, which he said would support an expanding economy without inflation.

Despite losses for its big tech peers, Nvidia's stock rallied Monday, leading it to eclipse Microsoft as the second-largest company in the world amid the AI boom. Nvidia registered its highest market cap since August at $3.19 trillion, trailing only Apple, valued at $3.4 trillion.

Influencers are touting egg donation as a cash cow to millions of followers on the internet. But while social media is helping to destigmatize fertility problems and procedures, some donor-conceived people and experts say the vast majority of content that lures donors with big payouts is doing more harm than good.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 suffered their worst days since early September following two new hurdles for investors that threaten to increase the cost of doing business and cut into profit margins. Crude oil prices and government bond yields, which influence borrowing costs as many loans are benchmarked against Treasury notes, both moved to multiweek highs Monday.

Andreessen Horowitz cofounder Ben Horowitz tweeted that he and his wife will make a ""significant"" donation to Vice President Kamala Harris, a notable reversal of his previous support for former President Donald Trump. Still, Horowitz said Harris' campaign has yet to formally state its intentions with their tech policies and that the ""Biden Administration has been exceptionally destructive on tech policy across the industry.""

Vice President Kamala Harris defended her economic plan in an interview with 60 Minutes on Monday, predicting Congress will go along with paying for her agenda, as the nominee has already called for an ""opportunity economy"" focused on the middle class and released plans that include lowering grocery and prescription drug prices and addressing the housing crisis. Harris' economic plan would increase the federal deficit by $3.5 trillion through 2035, according to an estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

One of Donald Trump's prized properties, the landmark building 40 Wall Street, now appears underwater. The remaining 35 years on Trump's leasehold in the Financial District tower is worth about $116 million, which is $2 million less than the estimated $118 million Trump owes on his mortgage, according to a Forbes analysis.

The Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge brought by social network X on Monday, after the Elon Musk-owned company sued the federal government for forcing it to turn over information about former President Donald Trump to Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team. Prosecutors asked the company, formerly known as Twitter, to sign a non-disclosure agreement barring them from informing Trump or his associates about the warrant.

As Hurricane Milton, now a Category 4 storm, is slated to make landfall in Florida this week, major U.S. airlines are issuing travel waivers allowing passengers flying in or out of impacted airports to rebook without paying the fare difference.

The Supreme Court's new term kicked off Monday, and the justices are slated to hear cases on major issues like guns, transgender rights, vaping and environmental impact studies. The nation's highest court is likely to add a number of other key cases to its docket, including former President Donald Trump's criminal cases and challenges to the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness relief efforts.

TOPLINE Phoenix Capital Group, founded in 2019, says it's an oil and gas company, specializing in acquiring mineral rights and drilling independently. But its core competency seems to be raising funds from yield-hungry investors.

Mostly through advertising run on conservative radio shows like The Sean Hannity Show and webinars which it holds daily, founder Adam Ferrari reports that Phoenix has so far raised $700 million of a planned $750 million private high yield bond offering. Some 95% of its sales, says Matt Willer, head of Capital Markets, are to people above the age of 55, with half of the funds coming from 401(k)s and IRAs.

Phoenix is one of a growing number of little-known financial firms taking advantage of Congress's Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2012, which enabled companies to more easily sell unregistered securities, otherwise known as private placements, directly to individual investors.

From 2009 through 2020, $15 trillion of so-called Reg D offerings were sold, according to a 2023 study by SLCG Economic Consulting. During the same time period, fully SEC registered offerings, of stocks, bonds and ETFs trading on exchanges, tallied $16.4 trillion in sales.

As the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) movement gained traction, many banks and large institutional investors began withdrawing from fossil fuels, citing environmental concerns. This opened a window for sellers of unregistered securities, especially those with enticing offerings like Phoenix and its oil bonds yielding as much as 13%.

WHY IT MATTERS ""The private placement market is booming, offering a fast track for companies to raise capital,"" says Forbes senior reporter Brandon Kochkodin. ""Phoenix Capital Group has tapped into this trend, drawing mom-and-pop investors to its debt with promises of high yields and the opportunity to create 'generational wealth.' Yet, a recent deal between Phoenix and Fortress Investment Group, a Wall Street behemoth, suggests that smaller investors might not be getting paid enough interest for the risk they're taking.""

A lack of response, or ""ghosting,"" can be frustrating in the workplace, especially when it comes from your boss. First, assess whether their absence is out of character, and if so, give them leeway. Ensure your communication is concise and prioritized, establish regular check-ins and keep a detailed record of your communication attempts. If the behavior becomes a chronic issue, consider seeking advice on potential solutions from a mentor or senior leader.

Data Revisions Reveal: Consumers Have More Spending Power Than We Thought,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2024/10/08/data-revisions-reveal-consumers-have-more-spending-power-than-we-thought/,2024-10-08T11:37:42Z,"Consumers are in better financial shape than we had previously realized, according to revisions of critical information about U.S. incomes, spending and saving. Savings, in particular, are much higher than we had known.

Like virtually all of our economic data, early releases are best-estimates from incomplete information. The numbers are collected from surveys of consumers, businesses and governments. Over time, the statistical agencies get better data. I previously explained the process in relation to employment data. (The information on income, spending and savings comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis as part of the National Income and Products Accounts.)

The biggest change in our understanding regards savings, 78% higher than previous estimates. Savings is a relatively soft estimate, one we cannot take to the bank, so to speak. But whether the true number is a bit higher or lower than the latest estimate, it's still very good.

The data revision showed more income than earlier estimates, but only a little more spending. Savings is the difference between the estimate of disposable income and the estimate of consumer expenditures. That's an important point: savings is not measured directly. It's simply the residual between income and expenditures. The calculation starts with a very big number (income) and then subtracts another very big number (spending). The result is a small number (savings) which critically depends on the accuracy of those two big numbers. Some small errors in the big numbers can make a very large difference in the small number.

Here's why this matters a great deal for the current economic outlook. Most people got substantial stimulus checks during the pandemic, in 2020 and early 2021. And most of the money was saved. This is the typical pattern of surprise income, explained in a pathbreaking book by Milton Friedman back in 1957. He wrote that spending is driven by ""permanent income,"" what a person expects financial resources to be on a long-term basis. Suppose someone gets big winnings from a lottery ticket. There may be a small splurge after the happy event, but the consumer will spread most the expenditures out over a long period.

The chart above shows the month-by-month savings (income less expenditures). Income jumped up sharply with the stimulus checks, and most of it went into savings. Consumers would likely spend the money gradually in the following years. This was a commonplace belief among us economists and one that we got right.

To judge how the savings would impact future spending, many economists calculated ""excess savings."" We looked at the path of savings before the pandemic and projected it into the future as if nothing happened. Then we subtracted this trend savings from actual savings and called the result excess savings. We accumulated it month by month as savings exceeded the trend, then reduced the cumulative excess savings as consumers spent more than they otherwise would have, bringing savings below trend.

Before the recent data revision, excess savings was thought to be coming down briskly, meaning that it would run out some time in 2025. After that, consumers would be likely to tighten their belts, reducing their discretionary spending. Now, however, the recent consumption path looks like it could go on for four or five more years.

However, it bears repeating that savings is not measured with high accuracy. And different economists have calculated excess savings using different assumptions about the underlying trend. Finally, the pandemic and related economic changes may have altered the trend that consumers wish to be on. So this optimistic take on the outlook for consumer spending should be taken cautiously.

The best data we have at this point clearly points to solid consumer spending in the aggregate. News reports will continue to feature a family with financial difficulties, as total income can grow even though some people struggle with falling income. But the overall economy is driven by the aggregates, and they look good."
Inflation Reduction Act Two Years Later: Building Clean Electricity Faster Than Ever,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/10/08/inflation-reduction-act-two-years-later-building-clean-electricity-faster-than-ever/,2024-10-08T11:22:17Z,"This is the fourth article in a series exploring the Inflation Reduction Act's impact after two years. The first summarizes its total impact, the second details historic industry investment, the third tracks a clean manufacturing boom.

In August 2022, when the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, it became the most significant investment in climate that the United States has ever made, making long-term, transformational investments in clean energy deployment, manufacturing, electric vehicles and buildings, and targeted investments to support communities disproportionately impacted by our energy system.

America's electricity sector is the IRA's cornerstone, making up 30-44% of the bill's expected economy-wide emissions reductions. Now, two years after the IRA's passage, signs of progress are emerging.

Before the IRA passed, clean electricity incentives were caught in a cycle of short-term extensions and expirations, creating enormous clean energy industry uncertainty. The IRA invested in the clean energy industry's long-term economic health by creating a decade's worth of certainty for electricity providers, developers, and investors solidifying that clean energy was the better deal for electricity consumers, shareholders, and the planet.

The IRA owes its name to the era of rising prices in which it passed. Global fossil fuel price volatility and supply chain constraints were driving up inflation and interest rates. With clean energy costs largely coming as upfront capital expenditures, the industry was in a period of moderating growth when the bill passed.

Key policies included extension and expansion of clean electricity tax credits, providing up to 60% off the cost of clean energy for ten years, the creation of manufacturing tax credits that bring clean energy manufacturing to the U.S., and billions of dollars to grant and loan programs to make sure upfront funding is there for projects that will save money in the long-term.

A New Energy Era

The effect of the IRA has only just begun to show up in clean energy deployment. While the first half of 2023 was still relatively slow on installs of solar, wind, and energy storage, 2023 ended with a new record of over 35 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity added, and the first half of 2024 saw a 91% increase over installs in the first half of 2023 at 19 GW. Not only were installations in the higher than 2023, but they were 10 GW higher than average of the previous five years. The U.S. Energy Information Agency expects a total of 59 GW of wind, solar and energy storage to come online in 2024. The growth in renewable energy installations is only expected to rise, with planned projects reported to the EIA overwhelmingly comprised of wind, solar, and batteries in coming years.

Since 2021, utility plans have also become increasingly bullish on adding new clean energy. An RMI analysis of 121 utilities representing 48% of U.S. electricity demand showed utilities are now planning to add 34% more wind and solar than they were as of August 2022. Unfortunately, plans to add gas have also increased, as utilities respond to rising electricity demand while they work to modernize their planning assumptions. Utilities don't need to rush to gas, however, as good planning and procurement practices can help utilities meet growing demand with cleaner and cheaper resources.

The IRA extended support for clean electricity across the whole sector, but publicly owned and non-profit electricity providers saw some of the most significant changes. First, tax credits that were previously inaccessible due to lack of tax liability were converted to direct pay, so non-profit entities could take direct advantage.

Rural electric cooperatives in particular are set to receive significant direct funding. Rural electric cooperatives provide electricity to 42 million people across 56% of the nation's landmass. They serve a disproportionately low-income segment of the population, but lag behind the rest of the nation in moving away from coal power, with 30% of their electricity coming from coal in 2022 compared to 19% nationwide. However, the IRA breathed new life into these non-profit utilities, setting aside $9.7 billion in funds to help cooperatives reduce emissions and install clean energy projects.

The first round of funding announcements into this program were made in September, with $7.3 billion awarded to 16 utilities across 23 states, leveraging an additional $29 billion in private investment. These funds are expected to support 10 GW of new clean energy projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from rural electric cooperatives by 43.6 million tons each year, or about 30% of cooperatives current annual emissions. Projects are also expected to reduce electricity rates substantially compared to a continued reliance on fossil energy, according to several of the awardees.

Clean Electricity for Everyone

The IRA didn't stop at driving new clean energy investment - it sought to create a positive feedback loop between the clean energy transition and the health of American manufacturing via a new set of tax credits that can be earned by producing components that go into clean energy projects.

Since the bill's passage, manufacturing facility announcements rolled in, with over $112 billion in investment slated for batteries, electric vehicles, solar, and wind. Batteries are by far the largest share of investment at 68%, shared between batteries for the electric grid and for electric vehicles which utilize slightly different chemistries. However, solar manufacturing boasts no small stake with $14 billion in announcements, which will continue to abate supply chain delays that have lingered after the pandemic.

The power of the IRA does not lie in its direct investment alone. The bill's clean energy provisions also enabled state action with four states implementing 100% clean energy targets for the first time in 2023. Minnesota and Michigan passed legislation requiring 100% of electricity sales to come from clean sources by 2040, while the New Jersey governor signed an executive order requiring 100% clean electricity by 2035. Delaware, too, passed clean energy legislation, requiring a 100% clean economy by 2050.

While interest in clean energy from states, utilities, and investors has increased, many bottlenecks remain, namely in interconnection queues, or the projects waiting to connect to the grid. Research by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that at the end of 2022, over 2,000 GW clean projects were waiting to connect, and at the end of 2023, that number had skyrocketed to over 2500 GW. Overall U.S. energy capacity is about 1,400 GW, meaning significantly more projects are waiting to connect to the grid than are currently connected.

Reforms by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aim to shorten these wait times and reduce costs, but regional approaches have shown that much more can be done in the effort to connect clean energy projects as quickly as possible. For example, Texas uses an approach to interconnection that avoids lengthy studies and costly upgrades across the transmission grid any time a project wants to connect.

This has reduced Texas' timeline to connect projects compared to other regions by 2.5 or more years, and shows why the state is predicted to add 35% of all solar projects and 44% of all battery projects this year, despite only producing 13% of the nation's electricity.

Further improvements to transmission planning, bolstered by recent FERC action, are also expected to prepare the grid to handle more clean energy, faster, but short-term actions like upgrading existing infrastructure to carry more electricity on the transmission pathways we already have can help meet our current needs.

A Clean Power Future

The investment approach of the IRA is not enough to bring electricity sector emissions down to zero - it was never expected to do so. However, it has created tailwinds, bringing industry forward and creating momentum far into the future. Now, it's time to focus on the next piece of the puzzle and make sure the momentum translates into clean power."
"Coinbase's Base Leads The Race To Become The ""Broadband"" Of Web3",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/08/coinbases-base-leads-the-race-to-become-the-broadband-of-web3/,2024-10-08T11:02:21Z,"For the casual observer, the unstoppable rise of blockchain and associated Web3 technologies seems serene, but like a swan there's always a lot going on under the surface - and I can't remember a time of more momentous movement than right now. Today, blockchain faces its ""broadband moment"", as increased adoption and use cases drive the demand for speed and capacity that's an order of magnitude higher than what came before.

This isn't a gradual, gentle evolution, and it's not the result of pan-industry collaboration, either. When you get up close and personal, it's a fierce and sometimes bitter rivalry between a range of Layer-2 (L2) networks. These L2s are designed to overcome the technical and performance limitations of underlying L1s like Solana and Ethereum. Whether they admit it or not, they are all competing to become the de facto standard; the ""broadband for the decentralized web"".

The battle to become the ""L2 that rules them all"" is yet to be decided, but we have a new contender for the crown - Coinbase, a company that combines an impeccable pedigree in blockchain with superb technical expertise. With its new solution, Base, Coinbase has thrust itself into the vanguard to become the broadband of Web3. And into the money. Per Yahoo Finance, Coinbase achieved a significant milestone in its diversification strategy last quarter, with its Base blockchain generating $56 million in revenue.

Like its competitors, Base is designed to solve issues surrounding scalability and security, but it also promises to tap into a massive sum of liquidity that stands to change the nature of the crypto markets forever. Alongside some other powerful developments, and with the support of the memecoin community, Base may just be the player that' overhauls the entire decentralized landscape and brings Web3 to a worldwide audience.

As the biggest crypto exchange in the US, Coinbase needs little by way of introduction, but market dominance in one area does not necessarily translate into L2 leadership. So what is Base, and sets it apart in a crowded - some might say far-too crowded - landscape? Well, to quote Jennifer Aniston: here comes the science bit.

Base is an Ethereum L2 blockchain that specifically focuses on security, stability, and scalability for the benefit of ecosystem builders. With Base, developers can launch literally any EVM codebase and proceed to onramp liquidity and users directly from the entirety of the Ethereum ecosystem.

$130 billion worth of assets from Coinbase and associated, interoperable chains. What makes Base so flexible is the fact that it is built out of the OP (Optimism) Stack. The OP Stack is designed to make Optimism (and now Base) as close and equivalent as possible to Ethereum itself, unlocking maximum compatibility for existing Ethereum developers. This manifests as a series of modules across various consensus, execution and settlement layers that all work together to form a massive, interoperable, and secure blockchain ecosystem.

That might all sound like Base is mostly relevant to those unsung backroom guys and gals of the blockchain industry, but it's actually incredibly significant for all of us, the ultimate end users of Web3. Sure, every L2 talks about interoperability - it's what Layer-2s are for, after all - but Base takes this to the next level, making it simple for developers to deploy services, access a massive well of liquidity, and ensure seamless interoperability with most of the major services already trusted in the Web3 space.

Jesse Pollak, the creator of Base and a key figure at Coinbase, has been quite vocal recently about the future of Base and its broader impact on the blockchain ecosystem. In one of his recent remarks, Pollak highlighted that Base is about building ""an open global economy,"" where the goal is to bring millions of people and decentralized applications (dApps) into the on-chain world. He believes that integrating Coinbase on-chain is essential to realizing this vision, which will help increase economic freedom globally. Pollak also mentioned that despite the challenges ahead, Base has already seen significant community engagement with users creating Twitter accounts, memes, and launching new projects on the platform, underscoring the excitement surrounding this new ecosystem.

If Base competed solely on integrations and interoperability, it would be a strong challenger in the L2 ecosystem. But these alone don't explain its incredibly rapid adoption, which has seen

Base hitting (and smashing) milestones at breakneck speed.Base has repeatedly hit new highs for daily transactions, most recently setting the record with more than 5 million transactions on a single day. There's also the fact that Base has a whopping TVL of $1.92 billion worth of assets, placing it as the #6 biggest chain overall, and well ahead of major competitors like Polygon and even Optimism (which, of course, uses the same base-layer technology).

Size isn't everything, of course. For the ordinary end user, whether they be an institution or individual, speed is every bit as important. Here again, Base boasts impressive credentials for the title of ""broadband of Web3"". As Brian Armstrong himself has championed, Base has gotten its transactions to under one second for finality along with just $0.01 for fees. Considering that Base is also truly global and has no regional restrictions, he claims that this transcends the capabilities of all existing international payment rails.

Meanwhile, in a further leap for Web3 innovation, Armstrong announced recently that, for the first time in history, Artificial Intelligence had used the Base blockchain to send a cryptocurrency transaction. ""AI agents cannot get bank accounts, but they can get crypto wallets,"" said Armstrong ""They can now use USDC on Base to transact with humans, merchants, or other AIs. Those transactions are instant, global, and free."" What this signals is a new space in the cryptocurrency industry that facilitates AI-powered automated trading, a development that stands to revolutionize how these markets are managed.

This is precisely why there are multiple, promising ventures specifically building on Base to leverage its cutting edge benefits. Projects like PropyKeys, which offers users an unprecedented opportunity for anyone to mint an NFT representing a digital address that corresponds to a tangible, real-world property. Speaking to PropyKeys CEO, Nina Fabbri, she said that ""Propykeys is built on Base because of their excellent leadership and commitment to bringing the world onchain. Their innovative approach and dedication to decentralization make them the perfect partner for our mission to revolutionize the real estate industry.""

In addition to multiple enterprise focused projects and revolutions in AI trading, Base has also established itself as a haven for cutting edge memecoin activity.

Jesse Pollak, head of Base and Coinbase wallet, envisions meme coins playing a significant role in onboarding new users to Base, suggesting that these culturally-driven projects will be a major driver of growth for the protocol.

Already, we have seen multiple projects launch and thrive in this ecosystem. Take for example the current leader in Base memecoins, BRETT, a project inspired by a character from Matt Furie's ""Boy's Club"" comic series and depicted as a laid-back, video game-loving figure. After its launch in February of 2024 BRETT quickly rose to prominence and has become one of the largest memecoins by capitalization in the entire market.

There's also Basenji (BENJI), themed after the popular dog breed. The BENJI token aims to follow in the footsteps of other, previously successful dog-themed memecoins, all while bringing its own utility through this domain partnership. Beyond examples like these, the Base blockchain is host to a wide array of other memecoin projects, with names like Mumu, Base God, and Toshi. This is because Base's near-instant transactions and extremely low fees make trading these assets - which have evolved from in-jokes to become crucial entry points to the world of Web3 - more attractive than on virtually any other network.

Ultimately, it's the collision of interoperability, technical innovation, speed and Coinbase's huge clout and connections that are positioning Base as the leader in the race to become the broadband of Web3. And that's to say nothing of the huge community of users and developers that Coinbase brings to the table, which makes it such a powerful player in this hyper-competitive spaceThe battle for Layer-2 hegemony is far from over, but the speed with which Base has established itself as the clear leader puts it firmly among the favorites to emerge the winner."
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: October 8, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-10-08-24/,2024-10-08T10:58:18Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are decreasing. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can put some money aside? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are known for paying teensy interest rates. But it's easy to find rates 10x higher if you know where to look. For instance, online banks and credit unions often pay much higher rates than brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you spot a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.23%, Curinos says. APY, or annual percentage yield, reflects the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts typically pay substantially higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the catch is you may have to jump through some hoops for the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.89%. You'll be in good shape if you can get an account offering a rate close to 4.89%. Last week at this time, the best rate was 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's about the same as last week's APY.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
"Opinion | Biden pledged to restore order as president. In the Middle East, he's failing.",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-iran-war-biden-hezbollah-election-rcna174262,2024-10-08T10:47:49Z,"The president's poor leadership has brought us closer to a regional war that could cause enormous suffering and hurt his own party.

One of Joe Biden's promises in his 2020 presidential campaign was that he would restore strong U.S. leadership abroad and rein in the chaos that Donald Trump had unleashed in the international order.

But if you take a look at the Middle East right now, Biden hasn't done a very good job of fulfilling that pledge.

Under Biden's watch, the Middle East is growing less stable. In the past few weeks, Israel has begun a new war with its invasion of Lebanon, against the public wishes of the Biden administration. Iran has fired around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, the second time it has ever launched such a direct assault on Israel from its own land. Israel has since promised it will retaliate against Iran -- and that if the tit-for-tat continues for an additional round, strikes on Iran's nuclear sites are on the table. Meanwhile Israel's war in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks continues to rage with no end in sight. As a result of the instability, the price of oil is rising, and attacks on oil production in the region could cause it to surge more.

In other words, the Middle East is slowly inching toward breaking out into a full-scale regional war that could shake up the global economy, create a gigantic crisis in U.S. foreign policy and result in the deaths of countless civilians.

This is not good news for the Democrats as Election Day approaches: Just the rumblings of an imminent crisis or potentially surging gas prices could hurt the electoral appeal of Democrats, who are already suffering from their association with inflation.

The growing specter of wide-scale war in the Middle East is not some kind of approaching weather event or natural disaster. It is the product of choices. And our president has made some terrible ones that helped us get to this point. After Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, it was inevitable that Israel was going to retaliate. What was not inevitable was that the Biden administration would give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a far-right leader with neocolonial extremists in his Cabinet, carte blanche to retaliate against the entire population of the Gaza Strip however he wished to.

The Biden administration has appeared to use leaks and statements to suggest that it believes Netanyahu has gone too far in his brutality toward the civilians of Gaza, but in practice it has greenlighted all of Israel's actions. The Biden administration has been a staunch defender of Israel at the United Nations, shielding it from legally binding Security Council resolutions. It has given Israel billions in military aid. Aside from a brief, temporary and ultimately symbolic pause in arms transfers, Biden has not threatened to cut off aid, or even condition aid on Israel's compliance with international or U.S. law. The Biden administration, to keep weapons shipments intact under U.S. law, has reportedly ignored findings from the State Department and USAID that Israel had blocked U.S. humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Netanyahu's takeaway from Biden's support is that he can take U.S. backing as unconditional and do whatever he wants not only toward Palestinian civilians, but in the region more broadly. Netanyahu has embraced a ""shoot first, notify Biden later"" attitude toward many high-stakes and escalatory actions against adversaries in the Middle East, such as when Israel struck the Syrian headquarters of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, or when Israel leveled several buildings in Beirut in a bombing that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's operations in Lebanon -- against Biden's public wishes -- have already displaced close to a quarter of Lebanon's population and killed hundreds of civilians, according to PBS' NewsHour. And Netanyahu has demonstrated he feels no obligation to listen to U.S. calls to wind down the bloody military operation in Gaza, which is why Israel and Hezbollah have locked horns in the last year.

As Atlantic Council fellow Nicholas Blanford explained to me, Israel's escalation with its adversaries in the region increases the likelihood of a regional war. If, for example, Israel decides to entrench itself in a more wide-scale war in Lebanon, it could nudge Hezbollah to unleash its most destructive firepower, such as its precision-guided missiles that it has so far refrained from using. And if Iran were to fear that Israel is about to wipe out Hezbollah at some point, it could ""activate all [its] proxies across the region"" against Israel, dragging several other countries directly into the conflict.

We don't know exactly how Netanyahu would act if Biden were to condition or cut off aid to Israel. But given that U.S. military support is vital to Israel's national security and military operations, Netanyahu would be far more likely to behave conservatively in his military campaigns and targeted strikes across the region.

Netanyahu is aware that the timing of his more aggressive maneuvering comes at an acutely sensitive time for Biden politically. Biden is likely in the weeks before Election Day to be particularly hesitant to initiate an upheaval in U.S.-Israeli relations by cutting off weapons shipments or demanding that Netanyahu act like more of a cooperative U.S. ally. But at the same time Biden looks rudderless and weak by not doing anything.

When asked at a press conference Friday if he believed Netanyahu was trying to influence the U.S. election, Biden said, ""I don't know."" And when asked by another reporter, ""How long are you OK with Israel bombing Lebanon? What is acceptable to you?"" he smiled and walked away from the podium.

Biden has gotten himself into this bind through his record of unconditional support for Israel, no matter how badly it deviates from basic morality in warfare, international law or U.S. interests. One can't help but wonder if Biden's poor leadership in the Middle East might just mark a historic first: a president inadvertently springing an October surprise on his own party."
Americans are using AI at fairly high rates. What does this mean for the economy?,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2024/10/07/g-s1-26429/americans-using-ai-fairly-high-rates-what-does-this-mean-for-economy,2024-10-08T10:33:21Z,"Before conducting a recent survey of Americans to figure out how much they're using generative AI, Harvard University economist David Deming says he was solidly in the ""AI skeptic"" camp. That is, he was skeptical that the explosion of generative AI would offer sizable benefits for the U.S. economy anytime soon. Now, however, he says he's more optimistic.

""I was very surprised at the numbers in our survey,"" Deming says. ""And it sort of made me think that AI is gonna be a bigger deal than I would've thought.""

The study, Deming says, was motivated by questions over whether and how much Americans are using generative artificial intelligence. Doing what economists tend to do, he and his colleagues, Alexander Bick and Adam Blandin, wanted to get some good data.

They modeled their survey after the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Conducted monthly, the CPS is sort of the gold standard for surveys. It's how we know things like the unemployment rate and the state of the labor market.

In short, the survey that Deming, Bick and Blandin conducted is high-quality. It has a large sample size. It's nationally representative. And they even included some of the same questions that the CPS asks, so they could cross-reference their survey with the CPS and make sure their numbers were good. They conducted their survey twice, in June and August 2024.

Deming says he was shocked by the results. He and his colleagues found that almost 40% of Americans, ages 18 to 64, have used generative AI. And a sizable percentage seems to use it regularly. In their August survey, the economists found that more than 24% of American workers had used it ""at least once in the week prior to being surveyed, and nearly one in nine used it every workday.""

Even more surprising, Deming says, usage of AI seems to be pretty much across the board. He expected that younger and more-educated Americans would be the biggest users. They confirmed that's the case. ""But we even found that 22% of blue-collar workers say they use AI, and usage rates were above 20% in every major occupation category except personal services, where it was like 15%,"" he says.

This rapid rate of adoption, the authors point out, is much faster than the speed at which Americans adopted personal computers and the internet. That may not be very surprising though, considering that personal computers cost thousands of dollars in the 1980s and 1990s and you had to get physical hardware, hook it up, figure out how to use it, etc. Even with the internet, people had to buy modems, get subscriptions, figure out how to ""surf the web"" and so on. Generative AI is more plug and play, often free or has a low-monthly subscription cost, and has a user interface that is familiar to anyone who has ever used Google.

In a recent two-part series on The Indicator, Darian Woods and I debated whether AI is overrated. Given the tremendous uncertainty about the impact that AI will have on the economy -- as well as our reluctance to make predictions that might get us laughed at in a few years -- we decided to obscure our personal feelings on the matter. We flipped an AI-generated coin. I got ""AI is overrated"" and wrote an episode and a newsletter making that argumentative case.

In the course of my research, I discovered a study conducted by the Census Bureau this year that found that only about 5% of American businesses said they had used AI in the previous couple of weeks. I used this as evidence that use of generative AI was pretty pathetic, especially considering all the hype around it.

How does Deming square his results with that finding?

For one, Deming says, he and his colleagues found that actually Americans report they're using AI more during their personal time at home than at work.

Hmmm. OK. Putting my ""AI is overrated"" hat back on, this makes me think that much of AI use is for pleasure rather than for productive work purposes -- which would suggest that AI's impact on the economy will be limited.

The sort of economic dream for AI would be that it would rescue the U.S. economy from its long period of slow productivity growth. Productivity growth -- meaning workers being able to produce more in less time -- is the magic sauce of rising living standards. And recent technologies have been pretty disappointing on that front.

I mean, look at the smartphone. If I told you back in 2006, the year before the iPhone was released, that we'd soon all have supercomputers in our pockets, able to search the internet, give us precise directions to anywhere, send emails to and do video calls with co-workers and clients, order basically any product or service, translate languages and on and on -- you might think we'd see an explosion in productivity. But smartphones seem to be more a tool for pleasure and distraction than an incredibly impactful work tool. We haven't seen a huge boost in productivity growth since its mass adoption well over a decade ago.

Deming, however, stresses that people are using generative AI for work. He says their survey shows ""about 1 in 4 people used it at least once in the last week at work"" (versus ""about 1 in 3"" who used it in their off time). When it comes to how people use AI to help their work, respondents indicated that writing, interpreting and administrative support were the most helpful (although a significant share also said they were using it for other tasks, including coding and support when dealing with customers and co-workers).

Squaring his study with the one from the Census Bureau, Deming says he thinks there's a ""big gap between a company's formal policy on AI use and workers. I think quite a lot of the use is under the radar, like you've gotta write an email to your boss and you just use it to write the email more quickly and you just use ChatGPT to do it. But you don't tell anyone."" Deming says many of his students use generative AI this way.

We reached out to Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Daron Acemoglu -- whom, these days, you might call the AI skeptic in chief -- about Deming and his colleagues' study. Does the fact that they find that a large percentage of Americans are using generative AI change his perspective at all?

""My concern with their numbers is that it does not distinguish fundamentally productive uses of generative AI from occasional/frivolous uses,"" Acemoglu said in an email. ""If you are curious about what ChatGPT would say to introduce one of your guests and use it to get a sense of that, you are a user, but this is not fundamentally integrated into the NPR production process. Worse, if you asked me whether I'm using generative AI, and if I'm being honest, I will have to say yes, because when I do searches, now I see generative AI-generated output. But this has zero impact on me. The productivity improvements would require fundamental integration and reorganization of production processes, together with complementary investments in organizational capacity and worker skills -- not gimmicky, frivolous uses. We know ChatGPT has about 200 million unique monthly users, but the question is how many of them are using it in a way that will lead to significant productivity improvements/cost reductions. I don't really know the answer to that question, and I don't think we find the answer to that question from this paper.""

To try to predict how much AI will boost productivity growth, Deming and his colleagues did some rough calculations. They looked at five randomized studies that analyzed how much use of generative AI increases productivity in various work settings. They picked the productivity-boost number in the middle of those studies, which is about 25%. They then multiplied that, Deming says, by ""our estimate of the number of work hours that are currently being assisted by generative AI"" (which, they calculate, is somewhere between 0.5% and 3.5% of all work hours in the U.S.).

They ended up estimating that generative AI will result in an ""increase in labor productivity of between 0.125 and 0.875 percentage points at current levels of usage."" That may not sound like very much. But, Deming says, consider that productivity growth over the last couple of decades has ""been about one and a half percent per year. So if you take that 1.5% and you add this, that's actually a pretty big increase.""

Interestingly, Acemoglu has also done some rough calculations of the potential impact of generative AI on the economy in the near future. And despite using a different method to calculate the potential productivity boost from AI, his estimates are actually pretty similar to this recent work from Deming and colleagues.

Yet, Acemoglu and Deming put different spins on the results. Acemoglu seems to be reacting more to all the media and industry hype around generative AI -- and, he's like, we're not witnessing an economic revolution by any means. Deming looks at the potential productivity increase and emphasizes more that it looks like generative AI could make a meaningful impact on the U.S. economy.

""Is it gonna lead to 7% productivity growth? No, probably not,"" Deming says. ""Not the way it's currently being used, but it could add a little bit, and every little bit counts. Like that's millions and millions of dollars of extra GDP growth and rising living standards. That really counts.""

Deming and his colleagues have plans to continue conducting their survey in the future. It's worth noting that they conducted their last survey before Apple released an iPhone that has ChatGPT integrated into it.

Pretty soon, he says, ""because AI is gonna be embedded in so many things, like the iPhone, it's gonna be hard to even ask people, ""Do you use AI?"""
Starbucks Stock: Path To $190,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/08/starbucks-stock-path-to-190/,2024-10-08T10:09:38Z,"Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is adding a new beverage The Pecan Crunch Oatmilk latte to its lineup, and it has been garnering good reviews. What makes this drink different from other seasonal favorites? This beverage boasts a pecan pie-inspired flavor, evoking the nostalgia of Thanksgiving. It aims to bridge the gap between the everyday routines of the fall season and the festive indulgences of the upcoming holiday season. This beverage has the potential to become a landmark product for the company, illustrating the impact a single, game-changing offering can have on a brand's trajectory. As exemplified by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), whose iconic products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, etc, have cultivated a devoted following and solidified the company's market position. Starbucks can also replicate this success, establishing a signature offering that resonates with consumers, fosters brand loyalty, and drives business growth.

Could Starbucks stock grow 2x in the next few years from the roughly $97 level it is at currently? Does this sound a bit ridiculous? Consider this - Starbucks' stock was trading at around $126 per share, almost 1.3x the current value in July 2021. We examine a scenario in this note where SBUX stock doubles from current levels, considering three key metrics: revenues, net margins, and price-to-earnings multiple.

Does SBUX stock look attractive now?

Overall, the performance of SBUX stock with respect to the index over the last 3-year period has been lackluster. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -13% in 2022, and -1% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could SBUX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? We have revised our Starbucks' Valuation to $97 per share, based on a $3.58 expected EPS and a 27.1x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2024 - almost in line with the current market price.

Snapshot of Current Scenario

Starbucks' Revenues grew from $29 billion in 2021 to $36 billion in 2023 as the company's strength in digital orders helped it rebound quickly from the pandemic setback. The company saw strength in both U.S. business and growth in the International segment during this period. However, the company's sales have been taking a hit in FY 2024 so far. The company's total sales, inclusive of new stores, were down 1% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $9.1 billion in the third quarter (ended June 30), while its global comparable sales declined 3%. Starbucks faced significant external pressures, including eroding consumer confidence, elevated inflation, and disappointing growth in China, which comprises almost one-fifth of the company's business.

How Can An Iconic Product Improve Sales?

A flagship product can potentially boost foot traffic, enhancing comparable sales opportunities. During the recent third quarter ended June, Starbucks' global comparable store sales declined by 3%, primarily driven by a 2% decline in the U.S. and a 7% decline internationally. However, when compared to a similar period before the pandemic (Q3 2019) - when Starbucks was thriving thanks to exponential growth in China, innovation in products, and global coffee alliances with the likes of Nestlé - the company's comparable sales grew 6%, driven by a 7% growth in the Americas and 5% growth in China and Asia Pacific.

An uptick in foot traffic can revitalize customer loyalty for Starbucks, bolstered by its successful rewards program. Starbucks Rewards launched over a decade and a half ago - reported 33.8 million 90-day active rewards members in the U.S. as of June 30, an increase of 7% year-over-year (also up 2% quarter-over-quarter from Q2 2024). Nonetheless, comparative analysis reveals an opportunity for further growth. For perspective, SBUX's peer Chipotle (NYSE: CMG) rewards program, introduced in Q1 2019, has surpassed Starbucks' membership numbers, with 40 million members as of Q2 2024.

Starbucks is the world's largest coffee chain. It boasts an extensive network of nearly 39,500 global stores, with over 18,000 located in North America. The company's growth momentum remains strong, with 526 net new store openings in Q3 (of which 141 were in North America). For FY 2024, the company has planned a total of 580 new stores added, with renovations planned in more than 800 stores in North America. This strategic expansion is poised to fuel revenue growth, solidifying Starbucks' market position and driving future profitability.

Margins Could Improve Going Forward

Starbucks' net margins (net income, or profits after expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) fell from levels of over 14% in 2021 to about 10% in 2022 amid increasing operating costs and increased promotional activities. Nevertheless, the company's net margins grew to about 11.5% in 2023 due to sales growth and in-store operational efficiencies. At present, the coffee king's Q3 2024 net margins came in at 11.6% (down 90 basis points y-o-y), and earnings per share dropped 6% y-o-y to $0.93. Despite near-term challenges, we remain upbeat on Starbucks' prospects, anticipating a margin rebound to historical levels driven by the company's transformative turnaround strategy. CEO Brian Niccol outlined a US-focused turnaround plan centered on four key areas: barista empowerment for consistent quality, timely delivery of high-quality offerings, revitalizing the community coffee house experience, and highlighting Starbucks' unique story, including its Costa Rican coffee farm and innovation hub.

Consumers are also willing to pay for the products they deem premium, based on Starbucks' high gross margin (~67%) which gives the business room to absorb higher input costs while still being profitable. Starbucks has consistently been able to raise prices throughout the inflationary environment in the U.S. - and most loyal customers still come in despite higher pricing and inflationary pressures - demonstrating the strength of its business.

Impact on Starbucks' Valuation?

The Pecan Crunch latte's financial impact will be directly tied to its availability. While seasonal releases yield quarterly gains, a permanent menu addition would likely foster sustained revenue growth.

If we assume revenue growth of roughly 1.26x between 2023 and 2027 with margins growing from 11.5% in 2023 to about 21% in 2026, a roughly 2x increase, this would mean that its net income could grow from about $4.1 billion in 2023 ($3.58 per share) to about $9.5 billion (about $8.29 per share). Good times make it easier to imagine even better times - and when that happens, investors could begin to see Starbucks in a more favorable light, re-assessing the company's recovery path. For example, if Starbucks' investors assign a multiple of 23x following its stronger growth trajectory, this could translate into a stock price of about $190 per share by the end of 2027, assuming earnings of $8.29 per share. What about the time horizon for this positive-return scenario? While our example illustrates this for a 2027 timeline, in practice, it won't make much difference whether it takes three years or four. If the turnaround takes hold, with Starbucks improving its revenues and margins, we could see meaningful gains in the stock. This is a huge business and Starbucks has valuable know-how in a competitive market. Our analysis suggests that a win will be at hand - it just may not be quick and may require patience.

It is helpful to see how its peers stack up. SBUX Peers shows how Starbucks' stock compares against peers on metrics that matter. You will find other useful comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Hyatt Hotels: Further Upside Potential After 15% YTD Growth?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/08/hyatt-hotels-further-upside-potential-after-15-ytd-growth/,2024-10-08T09:03:00Z,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation stock (NYSE: H) has gained close to 15% since the beginning of 2024 while its rival Hilton stock is up about 27% over the same period. There are a couple of trends driving the recent price appreciation. Travel demand has remained robust, despite concerns about the global economy. Over Q2 2024, Hyatt saw its comparable system-wide revenue per available room increase by 4.7% year-over-year (down from 5.5% y-o-y growth in Q1 2024), driven by higher occupancy levels and average room rates. The company's operations in Asia remain the biggest drivers of growth, as greater outbound travel from Greater China to markets including Japan, Thailand, and South Korea drives growth. Moreover, the U.S. business also increased from group and business travel. Looking ahead, the hotel operator expects system-wide revenue per available room of 3.0% to 4.0% y-o-y in FY 2024. It also anticipates a 5.5% to 6.0% increase in net room growth. In addition, the company's adjusted EBITDA is expected to land in a range of $1.10 billion to 1.14 billion in FY 2024 compared to $1.03 billion in FY 2023.

Admirably, H stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 29% in 2021, -6% in 2022, and 45% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could H see a strong jump?

Hyatt primarily makes money from fee-based revenue, licensing, and other services, allowing third-party owners and franchisees to use Hyatt's brand and intellectual property. In Q2 2024, the company added 18 new hotels and 3,251 rooms to its portfolio. The company has seen its pipeline grow 9% y-o-y to a record 130K rooms. Hyatt had previously estimated that it would derive over 80% of its earnings via fees by 2025. For this year, the company is guiding for fee-based revenues of $1.1 billion to $1.13 billion.

Hyatt has also been increasingly focused on deal-making activity, with deals in recent years including the Mr & Mrs Smith booking platform, offering direct booking access to a select collection of boutique and luxury properties, and its 2021 deal for Apple Leisure Group, a luxury resort-management services, travel, and hospitality company. Recently, Hyatt completed the sale of its 1,641-room Hyatt Regency Orlando and adjacent 45 acres of land to affiliates of RIDA Development Corporation and an Ares Management Real Estate fund for approximately $1.07 billion, while retaining a long-term management agreement under the Hyatt Regency brand. Hyatt also entered into an agreement to pay $150 million for 21 Standard International properties, and another $185 million to acquire an additional 30 new projects in the Standard International pipeline over time for a total value of $335 million. This acquisition along with the sale of the Hyatt Regency Orlando is part of the company's capital allocation strategy to sell owned hotels and reinvest in asset-light platforms to accelerate growth.

While the increasing pivot to fee-based businesses, a focus on more premium properties, and a strong and growing travel market should help Hyatt in the long run, we think the stock is fairly priced at current levels. At the current market price of about $150 per share, Hyatt trades at roughly 33x projected 2024 earnings, which aligns compared to peers. We value H stock at about $144 per share, which is almost in line with the current market price. See our analysis on Hyatt Valuation: Is H Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for more details on Hyatt's valuation and how it compares with peers.

Mortgage Rates 8 October 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-08-10-24/,2024-10-08T08:59:49Z,"Bank Rate was held at 5% in September by the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steadying interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Good news on inflation and interest rates has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy. We will know more in its Autumn Budget on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.44%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.34% and 4.19% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 3.39%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 3.79% and 3.68% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.57%, with the best in this category priced at 5.29%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stands at 7.23%, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 October there were 6,645 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,460 on 1 September. The number has been steadily growing as the market improves. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

Halifax's latest house price report (published 7 October) reported that the value of the average home was 4.7% higher in September than the previous year, while Nationwide building society's latest report (published 30 September) put annual house price inflation at 3.7%. Both lenders say it's the strongest annual growth they have seen since November 2022.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, also reported five consecutive months of rises. It found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before, although on a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."
Tunisia's President Saied wins reelection after cracking down on the opposition,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/g-s1-26834/tunisia-kais-saied-election-2024-arab-spring,2024-10-08T05:46:56Z,"TUNIS, Tunisia -- President Kais Saied won a landslide victory in Tunisia's election Monday, keeping his grip on power after a first term in which opponents were imprisoned and the country's institutions overhauled to give him more authority.

The North African country's Independent High Authority for Elections said Saied received 90.7% of the vote, a day after exit polls showed him with an insurmountable lead in the country known as the birthplace of the Arab Spring more than a decade ago.

""We're going to cleanse the country of all the corrupt and schemers,"" the 66-year-old populist said in a speech at campaign headquarters. He pledged to defend Tunisia against threats foreign and domestic.

That raised alarm among the president's critics including University of Tunis law professor Sghayer Zakraoui, who said Tunisian politics were once again about ""the absolute power of a single man who places himself above everyone else and believes himself to be invested with a messianic message.""

Zakraoui said the election results were reminiscent of Tunisia under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who ruled for more than 20 years before becoming the first dictator toppled in the Arab Spring uprisings. Saied received a larger vote share than Ben Ali did in 2009, two years before fleeing the country amid protests.

The closest challenger, businessman Ayachi Zammel, won 7.4% of the vote after sitting in prison for the majority of the campaign while facing multiple sentences for election-related crimes.

Yet Saied's win was marred by low voter turnout. Election officials reported 28.8% of voters participated on Oct. 6 -- a significantly smaller showing than in the first round of the country's two other post-Arab Spring elections and an indication of apathy plaguing the country's 9.7 million eligible voters.

Saied's most prominent challengers -- imprisoned since last year -- were prevented from running, and lesser-known candidates were jailed or kept off the ballot. Opposition parties boycotted the contest, calling it a sham amid Tunisia's deteriorating political climate and authoritarian drift.

Over the weekend, there was little sign of an election underway in Tunisia apart from an anti-Saied protest on Friday and celebrations in the capital on Sunday evening.

""He will re-enter office undermined rather than empowered by these elections,"" Tarek Megerisi, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote on X.

Saied's critics pledged to keep opposing his rule.

""It's possible that after 20 years our kids will protest on Avenue Habib Bourguiba to tell him to get out,"" said Amri Sofien, a freelance filmmaker, referring to the capital's main thoroughfare. ""There is no hope in this country.""

Such despair is a far cry from the Tunisia of 2011, when protesters took to the streets demanding ""bread, freedom and dignity,"" ousted the president and paved the way for the country's transition into a multiparty democracy.

Tunisia in the following years enshrined a new constitution, created a Truth and Dignity Commission to bring justice to citizens tortured under the former regime and saw its leading civil society groups win the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering political compromise.

But its new leaders were unable to buoy the country's flailing economy and quickly became unpopular amid constant political infighting and episodes of terrorism and political violence.

Against that backdrop, Saied -- then a political outsider -- won his first term in 2019 promising to combat corruption. To the satisfaction of his supporters, in 2021 he declared a state of emergency, suspended parliament and rewrote the constitution to consolidate the power of the presidency -- a series of actions his critics likened to a coup.

Tunisians in a referendum approved the president's proposed constitution a year later, although voter turnout plummeted.

Authorities subsequently began to unleash a wave of repression on the once-vibrant civil society. In 2023, some of Saied's most prominent opponents from across the political spectrum were thrown in prison, including right-wing leader Abir Moussi and Islamist Rached Ghannouchi, the co-founder of the party Ennahda and former speaker of Tunisia's parliament.

Dozens of others were imprisoned on charges including inciting disorder, undermining state security and violating a controversial anti-fake news law critics say has been used to stifle dissent.

The pace of the arrests picked up earlier this year, when authorities began targeting additional lawyers, journalists, activists, migrants from sub-Saharan Africa and the former head of the post-Arab Spring Truth and Dignity Commission.

""The authorities seemed to see subversion everywhere,"" said Michael Ayari, senior analyst for Algeria & Tunisia at the International Crisis Group.

Dozens of candidates had expressed interest in challenging the president, and 17 submitted preliminary paperwork to run in Sunday's race. However, members of the election commission approved only three.

The role of the commission and its members, all of them appointed by the president under his new constitution, came under scrutiny. They defied court rulings ordering them to reinstate three candidates they had rejected. The parliament subsequently passed a law stripping power from the administrative courts.

Such moves sparked international concern, including from Europe, which relies on partnership with Tunisia to police the central Mediterranean, where migrants attempt to cross in from North Africa to Europe.

European Commission Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said Monday the EU ""takes note of the position expressed by many Tunisian social and political actors regarding the integrity of the electoral process."""
79 days: Kamala Harris has yet to do formal press conference since emerging as Democratic nominee,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/79-days-kamala-harris-has-yet-do-formal-press-conference-since-emerging-democratic-nominee,2024-10-08T04:10:18Z,"'The Five' co-hosts discuss Vice President Kamala Harris' media strategy heading into November.

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 79 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Trump has held six news conferences where he took questions from the media since the beginning of August, including another on Friday after meeting with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp about hurricane relief efforts.

President Biden also held a news conference in the White House press briefing room on Friday, where he joked about getting back into the 2024 race.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey last month at a star-studded campaign event. This week she taped an interview on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

SAP BrandVoice: How GenAI Boosts Productivity In The Construction Industry,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2024/10/08/how-genai-boosts-productivity-in-the-construction-industry/,2024-10-08T04:06:43Z,"The construction industry accounts for 14.2% of global GDP. But as other industries have steadily grown their productivity in the last few decades, construction productivity has been stuck in the mud.

Between 1970 and 2020, as aggregate productivity for the U.S. economy doubled, labor productivity in the U.S. construction sector declined an average of 1% a year. Some estimates put this at $30 billion to $40 billion in losses. Meanwhile, schedule and cost overruns are the norm.

Just 8.5% of megaprojects ($1 billion or more) meet or exceed their time and budget expectations, according to one study. On top of all of that, skilled labor is growing scarce as older workers leave the industry and fewer young people enter its ranks.

While other industries have embraced the digital world to improve efficiency and performance, construction has historically been slow to adopt technology, says Dr. David Jason Gerber, director of the M.S. in Advanced Design and Construction program at University of Southern California.

It's not hard to understand why. After all, you can't digitize concrete. Construction is a low-margin, materials-based, physical labor-intensive field.

But AI could spur construction's digital transformation. The industry has accumulated decades' worth of data that, with the help of AI-driven analysis, could be tapped to boost construction productivity, prevent schedule overruns, improve cost-effectiveness, bridge labor gaps, and reduce risks. In a recent study, 92% of construction companies said they were already using or intend to use AI.

The application of generative AI specifically could be a turning point for the industry -- particularly as construction projects grow more complex and demand continues to increase.

While generative AI isn't the only AI tool to solve the construction industry's productivity challenges, its ability to use large language models (LLM) to create new text and images through a natural language interface makes it a good fit for construction, from planning to jobsite execution.

Jose Luis Bianco, who leads McKinsey's engineering and construction work in North America, estimates that AI and gen AI together can unlock value of up to $18 billion for home builders alone (about 10% of industry revenues).

A recent article in Engineering News-Record listed several promising gen AI applications, including AI assistants or ""co-pilots"" that help employees perform tasks and quickly gather information, high-speed content generation for drafting contracts, and specialized tools to aid in decision-making, from lot selection to pricing.

Let's examine other ways generative AI can help the construction industry improve productivity.

Construction firms manage vast, complex supply chains and networks of trade partners. By analyzing data on supplier performance, quality control, and project requirements, gen AI can identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies so construction companies can proactively address issues, streamline operations, and ensure timely project completion.

When facing material shortages or delayed deliveries, for example, gen AI might suggest alternative suppliers based on past collaborations or supplier quality, to keep work flowing.

Turner Construction last fall demonstrated a gen AI tool that automates contract drafting, a huge productivity tool for a company with 30,000 trade contractor deals (those contractors who supply labor and materials for a project) every year. The tool uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand requirements, automatically generate text for statements of work or master services agreements, and speed up the overall procurement process.

Nearly one in four construction workers in the U.S. are 55 or older, according to the Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) trade association. Meanwhile, an estimated 9 million construction workers are likely to leave the industry in 2024. The US construction industry will need an estimated 501,000 additional workers on top of the normal pace of hiring in 2024 to meet demand (and another 454,000 in 2025), according to a proprietary model from ABC.

Gen AI could help get new hires up to speed much more quickly through the deployment of digital assistants for junior project managers. By interacting with existing systems and data, these assistants can answer queries, offer suggestions, and provide step-by-step instructions in real-time.

Suffolk Construction, for instance, plans to roll out the co-pilot built into its collaboration software to find information and answer questions for workers in the field.

Co-pilots could also take on tedious tasks, boosting construction productivity. Gilbane, one of the largest privately-held real estate development and construction companies in the U.S., has been conducting gen AI proofs of concept that helps its people make the best use of their time with super-fast document retrieval.

Construction projects involve multiple parties engaged in a wide range of discrete activities, and keeping everyone on the same page -- literally -- remains a challenge. It's not uncommon to use paper blueprints, drawings and specs, and when plans change, they may not have access to the most recent information.

Many in the industry have shifted to using building information modeling (BIM) systems, whereby a digital twin of the built asset is created and managed. However, updating the digital twin can be laborious, as can pulling information from the BIM, which may contain hundreds of terabytes of data.

Gen AI can help by updating the digital twin with data gathered from AI-powered cameras and sensors, and comparing it with original plans. For example, it might find important information within the data lake of the digital twin, or even send alerts when, say, piping is scheduled for the following week, but the materials are running behind.

Once the project is complete, construction firms could use gen AI to take all the data in the BIM and package it up as a digital manual, including links to warranties and troubleshooting information.

Scheduling has historically been the purview of industry pros using traditional project planning tools -- and years of experience -- to build out their schedules in a linear fashion. They usually produce a single schedule since exploring alternatives would be too time-consuming and costly.

Project scheduling could be done more quickly and accurately using AI algorithms to analyze historical company data, project requirements, and resource availability. These tools could quickly develop multiple scheduling options and run ""what-if"" analyses to explore how changes in variables (e.g., number of cranes used) impacts timelines and costs. Such automation and optimization could yield significant time and cost savings.

Building the schedule, though, is only half the battle. Adjusting it based on changing conditions is the other. LLMs can be used to assess project risks, considering factors like weather, labor availability, and supply chain disruptions.

These models can also continuously monitor a project's progress and make changes to schedules in real-time. If a task is delayed or completed early, the algorithm can automatically reschedule dependent tasks to optimize project timelines.

Keeping on top of complex, confusing and frequently changing building codes is another construction productivity drain gen AI is particularly well suited to solve. Regulations vary by jurisdiction, year, and project type. They often include exceptions and can be challenging to interpret.

Some vendors are introducing AI-powered building codes co-pilots to answer building code queries such as how many exits are required for a restaurant and minimum ceiling height for a habitable room. Gen AI could also be used to analyze building schemes and blueprints to identify elements that don't meet standards, enabling early corrections and adjustments.

Once building is underway, gen AI could also help in the execution phase to keep projects on track by monitoring progress versus plan, spotting potential delays, and recommending steps to avoid or recover from such issues. Some startups already offer drones and hard hat or crane-mounted cameras to capture information on a project's status during execution phase. Gen AI can then compare the data gathered on-site to original plans to flag problems, like deviations from plans to minimize rework or delays.

Construction businesses face multiple hurdles when it comes to taking advantage of gen AI, most of which are centered on the industry's low levels of tech adoption to date. This is combined with a propensity to favor short-term cost concerns over long-term tech investment benefits.

Nonetheless, with some of the biggest industry players moving forward with gen AI, it's increasingly less of an option to sit on the sidelines. Here's how construction businesses can get the best results and better productivity with the emerging tech:

Gen AI has great potential to enable a new wave of productivity and efficiency within the construction industry and could well be a key driver in some long-overdue digitization and data integration and governance. As more industry players experiment with and adopt the technology, the pressure is on others to adopt as well.

At Clark Construction, Mathur says company leaders are convinced that a proactive approach to gen AI adoption is critical to continued competitive advantage.

""The real risk is to not invest and be left behind,"" Gerber says."
Harris is pressed for more specifics in a wide-ranging interview with '60 Minutes',NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144749/kamala-harris-60-minutes-cbs,2024-10-08T02:42:24Z,"Vice President Harris speaks to media members before departing for New York at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on Monday. Harris appeared on the CBS news magazine 60 Minutes on Monday, where she answered questions about her economic plans, the war in Ukraine and the U.S.-Mexico border.

Vice President Harris sat for a wide-ranging interview that aired on 60 Minutes Monday, during which she was pressed for specifics on how she would pay for her economic plans and how she would bring an end to the war in Ukraine.

The interview with correspondent Bill Whitaker followed weeks of criticism from her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, that Harris has been unwilling to sit for difficult interviews with the press. Her appearance on 60 Minutes was part of a week-long media blitz that will see Harris appear on programs that include The View, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Howard Stern Show.

On the economy, Harris was pressed on how she would pay for economic promises like an expanded child tax credit and tax breaks for first time home buyers and new businesses. A new report from the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that Harris' estimated proposals would cost the government around $3.5 trillion, but Harris said she would offset that by raising taxes on corporations and the highest-earning Americans.

Her answer led interviewer Whitaker to push back, saying, ""We're dealing with the real world here."" Harris responded by saying she believes leaders in Congress are privately ready to listen to her.

""When you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about,"" she said, adding that there are ""plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

On the issue of immigration, Harris was asked why the Biden administration to did not move sooner to crack down on illegal immigration - a recurring criticism on the campaign trail from Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.

""The policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem,"" Harris said. Illegal border crossings have fallen off by half, she said, ""but we need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem.""

Harris was also asked about criticism from her Republican opponents that she has morphed from a relatively liberal candidate during her first run for the White House in 2020 to a more centrist candidate today. She responded by saying that her evolution is result of traveling the nation as vice president ""and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground.""

""I believe in building consensus,"" Harris said. ""We are a diverse people, geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds, and what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus, where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing, as long as you don't compromise your values.""

On foreign policy, Harris said she would not meet unilaterally with President Vladimir Putin of Russia about ending the war in in Ukraine, suggesting Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy would need to be involved. ""Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine,"" Harris said.

The vice president also shared new details about a surprising admission she made during her debate with Trump: that she is a gun owner. -- that she was a gun owner.

She told Oprah Winfrey last month that she had long owned a gun for protection, because of her history in law enforcement. ""If somebody breaks in my house, they're getting shot."" She told Whitaker she owned a Glock and that she'd ""had it for quite some time."" Asked if she had ever fired it, she said, ""Yes, of course I have, at a shooting range.""

Harris' appearance was part of a long tradition of presidential candidates sitting for interviews with 60 Minutes going back to 1968. The show said Trump had been scheduled to appear for an interview as well, but that his campaign canceled last week."
"Ghost Rockets, ASAT Tests Create ""A Ticking Time Bomb"" For Astronauts",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinholdenplatt/2024/10/07/ghost-rockets-asat-tests-create-a-ticking-time-bomb-for-astronauts/,2024-10-08T02:38:04Z,"Decades of shooting rockets into orbit, interspersed with the firing off of anti-satellite missiles to shatter spacecraft circling the globe, are surrounding Earth with ever-moving minefields that will threaten spacefarers and space stations into the future.

Ghost rocket stages that revolve at 28,000 kilometres per hour, and missile shards from exploded ASATs, collectively form ""a ticking time bomb"" imperilling human spaceflight and the satellite constellations that ring the planet, says Darren McKnight, Senior Technical Fellow at the world-leading orbital mapping firm LeoLabs.

Dr. McKnight, one of the planet's foremost spacecraft trackers, told me in an interview he is set to sketch out urgent solutions to these escalating dangers at the upcoming meeting of the International Astronautical Congress, which opens next week in Milan. Vanguard space scholars around the world, like McKnight, flock to the yearly gathering of the IAC to map out strategies to safeguard the future for the entire spaceflight sector.

The author of a remarkable series of studies on space debris and its potential to trigger catastrophic collisions, McKnight heads the science team at the Silicon Valley-based LeoLabs, which operates a global web of phased array radars that scan low Earth orbit (LEO) while charting more than 20,000 objects in flight - from abandoned rockets to the clouds of ASAT shrapnel that circumnavigate the globe.

LeoLabs combines cutting-edge radar imagery with predictive AI tools to model imminent orbiting threats, and notifies satellite operators and other space players of high-probability smash-ups waiting in the wings.

The outfit's founder and Chief Operating Officer, Dan Ceperley, issued an ominous oracle on LeoLab's website, warning of the ""inevitability of a disaster in low Earth orbit"" due to clouds of missile shards and clusters of derelict rockets that are spinning around the globe.

He says while LeoLabs tracks tens of thousands of space objects that measure at least 10 centimeters, it is so far technically unable to map countless smaller fragments, resulting from earlier explosions, that have spread out across the orbital plane that the International Space Station flies through.

With this proliferation of rogue debris, he says,""This grim reality means that collisions are not a question of if but when.""

""Potential disasters in LEO,"" Dr. Ceperley predicts, range from an astronaut being blasted by ""lethal, small debris"" to an ""operational payload attacked by an adversary.""

His ""Guide To Disasters In Low Earth Orbit"" cautions that minuscule shards in orbit - measuring less than one centimeter - could be deadly to aeronauts spacewalking outside the International Space Station or floating outside their space capsules.

""Any size fragment above a few millimeters is likely lethal to astronauts,"" says Ceperley, who holds a doctorate in engineering from the University of California, Berkeley.

The world caught a glimpse of this peril when a tiny chip of shrapnel ripped a 5 mm hole in the robotic Canadarm2 positioned outside the ISS. ""Put simply,"" he says, ""what we can't see has the potential to kill us.""

Yet Darren McKnight says the jettisoned rocket stages that stalk the higher reaches of low Earth orbit might present the greatest threats to future space missions - both human and robotic.

At the height of the first Space Race and Cold War I, he says, the twin superpowers routinely cast off their spent upper stages in orbit, and never forged an agreement on dismantling this space obstacle course.

Like specters from the past haunting the modern celestial world, two of these colossal rocket bodies - one Soviet and one American - came within 500 meters of crashing into each other in June of 2022, even as Moscow and Washington sparred 800 kilometers below over Russia's invasion of democratic Ukraine.

The clash would have been cataclysmic, McKnight says, spewing debris ""over many hundreds of kilometers"" and creating deathly daggers of shrapnel that would ""linger for centuries,"" posing a risk to space capsules and satellites for generations.

The Kremlin-lofted Zenit rocket involved in the narrowly avoided crash, he adds, was just one of 18 identical phantom Russian spacecraft that still plague the high-risk graveyard that whirls around the planet.

All 18 have been placed on a space Most Wanted List, part of ""the top 50 objects"" that LeoLabs says should be captured and removed from LEO.

The space superpowers' rogue rockets present such an overwhelming threat to human exploration just above the Earth's atmosphere that all the world's space agencies should begin acting now to remove these hazards, says Ian Christensen, a senior director at the Washington-based Secure World Foundation. The Foundation is a vanguard think tank that aims to secure peace across the super-terrestrial sphere by uniting with scholars, statesmen and spacecraft operators across the continents to reach that goal.

Christensen, who teamed up with LeoLabs' McKnight to help stage a space summit in New Zealand earlier this year focused on ultimately ridding orbit of spectral spacecraft, told me in an interview that many space scholars have concluded that perhaps ""only a major debris-generating collision would stimulate true international resolve and commitment for debris remediation missions.""

""The biggest diplomatic challenge,"" he adds, ""is convincing the three major spacefaring countries (the United States, Russia, and China), who are responsible for 90% of the risk, to begin remediating their own large debris objects,"" especially the deserted rockets that crisscross orbital zones 800-1000 kilometers above the globe.

A onetime researcher at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, Christensen says space agencies in the UK, Japan and Europe that are spearheading precursor missions to active debris removal flights are far ahead of the space superpowers that have cast away their spacecraft in the heavens.

In a new study that he co-authored with McKnight, to be presented at the International Astronautical Congress, Christensen says unleashing the potential of the unfolding Space Race II will depend on a collective, global drive to clear the high-traffic orbital zones of the detritus of Space Race I.

A massive barricade blocking that goal, he says, is that there is now ""no economic incentive to remove debris [and] no economic incentive to really avoid creating debris.""

But that might be about to see a sea change, he predicts: ""With the space economy forecast to grow to over $1 trillion by 2040, ADR [Active Debris Removal missions] should in theory be affordable.""

Both Christensen and McKnight have lauded the introduction in the United States Senate of the ORBITS Act, which aims ""To establish a demonstration program for the active remediation of orbital debris,"" and would provide an initial fund of $150,000,000 to conduct tech demos on deorbiting the most dangerous space objects.

The bill has never been voted on in the House of Representatives, yet McKnight told me LeoLabs is urging its passage, while pressing the White House to back the legislation.

Meanwhile, McKnight says he has joined forces with space scholars around the world to craft a cluster of cutting-edge studies to be unveiled at the Milan IAC convention.

The most fascinating experiment, jointly conducted by McKnight, two astronomers at the University of Bern, and scientists at MAXAR, which operates a fleet of advanced observation satellites, focused on capturing images of five massive rocket stages and their flightpaths through orbit.

Each partner in the experiment gathered incredible imagery of the rockets, in part to determine each spacecraft's ""tumble rate"" and suitability to be captured by a future space tug and deorbited. MAXAR's photographs of one candidate spacecraft are super-high-resolution, and could enable the team to sculpt a precise digital twin of the rocket to simulate a future capture mission.

Their advances in precisely charting and modeling these abandoned spacecraft ""could be very useful for operationalizing ADR [deorbiting missions] soon,"" the American and Swiss researchers say.

Meanwhile, Jeffrey Manber, one of the NewSpace sector's leading tech visionaries, says he's perfecting futuristic blueprints to recover cast-off rockets and save them from being crashed into the Antarctic seas.

Manber, President of International and Space Stations at Voyager Space, which is designing Starlab, the most technologically advanced space station set to be launched before the ISS is decommissioned six years from now, told me he aims to begin converting these rescued rockets into station modules across the 2030s.

With breakthroughs in developing orbital transfer vehicles and space robotics, he says, Voyager could begin sending out droid-piloted recovery teams to capture these ejected spacecraft and transform them into orbital habitats and science labs within the next decade.

Voyager has already received $217 million from NASA under a Space Act Agreement to develop an independent orbital outpost, but he says there will actually be a series of Starlab stations in times ahead. Starlab 3, he adds, could become the first floating factory run by robots, which will redesign spent stages into space stations ""for low Earth orbit and around the Moon."""
What To Know About Kamala Harris' Economic Agenda As She Claims Congress Will Pay For It,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/07/what-to-know-about-kamala-harris-economic-agenda-as-she-claims-congress-will-pay-for-it/,2024-10-08T01:20:44Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris defended her economic plan in an interview with ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, predicting Congress will go along with paying for her agenda, as the nominee has already called for an ""opportunity economy"" focused on the middle class and released plans that include lowering grocery and prescription drug prices and addressing the housing crisis.

Harris was asked about how she'd pay for her economic plan in her ""60 Minutes"" interview on Monday, with correspondent Bill Whitaker noting that while she wants to make the richest Americans pay more taxes, ""We're dealing with the real world here."" Harris expressed optimism that Congress will be willing to pass her economic agenda, arguing, ""When you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about, 'cause their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about."" The vice president disagreed with Whitaker saying Congress ""has shown no inclination"" to back her economic plans, saying she knows ""the limitations of government"" and claiming, ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

$3.5 trillion. That's how much Harris' economic plan would increase the federal deficit by through 2035, according to an estimate released Monday by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget -- still far smaller than the $7.5 trillion Trump's plan would cost. The organization noted its estimate is subject to a ""wide range of uncertainty,"" and actual figures could range anywhere from not having any impact on the deficit to costing $8.1 trillion at most.

""I am a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets,"" Harris declared at a September event hosted by the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, pushing back against her opponent Trump's attacks classifying Harris as a ""communist.""

Harris told CNN host Dana Bash in an August interview that her priority on ""Day One"" as president would be to start implementing her economic agenda. The vice president said one of her ""highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class,"" arguing that while she believes the Biden administration has done ""good work"" on the economy, ""there's more to do.""

Harris' economic policy agenda is largely in line with Biden's economic platform, with some tweaks to emphasize causes that are more important to her, like the child tax credit. ""Same values, different vision,"" a Harris aide told The Guardian. ""She's not moving far away from him on substance, she will highlight the ones that matter most to her."" The initial plans from Harris' campaign also suggest the vice president plans to be more aggressive in her policy approaches than Biden, however, as polls have suggested voters hold dim views of how the president has handled the economy. While Biden has also opposed price gouging, Harris' proposal to enable the FTC and U.S. attorneys to go after companies that hike up prices goes beyond what the president has proposed, Politico notes, and her proposed $40 million investment in the housing crisis is double the amount the Biden administration spent.

Harris' economic agenda so far hasn't gone fully in depth about her proposals, which The New York Times reports is by design. The Times reported before Harris unveiled her agenda that the Harris campaign has adopted a ""strategic vagueness"" for her economic proposals, believing that being more of a ""blank slate"" will help ward off attacks and attract more support from business groups.

Trump's economic agenda is largely focused on raising tariffs on imported goods, which Harris has said she opposes. The ex-president has also called for cutting taxes and regulations in hopes of lowering inflation, including lowering the corporate tax rate, and has encouraged increasing oil production in order to lower energy prices. In addition to his ""no tax on tips"" proposal that Harris has also endorsed, Trump has called for ending taxes on Social Security benefits, which Harris has not yet responded to. Experts believe the ex-president's proposal could speed up Social Security and Medicare becoming insolvent, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projecting exempting taxes on benefits would result in Social Security and Medicare receiving $1.6 trillion less in revenue between 2026 and 2035. The Trump campaign opposed reports of Harris' economic proposals in September, with spokesperson Steven Cheung saying in a statement, ""Kamala Harris can't hide from her disastrous record of skyrocketing inflation ... Americans are struggling under the Biden-Harris economy, and now she wants to gaslight them into believing her bald-faced lies.""

41%. That's the share of voters who trust Harris more to handle the economy, according to an Associated Press/NORC poll conducted Sept. 12-16, versus 43% who trust Trump more. While Trump still maintains a narrow lead, recent polling has broadly shown voters are warming up to Harris on the economy, with polls on who voters prefer on the issue going from being strongly in Trump's favor to more of a toss up. A Washington Post analysis of five recent polls found that while Trump still leads on the economy by an average of six points, that's narrowed from a 12-point lead that the ex-president held against Biden before the president dropped out of the race.

Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in July after Biden stepped down suddenly from the presidential race, following weeks of pressure over mounting concerns about his mental fitness. While the vice president has quickly garnered Democrats' support and risen in the polls, Harris released few concrete policy proposals in the first few weeks of her campaign -- drawing some criticism as a result. The vice president has made releasing a platform on economic proposals her first priority, delivering a speech earlier in August laying out her economic platform that marked the most substantive remarks she had given on policy so far. Her focus on the economy comes as polling has repeatedly shown it's the most important issue to voters in this election cycle, with the vice president hoping to attract support amid low approval ratings for Biden's handling of the economy. Harris' August 16 speech also came days after news that inflation fell in July to its lowest point in more than three years, with federal data showing inflation at 2.9% in July, the first time it's been below 3% since March 2021."
Trump-supporting billionaires are enabling his white supremacist rantings,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-backing-billionaires-enabling-white-supremacy-rcna174186,2024-10-08T00:54:52Z,"Some of Trump's wealthiest backers say they like his economic policies, so they keep quiet about his racism and xenophobia.

According to polls, the top issue in this year's presidential race is inflation/the economy. But at Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, last week, there was just about no applause when he stated, ""We will end inflation and make America affordable again. We're going to get the prices down."" When did his audience explode with energy? When Trump gave them lines targeting immigrants, like ""On day one of my new administration, the invasion ends and the deportations begin. We get them out."" And, speaking of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, ""Do you trust her to stop the invasion?"" In response, the crowd loudly chanted, ""We need Trump! We need Trump!""

Regardless of what the polls say the top issue is, Trump knows that his rallygoers get most excited when he gives voice to white supremacy. Two weeks ago, at another rally in Pennsylvania, Trump claimed Black migrants were destroying the character of Springfield, Ohio, and then declared, ""You have to get them the hell out. You have to get them out!"" In response, the crowd delivered a bone-chilling chant: ""Send them back! Send them back!""

Over the weekend, Trump told Wisconsin voters that he ""will liberate Wisconsin and our entire nation from this mass migration invasion of murderers, child predators, drug dealers, gang members and thugs."" The facts don't back up Trump's claims of a migrant crime wave. (As Frank Figliuzzi noted in an MSNBC column Sunday, the feds just made a huge bust of a white supremacist gang trafficking in fentanyl.) But Trump doesn't care about facts. He cares about scaring his predominantly white base and then persuading it to see him as the guardian of white America.

We know exactly which immigrants Trump is talking about given his long history of demonizing Latino immigrants and the comments he made when he was president, when he referred to Black nations such as Haiti as ""shithole countries."" His supporters know that when Trump promises ""mass deportation"" -- one of the themes of this year's Republican National Convention -- he means Black and brown people.

Everyone understands what Trump is about. But for too long there has been a tendency to excuse Trump's wealthy supporters -- like Elon Musk, who appeared at Trump's rally on Saturday -- as being on the Trump train only for the tax cuts or other financial gain -- as Trump has explicitly promised them at big-ticket fundraisers. However, these wealthy and often well-educated people see the same headlines we do. They should understand that the most visible part of Trump's campaign is racism, and it's long past time they are called out for enabling Trump's racist agenda.

As Forbes magazine detailed in its article on Trump's top billionaires, some are outspoken, while some support Trump for unspecified reasons.

Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who posted after Jan. 6 attack that Trump should ""resign and apologize to all Americans,"" changed his tune in July when he announced he would endorse Trump. At the time Ackman wrote on social media, ""We are in the midst of a perilous moment for our democracy."" (Seeing Trump, who is facing criminal charges for attempting a coup and called for the ""termination"" of the Constitution, as a guardian of democracy is laughable.)

New York Jets owner Robert ""Woody"" Johnson said this year on Fox News that he is backing Trump again because ""Americans remember how good it was or how much better it was on the border and inflation and gas prices and grocery prices, all that, during the Trump administration, and they want to get back there."" The Winklevoss twins, famously depicted in the film ""The Social Network,"" about the founding of Facebook, donated more than $1 million each to support Trump, citing Trump's ""Pro-Bitcoin Pro-Crypto Pro-Business"" position.

But every one of these billionaires is telling us that in exchange for the policy goals they want, they are on board with or at least comfortable with Trump's bigotry. After all, if racism were a deal-breaker for them, would they still be funding his 2024 campaign?

Others, like Musk, though, appear to be more openly on board with Trump's extremist agenda. Musk has peddled the same types of bigoted attacks Trump has about Black migrants in Ohio, demonized DEI programs while suggesting white people are inherently smarter than Black people. And Ackman has been vocally critical of DEI programs with posts on X such as ""DEI is inherently a racist and illegal movement in its implementation even if it purports to work on behalf of the so-called oppressed.""

Trump has become the head cheerleader for white victimhood and the defender of symbols of white power. This explains why on Friday he told supporters at an event in North Carolina he would rename the local military base to again honor the slave-owning Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg, who, as part of the Confederacy, fought to preserve chattel slavery.

""Should we change the name Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg?!"" Trump asked, and the crowd exploded with cheers. (The name of that base, like others that honored Confederates, was changed in 2020 when Congress overrode Trump's veto of the bill.) Trump vowed that if wins, he is ""doing it."" This syncs up perfectly with Trump's defense of monuments honoring white supremacy as ""beautiful"" when he was president.

Those who claim that they're supporting Trump for his promises of tax cuts or deregulation don't get a pass when he's using such racist language and promising to carry out racist policies. If a candidate campaigning on white supremacy is elected to the presidency again, they won't be able to evade accountability with the claim that that's not why they supported him.

""I think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country,"" Trump told Time magazine in April. He is reportedly planning a second-term overhaul of anti-discrimination law that his allies say would ""dramatically change the government's interpretation of Civil Rights-era laws to focus on 'anti-white racism' rather than discrimination against people of color."" And as the American Civil Liberties Union has recently warned -- citing the mandates of Project 2025 -- if Trump wins there will be a dismantling of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs because he and his supporters have characterized them as ""anti-white racism."" Indeed, 84% of his supporters are worried about ""anti-white"" discrimination.

Trump isn't hiding his bigotry. In fact, it's the cornerstone of his campaign. And if he's returned to office, then everybody who helped him get there is responsible: those who voted for him because of the white supremacy and those who say they had other reasons but didn't treat the white supremacy as disqualifying."
Update On Interest Rates: Is The Federal Reserve Shooting Blanks?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2024/10/07/update-on-interest-rates-is-the-federal-reserve-shooting-blanks/,2024-10-08T00:18:28Z,"The Federal Funds Rate (FFR), set by the Federal Reserve - the interest rate that everyone obsesses over - is a strange creature. It is not what it may seem, or what many people assume it to be.

The FFR is really more like a polite suggestion to banks which may or may not decide to go along. The suggestion applies only to a very narrow category of loans that may or may not happen, and which, if they do happen, involve transfers of funds that remain entirely within the closed system of reserve accounts deep inside the Fed itself. The motivation for these transactions is generally regulatory rather than economic. They are designed to ensure compliance with the Fed's reserve requirements. The FFR does not apply to any real loans to businesses or consumers.

Nevertheless, this peculiar inside game involving the manipulation of an ultra-short-term target does seem to drive changes in the broad interest rate regime that regulates the flow of credit in the real economy. The FFR typically appears to push economically important long-term interest rates to sync up, directionally. Over the last 5 years, the yields on 10 year Treasury bonds moved in lockstep with Federal Reserve interest rate targets. The correlation was 92%. The same was true for rates on 30 year fixed-rate mortgages, which showed a correlation of 94% with the FFR.

This might suggest that the Federal Reserve does indeed wield a powerful and precise instrument for influencing important long term rates - the foundational myth upon which the Fed's credibility rests. In the previous column, the hollowness of this myth was detailed. The Fed's ability to influence the real economy has been grossly oversold. Instead, we have a kind of confidence game where the Fed's power is a matter of faith - as long as we believe in it, the illusion will retain its power.

Until recently that belief has been strong. It has caused the syncing process to extend to the stock market itself. The market has shown extreme sensitivity to Fed announcements, possible announcements, redacted minutes, the phraseology of the leadership in various press encounters - resulting in a pronounced clustering of stock returns around the days when the Federal Open Market Committee meets.

This is extraordinary. There are only eight regularly scheduled FOMC meetings a year. If those eight days are removed, the gains of the S&P 500 on the other 347 days of the year are severely diminished.

[Note that this effect only appeared in the Greenspan years, where - arguably -- an important shift in Fed communications policies emerged, aimed more explicitly at influencing the financial markets. Of course, this was never part of the Fed's mandate, and there are many who view this innovative new mission with skepticism.]

Is this healthy? Is it sustainable? And what happens if Faith at some point falters? These are weighty questions. And at the moment, a smidgen of doubt may be emerging, following the recent long-awaited cut in the FFR target.

On September 16, Jerome Powell announced a 50 basis point reduction in the Fed Funds target rate, as described in a previous column. It was the first cut in more than four years. It was seen as an ""emphatic"" trend reversal, and the signal of a shift to monetary easing that will see interest rates begin to drop across the board, presumably providing a stimulant to a softening economy.

But this time the markets didn't follow the Fed's ""suggestion."" Real interest rates in the real economy rose, rapidly and substantially. The yields on the 10-year Treasury bond climbed 40 basis points, closing above the significant 4% mark today (October 7).

Interest rates on 30-year Fixed mortgages were up 58 basis points (as of October 4).

Consider the disconnect.

The Federal Reserve dropped its target rate by 50 bps, and yet market-based benchmark rates increased by more or less the same amount. The ""spread"" between the policy rate and the market rate over this three-week period widened by a full percentage point. Spread across the $25 trillion U.S. economy, and the $46 trillion bond market, that is a huge discrepancy.

There is a lesson here. The Fed's power to move the credit market is not automatic, as many people assume. Yes, it is likely that in time the market rates will begun to track downward. But the truth may have blinked through the illusion here. Is this causation, or just correlation? The Federal Reserve and the financial markets may both reach a similar conclusion, but that does not validate the efficacy of the Fed's policy moves. Certainly for the moment what is in display is the independence of the markets in declining to immediately accept the new easing regime.

This is not actually that unusual. Over the last year the correlation of the Treasury bond yields with the FFR was just 34% (a far cry from the 5-year averages). Since the FFR was fixed at 5.25% over that period, this means that the Treasury yields were bouncing around quite a bit, reflecting the market's changing views on the probability and importance of various future events (recessions, soft landings, Fed policy changes) - rather than chaining themselves to the Fed target.

And in the year before that (Oct 2022-Oct 2023), as the Fed was cranking up the target rate, correlations between the FFR and both the 10-year Treasury yield and the 30-year mortgage rates were lower still, around 20% - which means that the relationship was quite weak indeed.

A full percentage point of ""adverse"" reaction from the financial markets against the Fed's suggestion is, well, at least a little bit shocking. This is one more chink in the Fed's armor, even if the rates do eventually converge. It is starting to seem like the Fed's chief asset -- its credibility - may be at greater risk than it has been. Even the sober citizens who edit the Washington Post are worried. ""The Federal Reserve's greatest resource is its credibility. People have to believe..."" If belief falters, ""the central bank won't survive."" True, the Post's concern here was focused on questions about personal transactions by Fed officials, but the modes of impairment that can threaten the public's faith in the institution are multifarious. Public confidence in the Federal Reserve today is at or near an all-time low, and these small signals of the market's disdain for the Fed's intentions should not be discounted."
Reporter's Notebook: All about the politics of disaster relief,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/politics-disaster-relief,2024-10-07T23:16:37Z,"Fox News' Chad Pergram reports on the politics of disaster relief as FEMA pushes back on the 'dangerous' criticism of their Hurricane Helene response.

Republicans are excoriating the Biden/Harris administration for how it responded to Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, Tennessee and other parts of the South. This is now about to be a double whammy as Hurricane Milton bears down on Florida.

It unfolds amid a tight presidential election. So the disaster response is now infused with politics in swing states like North Carolina and Georgia. There is also a competitive but not top-tier Senate race in Florida.

Storms can disrupt the typical electorate. The usual people who vote might not make it to the polls. It's hard to care about voting if you're low on food, lack electricity and can't even make it out of the holler in western North Carolina because Helene wrecked the road.

'IMMEDIATELY RECONVENE': SCOTT URGES SCHUMER TO RECALL SENATE AMID HELENE'S DEVASTATION

Pray tell, where should you vote in Tampa or Sarasota if your basement is swamped by Milton - after getting drenched when Helene spun through a few weeks ago? You were going to vote at the school down the street. But now it lacks power. You're now living at your sister's house inland. But you're not registered to vote there ...

You see what we're getting at.

Republicans are hammering the Biden/Harris administration for its response to the storm.

""It's like the DMV at industrial scale,"" said Republican vice presidential nominee and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, on Fox. ""It is incompetence of the highest order.""

""At the federal level, this has been a massive failure,"" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. ""When you talk to the people who are directly affected, they will tell you that this has been an abject failure. FEMA has lost sight of its core mission. The administration has not shown that they were prepared for this eventuality in this terrible disaster.""

""Kamala Harris has left them stranded. This is the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we've ever seen. Probably worse than Katrina. And that's hard to beat, right?"" asked former President Trump.

Storm responses are challenging. Hurricane Andrew was a powerful Category 5 storm that swept through Florida in August 1992. Former President George H.W. Bush's tepid response to Andrew slashed his support in Florida. ""Bush 41"" wound up narrowly winning Florida, besting former President Clinton by less than 2%. Bush won Florida by 22 points four years earlier. Moreover, the response to Hurricane Andrew raised questions about the competence of the administration weeks before the election. It's believed that cost Bush a few points nationwide.

When Clinton took office, he immediately beefed up FEMA to prepare and respond to other natural disasters.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

So, part of this tactic is the natural extension of Republicans to undercut the Biden/Harris administration at nearly every turn. This is another component of the GOP narrative that the administration can't handle the economy. Can't handle foreign policy. Can't handle the border.

Did someone say the border?

""We give $20 billion a year to FEMA. And unfortunately, they have drained everything dry,"" said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., on Fox Business. ""We spent $200 billion in Ukraine. We spent $220-$500 a month on our illegal aliens.""

This is where things get tricky.

FEMA is under the aegis of the Department of Homeland Security. DHS runs a program that sends money to cities besieged by the illegal migrant crisis. Some of the money goes for food and shelter for those in the country illegally. But it also helps those towns cope by addressing strains on their medical systems and other services.

Money for disaster recovery and migrant assistance constitute two separate line items in the DHS budget. Congress approved money for both these programs. In fact, some Republicans would prefer to spend more to help their communities grapple with an infusion of illegal immigration.

SPEAKER JOHNSON ADDRESSES CLAIMS FEMA DIVERTED FUNDS TO IMMIGRATION EFFORTS: 'AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTED'

About $640 million currently goes to assist these towns beset by an influx of illegal migrants. But some lawmakers would like that to spike to as much as $3 billion next year.

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., introduced legislation to halt the migrant assistance program. And Johnson blurred the line between FEMA disaster aid and migrants and the border.

""FEMA should be involved and the Federal Emergency Management Association. Their mission is to help people in times like this of natural disaster. Not to be engaged in using any pool of funding from any account for resettling illegal aliens who have come across the border,"" said Johnson on Fox.

Other Republicans believe this may be an opportunity to recalibrate spending overall. Keep in mind that many Republicans look askance at foreign aid to Ukraine.

""As an elected official, it's our responsibility to put Americans first. Whether you're in Florida, in my district or you're anywhere in the union, I think that it's important for us to prioritize Americans and restore hope and let them know they're not forgotten,"" said Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., on Fox.

But some Republicans compared issues with FEMA's response to how the administration addresses other subjects.

KJP SLAMMED AFTER HURRICANE HELENE OVER MIXED MESSAGES ON WHETHER FEMA RESOURCES USED FOR MIGRANTS

""This administration seems to have no problem finding money when they want to spend it on their priorities. When they need hundreds of billions of dollars to pay off student loans for graduate students and gender studies programs, they somehow find it. When it's trying to get helicopters to deliver food and water and cellular service and lifesaving medicine into these mountain valleys, they somehow can't seem to find the money,"" declared Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., on NBC.

FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell castigated Republicans for suggesting FEMA was focused on other issues rather than the storms.

""It's frankly ridiculous and just plain false. This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people,"" said Criswell on ABC.

Before leaving Washington, Congress green-lighted $20 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) as part of the interim spending plan to avoid a government shutdown. But Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas muddled matters when he said FEMA had enough funds to respond to Helene for ""immediate needs"" but not enough to get through ""the season.""

The ""season"" to which Mayorkas refers is the annual hurricane ""season."" It stretches through Nov. 30. Note that Mayorkas made this remark when there was the potential for another storm, but Milton hadn't yet formed in the Gulf of Mexico.

Some Republicans pounced on Mayorkas. But after considering the severity of Helene, it will likely draw down the DRF for ""immediate needs."" The key phrase here is ""immediate needs."" Milton will probably do the same. That's why Congress must likely tackle disaster relief in at least two tranches when it returns to session in November. Lawmakers will need to refill the DRF. And the price tags will start to roll in for Helene and Milton. That's to say nothing of outstanding disasters like Hurricane Beryl in Texas, tornadoes in Iowa, a typhoon on Guam and wildfires in Hawaii.

FEMA HAS FUNDS NEEDED FOR 'IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY,' DESPITE MAYORKAS' WARNING

However, Johnson is unwilling to summon lawmakers back to Washington to grapple with disasters.

""You don't just send estimates to the federal government. You send specific needs and requests based upon the actual damages. And that takes some time, especially with storms of this magnitude. So Congress will do its job,"" said Johnson on Fox.

So, lawmakers must first reload the DRF for future immediate needs, then mete out bigger chunks of change for Americans to cope with the impacts of Helene and Milton. The government funding deadline is Dec. 20. It's possible that the latter chunk of funding is folded into spending measures around Christmas.

But as for the politics? The election is fast approaching. The storms could impact voting this fall. And while Helene and Milton will certainly leave a mark meteorologically, they will probably leave a mark electorally, too."

Hemp Advocates Ask Court To Block California Hemp THC Ban,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajherrington/2024/10/07/hemp-advocates-ask-court-to-block-california-hemp-thc-ban/,2024-10-07T21:01:19Z,"A national hemp industry group and businesses including the company founded by weed icons Cheech and Chong last week filed a petition to block California's ban on hemp products with detectable amounts of THC. The petition for a temporary restraining order to block enforcement of the hemp THC ban was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court as part of lawsuit filed last month by the U.S. Hemp Roundtable and hemp consumer goods companies including Cheech and Chong's Global Holdings.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled the emergency regulations from the California Department of Health (CDPH) last month after a hemp products regulations bill failed to gain the approval of state lawmakers earlier this summer. The regulations, which ban consumable hemp products with any detectable amount of delta-9 THC or other intoxicating cannabinoids such as delta-8 THC, went into effect on September 23. The regulations also limit consumable hemp products to five servings per package and require retailers to sell such products only to consumers aged 21 and up.

Hemp advocates immediately balked at the emergency regulations, saying they would threaten the emerging hemp industry and harm patients who use hemp cannabinoid products therapeutically. On September 24 the U.S Hemp Roundtable filed a complaint to block enforcement of the new rules, joined by co-plaintiffs Cheech and Chong's Global Holdings, the company owned by legendary marijuana comedy duo Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong, as well as Juicetiva, Blaze Life, Boldt Runners, Lucky to be Beverage and Sunflora. On Friday, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to block enforcement of the emergency regulations while the case is heard by the court.

""If allowed to remain in effect, the Emergency Regulations will eliminate nearly every ingestible hemp product currently for sale in California, including the vast majority of nonintoxicating products,"" the petition maintains. ""Many small businesses will have to close operations immediately with millions in losses. Relief is thus warranted because the Emergency Regulations are substantially unlawful and have in any event been adopted by drastically unlawful means.""

The petition notes that state regulators have failed to fully implement and enforce hemp regulatory legislation that was passed three years ago. Additionally, the legislature this summer declined to adopt a hemp regulatory bill (AB 2223) favored by Newsom.

""The Department [of Public Health] had nearly three years since 2021 to address the issues in these Emergency Regulations, which were fully known to the Department and the California Legislature,"" the TRO request reads. ""As recently as a few weeks ago, the California Legislature refused to pass AB 2223...which would have enacted similar provisions.""

The court filing maintains that the ban on any detectable amount of THC will cripple the hemp industry. The regulation is at odds with 2018 federal legislation that legalized hemp and hemp products containing no more than 0.3% THC by weight. The rule prohibits many non-intoxicating products, including CBD products popular with many consumers.

""This draconian regulation alone will essentially devastate an emerging industry that consists largely of small business owners,"" the petition argues. ""It's akin to requiring candy to stop containing sugar...starting tomorrow.""

Jonathan Miller, general counsel for the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, said that the plaintiffs in the case would like to see the court approve the temporary restraining and eventually make it permanent.

""We are hopeful that the Court will temporarily block - and then ultimately, permanently enjoin - Governor Newsom's misguided efforts to devastate hemp farmers, business and product consumers in California,"" Miller said in an October 4 statement from the industry group. ""It's high time that the Governor abandon this punitive effort and sit down with all stakeholders to appropriately address his stated mission: to develop a robust regulatory regime that promotes health and safety and keeps hemp products out of the hands of minors.""

""This is not just about California,"" Miller told online cannabis news source Marijuana Moment. ""California is the largest state in our union. It's the fifth-largest economy in the world. It is where the birth of legal cannabis happened in this country, and so it makes this decision ever more important.""

A hearing on the TRO petition is scheduled for Thursday, according to information from the U.S. Hemp Roundtable."
U.S. Equities Surge In Best Election Year Since 1936,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/07/us-equities-surge-in-best-election-year-since-1936/,2024-10-07T20:24:59Z,"As we approach the final stretch of 2024, much of the nation's focus is on the upcoming U.S. presidential election. But while the political landscape remains uncertain, the markets are painting a different picture. September, traditionally a sluggish month for global equities, delivered an unexpected surge.

The S&P 500 gained 2.02%, marking its strongest September since 2013. This brought its year-to-date return to 22.08%, making 2024 the best presidential election year for stocks in almost 90 years (more on that later).

Bitcoin has been another standout performer. Once viewed with skepticism by traditional investors, the digital currency posted a nearly 8% gain last month, bringing its year-to-date growth to an astonishing 51%. With the Federal Reserve adopting a dovish stance, the U.S. dollar has weakened, prompting investors to seek alternative assets like Bitcoin and gold as hedges against inflation and uncertainty.

Election years often bring volatility as markets grapple with the uncertainty surrounding potential changes in leadership, but 2024 has proven to be an outlier. Central bank easing has provided a powerful tailwind, helping to stabilize markets and lift stocks higher, despite lingering concerns over who will occupy the White House next year.

In fact, 2024 is shaping up to be the best presidential election year for stocks in nearly 90 years. By the end of September, the S&P 500 had risen more than 22%, the highest return during an election year since 1936. Investors have embraced the Fed's commitment to looser monetary policy, which has kept market sentiment buoyant despite the political backdrop.

Beneath the surface of these impressive market gains, however, lies a more complex picture of the U.S. economy. It's a tale of two sectors: while services continue to thrive, manufacturing is struggling.

The U.S. services sector -- which accounts for nearly 80% of the country's GDP -- has now expanded for 20 consecutive months. New orders continue to grow, driven by steady consumer demand and a reduction in interest rates, which has made borrowing more affordable for businesses and households alike, according to S&P Global. Despite some moderation from the 14-month high we saw in August, the sector looks strong, providing a foundation for economic stability.

In contrast, the manufacturing sector is showing signs of strain. The end of the third quarter saw manufacturing dip deeper into contraction territory. Slowing demand, both domestically and internationally, has weighed heavily on the sector, and many analysts are pointing to broader economic challenges as the cause. The uncertain outcome of the upcoming election has only added to the unease, as companies hold off on major investments until they have a clearer sense of the country's political direction.

In addition to domestic economic concerns, several external factors threaten to disrupt the positive momentum we've seen in the markets.

Hurricane Helene, for instance, serves as a reminder of the unpredictable risks posed by Mother Nature. The storm caused what could amount to $34 billion in total economic losses, with insured damages expected to exceed $6 billion.

The recent resolution of the dockworker strike at East Coast and Gulf ports -- a potential ""man-made disaster,"" according to President Joe Biden -- is a welcome development, but its impact will likely linger. The strike, which disrupted one of the busiest shipping periods of the year, created a huge backlog of goods waiting to be processed. Major retailers like Walmart, Ikea and Home Depot, which rely heavily on these ports for imported goods, were among the hardest hit.

As operations resume, shipping giants such as Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have warned that freight costs are likely to rise as a result of the delays. While the strike itself has ended (for now), the fallout could affect supply chains well into the fourth quarter, particularly as retailers ramp up for the holiday season.

Despite these challenges, there's still reason for optimism as we head into the holiday season. Adobe is forecasting a record $240.8 billion in online holiday sales, an 8.4% increase over 2023. Electronics and apparel are expected to be the standout categories, driven by deep discounts as retailers aim to move inventory.

As we move into the final quarter of 2024, there's much to be hopeful about. Central bank easing has provided a strong foundation for market growth, and the holiday season promises to deliver robust consumer spending.

At U.S. Global Investors, we believe in taking a long-term view. While the short-term outlook remains favorable, it's essential to stay diversified and prepared for whatever the future may hold. As always, our focus is on helping investors navigate both the opportunities and challenges ahead."
"Markets Are ""On Fire"" Since September Jobs Report. Will They Continue?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2024/10/07/markets-are-on-fire-since-september-jobs-report-will-they-continue/,2024-10-07T20:24:49Z,"On September 6 the jobs report came in weak at 142,000 new jobs. This report was well below expectations, unemployment rose from 4.1% to 4.2% and markets plummeted on the news. Economists proclaimed the beginning of the end with major stock indices falling 2% to 3%. The Vix index, indicating volatility and market nervousness, rose sharply. The outlook among many was bleak and, irrespective of Fed interest cuts on the horizon, many economic ""experts"" began voicing concerns of a recession. Those comments were overblown. The US economy is nowhere near a recession. At least now.

By contrast, on October 4 a new jobs report came out that was red ""hot"". Jobs increased by 254,000, soundly beating expectations, and major market indices soared by 1% to 2%. Since the September 6 dip, major indices have been soaring. The S&P 500 has increased 6.45%, while others such as the QQQ (+8.76%) and the Russell 1000 Growth (+8.43%) have done much better. Leading the pack has been the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR) which came in at 12.99%. (Note: Past performance is no guarantee or guide to future performance).

This performance has continued the strong year-to-date (YTD) results. The table below shows that, thus far, this has been a banner year. YTD the S&P 500 is +21.86%, with the Russell 1000 Growth (IWF) +24.10% and the Nasdaq QQQ +19.51%. The Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR) is continuing its strong year from 2023 (57.41%) with a current YTD performance in 2024 of 38% (Note: past performance is no guide to future performance).

What should investors take from these results? In retrospect, the strong negative response from the September, 6, 2024 negative jobs report was an overreaction on the downside. The economic situation for the US was not nearly as bleak as market pundits expressed. To be fair, neither is the strong jobs report on September 6, 2024 as good as many deem it to be. Many of the 245,000 jobs created in the month of September are from government, social services and healthcare. More importantly, the US workforce is old. Very, very old. 75m baby boomers will be at or past retirement age by the year 2030. As many as 25 to 30m working baby boomers, 1/3 of whom now work past retirement age, (well up from 20 years ago) will be retiring within the next 5-10 years. Further, online estimates suggest 300,000 jobs are being outsourced overseas each year. My data from a Capital IQ search of top public IT firms, suggests it is much, much higher. The US is losing high wage IT jobs to places based primarily in India and Eastern Europe. We are losing low wage bookkeeping and call center jobs to places based primarily in Philippines and Vietnam. Many low wage jobs in the US are also being picked up by illegal immigrants working for cash dollars.

Are these labor issues major concerns for the US economy in the next 5-10 years? Absolutely. The US labor force currently only produces approximately 1m new jobs per year. Losing 5 million jobs over the next year, under normal circumstances would be devastating, let alone, 20m to 30m jobs. The US labor force is currently creating non productive jobs in government and social services. As a country, we may soon find ourselves with less than 1/2 of our adults in the labor market. This means fewer Americans will need to perform the heavy lifting to support the rest of us.

Fortunately, purely by coincidence, AI may save the day. The productive capabilities of AI means that we as a population will need fewer workers to provide the same level of productivity as before. Smart robots will enter the workplace and provide more efficient delivery mechanisms than humans. In an environment with a growing population this displacement of humans would be a problem. The US has the opposite issue. The productive capabilities of AI and robotics will be a game changer for many industries, particularly in IT, Healthcare, Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary. We will also see innovative nuclear energy solutions to power our data centers. These innovative, disruptive, entrepreneurial solutions have the ability to arrive just as our aging population needs it most.

Will AI and robotics benefit all companies? Absolutely not. Just as companies such as Nvidia, Applovin and Arista Networks (among others) have begun reaping benefits associated with AI, their competitors have suffered. A declining labor force does not necessarily imply a dip in the stock market.

We believe that the next few years will continue to widen the gap between winners and losers. The stakes have never been higher. Brick and mortar, bureaucratic stores such as Walmart, Target and Home Depot and Telecommunication companies such as AT&T continue to lose hundreds of thousands of jobs, other entrepreneurial companies will grow their ventures and reap strong rewards. Major change to our labor force is guaranteed within the next 5-10 years. But all is not lost. Far from it. We simply need visionaries at the top to help us lead the way.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please refer to the below disclosures:"
Dow Suffers Worst Day In A Month As Rising Bond Yields A New Wrench For Investors,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/07/dow-suffers-worst-day-in-a-month-as-rising-bond-yields-a-new-wrench-for-investors/,2024-10-07T20:11:19Z,"Stocks tumbled Monday as the market digested new risks complicating the benefits of the much-awaited interest rate cuts on the equity market.

The recent rise in bond yields comes as a relative surprise compared to expectations for the bond market after the Federal Reserve rolled out a big 50 basis-point rate cut Sept. 18. Treasury yields serve as a rough proxy for fixed income investors' expectations for monetary policy, and, considering the consensus view that the Fed will keep bringing interest rates down, climbing government bond yields do not align with that view. The 10-year Treasury yield is often used as the baseline for loans such as mortgages, meaning some borrowing costs are actually higher now than they were prior to the Fed's cut. Bond yields also shot up Friday after the U.S. reported far stronger September job growth than expected. ""The bond market is becoming less skeptical on the soft landing outcome,"" explained Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson in a Monday note to clients.

Though higher bond yields can evoke bad memories for equity investors -- see the 2022 unraveling as the inflation crisis deepened -- it's not necessarily a bad omen for stocks. The 10-year is down a full percentage point over the last year and about 0.4 percentage points over the last six months. And yields are rising because the U.S. economy looks stronger than anticipated, a potential boon for earnings growth, with Wilson noting the increased odds of a soft landing ""should support more cyclical leadership in equities."" Over the weekend, Goldman Sachs strategists led by David Kostin raised their year-end price target for the S&P from 5,600 to 6,000 and its 12-month target from 6,000 to 6,300, indicating 5% and 10% further upside, respectively, citing the ""steady macro outlook.""

""Our job's to be worried about everything,"" Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and an alternate member of the Fed's rate-setting committee, told Forbes last week when asked about how new shocks like higher oil prices may impact the trajectory of monetary policy."
Trump's Tariffs Can't Pay For His Many Promises,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2024/10/07/trumps-tariffs-cant-pay-for-his-many-promises/,2024-10-07T19:54:13Z,"GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump's tariffs would raise a lot of money -- $2.8 trillion over 10 years, according to the Tax Policy Center. But even that would fall far short of paying for all the ambitious ideas he claims it would fund. Indeed, his campaign promises likely would add trillions of dollars to the federal debt.

At various times in the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump has said his tariff revenues would replace the income tax, finance an unspecified child care initiative, create a US sovereign wealth fund, eliminate the federal budget deficit, and even begin to pay down the $28 trillion public debt.

Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has her own list of costly promises that appear to be only partially offset by proposed tax hikes. But Trump's tariff revenue would fall far short of paying for all his promises, though it is impossible to know since they mostly are unspecified.

And Trump would inevitably be caught in the same fiscal trap that so many other policymakers have faced: Once you use revenues to pay for new programs or tax cuts, those funds are no longer available to reduce deficits. More often than not, the result is even higher deficits and debt.

Indeed, The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that Trump's campaign proposals would increase the federal debt by $7.5 trillion over the next decade.

How Much Would Tariffs Raise?

While the former president has pitched many different tariff plans over the course of the campaign, TPC analyzed one version he promotes often, a 10 percent tax on all goods imported into the US and a 60 percent levy on Chinese imports. It would raise about $3.7 trillion in gross tariff revenues over the next decade.

But the tariffs would increase net federal revenues by much less -- about $2.8 trillion. That's because they'd significantly raise prices of imported goods, which would mostly be passed on to consumers. The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates to offset those price increases. But that likely would reduce profits of US corporations and incomes of US workers, lower projected corporate and individual tax revenues, and offset nearly $1 trillion of increased tariff revenue.

How would Trump spend the added revenue?

Could tariffs replace the income tax? Not even close. They'd replace only about 8 percent of the $34 trillion in federal individual income tax revenue the Congressional Budget Office expects the Treasury to collect over the next decade. They'd even fall short of paying the $4 trillion cost of extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Could they fund other tax cuts?. Trump has promised many other tax cuts, including exemptions for tip income, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits, repealing the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent for some companies and 15 percent for others. All of those ideas would cost at least an additional $4 trillion, $1.2 trillion more than the income his tariffs would generate.

Could tariffs pay down the national debt? The public debt currently is about $28 trillion and CBO expects it to rise to $50 trillion by 2034. CBO projects the 2025 deficit will approach $2 trillion. By themselves, Trump's tariffs would lower this year's deficit by about $200 billion, or roughly 10 percent. They'd barely make a dent in the projected debt.

How about financing a sovereign wealth fund? Trump has provided no details on his idea to create a US government investment fund, but has promised it would be the biggest in the world. Currently, that honor belongs to Saudi Arabia, with a fund it values at about $925 billion. Trump could create a comparable US investment fund with about one-third of his tariff revenue. But that would leave less than $2 trillion for all his other initiatives.

Could tariffs fund child care? Trump has not specified what child-related programs he supports. But his running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) has endorsed a $5,000 Child Tax Credit (CTC) for all parents, regardless of income, which could pay for services such as child care. While Trump has not publicly commented on the plan, it is at least a hint of what his administration could do.

A Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calculator estimates a Vance-like credit would cost roughly $2.7 trillion over a decade, almost exactly what Trump's tariffs would raise. But that would leave almost nothing for his other initiatives.

Of course, Trump could try to raise more money with even higher tariff rates. But at some point, tariff-driven price increases will shrink demand for imports so much that tariff revenues would no longer offset the decline in corporate and individual income taxes caused by a slowing US economy.

Trump's use of tariff revenue to finance his many ambitious promises feels a bit like the stage magician who appears to be pulling countless rabbits out of a top hat. He's not the first politician to try that trick. But never forget, it is all an illusion."
"A Blockbuster Jobs Report Shifts The Narrative Amid Labor Disputes, Hurricane Destruction And A Close Election",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenamcgregor/2024/10/07/a-blockbuster-jobs-report-shifts-the-narrative-amid-labor-disputes-and-a-close-election/,2024-10-07T19:45:21Z,"This week's Future of Work Summit examines the fallout from Amazon'a RTO push, the challenges of leading through disaster and a conversation about AI and work with Handshake's Valerie Capers Workman.

This is the published version of Forbes' Future of Work newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief human resources officers and other talent managers on disruptive technologies, managing the workforce and trends in the remote work debate. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Monday!

ctober is here, and the sprint to the end of the year is fraught with distractions, disasters and disengagement that will be challenging for anyone managing workplaces and teams. A tight, polarizing election has workers unsettled and anxious -- and could drive more conflict in the office. An escalating crisis in the Middle East brings increasing tensions over geopolitical issues, uncertainty about planning ahead and more concerns for employees with family in the region.

Add the devastation of a massive hurricane across the Southeast, and it's been an unparalleled season of disruption for many leaders and workplaces. Hurricane Helene has disrupted operations at a quartz mine in western North Carolina, washing out roads and cutting power to an area critical to semiconductor manufacturing. Some employers across the region are working hard to help workers struggling without power, water or even homes -- while others in Tennessee face inquiries from the state Bureau of Investigation over allegations that they ignored warnings about Helene and required employees to report to work, leading to deaths and missing workers. Asheville, which had prospered with an influx of remote workers, entrepreneurs and new business owners, now faces an unprecedented challenge to rebuild.

Amid all the chaos is the human cost -- and a humanitarian crisis. Disaster relief is inherently hard to execute well, and the people leading it will need support. If you want to help, my colleague Kelly Phillips Erb has a rundown over what you need to know about tax deductible donations and where to donate. Read on for more in today's newsletter about how Amazon's RTO push remains in the headlines, Friday's blockbuster jobs report and an interview with Handshake's chief talent engagement officer about AI and jobs.

September job growth shattered economists' predictions, as U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs last month, according to nonfarm payrolls data released Friday by the Labor Department. It was the biggest month for jobs growth since March, sprinting past average economist estimates of 150,000 and prompting the unemployment rate to dip to 4.1%, compared to projections of 4.2%, where it stood in August. Investors cheered the news with big stock gains Friday.

Striking dockworkers and port employers reached a tentative agreement Thursday, ending a strike that began earlier in the week and lifting concerns over the potential impact to the U.S. economy. The tentative agreement includes a 62% wage increase over six years, according to the Wall Street Journal, and will temporarily relieve Democrats fearful of the strike's impact on the November election. The big issue still up for negotiation? Automation, as workers remain concerned about the potential for layoffs and fewer jobs for humans in the future.

The fallout over Amazon's decision to require full-time office work has remained in the headlines even several weeks after the tech giant made the announcement. Dell has since mandated that salespeople come back to the office five days a week, while McKinsey is also reportedly asking staff to be onsite more often. Will the trend continue? Contributor Ann Kowal Smith sees Amazon's move as the ""canary in the coal mine for a dangerous problem,"" noting ""the relationship between employers and employees has become one based on power, not mutual respect and collaboration."" Meanwhile, contributor Ryan Anderson suggests the continued disappointment leaders feel in one-size-fits-all hybrid policies could mean a different approach would be better for workplace flexibility.

The most sweeping attempt so far to regulate artificial intelligence, a California bill that could have set a precedent for other laws, was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom last week. ""I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public,"" Newsom said, according to the New York Times. If the California bill had been signed into law, writes Forbes contributor Owen Tedford, it would have predominantly focused on improving AI safety, with businesses that create large AI models required to perform safety tests and publicly disclose how they'd prevent the models from being manipulated. Tedford examines what could come next, suggesting the bill could be changed and reintroduced in future sessions.

Forbes caught up with Valerie Capers Workman, chief talent engagement officer at student careers platform Handshake, about how AI is shifting jobs as we know them, a recent book she published and addressing the gender divide in AI. Excerpts from our conversation have been edited for length and clarity.

How is AI changing jobs?

I'm going to use my son as an example. He entered school in 2018-2019, he was going to be a data scientist. Data science was the career: You're going to get a job the second you hit junior year, you're going to be flooded with internships and you're going to be employed. Enter A.I. The ability of A.I. to take on so much of the preliminary data science work [means] you need to be a masters or PhD in data science to skip over what A.I. can do. [He realized] 'I need to go back to school.' He is now applying to universities for artificial intelligence master's degrees. He loves having the skill set, but A.I. enables more companies to do what he was doing.

What message did you want to share in your book?

The most important concept that I was raising is that the requirement to be superhuman; the requirements of EQ are more important in the age of AI than all the pundits are saying. My point is, yes, you can get an entry level job, but you're not moving up without the EQ, without the combination of AI plus liberal arts skills, the critical thinking skills, you're going to stay right there. The ability to move and progress in your career? You're going to have to do both.

[""AI skills""] are the ability to ask great questions and understand whether or not you've got a great answer and then utilize that answer to do the work you're doing. The ability to ask great questions? That requires critical thinking skills, language skills, reading comprehension skills, historical context, ethical understanding and understanding of biases. Generative AI is what is going to differentiate the general workforce from the executive workforce track, if you will. I think it was a COO from BlackRock who said [they want] to hire finance or tech employees who have liberal arts or history majors? That's what I'm talking about.

If you're hiring, how do you assess that AI skill?

If I'm interviewing someone on my team, I'd ask them: 'I have this issue. Give me an AI prompt that will help me. Give me a prompt that you would use to help me finish this project for me in five days.'

Are you pulling on the right threads to understand what types of questions you need to ask? If I find someone who knows how to frame a question, I can train you how to do that better. I can't train you how to think.

Do companies have a responsibility to retrain their people who work in fields where jobs will be replaced, such as customer service?

That's a great societal question.

What is the responsibility of the employer to reskill its current workforce if a set of roles can now be done by AI? I like to put it this way: The companies that understand how to repurpose their workforce for the higher order skills that need to be done by humans -- that can't be done by A.I. -- are the companies that are going to win.

We're hearing more about how women are not developing the AI skills at the same pace and could get left behind. What can be done to help with this?

In higher education, they need to have required courses, period. Just required. It cannot be optional because women are not taking the AI courses at the same rate as their male counterparts. It can't be optional. ... The societal issues that caused them to run away from a phrase like prompt engineering go all the way back to when they were in third grade. So, required courses.

Same thing with employers. Training should not be optional. ... You're going to leave people behind who don't think that certain courses apply to them. AI courses apply to everyone. They should be mandatory. You can solve a lot of societal anomalies and inequities just by making the playing field even for everyone without having people required to opt in.

Last week's jobs report was a big one, prompting a stock market rally and causing the odds of another interest rate cut in the coming months to fall.

176,000: How many more jobs than expected the U.S. nonfarm labor force grew by from July to September, according to the Labor Department. September's 254,000 nonfarm payroll additions, the highest total in six months, were 104,000 more than economist forecasts, while the government upwardly revised July and August's payroll growth by 55,000 and 17,000, respectively.

83.8%: Prime-age labor force participation, or people working or looking for work, is near multi-decade highs

""The labor market isn't on the brink of collapse and still has the potential to deliver surprises, however its ability to sustain momentum without further support from the Federal Reserve is not guaranteed."" -- Cory Stahle, economist for Indeed Hiring Lab, in a statement

Cheaper Chevrolet Silverado EVs With More Range For 2025,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2024/10/07/cheaper-chevrolet-silverado-evs-with-more-range-for-2025/,2024-10-07T19:45:12Z,"The third quarter of 2024 was a landmark for General Motors EV sales. After nearly 3 years of struggling to actually build and deliver its new Ultium platform based electric vehicles, the automaker had its best quarter yet. Among the models that are slowly starting to gain some traction in the marketplace is the Chevrolet Silverado EV. For model year 2025, Chevrolet is finally expanding the availability of new trim levels for the electric pickup and building more affordable variants with more range.

Chevrolet started low volume deliveries of the 4WT work truck variant of the Silverado about a year ago and finally launched the first consumer model, the RST in late spring of this year. Unfortunately, those work trucks were only being delivered to fleets and the RST had a price tag of over $96,000. For that price though, it did offer the longest range of any electric truck on the market with 440 miles for the RST and 450 miles for the 4WT.

For 2025, availability is improving and the new LT trim level is finally available with an even lower priced version of the work truck due sometime during the model year starting at $57,095. Range is also improved across the board by as much as 9%. According to Chevrolet spokesman Sean Szymkowski, GM engineers have ""optimized everything."" This includes ""improved motors, magnets, and inverters all contribute to better coast down and overall efficiency gains that improve range.""

The longest range Silverado, the Work Truck with the Max Range battery now goes 492-miles on a charge and the rest of the lineup does great as well:

Annoyingly, GM doesn't like to talk about the actual capacity of its EV batteries. For the Silverado, they are simply referred to as standard, extended and max range. However, it appears that nothing has changed in the battery, so based on the EPA fuel economy data file, the max range pack with 24 modules should have about 209-kWh of usable energy. The max range pack is available in the work truck and RST.

The LT is only available with the extended range pack which is believed to have a 20-module configuration and should have a capacity of around 168-kWh. The work trucks with both of these batteries have longer range estimates, because these trucks have less equipment and weigh several hundred pounds less than the LT or RST.

The standard range work truck won't be available until later in the model year, and doesn't have a range estimate yet. At $57,095 including delivery, the standard range work truck matches the price point of the standard Ford F-150 Lightning Pro which only has a range of 240 miles. If Chevrolet steps down the capacity by another 4 modules to 16 (removing 2 more modules from each of the two layers of the battery, the capacity is likely to be approximately 138-kWh which is still more than 131-kWh in the Lightning's extended battery.

That will probably yield a range of over 300 miles and with the reduced weight of the battery it could hit 340-350. That would be more than even the longest range Lighting, making this lowest cost Silverado a significantly better value. If it hits that 300 mile range, that standard work truck will also be more than $20,000 than the least expensive dual motor Cybertruck that might offer similar performance.

The price of the max range RST does go up by about $1,400 for 2025 but the LT starting at $75,1195 will probably be the sweet spot for most retail customers since it comes in under the $80,000 cap for federal tax credits. These electric trucks certainly still aren't exactly affordable, but when factoring in those credits, the prices start to get a lot closer to the gas trucks while still having enough range that even when towing a big trailer you'll probably hit close to 200 miles between charges. The consumer oriented LT also undercuts the dual motor Cybertruck by about $5,000

Ford certainly has its work cut out for it now that it has delayed its next generation electric truck until 2027. Ram is due to launch its electric truck by the end of the year which should offer similar range to the Chevrolet, but with an as yet unknown price point."
California Law On GenAI Continues To Advance,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2024/10/07/california-law-on-genai-continues-to-advance/,2024-10-07T19:32:28Z,"When it comes to state-by-state efforts to regulate artificial intelligence and related new technologies, there's probably no state more advanced than the state of California.

That's not surprising, given that California is the only U.S. state thus far to enact its own version of the European General Data Protection Rule that gives a broad spectrum of data rights to individual users of software and systems. The California Consumer Privacy Act or CCPA is often cited along with the GDPR in the myriad of instances when people are talking about shielding personal data from abuse.

But California has been pioneering, too, in the way that it addresses rules for AI/ML systems beyond just the use of personal data.

Some of the recent bills that have been passed (or failed to pass) the state house illustrate what California is doing to try to be proactive as the host of Silicon Valley, and the largest state economy in the country.

The Kerfuffle Over SB 1047

Most recently, Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill called SB 1047 that was made to enact guardrails for AI systems that makers would have to put in place.

Ultimately, Newsom suggested that SB 1047 is ""not the best approach to protecting the public from real threats posed by the technology.""

Digging deeper, you can see that prior to Newsom's veto decision, the bill was becoming incredibly controversial, as in a letter sent by California state senator Scott Weiner to people at Y Combinator and Andreessen Horowitz.

In the missive, Weiner contends that these parties had made ""inflammatory"" statements containing ""misinformation."" The senator writes:

""While I always appreciate engagement and constructive feedback on any bill I author, I also ask that those engaging be accurate in their characterization of those bills. Unfortunately, various statements by YC and a16z about SB 1047 are inaccurate, including some highly inflammatory distortions, e.g., that SB 1047 will send model developers to prison for failing to anticipate harms from their AI systems (false), that SB 1047 will effectively ban open source releases (false), and that SB 1047 will cause technology companies and startups to relocate to other states because only developers located in California will be covered (false).""

Later, Weiner called YC's statements on the bill ""irresponsible,"" suggesting that the firm asserted that ""creating a penalty of perjury would mean that AI software developers could go to jail simply for failing to anticipate misuse of their software."" This, he wrote, is ""absolutely untrue"" and ""a scare tactic"" that would have a chilling effect on the industry.

Read the rest of the letter for all of Weiner's arguments on claims by detractors of the bill.

With that kind of discussion in play, it's perhaps not surprising that SB 1047 failed to pass. However, Other California legislation has been put in place, and it will have an effect in policing the use of AI in business.

Data Set Formats For Artificial Intelligence Projects: AB 1013

This legislation, which goes into effect on the first day of 2026. requires systems or software makers to deliver a summary of Information on the data sets that were used for GenAI systems. These include the sources or owners of the data sets, information on purchase or licensing, transparency on processing or modification to data sets, and whether any of the information falls under the CCPA.

Promoting accurate descriptions of systems in this way could be fairly useful in making sure that the use of AI and systems is transparent.

""California's new AI law underscores the importance of AI developers maintaining a data provenance record that traces the lineage of data used to train AI systems and taking steps to be transparent about how they develop AI, including through trust centers on websites,"" writes Arsen Kourinian at Mayer Brown in Los Angeles regarding the legislation. ""Developers should consider adopting technology that automates this process in order to operate at scale. Moreover, companies that integrate their AI offerings with a foundation model should consider the impact of this new law because it could apply to developers that fine-tune or retrain AI systems or services.""

AI in Healthcare: Disclosure to Citizens

This next California law is industry-specific to healthcare. However, it represents that effort to let people know when AI is being used in decisions that affect their lives.

In the Assembly Bill 3030, on artificial intelligence and healthcare services, the creators of the law point out that the Medical Practice Act already establishes regulation of information for medical processes. Further:

""This bill would require a health facility, clinic, physicians, office, or office of a group practice that uses generative artificial intelligence to generate written or verbal, patient communications pertaining to generative patient clinical information as defined to ensure that this communications include both a disclaimer that indicates to the patient that communication was generated by generative, artificial intelligence as specified and two clear instructions describing how patient may contact the human healthcare provider...""

Essentially, these types of rules give people the tools to respond when they are subject to the influence of AI in processes involving their own healthcare.

All of California's trail-blazing notwithstanding, critics just ask whether companies can just go out of state, and house their operations elsewhere, to avoid having to comply with these directives.

Still, this kind of work is crucial to showing how regulation of AI systems may work in the years to come.

So anyone with an interest in this kind of thing should keep an eye out as California continues to move forward."
"Harris says wealthy Americans, corporations will pay higher taxes to fund economic plan",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-says-wealthy-americans-corporations-will-pay-higher-taxes-to-fund-economic-plan,2024-10-07T18:36:59Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris told CBS ""60 Minutes"" in an interview set to air on Monday that she plans to pay for her economic plan by taxing the rich.

Vice President Kamala Harris plans to increase taxes on wealthy individuals and large corporations as part of her economic plan if elected in November, she said in a new interview.

Since becoming the Democratic Party's official nominee for president, Harris has said she will provide $25,000 housing subsidies for first-generation home buyers, implement $100 billion in tax credits for the manufacturing sector and increase small business tax credits by tenfold.

""My plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy,"" Harris told ""60 Minutes"" in a clip released on Monday.

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

""60 Minutes"" correspondent Bill Whitaker reminded Harris that the question was ""how are you going to pay for it?""

Harris quickly said that wealthy Americans would foot the bill.

""I'm going to make sure that the richest among us, who can afford it, pay their fair share in taxes,"" Harris said.

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations,"" Harris continued. ""I plan on making that fair.""

Whitaker shot back, ""But we're dealing with the real world here,"" and asked how that plan would get through Congress.

""You know, when you talk, quietly, with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I am talking about,"" Harris said.

""Cause their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about,"" Harris added. ""Their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses.""

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

Harris' opponent, former President Trump, was invited to appear on ""60 Minutes"" as well for its election interview special, but he declined.

Last month, Harris unveiled new small-business tax proposals last week aimed at reducing the cost burden related to starting a new business. Among the proposals was a substantial increase in the standard tax deduction for small-business startup costs, from $5,000 to $50,000. ""It's essentially a tax cut for starting a small business,"" the vice president said during a stump speech announcing the new proposal. ""We're going to help more small businesses and innovators get off the ground.""

Harris has simultaneously expressed support for raising marginal tax rates for both corporations and individuals, which conservative economists argued would work to diminish the benefit received by the tenfold increase in the startup deduction.

In addition to Harris' new tax proposals for small businesses, she also laid out her plan this week for taxing capital gains. She wants to increase it to 33%, whereas Biden reportedly wants the current rate, which is at 23.8%, to be nearly doubled, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Harris has also suggested support for increasing government spending to support families' child care needs, while also expanding the child tax credit, among other proposals.

Immigration In America: Stats And Facts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/legal/immigration-law/immigration-stats-and-facts/,2024-10-07T17:01:23Z,"The American dream has long attracted people from throughout the world to the land of prosperity. Let's take a look at who is migrating to America, when they've come and where they're going.

Immigration is part of the history of America. In fact, in 1890, immigrants made up 14.8% of the U.S. population. This remains the year with the largest share of immigrants in recorded history.

U.S. immigration laws have tightened considerably since the 1890s when there was virtually no check on migration. However, America remains a top destination for foreign-born individuals. Today, immigrants make up an increasing share of the population. In fact, in 1970, immigrants accounted for 4.7% of the population but now account for 15.6%.

Mexico is one of the closest neighbors to the U.S., so it likely comes as no surprise that a large percentage of migrants come from Mexico. Still, their share of the overall population has decreased. In 2010, the Mexican share of the immigrant population was 29%, but that number was down to 23% by 2022.

India, China, the Philippines and El Salvador also saw many residents traveling to the United States. These countries represent the next largest origin groups after Mexico, accounting for 6%, 5%, 4%, and 3% of immigrants respectively.

Prior to 2007, more Hispanics than Asians immigrated to the United States each year. However, between 2009 and 2018, Asians began arriving in larger numbers. Based on region of birth, Asians made up 28% of all immigrants in 2022.

Like many immigrants, Asians come to the U.S. in search of opportunity. They often find it. Pew Research revealed that Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial group in the United States. They are also the highest-earning and best-educated racial group in the country.

In 2022, immigrants accounted for 13.8% of the population, although this number has since grown. In total, there were 46,118,600 immigrant residents living in the United States in 2022.

That's a substantial number. These immigrants have an estimated $1.6 trillion in spending power and paid $579.1 billion in taxes during the 2022 tax year, so they play a major role in the country's economy.

For many immigrants, birthing and raising children in the United States is part of their American dream. In fact, 7.9% of U.S. residents have at least one immigrant parent. That's an estimated 17.6 million children who have at least one parent born outside of the United States.

While immigration has become a hot-button political issue in recent years, most immigrants have lived in the United States for a very long time. In fact, 26% entered the country prior to 1990 and 46% have lived in the U.S. since 2000 or before.

The vast majority of immigrants have established lives in the country, and many have taken steps toward making it their permanent home.

Although immigration is not a new phenomenon, there has been a significant uptick in migration to the United States in recent years. In total, the foreign-born population increased by 5.1 million in the two years following March 2022. This is the largest two-year increase in American history.

The influx of new immigrants has increased the foreign-born population to 51.6 million, and immigrants now account for 15.6% of the total U.S. population.

Immigrants are not distributed evenly across the United States. California has the largest number of foreign-born individuals, with other top states including:

Some of these states share common traits. Texas and California are border states, so immigrants arrive and settle there. Others, such as New York, are known for being especially welcoming to migrants, including both legal and undocumented individuals arriving in the United States.

Naturalization is the process of becoming a lawful permanent resident. One of the many jobs of immigration lawyers is to assist people with the process of becoming a naturalized citizen.

Many immigrants are well-established in their lives before naturalizing in the United States. The median age of individuals who naturalized in the United States in 2023 was 41, while more than 39% of citizens who were naturalized that year were 30 to 44 years old."
Five Things Small Business Owners Can Do To Prepare For The Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyshoenthal/2024/10/07/five-things-small-business-owners-can-do-to-prepare-for-the-election/,2024-10-07T16:49:24Z,"As the U.S. braces for the upcoming presidential election, small business owners harbor a unique set of concerns around how the outcome might impact their day to day operations. From legislation that could affect taxes, healthcare costs and regulation, the political climate will have a domino effect on consumer behavior, financial markets and more.

Regardless of who wins, it's critical for small business owners to stay informed on new policies and regulatory shifts, as new legislation could reshape things like employee benefits and compliance requirements. With one month to go, many small business owners are curious about proactive steps they can take to prepare for the looming uncertainty. Experts suggest five key principles to prepare for the election's outcome:

1. Monitor policy changes.

It's widely known that election years can bring market volatility. That's why it's critical for small business owners to stay informed about proposed changes in regulations, taxes, healthcare and labor laws that could directly impact their operations. Understanding candidates' platforms will help anticipate shifts and plan for potential changes accordingly.

Jen Stark, who serves as a strategic advisor to Don't Ban Equality, advises small business owners to pay attention to local laws that might impact employee health benefit concerns, especially around reproductive care.

""Small businesses in states that have passed abortion bans and restrictions are left with the burden of shouldering the costs and chaos facing workers and communities,"" she says. ""Those workers have to travel out of state, resulting in more time off and greater healthcare costs out of pocket even if their employer has a benefits program to support them.""

Shifts in economic regulations are another area small business owners should pay close attention to.

""Political uncertainty in the months leading up to the presidential election can affect confidence and decision-making for consumers, which leads to impact on small business owners and can cause a decrease in consumer spending,"" says Cate Luzio, former banker and founder of Luminary, a professional education and networking platform. ""The election results themselves can eventually cause a change in business regulations that small business owners need to be aware of, along with the impact that might have on their business, their growth, their customers and more.""

2. Focus on consumer and employee engagement.

Consumer spending patterns may shift during an election year due to uncertainty. Many people tend to cut back on discretionary spending when they feel uneasy about the economy.

Consider changes you can make to your business to prepare for this sentiment shift. Do you offer essential products or services that are less impacted by economic swings? Are there ways to re-engage your most loyal consumers right now? Focus on those if possible.

At the same time, this is a prime opportunity to foster civic engagement among employees.

""As this election season kicks into high gear, entrepreneurs and business leaders have an opportunity to use their trusted voice to protect American democracy,"" says Katie Vlietstra Wonnenberg, principal of Public Private Strategies. ""Consumers want businesses to be active in protecting America's democracy and they support actions to ensure it.""

Wonnenberg cited research from the Business & Democracy Initiative, which revealed that 75% of consumers support businesses who promote employee civic education and agree that employees should have time off for political engagement.

""Taking these steps during election season can help with employee retention and can build trust and loyalty with consumers,"" she points out.

3. Scenario plan.

Given the potential for significant regulatory changes, business owners should consider the changes that might occur under different administrations. Think through any adjustments you might need to make within operations or budgets when considering factors like minimum wage hikes, healthcare mandates, trade policies and more.

""Company leadership should always be preparing for uncontrollable changes by discussing different scenarios with their teams so they are prepared,"" says Chantell Preston, a healthcare development consultant who advises small businesses on reducing risk.

Preston suggests playing out different scenarios so your company and employees are prepared for any outcome. ""Enlist feedback and engage with your stakeholders so they know you are preparing,"" she says. ""Communicate and be transparent with your employees to build trust and reduce uncertainty.""

4. Remind your employees that they have a say.

Presidential elections can influence labor laws and healthcare regulations, which impact employee pay and HR policies. Business owners should keep a close eye on any proposed changes to healthcare, minimum wage, or employee benefits that could impact overhead costs, communicating openly with employees to prepare for any potential changes that might occur following the election.

Kimber Lanning, CEO of Local First Arizona, suggests starting this conversation prior to the election by reminding employees that they actually do have a say in shaping the outcome.

""A great way to get involved in an election while staying out of divisive politics is to stick to a message of getting out the vote,"" she says. ""Consider giving your employees time off to go to the polls on Election Day. Encourage your customers to vote by placing signs in your establishment or stickers at the cash register. Sponsor or organize a voter registration event. Using your voice as a business owner to support democracy is a noble thing to do.""

5. Be prepared to dip into cash reserves.

Election years can bring about economic uncertainty, which leads to market volatility. Small businesses should consider building up cash reserves to cushion against any potential downturns.

Experts recommend postponing major investments until after the election, reviewing current tax strategies and being prepared to dip into cash reserves in case of significant disruption.

Preston recommends having at least 18 months of capital available. She also suggests researching regulatory perspectives from all parties and evaluating supply chains in case of issues.

Lanning suggests treating an election cycle like any other slow season. She points out that, ""In Phoenix, our summers are hot, so businesses know to plan for decreased revenue as customers go away on vacation. In the months running up to a major election, business owners should do the same thing.""

""No matter what industry you're in, sales activity slumps as Americans hold their money tighter, wondering how the election will turn out and what policies a new president will implement that may affect their pocket book,"" says Lanning. ""You may need to pause hiring, dip into savings or wait to make a big purchase to keep your business healthy.""

Luzio acknowledges the financial anxiety that comes with the election can lead to impulsive, shortsighted decisions.

""Get your 2025 financial projections in order with scenarios around growth, flat and down performance,"" she suggests. ""At a macro level, key issues may have an impact on your numbers: taxes, regulation, trade and consumer spending/customer acquisition. It is important for business owners to be informed about issues and make sure they're aware regardless of which way the election goes. Doing an updated SWOT analysis for your business can help, especially as it relates to how to mitigate or protect your business against threats.""

Finally, Luzio recommends talking to your trusted experts such as insurance professionals, financial advisors, cybersecurity experts, attorneys and banking partners to help mitigate risk.

""Discuss potential business impacts with these experts to help you feel informed about decision making around the business,"" says Luzio.

""The election is out of your control,"" she says. ""So don't panic, please vote, and focus on awareness to support your business through this time."""
"""Whatever It Takes"" Is On The Table",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brendanahern/2024/10/07/whatever-it-takes-is-on-the-table/,2024-10-07T16:49:11Z,"Asian equities were higher, despite a stronger US dollar due to rising US Treasury yields, except for India. Mainland China remains closed for the week-long national holiday until tonight.

It is worth noting that India rebounded from its intra-day lows once other Asian markets closed, indicating India could be a funding source for the China re-rating trade.

Hong Kong bounced around the room in the morning, but grinded higher as the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced that Director Zheng Zhajie and several Deputy Directors will host a press conference tomorrow at 10 am to review the ""implementation of a package of incremental policies to solidly promote the economic structure to improve and development trend to continue to improve"". We've seen the monetary, housing, and stock market policy bazooka unleased, but with very little fiscal stimulus thus far, except subsidies for auto and home appliance purchases. The press conference should provide further clarity on fiscal measures.

The rock band Imagine Dragon's popular song titled ""Whatever It Takes"" is what the Chinese government is committed to doing to get the economy, consumer confidence, and domestic consumption higher. Over the weekend, a Mainland brokerage noted the government fiscal stimulus will be ""a gradual strategy"" versus ""an immediate large-scale expansion"" as they expect ""the initial expansion scale will be about 2 trillion yuan of additional bonds, which will be used to support the trade-in of consumer goods, strengthen social security benefits, and help local governments repay their debts.""

Based on economic data and government policy meetings at month-end, December's Chinese Economic Working Conference, and next year's Two Sessions, there are multiple opportunities for the government to press the gas pedal, as necessary. Skepticism about the Chinese government's ability to improve the economy was cited in a Bloomberg News article on the topic. CLSA and Goldman Sachs equity strategists are the only two firms that have upgraded their China model weights thus far. Moving the sentiment supertanker will take time, which means more buyers will likely be forced to come back into the space in the coming months, quarters, and years.

Train data indicates a strong National Holiday, with 17 million passengers taking trips on each of the last six days. Meanwhile, Macau hotel occupancy rates were 95% during the holiday.

Hong Kong was led higher by growth stocks and sectors, though it was another broad rally, led by Hong Kong's most heavily traded stocks by value, which were Tencent, which gained +0.17%, Alibaba, which gained +0.61%, Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), which gained +21.76%, Meituan, which fell -0.09%, and Hong Kong Exchanges, which gained +4.68%. Tomorrow's China reopening should be fun to watch! Shanghai and Shenzhen stocks have a limit-up of 10%, which means trading will be halted once the market is up by that amount, while the STAR Board has a limit-up of 20%.

The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes gained +1.60% and +3.05%, respectively, on volume that increased +13.5% from Friday, which is 266% of the 1-year average. 448 stocks advanced, while 60 stocks declined. Main Board short turnover increased 40% from Friday, which is 248% of the 1-year average, as 16% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers' ETF hedging). The growth factor and small caps outperformed the value factor and large caps. All sectors were positive, except for Real Estate, which fell -0.02%. The market was led higher by Information Technology, which gained +5.46%, Industrials, which gained +4.84%, and Utilities, which gained +4.45%. All subsectors were positive, except for media, led higher by semiconductors, diversified finance, and capital goods. Southbound Stock Connect will reopen tonight.

How Atlassian Drives Growth: Listening To Customers And Its Employees,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/10/07/how-atlassian-drives-growth-listening-to-customers-and-its-employees/,2024-10-07T16:27:56Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CEO newsletter, which offers the latest news for today's and tomorrow's business leaders and decision makers. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every week.

It's a very good time for unions right now. Last week, organized labor likely notched another victory, as 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association returned to work, reopening 36 East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports after a three-day strike.

Union members started striking at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, after their contract with ocean carriers and port operators represented by the U.S. Maritime Alliance (USMX) expired. The strike essentially shut down all cargo ports on the eastern side of the U.S., potentially roiling the economy and supply chains for everything from groceries to automobiles. Union members wanted a 77% wage increase over six years, as well as an agreement to ban automation in places where it could be used to replace workers. To end the strike for now, USMX offered a 62% wage increase over six years and extended the current union contract until January 15, 2025, to allow for further negotiation.

The contract extension means that the nation's ports will remain open for Q4 -- which includes the presidential election and the all-important holiday shopping season. But the new contract isn't even fully negotiated yet, so it's hard to say whether port workers will ultimately support it. Port automation hasn't been resolved, and as Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly notes, it's a huge issue for the union. The cranes used to remove containers from cargo ships and move them to wherever they need to go next can be automated, meaning fewer people are needed to do the work. Union members are essentially negotiating for their job security -- at least for now.

But cargo ships are getting bigger, global trade is increasing, and there is more demand for imports and exports. Proponents of automation say that it could make ports more efficient, which could help them handle higher volumes. Some ports in Europe and China, as well as a couple on the West Coast, are already automated. The California ports that use automation increased their employment numbers and wage hours after the machinery went in.

These numbers -- and what truly makes a port efficient -- will likely to be discussed at length as the union and USMX return to the bargaining table. It's unknown if the port workers will be willing to compromise on this point. Jim Kruse from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute told Marketplace he has seen forecasts of seaport trade volume doubling by 2050, meaning ports really should be striving toward more efficiency. But if there are no port workers, all of the automation in the world won't be helpful.

Thousands of companies worldwide use Atlassian's collaboration tools -- including Jira, Confluence, Trello and Loom -- to work together and manage projects. I talked to Atlassian President Anu Bharadwaj about how the company uses its culture and experience to best serve enterprise technology needs. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Last month, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs, a huge increase over economists' estimates of 150,000, according to government data released on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, an improvement of a tenth of a point over August. This level of job growth didn't just happen in September. The government revised its summertime job growth figures, adding 55,000 more jobs to July's total -- reaching 144,000 jobs -- and 17,000 more jobs to August, for a total of 159,000.

With the upbeat job data, the stock market turned upwards, too. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both rose close to a percentage point on Friday, while the Nasdaq was up 1.2%. ""The economy continues to show incredible resilience,"" Bolvin Wealth Management Group President Gina Bolvin said in comments emailed to Forbes.

While the jobs data and stock bounces are all good for the economy, economists say they're negatively impacting the chances for another big interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets early next month. According to CME FedWatch, 88.5% of economists now believe interest rates will be cut by a quarter percent, with the remaining 11.5% not expecting a rate cut at all. Forbes' Derek Saul talked with Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, an alternate member of the Open Market Committee, about what he'll be paying attention to as the Fed closes out the year. The unemployment rate going forward is important, he said. ""After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?""

Spirit Airlines stock dropped more than 30% on Friday after reports that the budget carrier may be exploring bankruptcy following a failed merger with JetBlue Airways. It was the deepest plunge of the airline's stock since January, when the Justice Department blocked the proposed $3.8 billion acquisition on antitrust grounds, sending prices down more than 50%. Spirit has been working toward improving its financial position this year, executing a restructuring plan that involves changing routes, deferring new aircraft deliveries, cutting 32 routes, and adding new premium tiers for passenger service and experience. Spirit Airlines CEO Ted Christie has said in the last two earnings reports that the company was discussing options with its bondholders for bills due soon. In the last earnings report, CFO Fred Cromer said updates would be provided ""when appropriate."" According to the Wall Street Journal, people familiar with the matter said any bankruptcy filing is not imminent, and recent talks have focused on reaching an agreement to support a Chapter 11 filing.

In today's business world, studies found most women are not at the levels where decisions are being made. Just 9% of CEOs at the largest U.S. companies are women, but there are few women in the other C-suite roles that can be seen as stepping stones to the top spot, according to a new analysis by executive search firm Russell Reynolds. Looking at the top 100 companies on the S&P, there are 74% fewer female executives on leadership teams than there are in the current U.S. population. Looking at the position-by-position breakdown, 46% of CMOs are women, the closest to the half of the population women represent. There are the most female CHROs -- 72% -- and the fewest CEOs and COOs -- 8%. Forbes senior contributor Kim Elsesser writes other recent studies show that the professional bias against women starts early. A recent study by McKinsey and LeanIn found that women represent 59% of all bachelor's degree recipients, but only represent 48% of entry-level corporate roles. For every 100 men promoted to manager, only 81 women get the same career advancement. Another study that interviewed 57 women CEOs found that two-thirds of them weren't aware the CEO role was in their grasp until someone else suggested it.

Thousands of companies across the globe use Atlassian's collaboration tools -- which include Jira, Confluence, Trello and Loom -- to work together and manage projects. I talked to President Anu Bharadwaj about how Atlassian serves companies' tech and AI needs, the culture at the 22-year-old company -- which is still founder-led, and its growth prospects.

This interview has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here.

How do you figure out which problems Atlassian should be solving next with AI, and how do you go forward doing it?

Bharadwaj: We are a company of product builders. Our philosophy is: Create the things that you want to use yourself. A lot of our product heritage has been we build products for ourselves and then figure out [if] this is interesting for other people, and how can we make it more generalized and applicable in different industries and contexts?

Or we go off and acquire a product. Loom is a great example of a company we acquired last year that we used heavily inside Atlassian. We are a 12,000-person company distributed across 13 countries. [At] the beginning of the pandemic, we made the decision to go fully distributed. We said to employees, we will not ask you to come into an office for any number of days a week, but we will set some guidelines around how many working hours overlap you have with your team. When we compose a team of people on the West Coast and East Coast, that's okay. But if you take people on the East Coast, West Coast, Australia and Singapore, it becomes a problem because there are not enough working hours overlap. A lot of the tools that we use are really our own tools for collaboration and for teamwork. And one of the tools we heavily relied on was Loom, which really helped, creating video snippets that would help disseminate information so that people can then consume it at their own pace. We decided to buy the tool ourselves and integrate it with our product suite because it really helped with asynchronous communication and distributed teamwork.

Scott Farquhar, one of the founders of Atlassian, recently stepped down from the co-CEO spot. While this may not signify a huge transition for the company, since cofounder Mike Cannon-Brookes is assuming the sole CEO role, what does it mean symbolically for Atlassian?

I have been at Atlassian for 10 years, and the big reason for me staying this long has been Scott. Scott's a personal friend and has been a great supporter and champion. Personally, I feel bittersweet about it. I feel very happy for him that he is now going on to the next phase of life. He has the energy and the bandwidth to focus on some of the things that he has started, like Pledge1%. He has a number of well-defined philosophical philanthropy projects that he's rallied the company around.

Operationally day-to-day, it's not that much of a change for us because he's been very thoughtful about this transition. He has set up the requisite systems and leaders. I personally have been doing a lot more on the go-to-market, which Scott used to run.

Mike, our CEO, [and Farquhar] have been co-founders and co-CEOs for 20-plus years, which is very unusual in software. Mike staying on as the founder CEO means that even symbolically for Atlassian, it's really not that much of a step change, because we continue to be founder-led. We continue to have the 20-year context continue.

One of the staggering things about Atlassian is we have a lot of tenured people in the company. We have a Slack channel called Old Timers, which seems to keep growing each day. It's mostly people who have 10-plus years, and I recently joined. Because we have a lot of tenured people, the culture, the ethos of the company, beliefs, values, they all tend to be strong. We are lucky that we have that cohort of people where this continues to be a defining way of how we run the company.

In Atlassian's most recent earnings report, some investors reacted negatively to slower growth prospects than they were hoping. Where do you see Atlassian's growth going? What is your vision for the next six months?

It's interesting because I've been here since we were $100 million in revenue. We are about $4.5 billion dollars in revenue, and we've been a growth company throughout. We are committed to a 20% CAGR over multiple years. [A] 20% CAGR on a $4.5 billion base is substantial, and it's quite rare for a company of our scale. I continue to be excited and grateful that we have a business where the opportunities are so big that we can confidently talk about 20% CAGR over multiple years.

Why do we think that that is the case? Because we operate in three fundamental markets where I think the opportunity is going to grow, because more and more people are poised to be creators. Thanks to gen AI and redefining of the software development lifecycle, more people can do what only technical people used to be able to do before. That's a good thing for Atlassian because we serve the full cycle, not just the coding part of a developer's life. That means more software gets created and more opportunity to grow in that business.

Our second business is the IT service market, which is fundamentally service request handling. This is a market that stands to greatly benefit from the AI wave. Even outside of the AI wave, this is a market that continues to grow at a very healthy clip. We just put out the numbers for each of our business lines for the first time back in April. Service management has been our fastest growing business, close to $500 million. We are priced super competitively, and we are just getting started. That's really at the early phases of the market capture, and that's several billion dollars that is open opportunity for us to go after.

The last market is for knowledge workers. We can democratize that with an open philosophy of saying companies can use any number of tools for knowledge management applications they require, but we want to be the backbone that connects all of those things in one single place through a connected data platform, and offers customers the choice to use multiple tools, but have a single knowledge backbone across their organization such that they can make the maximum use of their own data and deliver the most insights based on what their own employees are doing. That is definitely the largest market we are addressing, and has the most promise, and we are also the earliest in that market.

Booming artificial intelligence company OpenAI announced a massive funding round last week.

$6.6 billion: Size of the newest round, which was led by Thrive Capital and saw participation from SoftBank, Nvidia and Tiger Global, according to the Wall Street Journal

What To Expect From September's CPI Inflation Report,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/07/what-to-expect-from-septembers-cpi-inflation-report/,2024-10-07T16:20:48Z,"Consumer Price Index inflation data to be released on October 10 is expected to provide some support for the Federal Open Market Committee cutting rates in November. However, unemployment data may ultimately matter more for the FOMC's decision making.

All inflation metrics are down over the past 12 months according to the Atlanta Fed's Dashboard that measures a range of inflation metrics. Specifically, headline annual CPI inflation is 2.5% to August 2024 and core CPI, which removes swings in food and energy prices is 3.2%.

Although these figures do not hit the FOMC's 2% inflation goal, inflation is running at a much lower rate than for much of the 2021-2023 period. As a result the FOMC made the first interest rate cut of this cycle in September, recognizing that monetary policy no longer needed to be as restrictive with significant progress on inflation.

Inflation nowcasts from the Cleveland Fed call for reassuring inflation data. They expect 0.1% monthly inflation for headline CPI for September and 0.3% monthly core inflation. Should these forecasts hold, they would provide further reassurance for the FOMC that inflation is now under control. However, some minor concerns remain.

Firstly, shelter costs, which make up a large portion of CPI inflation continue to rise at a relatively fast 5.2% annual rate as of August 2024. Reaching the FOMC's 2% target may require shelter costs to cool from these levels. Secondly, the FOMC continues to monitor for unexpected shocks that could cause inflation to resume. For example, the dockworkers' strike ending with a substantial pay increase recently is the sort of thing the FOMC will be monitoring, to make sure wage-lead inflation doesn't resume.

Inflation was among the more closely watch economic indicators in recent years, given the surge in prices. Now, the FOMC is paying closer attention to the other component of its dual mandate - maintaining full employment. Typically, when the FOMC raises rates abruptly, increases in unemployment result. We've seen that to some degree this cycle with unemployment now at 4.1% for September compared to 3.8% in September 2023. However, so far the increase in unemployment has been sufficiently gradual, so far, to ease fears of a potential recession. Still, jobs data is likely to get more attention than inflation data should inflation continue to ease back towards 2%.

The FOMC next sets interest rates on November 7. Therefore, the October 10 figures will be the last CPI release before that meeting. However, there will be a Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index release on October 31, which may offer further insight on U.S. inflation trends.

It is expected that the FOMC elects to cut interest rates by 0.25% according to the CME FedWatch Tool, with some chance that rates are held steady. Previously, markets anticipated a material chance of a larger 0.5% cut. However, that probability has faded with unexpectedly robust jobs data for September, with the economy adding a higher than expected 254,000 jobs. Should inflation continue to cool, so it is likely that the FOMC continues to cut rates. However, the pace of loosening monetary policy may be more informed by jobs data than inflation figures."
VMware BrandVoice: Unlocking The Benefits Of Private Cloud For Modern Enterprises,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/vmware/2024/10/07/unlocking-the-benefits-of-private-cloud-for-modern-enterprises/,2024-10-07T16:06:30Z,"Written by Richard Monro, Technology Executive and Business Value Lead, VMware Cloud Foundation Division, Broadcom

We are in the middle of a resurgence of interest in private cloud because the concept remains the best answer to solving today's growing IT cost, complexity, and compliance challenges. This interest is driving current CIO spend and activity, with Forrester's ""Private Cloud Market Insights, 2023"" reporting that 79% of surveyed cloud decision makers are implementing internal private clouds.

There are a plethora of private cloud solutions on the market. Many are described by tech marketers using very similar terminology. Yet definitions of what ""cloud"" and ""private"" mean can vary enormously. The challenge lies not in any judgment of solutions being ""good"" or ""bad,"" ""right"" or ""wrong,"" but in expectations and the risk of misunderstandings.

Cloud, as befitting its meteorological alter-ego, is a nebulous term for many.

For some it is a strategy, others a tactic. It is sometimes even used to describe a thing or place. Yet cloud computing is an operating model, as clearly defined by NIST. In short, it is the way we build, deploy, manage, consume, and protect our IT services. The most fundamental characteristics of cloud -- the deal breakers if you will -- are user self-service backed by automation.

Private cloud technology has come a long way in the last 10 years and this cloud operating model, once only available from public clouds, is available privately too. A modern private cloud platform can provide governed and secure self-service, using powerful automation layers, simplified operations, and workflow orchestration. What previously took weeks, now takes minutes.

The modern tools and capabilities for building applications, for so long synonymous with public clouds, are also more widely available as well. A private cloud platform is now far more comprehensive in terms of feature set, offering parity with those public cloud services.

Executives should expect their investments in private cloud technology to enable that cloud operating model and provide access to innovative services like AI and analytics. Many private solutions today are based around independent siloed architectures, bound together with an automation layer that is typically limited in capability while being complicated to maintain. This might be branded a ""cloud,"" but it does not provide for a cloud operating model.

Now that we have described current expectations for a ""cloud,"" we need to define how that cloud operating model will be delivered. This is where the accompanying adjective becomes important -- public or private?

Public cloud has less demanding constraints than private cloud. It is generally understood to be a platform belonging to another organization where we can build and run services. There are restrictions on control and customizations -- everything will need to be done the way the public cloud platform wants it done and this will be different from self-owned services. Applications will also need to comply with the public cloud platform requirements for how workloads will run and data will be stored.

Private cloud, in contrast, has a range of vendor definitions which makes it important for an executive to be very clear about their own requirements and expectations in order to assess solutions.

The definition of the word ""private"" in everyday use has two meaningful characteristics. Something private is ours -- it belongs to a single person or entity. It also means there are the necessary controls to protect our confidential information. These same essential characteristics also apply to private cloud and can translate into tangible business advantages.

In sectors such as finance, healthcare, and government, stringent compliance requirements necessitate robust data protection and privacy measures. A private cloud ensures that sensitive data remains within the organization's own control, adhering to regulations, meeting custom control requirements, and minimizing the risk of breaches.

Data sovereignty may also be a critical driver of private cloud. As well as compliance with public policies, data is increasingly being seen as a strategic asset in the digital economy, particularly with the increasing use of AI, and sovereignty is seen as an essential component of data protection.

Moreover, existing systems and data architectures in many enterprises are often deeply intertwined with their operations. Here, the customization that a private cloud affords modernization without sacrificing stability and integrity.

A private cloud should help you unlock the value of your private data in a controlled manner.

By calling solutions ""private cloud"" when they do not deliver a cloud operating model nor align with the need for control, sovereignty, and customization, vendors have diluted the term and confused the market. The gaps and omissions in vendor definitions tend to be driven by elements they are simply unable to deliver.

The onus is on executives to identify what cloud challenges they are trying to solve -- and what each vendor is actually capable of delivering when they offer a private cloud solution. The Broadcom definitions for private cloud and hybrid cloud can help you start.

Ultimately, executives are looking for private cloud solutions that do not compromise on cloud features while still ensuring enterprise controls. Private clouds are expected to deliver:

We know that private cloud is a current imperative for most organizations, but that need will only increase. In the next article in this series, we will uncover exactly why that is and how you can get ahead of it.

Democratizing Finance: How Web3 Bridges The Gap For The Underbanked,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/07/democratizing-finance-how-web3-bridges-the-gap-for-the-underbanked/,2024-10-07T15:08:01Z,"The global financial landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation, driven by rapid advancements in technology. In particular, the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 technologies promises to break down traditional barriers to financial services, making them more accessible to individuals and communities that have long been excluded. As of 2021, an estimated 1.4 billion people worldwide remain unbanked, meaning they have no access to formal banking institutions. Another 1 billion are underbanked, lacking sufficient access to affordable financial products. This exclusion contributes to cycles of poverty, as it limits individuals' ability to save, borrow, or invest. However, decentralized technologies, which utilize blockchain infrastructure and smart contracts, offer a new pathway to financial inclusion, providing innovative solutions for these underserved populations.

Web3 technologies, which refer to a decentralized version of the internet built on blockchain, represent a significant departure from traditional centralized financial systems. Instead of entirely relying on intermediaries such as banks or payment processors, Web3 enables peer-to-peer transactions and automated financial services. For the underbanked, this is revolutionary. Access to digital wallets, decentralized applications (dApps), and cryptocurrencies means that people can store, transfer, and grow their wealth independently of traditional financial institutions, avoiding high fees and geographical limitations while complying to regulatory compliance requirements across jurisdictions.

Key industry players in this space are already making significant strides toward democratizing finance. Mastercard, in collaboration with MetaMask and Baanx, recently launched a crypto-to-fiat card allowing MetaMask wallet users to spend their cryptocurrency directly in fiat currency at any location accepting Mastercard. This new solution removes the need for intermediaries like exchanges or banks, making it easier for self-custodial wallet users to access funds outside the crypto space. This initiative is a step towards connecting Web2 and Web3 ecosystems, empowering underbanked individuals with instant crypto-to-fiat conversions for everyday purchases.

Another company actively driving financial inclusion through Web3 technologies is CrossFi, founded by Alexander Mamasidikov. It creates decentralized finance (DeFi) tools that aim to democratize access to financial services, empowering everyone to take control of their own financial futures. By building a bridge between traditional banking and DeFi, CrossFi offers a suite of products that allows users to seamlessly manage both fiat and cryptocurrency assets. These innovative products include the world's first non-custodial payment card, enabling users to spend cryptocurrency directly from their Web3 wallets, without the need for a third-party custodian or exchange. For millions of people across various socioeconomic backgrounds who don't have access to conventional banking, this on-chain payment card represents a gateway to the global economy, enabling their access to secure, transparent, and efficient financial services.

""We believe that financial inclusion is not just about offering financial services -- it's about creating accessible, secure, and user-friendly tools that anyone can use, regardless of where they are in the world,"" said Alexander Mamasidikov, founder of CrossFi.

Another player in the Web3 finance space is 1inch, known for its decentralized finance products. The 1inch Wallet and 1inch Card provide users with seamless ways to manage and spend digital assets. The 1inch Card allows for crypto-to-fiat conversion at competitive rates and supports Apple Pay and Google Pay, ensuring that users can make everyday purchases with crypto while benefiting from secure, fast transactions. With features like a physical and virtual card, it empowers individuals to bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional financial systems.

However, as with any new financial technology, regulatory frameworks need to be in place to prevent misuse. Fintech companies like CrossFi need to ensure compliance with local regulations by requiring users to pass Know Your Customer (KYC) checks before obtaining their credit cards. These companies work closely with local regulators and banking partners to maintain full compliance across all products, backed by dedicated legal teams that monitor and adhere to the legal requirements of each geography.

""Robust compliance and regulatory frameworks are essential to ensure that web3-powered DeFi innovations operate within the boundaries of the law. Without clear guidelines, we risk creating a system vulnerable to exploitation. That's why, at CrossFi, we prioritize full compliance, leaving no loopholes in our approach. It's crucial for us to adhere to the laws in the different regions we operate, as it ensures trust and long-term sustainability for our users,"" said Mamasidikov.

Beyond payment cards, innovations like stablecoins and decentralized lending platforms are also playing a crucial role in extending financial services to the underbanked. Stablecoins, for instance, are digital currencies pegged to a stable asset such as the U.S. dollar issued by Circle or Hong Kong dollar issued by IDA. These offer a secure and reliable alternative to the volatility of other cryptocurrencies, making them an ideal option for people in regions with unstable currencies or inflationary economies. Additionally, decentralized lending platforms enable individuals to access credit without needing a traditional bank account or credit score, opening up new opportunities for financial empowerment.

Olga Feldmeier, a prominent blockchain expert and CEO of Smart Valor, an AI-powered crypto investment platform, believes that DeFi has the potential to completely reshape the financial landscape by making essential financial services more accessible to all. ""Stablecoins, for example, can serve as a lifeline for people living in countries with hyperinflation, providing them with a way to protect their wealth and participate in the global economy,"" Feldmeier explained.

Mamasidikov also shares a similar view: ""The real power of Web3 in democratizing finance lies in its ability to provide programmable liquidity and trust-less financial instruments. By leveraging decentralized protocols, we can bypass traditional gatekeepers and offer financial services that are not bound by geographic borders or legacy banking infrastructure. In this context, stablecoins represent a breakthrough in providing stability in uncertain economic environments. They allow people to store and transfer value securely and affordably, particularly in regions where traditional banking is inaccessible or unreliable.""

The movement towards decentralized finance is still in its early stages, but it holds immense potential for creating a more inclusive financial system. By eliminating intermediaries and providing direct access to financial services, innovative Web3 technologies can empower individuals to take control of their finances, no matter where they are located. In doing so, they are helping to bridge the gap for the underbanked and pave the way for a more equitable global economy.

Ultimately, the democratization of finance through Web3 is not just about technology; it's about creating a fairer, more inclusive system that gives everyone the opportunity to participate in the global economy. The future of finance is decentralized, and it's one where everyone has a seat at the table."
New poll shows who Hispanics are backing in southwest swing states,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-poll-shows-hispanics-backing-southwest-swing-states,2024-10-07T15:06:03Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

With less than a month to go until Election Day in November, a new poll indicates Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Trump among self-identified Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada, two crucial southwestern battleground states.

But Trump has made gains with younger male Hispanic voters compared to four years ago, according to a pair of Suffolk University/USA Today surveys released on Monday.

According to the poll, Harris leads Trump 57%-38% among Hispanic voters in Arizona, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver both under 1% support. Three percent of voters remain undecided. When asked how they voted in the 2020 election, 55% of those Hispanic voters said they voted for President Biden, while a third said they voted for Trump.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

The vice president's lead over the former president is slightly smaller in neighboring Nevada, at 56%-40%. According to the survey, Independent American Party's Joel Skousen is just over 1%, Libertarian Chase Oliver is under 1%, and 2% are undecided. When asked how they voted in the 2020 election, 56% said they voted for Biden, while 33% said they voted for Trump.

""So far, Harris is falling short of the 24-26 point advantage that Joe Biden carried with Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada in 2020, according to the exit polls from those states,"" Suffolk University Political Research Center director David Paleologos highlighted. ""This Democratic shortfall is largely due to young Hispanic men.""

In both states, a majority of men under 50 years of age are choosing Trump over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 53%-40% among Hispanic men ages 18-34 in Nevada, and tops her 53%-39% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

In Arizona, the Republican presidential nominee leads the Democratic Party standard-bearer 51%-39% among Hispanic men ages 18-34, and 57%-37% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

TIGHTEST PRESIDENTIAL RACE SINCE 2000 - WITH ONE MONTH UNTIL ELECTION DAY

The economy and immigration were the top two issues on the minds of those questioned in the survey in both states.

Arizona and Nevada have referendums to protect access to abortion on the ballot in November - and the poll indicates majority support for the measures in both states.

Arizona and Nevada - along with Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin - had razor-thin margins in the 2020 presidential election that decided Biden's victory over Trump. And all seven states are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election in the race for the White House.

The latest surveys in Arizona and Nevada - as well as the other five swing states - indicate margin-of-error races between Harris and Trump.

The Suffolk University/USA Today surveys were conducted Sept. 27-Oct. 2, through live interviews of 500 self-identified Hispanic voters in the states of Arizona and Nevada. The overall sampling error for results from each state is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points."
Is It 'Irrefutable' That The Economy Performs Better Under Democrats?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/10/07/is-it-irrefutable-that-the-economy-performs-better-under-democrats/,2024-10-07T15:02:38Z,"Responding to the failures of Enron and Worldcom within six months of each other, failures that didn't spook the markets much at all, President George W. Bush zestily signed into law Sarbanes-Oxley (legislation that most certainly did spook the markets), thus criminalizing failure in an economy that had long derived its dynamism from - you guessed it - a lack of barriers to the decline of corporations no longer meeting or leading the needs of customers.

Even though government spending is the ultimate tax on growth (this is not a comment on deficits, which both sides needlessly waste time on when the other Party is in power), was allergic to government-spending vetoes, he reversed the Reagan-Clinton emphasis on a strong, stable dollar that had been such a major driver of economic vitality in the '80s and '90s, plus when banks and investment banks began to go belly-up in 2008 (arguably symptoms of the Bush Treasury's confusion about dollar-price stability), the rhetorically ""free market"" Bush claimed the markets weren't working on the way to bailouts that logically caused the ""financial crisis,"" as opposed to staving off market mayhem.

Bush's unsuccessful presidency always comes to mind every four years, and when Republicans and Democrats claim the economy does much better when their party controls the White House. It's a discussion that elevates neither side, and not because policy doesn't matter. The reality is that good and bad individuals with good or bad ideas occupy the White House, after which part of the success or failure of individuals has much to do with how cooperative (or rather crucially, uncooperative) Congress is toward the president in office. Bush can be given a little leniency here with the latter in mind.

While his awful dollar policy was all his, Sarbanes-Oxley was passed near unanimously in the House and Senate. Considering TARP, the bank bailout bill that morphed into so much more, many more Democrats voted for it than Republicans.

This is important in consideration of the economic portion of Barack Obama's presidency that followed Bush's. The economy had limping qualities much of the time. One anecdote supporting the previous truth comes care of Republican-leaning Wall Street Journal columnist Mary O'Grady. O'Grady has noted that from 2009-2014, more Mexicans crossed the southern border back into Mexico than came into the U.S. However, looming large in the weakness of the Obama economy were the bailouts signed into law by George W. Bush, but that were overwhelmingly supported by Democrats in Congress.

Obama had his own errors, including the passage of the misnamed Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), but the stock market did pretty well as his presidency wore on. Was this Democratic policy? Arguably no. Lest readers forget, the legislative portion of Obama's presidency (2009-2017) largely ended in 2010 after the electorate, presumably chastened by Obama's lefty lurch (after running a centrist campaign), handed control of Congress back to the Republicans. In 2014, the GOP took control of the Senate too.

Obama's presidency is useful to think about when making comparisons between Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Using the charitably worthless measurement that is Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Reagan economy averaged annual growth of 3.5%, while Clinton was near 4%. The stock market soared under both too, but more under Clinton. Ok, so both GDP and the stock market favor Clinton and the Democrats? Not so fast.

It's easily forgotten that Clinton, like Obama, lost Congress in the mid-term elections, and after tax increases in concert with an attempt to nationalize healthcare. Clinton later admitted regret about the tax hikes, plus famously proclaimed subsequent to the GOP's taking of Congress that ""the era of big government is over."" As Democratic historian Richard Reeves observed about Clinton's presidency, it was Reagan's third term.

With Republicans in control of Congress while Clinton was in the White House, welfare reform was signed into law, a capital gains tax cut was passed, after which divided government invariably keeps a lid on major legislation meant to expand government. It's worth adding that to Clinton's everlasting credit, he replaced weak-dollar Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen with Robert Rubin. This was a big deal.

Still, it's useful to consider a Clinton presidency that in so many ways mimicked Reagan's in the eyes of Democrats, all the while considering the role of GOP's takeover of Congress in Clinton's makeover. What if Reagan had similarly enjoyed a GOP congressional majority?

It's worth asking mainly because in judging the individual in the White House, you can't judge them solely on their actions. What about the Congress in opposition or supporting them? Democrats like Clinton and Obama plainly prospered more than they otherwise would have thanks to Republicans in majority opposition.

Pivoting to Donald Trump, stocks and the economy generally did well during his presidency with a mix of good (de-regulation, exiting of the Paris Accord, ok tax cuts) and bad (tariffs) decisions, only for stocks and the economy to plummet in March of 2020. Think the lockdowns following political panic over the coronavirus. It was then that Trump went against type and supported freedom, economy, and logic-trampling government control. The collapse under Trump towards the end of his presidency obviously compromises the numbers leading up to March of 2020, at which point Trump and Republicans are awful at economic policy? Not so fast once again. Without excusing Trump's mindless actions for even a second, let's never forget that Democrats supported this hideous lurch from sanity exponentially more than allegedly virus-denying Republicans.

This is important in consideration of the Biden presidency that followed. While Democratic governors were only too happy to oversee lockdowns in the states they ran, and while mouthbreathing Republican governors locked down late while ""unlocking"" early to the disdainful horror of double-masked Dems, the total discredit of lockdowns in GOP-led states set the stage for eventually all U.S. states ending what was so inhumane, unhealthy, and inimical to growth. Yet it's ""Biden's"" economic growth now?

Hopefully readers see the point. Prosperity under Democratic presidents was so often aided by the GOP's more routine embrace of limited government and freedom, while horrendous errors by GOP presidents (2008 bailouts, 2020 lockdowns) were embraced much more by Democrats than Republicans. Which means it's overwhelming fallacy for Democrats to claim a ""clear"" relationship between their policies and growth.

At the same time, Republicans should be looking inward too. As evidenced by the not-infrequent economic success of Democratic presidents, there's a case to be made that the GOP does the most for freedom and for growth when they're out of the White House, and aggressively restraining the Democrats from being - yes - Democrats."
Biden Responds to Chinese Foothold in Iraq Energy Sector,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dipkabhambhani/2024/10/07/biden-responds-to-chinese-foothold-in-iraq-energy-sector/,2024-10-07T14:23:58Z,"The U.S. government is laser-focused on bringing American companies to Iraq to rebuild its energy sector in an attempt to edge out Chinese investors, reduce emissions from Iraq's burgeoning oil and gas production, and counter Iran's growing influence.

In August, Forbes reported that over the past four years, Iran has become more energy dominant, cash rich, and globally influential. The Biden administration is now pivoting swiftly to help Iraq under its new pro-business Prime Minister Mohammed Shiaa Al-Sudani.

""Everybody recognizes the asset that Iraq represents, second largest proven reserves in OPEC,"" Geoffrey Pyatt, the State Department's Assistant Secretary for Energy Resources told Forbes.

Iraq has 145 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, which is about 100 years of supply at the current rate of production, according to the World Bank.

However, when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, it destroyed critical infrastructure, including Iraq's electricity infrastructure, leaving the country deficient and unable to rebuild, until now.

""Two decades of American blood and treasure are in Iraq and we shouldn't forget that,"" Pyatt said.

""Now the relationship is shifting into a new phase.""

U.S. national security is at stake in staving off China.

Developing the energy system in Iraq is also an opportunity to usurp China's position in the region, Pyatt said.

The assistant secretary said the growth of Iraq's energy sector is going to take place ""in a market environment.""

""And unlike the Chinese that may have other motives, our companies are going to get involved where they feel there's an asset...but also where there are options for recovery of capital and making some progress,"" Pyatt said.

China, which was already one of the leading operators of oil and gas fields in Iraq, is now developing 10 more oil and gas fields after winning a competitive bid process to develop selected blocs earlier this year.

Pyatt said, ""Sudani is serious about trying to attract Western investment into the sector. When I was there in May, there was a genuine sense of chagrin that the fifth and sixth bid rounds had gone entirely to small and not particularly competent Chinese bidders, and that there had been a paucity of big Western companies coming in.""

China imports more crude than any other country, more than 11 million barrels of crude a day. Iraq is the country's third largest source of oil behind Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Iraq sends 35% of its crude to China, and the trade volume between them has reached $50 billion.

Still China could also end up buying the newfound Iraqi oil and gas developed by American companies.

Pyatt is not concerned.

""It's a globally integrated oil market, so I don't worry at all about the flag on the molecule. It's a fungible and integrated market, with the exception of Russia, which has managed to put itself deep into the penalty box because of Ukraine and which is excluded from mainstream markets,"" he said.

This relationship between the new Government of Iraq and the U.S. government has been developing over nearly 6 months in force.

After Sudani visited Washington in April, Pyatt visited Bagdad, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, which set into motion a series of MOUs, meetings and collaborations.

In the past month alone, the U.S. State Department has managed high-level meetings between Sudani and energy giants like GE Renova, Total, BP, Baker Hughes, Haliburton, Hunt and Honeywell.

With a sense of urgency, Pyatt, Sudani and high-level executives from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the energy sector met in Houston around Gastech, the international ministerial-level conference of natural gas executives. They met again a week later during NY Climate Week and the U.N. General Assembly.

On October 1, the U.S. Export Import Bank announced that Congress had allowed it to release nearly $300 million to Iraq's Ministry of Electricity, which will pay Jacksonville, Florida-based Stellar Energy Americas, Inc. to retool several power plants to make the grid more reliable and efficient.

The Iraqi government will pay Stellar $297 million for a project EXIM said will ""increase the availability and reliability of electricity in Iraq by generating power through waste heat"" and support 600 U.S. jobs across more than half a dozen states.

The deal was part of $1 billion package to support U.S. exports.

EXIM is the U.S. export credit agency which helps U.S. businesses export products and services to international markets to compete for global sales. It offers financing including export insurance, working capital guarantees, loan guarantees and direct loans.

In documents obtained by Forbes, Stellar will convert two of Iraq's three single-cycle power plants into combined-cycle natural gas-fired units.

Once converted, total plant generation capacity in Iraq will rise from 550 MW to 835 MW, about a 40% increase in power generation capacity.

According to EXIM Bank's notice to Congress, the project represents ""a significant expansion in energy produced with no material increase in greenhouse gas emissions.""

EXIM said the increased production of electricity will yield a 31.2% reduction in GHG emissions per MWh generated.

Stellar will handle engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, design, health and safety management, and operational training for personnel. The London branch of JP Morgan Chase Bank is EXIM's guaranteed lender.

Beyond EXIM, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation is also investing in Iraq. A DFC official told me the active investment in Iraq's energy sector is $299 million.

The agency said its energy priorities in Iraq and across the entirety of its global portfolio are focused on wind, solar, methane abatement, carbon capture among other clean energy investments.

Between 2004-11, the U.S. Trade the Development Agency helped Iraq invested $2 million for programs to develop Iraq's energy and natural resources and mining sectors.

A USTDA official told me the assistance fell into two categories: training programs in technical, management, and human resources for the oil sector, and reverse trade missions that brought delegations of Iraqi oil sector officials to the U.S. to examine American innovations with the goal of exporting U.S. technology.

The goal at the time was a post-war rebuild before the U.S. would withdraw military troops, which it did for the most part in 2011. ""While the Agency has not done work in Iraq for several years, USTDA is open to new programming in the country if a proposal aligns with our demand-driven funding model.""

There's another priority for the Biden administration -- lowering emissions.

In an interview, Pyatt told me there are ""huge opportunities"" under Sudani to bring efficiency to Iraq's ""legacy energy sector,"" and opportunities to capture gas that's currently vented at record levels.

""They are one of the world's largest emitters. The volume of gas they currently vent or flare is on par with the volume of energy they import from Iran,"" Pyatt said.

Currently, when Iraq drills for oil, the associated gas is burned off. Flaring is a hazard to the environment, and a loss of gas revenues to the Iraqi government. The goal is to reduce flaring and instead pipe that natural gas to the power sector.

""For the U.S., a big part of this is Iraq's sovereignty and economic success, and the convergence of interests between the US and Sudani's vision right now, in particular his objective of getting to zero imports by 2030,"" Pyatt said.

Iraq's Minister of Oil, Hayan Abdel-Ghani, said in Houston he wants Iraq to end all flaring by 2028, which is ""consistent with Biden administration climate goals as well,"" Pyatt said.

Iraq will soon select a contractor to install rooftop solar systems on more than 500 public buildings.

According to Mideast Utilities magazine, Ziad Fadil, Iraq's Minister of Electricity, confirmed that nearly $68 million has been secured in the 2024 national budget, ""underscoring the government's commitment to addressing the country's chronic electricity supply challenges.""

An Iraqi official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Iraq is one of the world's greatest victims of climate change. ""It's a real issue,"" he said.

Ironically, as countries work to meet global climate goals to become net-zero by 2030, Iraq could be producing record volumes of oil and gas for the global market by then.

""Not how I look at it. The market is going to decide when demand begins to abate for fossil fuels. The IEA says that's going to happen within this decade. The United States is working to help make that so,"" Pyatt said.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has forecast a sharp global decline in fossil fuel supply from 2022 to 2050.

""In the meantime, we need to make sure we're doing everything possible to reduce the climate intensity, the climate footprint of the fossil energy that the world does produce,"" Pyatt said.

He said he likes the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's celebrated Vision 2030 model whereby the country increases renewable energy capacity for its domestic grid but sells its oil and gas into the global marketplace.

""The more they power the domestic economy with renewables, the more molecules they're left with to sell into the global market. Iraq ought to be following that same pathway,"" Pyatt said.

In May, Oil Minister Abdel-Ghani said he wanted to increase Iraq's proven reserves to 160 billion barrels by producing 29 new oil and gas fields."
"The Tax Man Comes For Fast Fashion, Part 3: The U.S. Leads The Way",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/taxnotes/2024/10/07/the-tax-man-comes-for-fast-fashion-part-3-the-us-leads-the-way/,2024-10-07T14:23:49Z,"This is the third article in a series. The first provided an overview of how fast fashion companies are taxed globally and potential solutions moving forward. The second discussed rivalries within the growing fast fashion industry, focusing on how this growth has been influenced by tax policy.

Temu's parent company, PDD Holdings, has had a rough several weeks.

In August the company's stock price plunged nearly 30 percent after its second-quarter earnings fell short of analysts' expectations. Despite this, PDD is performing astonishingly well in the market, making the steep sell-off a bit surprising. In the second quarter, PDD earned $13.6 billion in revenue -- an 86 percent jump over its same-period earnings from the previous year, the company reported. PDD should be celebrating, but instead it is assuaging the nerves of Wall Street analysts who had forecast an overly optimistic $14 billion for the quarter, according to CNBC.

PDD is in a bit of a delicate spot. Yes, revenue is high, but the company is also aware that its boom may be nearing its end. In its second-quarter release, PDD acknowledged that it's likely to face pressure amidst ""intensified competition"" from other low-cost e-commerce retailers.

Investors are clearly skittish. PDD's stock price took a mini tumble in mid-September after the Biden administration announced that it intends to close a customs exemption that allows low-value imports to enter the country duty free.

In the statement, the White House left little question about who it is targeting:

The majority of shipments entering the United States claiming the de minimis exemption originate from several China-founded e-commerce platforms, putting American consumers at risk, undercutting American workers and businesses, and resulting in the importation of huge volumes of low-value products such as textiles and apparel into the U.S. market duty-free.

In the United States, importers are exempted from paying customs duties on packages valued under $800 under section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. The problem is that the number of exempt packages is accelerating at such a high rate that some lawmakers and industry analysts suspect the system is being gamed. In 2023 the United States received 1 billion de minimis packages -- a 57 percent increase compared with 2020. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says de minimis imports have jumped by 88 percent over the past six years.

The de minimis exemption was not meant to become a point of controversy or exploitation. Rather, it was meant to ensure that Americans who purchase goods abroad can buy a certain amount duty free. The exemption amount used to be much lower: Until 1994 the de minimis threshold for low-value imports was $5, but it gradually increased until it hit $800 per person per day in 2016. Congress landed on $800 because it wanted to align the de minimis threshold with the duty-free exemption that applies to international travel.

It turns out that this exemption, which was meant to help U.S. consumers, may be helping foreign e-commerce retailers as well. Lawmakers specifically say fast fashion retailer Shein and PDD's Temu are taking advantage of the exemption. In June 2023 a U.S. House committee released a report saying that the two companies alone accounted for nearly 30 percent of the 685 million de minimis shipments that entered the United States in 2022. Although the companies are doing heavy business in the United States, they aren't shipping their products in bulk. Instead, they mostly send their packages as direct-to-consumer shipments. Because their products are ultra-low value, the direct-to-consumer shipments are typically worth less than $800 and can enter the country duty free.

The Biden administration says it will issue proposed rules ensuring that products subject to tariffs under sections 201 or 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, or section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, will not qualify for the de minimis exemption. That spells bad news for Chinese e-commerce apparel operators, because 70 percent of Chinese textile and apparel imports are subject to section 301 tariffs. However, the de minimis threshold shielded many e-commerce apparel shipments from the tariffs.

Biden is building on policy from his predecessor, former president Donald Trump.

Between 2018 and 2019 the Trump administration imposed an escalating series of section 301 tariffs on Chinese imports, including a wide array of textiles, fabrics, and apparel. The decisions subjected those goods to additional tariffs ranging between 10 and 25 percent. The Biden administration decided to keep those tariffs, and now it plans to ensure that they will be fully applied.

The White House also announced that it wants more information about de minimis shipments entering the country's borders, including a shipment's 10-digit tariff classification number and information about the person claiming the de minimis exemption.

Although the White House is ready to use its executive power, it wants Congress to reform the de minimis exemption within the next few months. Specifically, it wants Congress to exclude textiles and apparel from the de minimis exemption and formally exclude products covered by section 301, section 201, or section 232 trade enforcement actions.

It's not an unreasonable request -- the de minimis issue is one that has bipartisan alignment in a polarized Congress.

The White House's proposal -- which should be released soon -- is similar to the End China's De Minimis Abuse Act (H.R. 7979), introduced in April by Rep. Gregory F. Murphy, R-N.C. That measure would prevent firms from applying the de minimis exemption to any goods subject to section 301 trade enforcement tariffs.

The White House's announcement has pleased Republicans and Democrats alike. House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo., said he, too, wants bipartisan legislation on the issue. ""They say imitation is the highest form of flattery, so I am pleased Democrats in Washington are once again acknowledging that Republicans' tough-on-China trade policy works,"" he said in a statement. ""Given that the Biden Administration has finally embraced Republicans' common sense reforms to prevent China's abuse of the de minimis threshold, I am hopeful that House Democrats will work with us to codify this policy into law.""

Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who in August introduced similar legislation under the Fighting Illicit Goods, Helping Trustworthy Importers, and Netting Gains (FIGHTING) for America Act, also praised the White House's announcement.

The United States is moving quickly on the matter, but other jurisdictions aren't far behind. The European Union is facing a similar de minimis issue, even though it applies a much lower €150 ($162) customs exemption. Germany -- the EU's largest market -- is being ""inundated"" with up to 400,000 low-value imports per day, according to member of European Parliament Engin Eroglu. The country's finance minister, Christian Lindner, thinks the bloc needs to scrap the exemption, according to Reuters.

The European Commission agrees; it actually called for the €150 exemption to be removed last year, but the proposal went nowhere. Some lawmakers think the bloc should revisit the issue. In March MEP Maximilian Krah asked the commission how it planned to address the rising number of de minimis imports, noting that ""customs duties are . . . paid on around one in every thousand packages.""

""Asian suppliers in particular, such as Temu, undermine this requirement by no longer sending large consignments on pallets -- instead, they package and ship goods individually in small packages and parcels. If a single product costs more than €150, it is -- if possible -- disassembled into its constituent parts, which are then shipped separately. This way, none of the individually shipped items costs more than €150,"" he said. ""The EU's Supply Chains Directive does not seem to have any effect.""

Krah asked the commission to divulge the amount of customs duties the bloc has lost because of the €150 customs exemption and further asked the commission to outline its response to the environmental burdens that high volumes of individual shipments present.

Paolo Gentiloni, European Commissioner for the Economy, didn't quite answer those questions, but he responded that risk management is ""essential"" for determining whether packages truly fall below the €150 threshold. The commission, he said, will ""use all available instruments to accelerate the EU customs reform and to coordinate and strengthen the enforcement activities against goods that pose health, safety and environmental risks, in cooperation with different EU enforcement-related bodies.""

Krah added that even if the customs exemption applies, e-commerce packages should be subject to an import turnover tax, and potentially to sales tax.

""In practice, however, these two taxes are paid only in exceptional circumstances,"" Krah said in another written question. ""First of all, non-EU traders like Temu only enclose a delivery note. Invoices showing the applicable taxes are hard to come by in practice, even upon repeated request. What is more, given the sheer volume of packages and parcels (approximately 900,000 per day), it is virtually impossible to levy charges. No import service has the capacity for this.""

Krah asked the European Commission to explain how it is addressing the issue and to provide member-state-level estimates of the amount of revenue they are missing.

Gentiloni responded that the commission wants e-commerce platforms to charge VAT and duties at the time of sale and share that information with customs. In the meantime, the European Parliament is reportedly looking at a new commission proposal to remove the customs duty exemption, according to the Guardian.

South Africa charges tariffs of up to 45 percent on clothing, but officials say foreign e-commerce companies are paying a fraction of that rate by shipping clothing in smaller packages. That's because the country allows importers to pay a 20 percent rate on shipments values at less than ZAR 500 ($28.90) and does not apply VAT to those parcels.

In August the South African Revenue Service announced that it is changing this system. In a release, the revenue authority said it ""noted legitimate concerns that have been expressed in the importation of several . . . goods, especially clothing, via e-commerce by a number of importers who have not been paying the obligatory customs duties and VAT on these imports, resulting in unfair competition with other industry players.""

There will be no more exemptions. Starting September 1, VAT is applied to low-value e-commerce shipments, in addition to the 20 percent customs duty. By November 1 SARS will apply a new set of reconfigured VAT rates to e-commerce shipments."

2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector's continued leadership and the bull market's broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023.

Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq's extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years.

The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the ""New Golden Age of Stock Picking"" that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that.

But, before diving deep into the Gorilla's top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail!

Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer

Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market's continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros.

August's deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs' (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power.

There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer's pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don't believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist.

The Fed's New Focus: Jobs and Growth

The Fed's fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer.

What's more, inflation is now officially in the Fed's rear-view mirror, and the past few months' trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed's Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed's new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years.

Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates.

Let's see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed's easing cycle.

Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead?

Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system's strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector's stability in the face of last year's regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla's main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024.

So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer's gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August's pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon.

Evidence for a ""soft landing"" is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia's war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks.

With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring ""Goldilocks"" conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions.

A Maturing Bull Market

Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a ""slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year."" By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter's grinding and ""boring"" advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don't closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets.

Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla's expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally's base is undeniable.

The odds are that this year's trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November's elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year's increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party!

If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year.

The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies.

Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won't slow down anytime soon.

Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth

AMT's average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry's profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors.

American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge.

Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company's core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters.

Financials and Valuation

American Tower's short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029.

The company's growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years' surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth.

American Tower's valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company's valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently ""underinvested"" due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally.

The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company's substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth.

Technicals and Recent Performance

AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company's fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock's all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year.

Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business.

Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company's recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM's growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story.

Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption

Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI's most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized ""in-house"" productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM's expertise, especially given the company's ""hands-on"" approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years.

IBM's strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company's hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM's latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon's (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth.

IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company's offerings fit well into IBM's strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path.

Financials and Valuation

IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM's operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM's operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company's further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters.

IBM's latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM's debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed's easing cycle.

In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM's business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come.

Technicals and Recent Performance

IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently ""testing"" the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200.

Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company's mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic.

The company's mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company's biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix's video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces.

Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push

For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses.

Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify's customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify's U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts.

Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify's diversification push. These new products could broaden the company's demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company's bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run.

Financials and Valuation

Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers' fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company's increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify's total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a ""cash cow"" would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates.

When it comes to evaluating Spotify's financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company's costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify's optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price.

Spotify's revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022.

Thanks to the past couple of years' positive developments, the company's financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify's valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks.

Technicals and Recent Performance

SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company's cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company's business continues to mature, the stock's sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla's picks while having the most upside potential as well.

Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company's strategic focus since well before going public in 2019.

Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company's platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors.

The company navigated the past couple of years' bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market's weakness for ""bolt-on"" acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space.

Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients

Tradewed defines itself as an ""operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,"" which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb's average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb's, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company's growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients.

For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company's addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential.

The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal.

Financials and Valuation

Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb's profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company's revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more.

Tradeweb's rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions.

Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company's financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company's growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years.

Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock's valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index.

Technicals and Recent Performance

Tradeweb's great execution is reflected in its shares' performance and the company's valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical ""support"" below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock.

Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the

U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber's core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company's ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the ""new economy"" over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the ""unicorn"" status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company.

Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber's revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion.

The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the ""big guns"" of the tech sector. Although Uber's markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed's easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant.

Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength

Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company's strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it's hard to question its strategic vision.

Uber One, the company's membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company's great execution.

Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber's platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver.

According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber's ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won't impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s.

Financials and Valuation

In its early years, profitability was Uber's achilles heel, but since 2018, the company's revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company's ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth.

Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics.

Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company's strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER's strong performance over the past couple of years.

Although the company's debt load is still substantial, Uber's swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company's bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here.

Technicals and Recent Performance

Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock's market value, with the company's surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER's relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point.

Conclusion

Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the ""boring"" truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s.

Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August's historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index's (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days.

Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it's important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed's painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher.

That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed's tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this ""rotation"" could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level.

This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla's hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential.

Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections.

With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!"
Putin Faces Risks His Energy Holdings Cannot Prevent?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielmarkind/2024/10/07/putin-faces-risks-his-energy-holdings-cannot-prevent/,2024-10-07T13:45:29Z,"As the Ukraine war progresses toward its third winter, Russian President Vladimir Putin finds himself besieged on numerous fronts. During the first 30 months of this conflict, Putin used his vast energy resources to hedge against the collapse of the Russian economy. Now, however, the oil and natural gas bounty may not be enough to keep Russia's economy afloat, as some captains of industry decide to distance themselves from the regime.

One of the secrets of Putin's longevity in the Byzantine world of Russian politics is his alliance with a handful of wealthy men known as oligarchs. While some of these men were allies of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, others rose with Putin since he succeeded Yeltsin in 2000. The first-generation oligarchs used their connections to purchase formerly state-owned Soviet assets in the 1990s, such as in the energy industry, for prices far below market. The ""Putin oligarchs"" used their ties to secure massive state contracts since the 2000s. ""Yeltsin's oligarchs"" gained substantial control over Russia's natural resources. All became potential targets of Mr. Putin if they happened to cross or displease him.

Despite the potential threat posed by Yeltsin-era oligarchs to his power, Putin often chose not to confront them but rather to co-opt, telling them they could keep their money and assets so long as they stayed out of politics. This gave them a stake in his regime, with a substantial penalty likely for those who chose to oppose him. Putin showed how heavy-handed he could be in the case of the opposition oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who he imprisoned for nine years beginning in 2003.

For twenty years few did. However, the script changed with the massive Ukrainian invasion in February 2022. Western governments slapped sanctions not only on Russian state assets but also on the possessions of many of the oligarchs, counting on whatever influence they might have over Putin to induce him to stop the fighting. As a result, men who had become accustomed to vacationing on the French Riviera and hosting lavish parties on their massive private yachts could no longer do so. Not only were they barred from traveling to many Western countries, but their yachts and other possessions were often seized from under them but cannot be sold unless a crime was committed. As the result, the seized assets remain in a legal limbo.

The dam may now begin to break. The last few months have seen more Putin allies, such as Vladimir Lisin and Albert Avdolyan, break with the Russian President, for the first time. Recently, Igor Rotenberg, who for some years now was quietly selling his stake in Russian companies, has rid himself of all of his holdings in the country.

This is significant because Igor Rotenberg, currently sanctioned by the EU had once been one of the prime beneficiaries of Gazprom Bureniye (Gazprom Drilling), a company that received contracts from the state gas monopoly, Gazprom. In December 2023, Rotenberg sold his shares of RTITS, more formally known as RT- Invest Transport Systems, his last major asset in Russia. Rotenberg, whose estimated net worth was once believed to reach $1.5B, was sanctioned by the UK in 2022 following Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine.

Igor is the son of Arkady Rotenberg, the Putin judo buddy from St. Petersburg, a sanctioned billionaire who is worth $4 billion and is on Forbes' billionaire list as #781. Despite his father's connections though, the young Rotenberg has distanced himself from politics in the country and from the regime.

All of this is happening as the West moves ever more aggressively to track and seize the assets of Russian oligarchs. On September 20, the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control designated seven oligarchs and 12 companies that they control as subject to having their assets frozen.

The sale of all of his assets by Igor Rotenberg and the recent anti-war comments made by Oleg Deripaska, may evidence a growing unease among the most powerful men in Russia who are outside of the security, military, or Vladimir's Putin's inner circle

Nevertheless, while it is clear that despite the economic sanctions, Vladimir Putin intends for Russia to remain a major energy power on the world stage, he will have to do so without the support of some of the high-profile businessmen who have led the country's energy industries for the last thirty years."
"Kamala Harris should prosecute Big Pharma, not bail it out",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-harris-should-prosecute-big-pharma-not-bail-out,2024-10-07T13:15:43Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

With less than six weeks before the election, Vice President Kamala Harris has been striking a populist tone, especially when it comes to taking on Big Pharma in her stump speeches. At a recent campaign rally, she touted her tie-breaking vote to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which granted Medicare the ability ""to go toe-to-toe with Big Pharma and negotiate lower drug prices.""

And to great fanfare, just before the Democratic National Convention, the White House announced that the first round of those drug price negotiations would save taxpayers a cool $6 billion - a major win for the American taxpayer.

Yet at this very moment, the Biden-Harris administration is quietly pushing for a multi-billion-dollar bailout of one of the nation's largest and wealthiest drug companies - a bailout that would be funded by those same taxpayers.

WISCONSIN POLL SHOWS HARRIS LEADING TRUMP BY 4, FORMER PRESIDENT AHEAD ON KEY ISSUES

The proposed bailout revolves around a patent infringement lawsuit. Arbutus and Genevant Sciences, two small biotech companies, allege that Moderna stole their patented lipid nanoparticle technology, which proved critical in developing Moderna's mRNA vaccine for COVID-19.

Though the case is yet to be decided, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and Federal Circuit Court of Appeals have already determined Arbutus' patents to be valid, despite Moderna's attempt to invalidate the patents before the pandemic. Given the stakes of this case, court-ordered damages could reach $3 billion, according to some analysts.

While this may appear to many as an obscure issue of corporations battling it out over patent infringement, there are serious ramifications for taxpayers here as well.

In a rare statement of interest filing, Department of Justice officials recently argued that due to an obscure federal law dating back to World War I, Moderna is excused from any patent infringement that may have occurred during Operation Warp Speed, the historic federal campaign to support COVID-19 vaccine development. If that's the case, the lion's share of the financial penalty for Moderna's potential wrongdoing will fall on U.S. taxpayers.

The law, known as Section 1498, essentially states that the government will compensate an inventor for patent infringement if the technology in question is ""used or manufactured by or for the United States.""

In times of great national need, the government may decide they need niche technology at a scale that the original patent-holding manufacturer can't provide. The law absolves the larger manufacturer from having to worry about licensing the patent from the original patent-holder or deal with the patent-holder taking them to court for infringement.

Put more simply, Section 1498 is similar to eminent domain, but rather than letting the government seize private land, it allows the government to seize patented inventions in emergencies and retroactively compensate the patent holders.

Here's where the DOJ's argument falls short, as Moderna's infringement clearly should not be covered by Section 1498. The government never asked them to infringe on the intellectual property of anyone else and never authorized widespread production of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine by other companies due to manufacturing capacity issues.

And critically, the vaccines in question weren't used exclusively or even primarily by the U.S. government - meaning military service members or other federal employees - but were instead distributed to regular Americans like you and me.

Yet at this very moment, the Biden-Harris administration is quietly pushing for a multi-billion-dollar bailout of one of the nation's largest and wealthiest drug companies - a bailout that would be funded by those same taxpayers.

""By or for"" government use has always been understood to mean that the U.S. government is the end user of the product in question - for instance, a patented technology that's appropriated for U.S. military use - not that it's merely a purchaser. Objectively, the U.S. government was merely one buyer among many purchasers of the vaccines - including many foreign governments and other foreign state-owned companies.

If the court overseeing the case accepts the DOJ's interpretation of Section 1498, it will set a precedent that companies that merely sell to the government, among other customers, are immune from patent infringement lawsuits. That result would be disastrous for our economy and a boon to wrongdoers.

Patents encourage innovation and risk-taking by enabling anyone with a novel idea to turn it into a real-world product - without bigger, entrenched rivals stealing it. Allowing huge corporations to essentially steal patented technology from small upstarts is the opposite of standing up for the little guy. It'd greatly disincentivize investments in research and development.

Harris has a strong history of standing up for the ""little guy"" going back to her early years as a prosecutor and San Francisco District attorney. The vice president should continue that legacy and make clear that in a Harris administration, large corporations will be held accountable if found responsible - a winning message in the final campaign stretch."
Heat And Drought Imperil The Panama Canal And Adjoining Rainforests,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2024/10/07/heat-and-drought-imperil-the-panama-canal-and-adjoining-rainforests/,2024-10-07T13:06:38Z,"Standing outside one of former General Manuel Noriega's retreats, I witnessed several ships waiting to pass through the Panama Canal. These included mega vessels carrying cargo and LNG. About 32 ships, or 6% of global maritime traffic, go through those locks daily. They pay billions in annual tolling fees and contribute 5% to 10% of Panama's gross domestic product.

The canal is shrouded by rainforests that store water, feeding the surrounding lakes and filling the locks that allow ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, climate change threatens water levels and is causing more extreme weather patterns, including prolonged droughts. Less rainfall results in less water, leading the canal operators to restrict the number of vessels passing through or the amount of cargo they can carry.

If water shortages become routine, the Panama Canal Authority must construct new reservoirs or desalination plants. This would lead to higher tolls for shipping companies, prompting them to seek alternative routes. I watched the ships pass through locks, which takes 8-10 hours. Since its completion in 1914, the canal has shaved 30-50 days off specific routes, saving exporters a ton of money and ensuring uninterrupted global commerce.

""Experts measure every drop of water every day,"" says Yafa Melamed, an environmental protection specialist for the Panama Canal Authority, at a talk in her office. ""We have a monitoring plan to check the water quality in the lake, rivers, and wastewater,"" with sensors and stations that measure rainfall and lake levels. ""We also monitor air quality.""

The Panama Canal is one of history's most impressive engineering achievements. It was constructed on Barro Colorado Island, which was mountainous before the canal's creation in 1914. The system includes locks that operate like an elevator, raising and lowering ships. The locks were designed to accommodate the largest vessels of the early 20th century, known as Panamax ships.

The Panama Canal Authority expanded the lock system from 2007 to 2016. This growth was necessary to serve larger vessels, known as Neopanamax ships. They can carry more cargo, resulting in higher tolling fees. However, potential water shortages threaten the canal's operation.

""During droughts, fewer ships pass through so that we can have more water to provide to the communities,"" which depend on it for drinking supplies, says Melamed. When the canal expanded, the authority performed environmental impact studies examining forest, soil, air, and water quality. ""To expand or modify now, we must address climate change and biodiversity.""

The Panama Canal relies on freshwater from rainfall and the adjoining rainforests, which store water in the soil. The canal's $5.25 billion expansion added two new locks to the existing three, allowing the system to handle four times as much cargo as before. This resulted in greater income for the authority and shipping companies.

However, the expansion requires more water; the larger Neopanamax ships traverse broader and deeper locks. On average, transit through the newer locks uses 50-60 million gallons of fresh water compared to 40-50 million gallons for the older locks. Moreover, salt water has crept into the lakes that feed the locks while human consumption has increased. Nevertheless, the newer technology allows recycling as much as 60% of the water.

Water management is a challenge. It may require building more reservoirs, new desalination projects, or diverting water from nearby rivers. ""However, increased warming leads to more evaporation, decreasing water availability,"" says Jeff Hall, a scientist with Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, during a hike through the Agua Salud Project. ""There has been an increased frequency of droughts in this part of the world, which leads to water uncertainty and potentially less transit.""

How does a drought affect the rainforests that provide water to the local lakes? Some trees tolerate the lack of rainfall, while others do not. That creates a system of winners and losers, underscoring the importance of diversity.

""A monoculture could die out, and the whole forest could collapse,"" says Hall. ""Diverse forests can survive. Forests have helped preserve the integrity of the canal watershed by preventing ecological disasters such as floods and providing water to the canal during the dry season.""

But when a drought is combined with extreme heat, it is a lethal one-two combo. Trees and plants take in water and release it into the atmosphere, delivering it worldwide. If they die, it means longer dry seasons. The rainforests further absorb atmospheric CO2. Without those trees, that CO2 is released back into the atmosphere.

""Warming doesn't happen in isolation,"" says Martijn Slot, a research biologist with the Smithsonian's institute, as we were on a crane above the canopy. ""It is often combined with droughts."" The result? ""The rate at which plants absorb CO2 tends to decrease while the rate at which CO2 is lost increases.""

The CO2 compounding effect is apparent. Since the industrial age, we have released increasing amounts of heat-trapping emissions. Almost every climate scientist agrees that humans have contributed to global warming. Consequently, temperatures increased by 1.1 degrees Celsius in 2023. If fossil fuel usage and deforestation rates remain unchanged, we will hit 1.5 degrees Celsius in 2030, resulting in more extreme weather patterns.

The Panama Canal's operators and the scientists who monitor the adjacent rainforests implicitly understand their symbiotic relationship.

Protecting the forests is a critical step in managing water resources and capturing CO2. When there is insufficient rainfall, trees act like sponges, releasing water into the canal's lakes. On the other hand, forests can also slow down the movement of water and prevent flooding. Global warming endangers that association.

Steve Paton, director of physical monitoring for the Smithsonian's institute, emphasizes the importance of rainforest preservation and decarbonization, stating, ""We can't wait for things to get worse. The cost of not taking action is too great.""

Climate change could upend Panama's economy, but it is hellbent on protecting its trees -- benefitting the entire planet. Indeed, the country's well-being is closely tied to the Panama Canal and the neighboring rainforests. Together, the two foster sustainable development and national wealth while contributing to the global economy and eco-viability.

Reporter's Note: This is the second in a series of three stories I have done on Panama. Here's the first one that profiles Panama's environmental and economic goals. The third one, which runs in a week, will focus on measuring rainforest preservation -- a key step in the quest to attract financing."
Forecasters Predict Tepid Holiday Sales Growth as Consumers Lean In to Austerity,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregpetro/2024/10/07/forecasters-predict-tepid-holiday-sales-growth-as-consumers-lean-in-to-austerity/,2024-10-07T13:05:56Z,"Consumer sentiment has ticked up, but forecasts for Q4 retail sales see only modest growth as shoppers trim their budgets.

The retail industry begins its annual fourth-quarter dash to the end of its fiscal year (Jan. 30), with the majority of consumers planning to spend the same or less on gifts compared to last year. Overall, industry forecasters predict decelerating sales growth this year, despite a recent rebound in the widely-followed University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment.

Regardless of whether the economy achieves a soft landing or avoids a recession, consumers are still adjusting to the stubbornly high costs of major living expenses, such as housing, cars, and insurance. Across several recent consumer surveys, a common theme emerges -- consumer confidence in the future is rising, but so are credit card debt and financial stress.

In a survey of 1,300 shoppers across the US, Canada, and the UK, 9 out of 10 (a full 90%) said they expect to spend 50% less on holiday gifts this year compared to 2023, according to project44, a logistics technology vendor.

A recent survey by Bankrate, a financial services platform, found that 33% of holiday shoppers plan to spend less this year, and another 43% plan to spend about the same. Consumers are embracing frugality, says Bankrate senior analyst Ted Rossman, because ""multiple years of high inflation and high interest rates have taken a considerable toll.""

The Bankrate survey also found that older generations ""are more likely to feel stretched thin during the holiday season."" A third of Gen X holiday shoppers said gift shopping will strain their budgets, while only one in five Gen Z respondents said the same.

Accounting network PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) reported similar results. Nearly 30% of respondents in its survey expect to spend less this season than last, marking a new high. A quarter of respondents said they will spend more, which -- except for pandemic-era 2020 -- was the lowest PwC has ever recorded.

The National Retail Federation, which has a strong track record for forecasting industry revenue, is projecting full-year fiscal 2025 sales growth of between 2.5% and 3.5%, down from fiscal 2024's final tally of 3.8%. While this might seem like a small number, it's based on a very large industry base.

Beneath the top line, there will be the usual suspects that outperform and those that lose ground or disappear. Walmart is projecting sales growth of up to 4.75% for the current year, and Amazon.com's e-commerce sales are expected to grow by more than 10%.

At the bottom of the list, companies that are perennially struggling include department store brands like Macy's and Neiman Marcus, apparel chains like Express Inc., and big-box hardware stores like Lowe's and Home Depot, along with some surprises like Nike.

One can only wonder how consumers feel about each of these companies' product offerings and why they are winning or losing."
Council Post: The Hidden Impact Of Fees On Inflation -- And What It Means For Businesses,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/10/07/the-hidden-impact-of-fees-on-inflation-and-what-it-means-for-businesses/,2024-10-07T13:01:45Z,"Inflation is a complex phenomenon influenced by many factors, from global supply chain disruptions to labor shortages. However, another often overlooked contributor is subtly driving prices higher across various sectors: fees.

These fees can take many forms -- service fees, convenience fees, processing fees -- and while they may seem insignificant in isolation, their cumulative effect can be profound, especially when considered across an entire industry or economy.

Take the facilities management industry, for example, where I operate daily. We see how hidden fees accumulate and significantly increase operational costs. From contract management fees to technology charges, these can sneak into agreements and strain company budgets.

Such fees are often passed down the supply chain, ultimately affecting pricing strategies and inflating costs for consumers. In retail, we've seen similar impacts, where incremental fees are contributing to the rising cost of goods and services.

The Proliferation Of Fees In Modern Business

In recent years, fees have become ubiquitous, tacked onto everything from airline tickets to hotel stays and banking services to utility bills and healthcare services. Companies often justify these fees as necessary to cover the costs of new technology, comply with regulations or provide additional services. However, many of these fees are more about padding the bottom line than covering actual costs.

An example is the rise of swipe fees in the retail sector. When consumers use a credit or debit card to make a purchase, banks and card networks like Visa and Mastercard charge retailers a ""swipe fee"" to process the transaction. The implementation of these fees, which average just over 2% of the transaction, has skyrocketed over the past two decades: Total swipe fees in the U.S. have grown from about $20 billion in 2001 to $172 billion in 2023.

The Ripple Effect On Prices

When companies pass on fees to consumers, the immediate impact is an increase in the price of goods and services. But the ripple effect goes beyond retail consumers.

It also affects the B2B environment, where businesses are not immune to the growing prevalence of hidden fees. As organizations encounter higher costs due to fees in areas like payment processing, shipping and vendor contracts, these costs are often passed along to other businesses in the supply chain, eventually reaching consumers.

In retail and B2B settings, these incremental fees can create a cycle of rising costs. In B2B transactions, where pricing can be complex, fees further complicate the financial landscape, squeezing margins and straining budgets. Whether a company is a direct consumer-facing business or a B2B provider, these rising operational costs can drive inflationary pressures that affect everyone down the line. Ultimately, even cautious and well-informed companies and consumers pay more as these fees accumulate.

Facilities Management: A Case Study In Hidden Fees

In facilities management (FM), fees are a pervasive issue. For example, backend fees -- such as per-work-order charges, implementation fees and support fees for data downloads and tailored reporting -- often add up across multiple service agreements.

At my company, we have encountered these costs frequently, and I think it's clear that a lack of transparency in such contracts can quickly inflate operational expenses. Many companies managing multi-location facilities have found themselves blindsided by unexpected charges that quietly accumulate into significant annual expenses.

Strategies For Transparency And Efficiency

Clients and consumers today are increasingly savvy, often scrutinizing the costs and fees associated with their services. Many seek value and transparency and quickly switch providers if they feel they're being overcharged.

However, when an entire industry collectively adopts practices that involve adding or increasing fees, the options for avoiding these costs become limited. This collective action can lead to widespread cost increases, impacting everyone, regardless of their choices.

Over the years, I have learned that businesses can combat these rising costs through a variety of strategies. Here are a few to consider:

1. Audit existing contracts regularly. Conduct regular audits of contracts to identify hidden fees. Many businesses miss recurring charges because they assume all fees are necessary. An audit helps reveal unnecessary or redundant fees that can be renegotiated or eliminated.

2. Establish clear upfront pricing. Ensure that pricing structures are clear and transparent from the outset, both internally and for clients. By listing all potential costs upfront, businesses can avoid unpleasant surprises later in the process. This practice helps build trust and reinforces long-term client relationships.

3. Consider automation to reduce labor costs. Automating repetitive processes, such as invoice management or payment processing, can reduce the labor costs associated with fee management. At my company, we've integrated platforms that streamline operations, thereby avoiding unnecessary tech and service fees.

4. Negotiate terms with vendors. If a vendor's service fees seem inflated or unnecessary, negotiate for more favorable terms. Explain the impact of hidden fees on your bottom line and leverage volume agreements to secure better terms.

A Broader Perspective

The issue of fees and their contribution to inflation reminds us that the costs we encounter as consumers and businesses are often more complex than they appear. While fees may be justified in some cases, their widespread and sometimes opaque application can have unintended consequences for the broader economy.

Given the above, and with rising costs across sectors, it is more important than ever for businesses to investigate alternative solutions and cost models that reduce or eliminate unnecessary fees. By understanding the role fees play in driving up prices, we can make more informed decisions by advocating for greater transparency, choosing service providers that prioritize efficiency or simply being more aware of the actual costs behind our prices.

In the end, I think controlling inflation isn't just about managing the big-ticket items; it's also about keeping an eye on the small fees that can have a significant impact.

Earnings Kickoff And World Conflicts Highlight The Week,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/07/earnings-kickoff-and-world-conflicts-highlight-the-week/,2024-10-07T12:47:57Z,"Oil Surge And Inflation Fears Threaten Economic Stability And Markets

A stronger than expected jobs report on Friday further eased fears of a slowing economy and allowed markets to stage impressive rallies to end the week. The S&P 500 closed higher by 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2%. For the week; however, markets were little changed. That came despite a wide trading range overall. As we head into this week, the expected move in the S&P 500 is 86 points, which means we could see a total trading range even bigger than last week.

It's going to be a data heavy week with much of it being of the qualitative variety. Fed members will be speaking throughout the week but what I think will be most interesting is the release of minutes from the last Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, due out Wednesday. These will be the minutes from the meeting at which the Fed decided to cut rates by half a point. With another Fed meeting not scheduled until November, I think a lot of investors are eager for a closer view into the last meeting and what members were thinking moving forward. I think this is especially true in the wake of Friday's jobs report and the response out of the bond market where we've seen yields on the 10-year note climb back above 4% for the first time since August. Then later in the week, on Thursday and Friday, we'll get the most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports.

Also on Friday, we'll kick off earnings season. JP Morgan and Wells Fargo are both scheduled to announce earnings and each bank offers a slightly nuanced view into the health of the economy. JP Morgan will likely discuss the health of consumers, spending habits and credit card debt. Wells Fargo often provides a look into the housing sector given their presence in the mortgage market.

As we prepare for a deluge of earnings over the next few weeks, it's worth noting the expectations for the quarter have fallen. At the end of June, estimates for third quarter earnings were a growth rate of 7.8% on a year-over-year basis. However, those estimates have since fallen and now stand at 4.2%, according to FactSet. While it is common to see estimates revised downward, these revisions are slightly larger than the average drop of around 3.3%. It's also worth noting that the S&P 500 is currently trading at 21.4x its expected 12-month forward-looking earnings, which is above its historical 10-year average of 18x and 5-year average of 19.5x. In other words, much like we saw at the end of the second quarter, stocks are fundamentally valued at levels above their norm.

The revised earnings growth rates and fundamental valuations may also explain the tempered enthusiasm for company stock purchases by insiders. An article in today's Wall Street Journal says insider purchases by officers and directors were at their lowest level in a decade. While purchases upticked in August and September, they are still below their 10-year average.

In addition to the economic news and earnings, we also have a couple other externalities that could make their way into the market this week. Oil, which was up 1% on Friday and 8% for the week, is something I'll be watching as the world continues to await possible continued escalation between Israel and Iran. Also, back here at home, we are less than thirty days away from the election and I would not be surprised if we see market volatility hold its current level of even increase as the election nears.

A couple individual stocks worth watching today include Chevron and Pfizer. Chevron is selling off some Canadian assets as part of a plan intended to divest between $10 to $15 billion by 2028. That stock is higher by just over 1% in premarket. Shares of Pfizer are higher by nearly 3% in premarket after it was announced that activist investor Starboard Value has taken a $1 billion position in the company.

For today, I am keeping my eye on oil and any news out of the Middle East. I think markets are already bracing for the economic data and upcoming earnings, but the geopolitical situation is the wildcard I'm most focused on. No one is entirely sure what response to expect from Israel and I think that adds a bit of volatility that's more difficult to quantify. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."
"Consumers Start Holiday Shopping Early, But High Prices On Essentials Drives Cutbacks",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sharonedelson/2024/10/07/consumers-start-holiday-shopping-early-but-high-prices-on-essentials-drives-cutbacks/,2024-10-07T12:31:16Z,"It's not even Halloween yet, but consumers already have Christmas on the brain. They're concerned about how prices of essentials will affect their budgets. In a survey by ESW, 61% said they'll spend more than $600 this holiday season, compared to 48% last year. Of the people who are spending less, about 47% said the high price of food and fuel will lead them to reduce spending.

""Even though global inflation is coming down, many consumers are still feeling stretched due to high essentials costs,"" said Martim Avillez Oliveira, chief revenue officer of ESW, a leader in direct to consumer ecommerce.

According to the survey, 37% of consumers have started their shopping journeys. As expected, Amazon Prime Deal Days and Black Friday are expected to be the biggest deal days of the season, with Cyber Monday coming in third place.

""Black Friday is where consumers plan to spend more money, and focus on deals and value,"" said Oliveira. ""We think global uncertainty isn't healthy for the economy. We're seeing that consumers will spend more, even though price and value was top of mind.""

From an intent perspective, consumers will spend more this holiday season, said Oliveira. Online will continue to grow, which means there are additional opportunities for online retailers to capture market share.

AI is going to be everywhere from physical to digital channels, smoothing store efficiencies and curating online experiences for shoppers. ESW found that 43% of consumers will shop more online.

""Retailers will have to make sure they have different promotions and loyalty schemes,"" Oliveira said. ""It's critical to understand who your customer is. Free shipping is now table stakes. In addition to free shipping, free returns are popular. We'll see free returns and other promotional activity like gifts-with-purchase and product bundles that consumers will expect from their preferred brands.""

ESW unlocks the local DTC channel for retailers. ""If you're a brand and want to capture or trial your product to international audiences, ESW acts as a merchant of record,"" Oliveira said. ""The brand can shift any liabilities and compliance requirements to the merchant of record [ESW].

Shopping cuts across demographic lines. For example, 51% of all consumers said they won't use TikTok for shopping, however, when broken down by age, 65% of millennials and Gen Z combined said they'll use TikTok for inspiration.

What categories will be popular? According to Oliveira, beauty will resonate with consumers, and ""private label will be able to stand out this year and gain more market share just because of the sensitivity and how price-conscious shoppers will be this season.""

In addition to free shipping, Oliveira sees omnichannel as table stakes this holiday season. ""That's a seamless commerce experience,""he said. """"For retailers, finding their most cost-effective routes to get their goods to the consumer will be important. And making sure they plan their inventory and their pools of stock according to where the demand lives, both domesticaally and internationally. From our perspective localizing inventory, making sure you have, for example, the right product, the right sizes and the right promotions, will be key."""
How EPC Firms Are Helping The Energy Sector Do 'More With Less',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gauravsharma/2024/10/07/how-epc-firms-are-helping-the-energy-sector-do-more-with-less/,2024-10-07T11:40:21Z,"As the energy industry embraces increasing calls for more efficiency, decarbonization and adoption of environmentally friendly business practices, they are increasingly turning to their engineering, procurement, and construction or EPC partners to replicate that in the built environment.

With large scale energy, oil and gas projects being a critical part of their business, EPC companies also appear to be embracing the challenge effectively turning into ""EPCM"" outfits, with the ""M"" incorporating management services as part of their broader client offering.

EPCM contracts now routinely involve sustainability targets, circularity or circular economy tenets and environmentally friendly practices in the construction and procurement value chain, according to research conducted by EY, based on its study 30 leading firms in the segment.

Furthermore, EY also notes that new global regulatory requirements will likely compel EPCM companies to disclose information about their own greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks in tandem with the sponsors of the projects they happen to be working on.

Nobody in the industry has any illusions about the scale of such a challenge. That too in an operating climate that until very recently saw EPCM companies clobbered by high inflation and interest rates whilst facing the constant age-old clamor for on time and on budget energy project delivery.

To manage the turbulence, many turned to technology and digital tools to the point that what once a subtle shift has now become routine.

Artificial intelligence, the industrial internet of things, robotics, construction data analytics, 3D and 4D printing, drones, virtual reality and augmented reality are all playing a vital role in enabling the EPCM segment become more efficient and sustainable across the life-cycle of the project, according to Chris Ashton, CEO of Worley, one of the largest companies operating in the segment.

""These digital tools are disrupting ways of working as they are deployed, leading to a reduction in time on repetitive tasks. And we see the development of digital platforms, the digital accelerant, as critical enablers to create trust amongst stakeholders and drive faster, more efficient project processes to move forward at speed,"" Ashton said.

He also appeared unfazed by the fact that some investments in emerging technologies carries the near-term risk of failure.

""We're regularly investing and are open to fail fast as we learn and pivot if roadblocks appear; leveraging advancements in information technologies; tapping into our global expertise, using standardized tools and processes to reduce costs and increase capital efficiency; and truly working in partnership with our customers to deeply understand their strategic plans for the future.""

According to EY, despite economic head winds, capital flows in construction technology or ConTech came in at just under $5.7 billion in 2022. Further growth is expected when latest data is available early in 2025.

An evolving built environment within the energy sector inevitably requires construction equipment partners to also respond in kind and they are, said Gavin Kerr, Director Global of Services at Mammoet, the world's largest engineered heavy lifting and transport company.

""We own and operate most of the world's largest cranes, and large jacking systems and transporters that are specialized to lift the heaviest loads built by humanity. Recognizing the growing need for efficiency and sustainability in EPCM segment, we recently launched the world's strongest land-based crane - the SK6000.""

It has a maximum capacity of 6,000 tons and can lift components of up to 3,000 tons, roughly the weight of six Airbus A380 super-jumbo aircraft, to a height of 220 meters.

""Such a capacity allows for critical components to be simultaneously built offsite anywhere in the world, before being transported to the actual project site ahead of installation. This potentially allows our EPC customers to build efficiently in larger pieces and shrink their project logistics, integration and mobilization phases in the construction cycle,"" Kerr added.

Ultimately, it is all about helping project developers reach first power generation or first hydrocarbon production sooner.

The evolving climate has resulted in EPCM companies and equipment makers becoming co-drivers of industry change for their project partners. Nowhere is it more visible than at industry trade shows and exhibitions in general, and ADIPEC in Abu Dhabi in particular. Regularly billed as the world's largest energy event of its kind, it attracts nearly 200,000 attendees every year.

Among its over 2,000 exhibitors will be 30 of world's largest EPCM companies and energy construction equipment makers of all shapes and sizes jostling for attention at a 155,000 square foot facility.

How EPCM corporate exhibits, displays and business pitches to world have evolved over the year offer ample proof of ""changing times"" according to Christopher Hudson, President of dmg events, an organizer of over 30 global energy events in a typical calendar year including ADIPEC.

""When we look at ADIPEC and go back as recently as ten years ago, it was primarily an oilfield services show. But since then, it has gradually transformed into a broader energy show with many, dare I say most, participants making their displays more cognizant of need to address the energy sector's efficiency and sustainability challenge,"" Hudson said.

""It feels different for us as platform creators. Even as recently as 10 years ago, you'd see very traditional exhibition booths of 100 sq meters with a drill bit here, a lifting equipment display and generator model there. Now it's far more technology driven with often two to three level stands, pods and meeting rooms.

And not only that, the EPCM exhibition boot of today also highlight specific technology and efficiency gains that can be achieved from energy project conception to completion - to produce on one level and generate at another level and how you split within that supply chain at, Hudson added.

""There is a clear reason for this. The major energy companies need to invest heavily in sustainability and decarbonization remains a key ADIPEC theme - something that 12 leading energy CEOs committed to in Abu Dhabi in 2023. The EPCM segment is key if this is to be achieved, and we see firms operating in the sphere adapting to opportunities presented by an evolving climate, something that's reflected in their displays and exhibits.""

Doing 'more with less' - or in other words achieving improved throughput / energy generation, doing so sustainably and whist using less energy - has become imperative for the industry. Therefore, ditching the old way of doing things is both mission critical and commercially logically for the EPCM segment and research strongly points to it, says Worley's CEO Ashton.

""Our thought leadership work with Princeton University Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment shows us that executing projects the same way we always have will not get us to net zero by 2050. In fact, we won't even get halfway. So we must change, and are changing, how we traditionally deliver projects.""

Ashton added that energy project sponsors are balancing strategic investments supporting their move to a lower carbon future and at the same time managing shareholder, investor, and society's environmental and sustainability expectations with the complex capital management, regulatory and jurisdictional frameworks within which they operate.

""Over the past five years, we've seen our customers shift to partner with Worley, to share their strategic plans and work together to drive down costs while delivering projects in new and innovative ways. And by working in partnership with our customers on their vast portfolios of projects, we're delivering real, life-time value across their assets.""

This will in all probability accelerate in a fiercely competitive post-pandemic EPCM market."
How Data From Space Is Transforming Mobility Services,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwyman/2024/10/07/how-data-from-space-is-transforming-mobility-services/,2024-10-07T11:38:28Z,"The satellite industry has been transformed in recent years from one with a few, mostly government-controlled, high-orbit vehicles into one with a proliferation of smaller, low-orbit constellations of multiple satellites dominated by commercial enterprises. All that has given the global economy and mobility systems in particular access to new data and applications that are leading to major efficiencies in the operation of various networks and ultimately better service for end users.. They include everything from systems that monitor airport operations and provide dynamic roadway traffic management to automated rail and public transport services that enable automated ticketing and trip planning. By our estimates, these markets should see annual growth of 5% to 10% through 2030, but they need more players with vision to realize their true potential.

Space-based mobility systems are ushering in not only a new era of data availability but also a new ecosystem of providers looking to replace current capabilities. The new players are operating in such areas as fleet management, advanced driver assistance systems, public transport, emergency assistance, insurance telematics, bike sharing, and congestion control, and as space-based data collection expands so do the possibilities for new services. Space-based technologies is one of nine megatrends analyzed in our 2024 report on sustainable mobility, ""Fast-Tracking The Mobility Revolution,"" written in collaborations with mobility and infrastructure operator

The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) -- constellations that provide positioning, navigation, and timing data for a host of transportation networks and individual vehicles -- has spawn new technology and services markets that already total over $460 billion Mundys SpA.

A plethora of space-based data possibilities

GNSS data has been available to the public free of charge for years. But two innovations have opened new possibilities for its use. First, the ability to process data has significantly improved. Next, there has been a steep reduction in the cost of launching satellites, leading to the creation of more privately held constellations and the ability to collect even more accurate data. Couple that with the higher expectations of mobility consumers for personalized services and the development of new data-driven mobility solutions using space data seems an inevitability.

By far, the two biggest segments for these new services are consumer applications in tourism and healthcare, including fitness apps, and road and automotive management. They make up more than 90% of today's space-based mobility services marketplace. For instance, the big users or potential users in automotive and roadway management are fleet operators, traffic enforcement, toll collection, insurance companies, and car owners themselves.

But the market is changing rapidly as more companies become knowledgeable about the data-collection possibilities in space. If there is one thing holding growth back, it's this lack of awareness of the possibilities among enterprises with the wherewithal to develop them.

New markets opening up

One of the newest sectors to enter the fray is aviation. Here, real-time data collected from satellites can prove an immense enhancement of navigational and weather monitoring capabilities. For airports, the space data is providing accurate positioning data for improved air traffic management and flight navigation, forecasting weather conditions, and enabling real-time communication between aircraft and ground control, even in remote areas.

Most of these are only on the cusp of reaching commercial scale. When they do, there is likely to be a good deal of market disruption for those not accessing the endless data space provides. Ultimately, space-based data could be the artificial intelligence of the next decade if companies can expand their vision on the possibilities."
"Mortgage Rates Today: October 7, 2024 -- Rates Move Up",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-10-07-24/,2024-10-07T11:32:12Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

The current average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.82%, according to Curinos. The average rate on a 15-year mortgage is 5.96%, while the average rate on a 30-year jumbo mortgage is 6.87%.

Today, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage is 6.82%, compared to last week when it was 6.67%.

The annual percentage rate (APR) on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is 6.84%. The APR was 6.67% last week. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

With today's interest rate of 6.82%, a 30-year fixed mortgage of $100,000 costs approximately $653 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included), the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. Borrowers will pay about $135,077 in total interest over the life of the loan.

Today, the 15-year mortgage rate sits at 5.96%, higher than it was at this time yesterday. Last week, it was 5.69%.

The APR on a 15-year fixed is 5.99%. It was 5.72% this time last week.

At today's interest rate of 5.96%, a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage would cost approximately $842 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. You would pay around $51,515 in total interest over the life of the loan.

The current average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage is 6.87% -- 0.12 percentage point up from last week. The 30-year jumbo mortgage rate had a 52-week APR low of 5.50% and a 52-week high of 10.50%.

A 30-year jumbo mortgage at today's fixed interest rate of 6.87% will cost you $657 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. On a $750,000 jumbo mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment would be approximately $4,924.

The first step on your homebuying journey should be to calculate affordability. You'll want to find out how much you can afford based on things like income, debt and savings.

Here are a few important factors that go into home affordability:

The annual percentage rate (APR) represents a loan's interest rate and fees, expressed as an annual cost over the life of the loan. It's essentially the all-in cost of the loan.

The APR is a helpful number because it shows you the total cost of a mortgage if you keep it the entire term.

Multiple factors affect the interest rate for a mortgage, including the economy's overall health, benchmark interest rates and borrower-specific factors.

The Federal Reserve's rate decisions and inflation can influence rates to move higher or lower. Although the Fed raising rates doesn't directly cause mortgage rates to rise, an increase to its benchmark interest rate makes it more expensive for banks to lend money to consumers. Conversely, rates tend to decrease during periods of rate cuts and cooling inflation.

Home buyers can make several moves to improve their finances and qualify for competitive rates. One is having a good or excellent credit score, which ranges from 670 to 850. Another is maintaining a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio below 43%, which implies less risk of being unable to afford the monthly mortgage payment.

Further, making a minimum 20% down payment can help you avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI) on conventional home loans. If you can afford the larger monthly payment, 15-year home loans have lower rates than a 30-year term.

Conventional home loans are issued by private lenders and typically require good or excellent credit and a minimum 20% down payment to get the best rates. Some lenders offer first-time home buyer loans and grants with relaxed down payment requirements as low as 3%.

For buyers with limited credit or finances, a government-backed loan is usually the better option as the minimum loan requirements are easier to satisfy.

For example, FHA loans can require 3.5% down with a minimum credit score of 580 or at least 10% down with a credit score between 500 and 579. However, upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums can apply for the life of the loan.

Buyers in eligible rural areas with a moderate income or lower may also consider USDA loans. This program doesn't require a down payment, but you pay an upfront and annual guarantee fee for the life of the loan.

If you come from a qualifying military background, VA loans can be your best option. First, you don't need to make a down payment in most situations. Second, borrowers pay a one-time funding fee but don't pay an annual fee as the FHA and USDA loan programs require."
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: October 7, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-10-07-24/,2024-10-07T11:31:44Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

Rates on savings accounts are going down. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Shopping for an account where you can put some money aside? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are notorious for paying puny interest rates. But if you know where to look, you can find rates 10x higher. Several online banks and credit unions pay rates that are far more competitive than those offered by brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you spot a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.23%, Curinos says. Last week, it was 0.24%. APY, or annual percentage yield, reflects the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts generally pay considerably higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the thing to know is you may have to jump through some hoops for the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.89%. You'll be in good shape if you can find an account offering a rate close to 4.89%. Last week at this time, the best rate was 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's about the same as last week's APY.

If you're shopping around for a traditional savings account, high-yield savings account or MMA, you'll want to remember a few key points.

A great interest rate is important, but it's not the only factor that matters when picking an account to hold your savings. Another major consideration is whether the account has a minimum deposit -- and whether you can come up with the cash.

You'll also want to understand the fees. Savings accounts can come with monthly maintenance fees, excess transaction fees (if you ignore limits on withdrawals) and other pesky charges that can bite into your returns.

And before you open an account, look into a financial institution's reputation and safety. You should trust your bank or credit union and feel like you're in good hands. Read the reviews, see what account holders have to say about customer service and learn about how the financial institution responds to consumer questions.

Search for an account that's insured by the FDIC or, in the case of credit unions, the NCUA. Those federal agencies provide up to $250,000 in insurance per depositor and per bank for each account ownership category.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
SAP BrandVoice: How To Create A Strategy To Reduce Youth Unemployment,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2024/10/07/how-to-create-a-strategy-to-reduce-youth-unemployment/,2024-10-07T11:28:18Z,"The global education goal, part of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), remains significantly off track. Various reports, including from UNESCO and UN news, highlight the concerning trend that unless drastic changes occur the world will not meet its commitments to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education by 2030.

The world today is grappling with a polycrisis - a complex set of interconnected global challenges that impact economies, industries, and job markets simultaneously. From climate change and geopolitical tensions to technological disruptions and economic instability, these crises are reshaping the landscape of work, especially for young people. While youth unemployment remains high, employers worldwide are also struggling to fill critical roles, highlighting a significant skills gap.

According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), global youth unemployment was 13% in 2023, with many young people facing limited prospects for stable and decent work. On the flip side, the World Economic Forum (WEF) found that 44% of businesses report difficulties in finding talent with the right skills to fill jobs. This contrast reflects a deepening mismatch between the supply of young job seekers and the demand for skilled talent, which, if left unaddressed, will exacerbate both unemployment and the talent shortage.

To tackle this challenge, we must take a comprehensive, systems-based approach, focusing on five interconnected elements: economy, education, employability, equality, and the ecosystem. Together, these factors can help close the skills gap, reduce youth unemployment, and create pathways to decent work for all.

Economic growth remains a critical driver of job creation, but the quality and inclusivity of that growth matter. In many parts of the world, jobless growth has become a pressing concern, as economies expand without generating enough formal employment opportunities for young people. Youth unemployment continues to rise even in nations with positive GDP growth, indicating that inclusive economic policies and investment in key sectors are lacking (ILO, 2024).

Moreover, the alignment between economic growth and investment in education is critical. The Global Education Monitoring Report 2023 highlights that national budgets for education often fall short of the recommended 4%-6% of GDP that UNESCO advocates. Without adequate financial support, education systems cannot provide the skills and competencies needed to prepare young people for modern job markets, leaving many young workers without the necessary tools to succeed.

Education systems need to evolve to meet the changing demands of the workforce. The OECD - OCDE emphasizes the importance of embedding skills, knowledge, attitudes, and values into education systems to ensure that young people are prepared for lifelong learning. In particular, stackable credentials - modular qualifications that allow learners to build expertise over time - are becoming an essential component of successful education-to-employment transitions.

For more information on how SAP is helping the world run better and improving people's lives all year round, visit sap.com/csr

Despite the need for adaptable learning pathways, many education systems remain rigid and slow to adopt these models. However, countries that have embraced flexible learning, such as Germany with its robust vocational education and training (VET) programs, have been able to reduce youth unemployment significantly. The integration of industry-specialized learning and competency-based education is critical for preparing young people to thrive in an evolving workforce, particularly in sectors like technology and sustainability.

One of the most significant barriers to reducing youth unemployment is the skills mismatch - the gap between what young people learn and what employers need. The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2023 projects that 50% of employees will need reskilling by 2025 due to rapid technological advancements. Yet, traditional education systems are often not aligned with industry needs, leaving many young workers without the skills required for high-growth sectors.

Governments and businesses must collaborate to ensure that training programs are directly linked to market demand. Public-private partnerships, such as apprenticeship programs and industry-led training initiatives, can play a pivotal role in closing the skills gap. For example, in Switzerland, where education and training are tightly integrated with the labor market, youth unemployment is among the lowest in the world. Building a system that continually adapts to changing workforce needs is essential for improving youth employability.

Recent trends show that many young people increasingly prefer entrepreneurship over traditional employment, driven by the desire for independence and the ability to create change. A 2019 study by Deloitte found that 76% of millennials view entrepreneurship as a key vehicle for driving social impact. However, research highlights the need for robust support systems to help these young entrepreneurs succeed.

The 2021 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor emphasizes that access to entrepreneurial education, mentorship, and skill development is critical for youth to thrive in their ventures.

Any strategy to reduce youth unemployment must prioritize equality, ensuring that opportunities are equally accessible to all young people, regardless of their background, gender, or location. Despite advances in education, women and marginalized communities continue to face barriers to entry in high-growth industries, particularly in STEM fields. According to UNESCO, only 35% of STEM graduates are women, highlighting the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

Programs that specifically target underrepresented groups - such as mentorships and women-in-tech initiatives - can help diversify the talent pipeline. Furthermore, companies that emphasize inclusive hiring practices, gender parity, and equity in leadership are not only contributing to social justice but also benefiting from a more innovative and dynamic workforce. The data is clear: promoting diversity is a strategic advantage in the modern economy.

A thriving job market requires more than just a functioning economy and well-prepared workers - it needs a cohesive ecosystem where governments, businesses, educational institutions, and civil society work together efficiently. The OECD underscores the importance of synergy across the value chain, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned toward the goal of reducing unemployment and fostering decent work.

Successful models of ecosystem collaboration, like those seen in Singapore, offer valuable lessons for other nations. In these countries, the government plays a central role in orchestrating cooperation between educational institutions and industries to ensure that young people are being trained in fields that are projected to grow. Such synergies foster an environment where young people can transition smoothly from education to employment and where employers can easily find the talent they need.

As respective leaders, SAP and UNICEF join forces to create innovative solutions to global skilling and workforce challenges with an aim to help young people transition to earning. Together, we're generating inclusive opportunities for underserved young people worldwide, preparing them for decent work with the skills that employers need.

We expanded our partnership in 2022, with a three-year investment focused on impacting youth in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa through a new program that supports learning to earning pathways in growing digital and green economies. The program helps equip youth with the essential skills they need to flourish - wherever they may see their future. Further, it builds on UNICEF's Generation Unlimited (GenU) signature program, Youth Agency Marketplace (YOMA), a platform developed by young Africans to tackle labor market challenges and increase youth agency across the globe.

By the end of the first year, SAP and UNICEF's GenU reached more than 600,000 youth, granting them access to foundational and digital skills opportunities that help young people unlock opportunities in the changing global economy.

One of the learn to earn pathways on YOMA is the SAP Educate to Employ initiative designed by SAP to help equip beneficiaries with essential competencies for the digital economy. The free initiative, implemented by the local non-profit UMUZI, focuses on developing skills, knowledge, attitudes, and values to help prepare candidates for employment.

It also aims to assist employers in accessing diverse and certified talent, thereby accelerating digital transformation in each country through a skilled talent pipeline. More than 1,000 learners completed one or more foundational skills courses, while 165 learners completed over 400 hours of critical skills development training and achieved an SAP certification for technology consultant beginners. Additionally, 100 learners have completed their intermediate training on the SAP Learning site and are preparing for SAP-certified associate exams.

This multistakeholder approach underscores the power of partnership in addressing complex social challenges. By pooling expertise and resources, SAP, UNICEF's GenU, and UMUZI are collectively ensuring that youth not only gain relevant skills but also access meaningful pathways to employment. These partnerships exemplify the collaborative frameworks needed to drive sustainable impact on a global scale. As digital and green economies continue to reshape the future of work, partnerships that unite private, public, and civil society actors will remain crucial in ensuring that marginalized youth are not left behind.

The polycrisis we face today demands multidimensional solutions that address both the supply and demand sides of the labor market. By focusing on the interconnected elements of economy, education, employability, equality, and ecosystem, we can create a comprehensive strategy to reduce youth unemployment and foster decent work for all.

Policymakers, business leaders, and educators must come together to close the skills gap, promote inclusive growth, and build resilient labor markets. The challenges are great, but so are the opportunities. With coordinated effort and sustained investment, we can build a future where young people have the skills, opportunities, and support they need to thrive in the global economy."
Why We Need AI: Alphabet's Moonshot To Save The World's Electrical Grid,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsiegel/2024/10/07/why-we-need-ai-alphabets-moonshot-to-save-the-worlds-electrical-grid/,2024-10-07T11:28:08Z,"Humanity's largest machine is demanding an overhaul. We built this behemoth haphazardly and yet we rely on it absolutely. Now we must fix it.

The electrical grid is the vascular system of modern society -- but it wasn't originally designed for its current immense scale. Nor was it designed to evolve, as it must, to seamlessly assimilate an inpouring of clean energy sources like wind and solar.

This brewing crisis presents one of the highest-stakes challenges imaginable for infotech as a field: Across trillions of overtaxed, aging components -- most of which date back to the 1960s and 1970s -- which ones demand maintenance first?

Predictive AI to the rescue -- and boy do I mean it this time. Only with machine learning models will we be able to address this century's greatest global infrastructure crisis.

Google's parent company Alphabet has established a new paradigm to supercharge grid upkeep globally. Here's how the paradigm works -- with the help of AI -- and how it not only scales critical maintenance but also sets a foundation for the grid's next evolutionary development: full-scale support for clean energy.

Grid operators can't keep up. Most still perform inspections manually -- workers approach individual components, clipboard in hand. Staff can only inspect a small fraction of potentially rusty, broken or otherwise failing poles, pins and transformers.

To lead a sweeping high-tech overhaul of the global grid, an organization would need large-scale instrumentation resources, a brand reputation capable of rallying worldwide participation and an aptitude and appetite for attempting moonshots.

Enter the world's only ""moonshot factory,"" X, part of Alphabet and therefore a sister of Google. X's initiative to take on this and related energy challenges is called Tapestry, described as, ""Making the world's electric grid visible so everyone can access clean, reliable energy.""

To put eyes on the problem, X taps Google's immense image database originally collected for Street View -- you know, the panoramic, street-level perspectives you can access in Google Maps.

X is also exploring the advantages of new, customized image-collection efforts. It rejiggers the hardware developed to collect Street View images, mounting it on the vehicles of energy partners to roam their terrains and collect photos of their grid components. In the last couple of years, vehicles outfitted with this hardware have covered several thousand miles in -- for example -- Michigan, as part of a joint initiative with the state's largest energy utility, Consumers Energy.

Out of the frying pan and into the fire. This scaled-up monitoring provides ideal, centralized visibility -- but it's too much to look at. The problem is we don't know what the problem is. Among trillions of components, which ones have a defect or impending failure set to cause an outage -- or even a dangerous incident like a fire?

The antidote to information overload is predictive AI, the use of machine learning models to triage and prioritize. It's a rule of thumb for the Information Age: Warehousing data isn't enough. To leverage any newfound source of data, you've got to learn from it. Machine learning has become imperative.

By targeting maintenance right where it's needed most, predictive AI fortifies the grid. Once trained, ML models predictively score individual cases -- incoming field photos that may or may not reveal an impending issue -- which are then prioritized for human inspection. Acting on this great number of incoming images is largely a matter of establishing a strategic decision threshold so that the most urgent issues are properly flagged -- and yet not too many flags come in, overwhelming staff.

This predictive targeting parallels another X project, Bellwether, which informs first responders where to go after climate catastrophes. Bellwether uses AI to prioritize photos captured from aircraft, whereas Tapestry prioritizes photos captured from land vehicles.

The wins are in. Even after early deployments, Consumers Energy credits Tapestry with reducing massive outages by 11.2 minutes during 2022, according to testimony given to the Michigan Public Service Commission. Each of these minutes are estimated to cost the Michigan economy $3.6M.

As with many machine learning initiatives, manually labeling the data presents a bottleneck (although nowhere near the bottleneck of manually surveilling equipment out on the field with a clipboard). X must manually label thousands of images that reveal defects and it partners with the experts, system operators, to do so. ML needs these labeled examples -- along with non-defective examples as well. Crunching the numbers, it learns how to differentiate between positive and negative cases.

As Tapestry gains traction globally, it's enabling fruitful data-sharing cooperation between its customers. For example, Vector, which provides power to most of New Zealand's population, is benefiting from the work done with Michigan's Consumers Energy. After all, the two don't compete for business.

""This global cooperation works because some patterns are universal,"" Tapestry lead Page Crahan told me. Her team trained a model for Michigan and then tried it out on images from Auckland, New Zealand, where grid infrastructure looks entirely different, e.g., transformers are located on the ground rather than on a pole.

Amazingly, the model performed fairly well. ""The Michigan model identifies 84% of faults on poles and cross-arms in New Zealand,"" Crahan said. ""To take advantage of this international crossover, we're now developing a practice for tuning and repurposing models to transfer well across geographies. This scales our efforts by greatly reducing the investment needed to cover grids globally.""

Similar arrangements have emerged in other industries. For example, FICO's payment card fraud detection system, called Falcon, greatly benefits from shared data across a consortium of over 9,000 banks, all cooperating for the common good. Likewise, ""Flood behavior on the East Coast of the U.S. can be used to forecast floods on the West Coast,"" the lead for Bellwether told me.

The Tapestry project began only a few years ago, but this singular initiative is positioned to weave a new fabric of intercontinental energy management. Several other grid operators also have signed on as customers and more are in the pipeline.

But wait, there's more! All this grid monitoring doesn't only serve grid maintenance -- it also builds the foundational visibility needed for grid advancement and expansion. This addresses much longer-term, larger-scale concerns. Keeping the grid working is critical, but radically evolving it for a new future of energy is an even greater challenge. In my next article, I will continue with that part of the story."
Blue Philly working class voters start leaning towards Trump ahead of election: 'People actually love him',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/blue-philly-working-class-voters-start-leaning-towards-trump-ahead-election-people-actually-love-him,2024-10-07T11:17:30Z,"Working-class Philadelphia Democrats may be planning to vote for former President Trump in November.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Wednesday about growing trends among poorer wards and districts in the Pennsylvania city to shift towards the Republican Party despite years of being solidly blue.

One example the report cited included 27-year-old Gabriel Lopez who registered as a Democrat and voted for Hillary Clinton for his first election in 2016. Since then, he changed his registration to Republican and voiced his support for Trump.

""Democrats keep saying [Trump] is going to bring down the economy, but he was already president for four years, and taxes were lower,"" Lopez said. ""We're tired of the same politics. We got a different type of guy, and the people actually love him.""

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

The article added, ""Lopez embodies one of Democrats' biggest problems in Pennsylvania: working-class voters in Philadelphia, a once reliable voting bloc for the party, have drifted right in recent years. And they've been disproportionately affected by rising prices over the last several years, an issue many blame Democrats for.""

Although Philadelphia, which holds 20% of the state's Democratic voters, may be crucial for Vice President Kamala Harris to win the state, the Inquirer reported the city lost the most Democratic voters out of any city in the 2020 election.

The trend was most pronounced in poorer, less-educated areas with majority-Latino neighborhoods showing the most movement, likely concerned about the economy.

Retired truck driver and registered Democrat Jim Kohn listed that as his top issue.

""When Trump was president, everything was cheaper,"" Kohn said. ""Now, everything is so sky-high.""

Other Democrats in the area remained optimistic about Harris' chances, though some understood the growing support for Trump.

""Many of us have people in our families who have gone to jail, or gone to schools that have failed us. We're not trustful of the government,"" Álvarez Febo, a Democrat who plans to vote for Harris, said. ""Then you have someone like Trump, who is a liar, and for some people, it's like, 'you know something? He's an honest representation of what we feel.'""

""They're saying Kamala is going to save our democracy,"" Febo added. ""That means very little for people who can't keep the lights on.""

Some Republicans, by contrast, were very optimistic about a potential political shift in the city.

""When I first started in politics in 1978, the managerial class was Republican -- no one votes the way their bosses vote,"" 45th Ward GOP Leader Charlie O'Connor said. ""Now, most people in the managerial class vote Democratic and no one is voting the way their boss is. So it's been a flip. Most of the bosses are Democrats and the Democratic Party has become the party of the upper middle class.""

Pennsylvania is considered one of the most competitive states for this presidential election. A Fox News survey found Harris and Trump tied at 49% among likely voters in the state. Trump previously won Pennsylvania in the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton but lost the state in 2020 to President Biden."
"Beyond Meat Stock Has 24% YTD Decline, But Can Sentiment Change?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/07/beyond-meat-stock-has-24-ytd-decline-but-can-sentiment-change/,2024-10-07T11:07:25Z,"After almost a 24% decline this year, at the current price of around $6 per share, we believe Beyond Meat stock (NASDAQ: BYND), a plant-based meat alternative - is fairly priced. BYND stock has dropped from around $8 to $6 year-to-date, largely underperforming the broader indices, with the S&P growing about 20% over the same period. The company has been facing challenging revenue and considerable cash burn for about three years now - thanks to the combination of inflation, pandemic-related shifts in demand, and rising competition. Although it would be premature to declare Beyond Meat's stock as irreparable, the company's current trajectory suggests a challenging outlook with no clear escape from its detrimental cycle.

In Q2 2024, the company's revenue of $93 million was down almost 9% year-over-year (y-o-y), driven by a 14% decrease in the volume of products sold. BYND also saw its revenues decline somewhat moderately in Q2 from an -18% y-o-y decline in Q1, but again this is largely a function of prior-year comps easing as well. BYND scaled back on promotional trade discounts in the recent Q2. Along with price increases on certain products in the U.S., this resulted in a 6.1% increase in its net revenue per pound compared to the year-ago period, which includes a ~21% increase in its U.S. retail channel (largest segment) net revenue per pound. Thanks to this, the revenue declines softened in Q2 and gross margins made a major recovery. However, there are still several headwinds that continue to pressure BYND stock in the future. In the U.S., the company's distribution has maxed out, while inventory levels remain high. Moreover, the company is dealing with low plant utilization and lower product volume. The company also has a substantial amount of debt in its capital structure, which may become a meaningful risk factor in the current high-interest rate environment. BYND has $1.14 billion in debt (due in 2027) on its balance sheet and a limited cash runway of $145 million (down from $194 million at year-end 2023). All said, BYND's most pressing issues still have not been addressed.

Notably, BYND stock has performed worse than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were -48% in 2021, -81% in 2022, and -28% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period.

Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BYND face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?

Beyond Meat's gross margin turned negative in 2023 and 2022 compared to its positive gross margins of 25% in 2021 and 30% in 2020. It should be noted that the company achieved a 4.9% gross margin in Q1 2024 and showed a substantial improvement to 14.7% in Q2 2024. Price increases have helped in this improvement along with lower cost of goods sold per pound and higher net revenue per pound. In addition, the company's adjusted Q2 EBITDA came in at a loss of $23 million compared to a loss of $41 million in the year-ago period. Beyond Meat was able to bring its operating cash flow losses down to -$47.8 million so far, roughly half of the year-ago loss, driven by the gross margin expansion and reduction in operating expenses from headcount efficiencies.

We forecast Beyond Meat's Revenues to be $326 million for the fiscal year 2024, down 5% y-o-y. We now forecast revenue per share to come in at $5.07. Given the changes to our revenues and RPS forecast, we have revised our Beyond Meat's Valuation to $6 per share, based on a $5.07 expected RPS and a 1.2x P/S multiple for the fiscal year 2024 - almost in line with the current market price. Beyond Meat expects net revenues to be in the range of $320 million to $340 million in FY 2024, representing a decrease of approximately 7% to 1% compared to 2023. The company continues to anticipate operating expenses to be approximately $180 million to $190 million. Also, the company expects further gross margin progress across the balance of the year, reflecting the combined impact of more fully distributed pricing adjustments and continued moderation of promotional spending.

"Meta's New Creator Program: A Step Forward Or Too Little, Too Late?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianshepherd/2024/10/07/metas-new-creator-program-a-step-forward-or-too-little-too-late/,2024-10-07T10:58:35Z,"Meta has announced a significant overhaul of its creator monetization programs for Facebook. The tech giant is consolidating its three existing creator monetization schemes into a single, streamlined program. While this development promises to simplify the process for creators to earn money on the platform, there is a question of whether this effort goes far enough to compete with other social media giants, particularly YouTube, which I believe offers the best opportunities for creators.

The New Facebook Content Monetization Program

Meta's latest initiative aims to address the complexity that creators have faced when trying to monetize their content on Facebook. Previously, the company offered three separate programs: In-stream ads, Ads on Reels, and Performance bonuses. Each of these had its own eligibility requirements and sign-up process, creating a potentially confusing landscape for creators looking to earn on the platform.

The new Facebook Content Monetization program, currently in beta, will unify these disparate systems. According to Meta, this consolidation will simplify the onboarding process, requiring creators to apply only once to gain access to all monetization features. The program will maintain a performance-based payout model, allowing creators to earn from ads in their reels, longer videos, photos, and text posts.

A key feature of the new program is an enhanced Insights tab. This tool will provide creators with a comprehensive view of their earnings across different content formats, enabling them to identify which videos and posts are generating the most revenue. This level of transparency and data access could prove invaluable for creators looking to optimize their content strategy.

The Rollout and Eligibility

Meta is taking a measured approach to the rollout of this new program. The company plans to invite 1 million creators who are already earning on the platform to participate in the beta testing phase. This initial group will receive invitations this week, with more creators being added to the program in the coming months.

It's worth noting that participation in the beta is optional. However, creators who choose to join the new program will not be able to return to Facebook's standalone monetization schemes. For those eager to join but not yet invited, Meta has provided an option to express interest through Facebook's official content monetization page.

A Step in the Right Direction, But Is It Enough?

While Meta's move to simplify creator monetization is commendable, industry insiders are questioning whether this effort is sufficient to compete in the increasingly crowded creator economy. A closer look at the numbers reveals a stark contrast between Meta's investment in creators and that of its competitors, particularly YouTube.

Meta proudly announced that it paid creators more than $2 billion for their content over the past year. At first glance, this figure seems impressive. However, when compared to Meta's overall revenue, the picture becomes less rosy. In 2023, Meta reported a staggering $134 billion in revenue. The $2 billion paid to creators represents merely 1.5% of this total.

Even if we assume that Facebook, despite its declining popularity in some markets, still accounts for a conservative 25% of Meta's revenue (approximately $33.5 billion), the payout to creators would only amount to about 6% of Facebook's estimated revenue.

The YouTube Comparison

The contrast becomes even starker when we look at YouTube's approach to creator compensation. Over the past three years, YouTube reported paying out $70 billion to creators, music labels, and studios. While this figure likely includes payments to larger entities, it still dwarfs Meta's contribution to the creator economy.

YouTube's parent company, Alphabet, doesn't disclose YouTube's total revenue, but we can make some educated guesses based on available data. YouTube's ad revenue over the same three-year period was $90 billion. If we conservatively estimate that total revenue was double this figure, around $180 billion, it would mean that YouTube is paying out approximately 39% of its total revenue to creators and content partners.

This stark difference in payout percentages - 6% for Facebook versus 39% for YouTube - raises questions about Meta's commitment to making Facebook a primary platform for content creators.

Meta's new program is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. Simplifying the monetization process and providing better insights will likely be welcomed by creators. However, the relatively low payout percentage suggests that Meta may need to do more to make Facebook an attractive primary platform for content creation.

Looking Ahead: What Meta Needs to Consider

For Meta to truly compete in the creator economy, several key areas need attention:

1. Increased Revenue Share: To attract and retain top talent, Meta may need to consider significantly increasing the percentage of revenue shared with creators.

2. Platform-Specific Features: Developing unique features that leverage Facebook's strengths could encourage creators to produce original content for the platform.

3. Cross-Platform Integration: Given Meta's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp, a more integrated approach to creator monetization across all its platforms could provide a compelling ecosystem for content creators.

4. Transparency and Communication: Clear, consistent communication about monetization opportunities and potential earnings could help build trust with the creator community.

Meta's new Facebook Content Monetization program is a positive development in the company's relationship with content creators. The simplification of the monetization process and the introduction of better analytics tools demonstrate Meta's recognition of the importance of the creator economy.

However, when compared to competitors like YouTube, it's clear that Meta has significant ground to cover. The relatively small percentage of revenue being shared with creators suggests that there's room for much more aggressive investment in the creator ecosystem. Only time will tell if Meta can transform Facebook into a home for original creator content."

Lake rips Biden-Harris 'double whammy' policies affecting Arizonans : 'Driven us over the cliff',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lake-rips-biden-harris-double-whammy-policies-affecting-arizonans-driven-us-over-the-cliff,2024-10-07T10:21:22Z,"PHOENIX, Ariz. - Arizona GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake told Fox News Digital that illegal immigration has disproportionately hammered residents of her state which she says has created a ""double whammy"" that will result in GOP wins in the state in November.

""I think most Americans think that they have driven us right over the edge, over the cliff,"" Lake told Fox News Digital about the policies of the Biden-Harris administration. ""And we're hoping that we can pull this back come November and that's what we plan to do. But our polling shows that the economy is really affecting everybody. The border is affecting everybody.""

Lake explained to Fox News Digital that the current administration's border policies have disproportionately hurt Arizona particularly when it comes to housing costs.

""It's basic supply and demand,"" Lake said. ""21 million people coming in, even if you take the estimate that Joe Biden and Kamala are giving, which is 10 million, they've got to live somewhere. They're living in homes and apartments and hotels and these are taking away housing opportunities for Americans and also jacking up the prices as well. Because right now, when you have a very limited supply of housing, which we do, we have not built enough homes and apartments in the past 20 years to keep up with the demand. So now all of a sudden, you add 21 million people, you've got a supply and demand issue. You got you don't have enough supply and you have a lot of demand.""

KARI LAKE SHREDS VP HARRIS' 'DESPICABLE' SOUTHERN BORDER VISIT: JUST TO MAKE THE 'MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAPPY'

Lake continued, ""We know that these people that are pouring across our country illegally, that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are bringing in hand-holding and saying, yes, please come in and we will supply you housing, federally subsidized housing, which means you and I are paying for it. And we will give you an ID card with thousands of dollars a month to pay for your food. They don't have living expenses like the American people do. The American people are barely getting by because living expenses have gone up so they can then afford to take these jobs making less than the going rate, which takes Americans salaries and hourly wages and depresses them or pushes them down. So it's a double whammy and it's really affecting Arizona particularly hard.""

On inflation, Lake pointed to data showing that Phoenix was at one point the hardest hit city in the country.

""I talk to more Arizonans than anybody in the whole country,"" Lake told Fox News Digital. ""I have a better relationship with the people of Arizona, I think, than anybody in the country and they're struggling. You know, it kills me to see families and people who are retiring or retirees, Arizona used to be an affordable state it's not so much anymore, who are telling me now, Kari, I've never had to go to a food bank in my life. As a matter of fact, I used to donate to food banks. Now I'm finding myself there every couple of weeks just to make ends meet. I can't even afford the basics. It breaks my heart because the people of this state are incredible, hard working people.""

FLASHBACK: ARIZONA DEM SENATE CANDIDATE CALLED TRUMP VOTERS 'DUMB': 'WORST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD'

""They don't deserve this and they don't want to be asking for a handout, but they're working as hard as they ever have. Some of them are doing two jobs and there's not enough hours in the day. They can't work any harder than they already are and they're still not making ends meet. So it's very distressing for the people and it's distressing for me because I really, truly love the people of the state.""

Lake, who is running for Senate against Dem. Rep. Ruben Gallego who she says is responsible for supporting the Harris-Biden immigration and inflation record, told Fox News Digital that she believes Republicans will have success in November as a result of those policies.

""Every main issue that we're facing as a country somehow seems to kind of come right through Arizona and this is why I feel so comfortable that we're going to win this because, well, first of all, we're registering voters left to right,"" Lake said.

""People are saying, yep, we're voting, we're going to become a Republican. People who've never been a Republican before are now registered Republicans...We're calling people who haven't voted in a number of elections, people who maybe skipped the last 4 or 5 elections. I guess they are called low propensity voters and we're asking, are you going to vote? And they're saying, 'Hell, yes, I'm going to vote. Absolutely, I'm going to vote. I'm struggling right now. This is the first election I voted in a number of elections.' But this one really matters. I think it's our last election. If we don't get this right as a free America."""
The Truth About Making Money Online: Real Opportunities That Work,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissahouston/2024/10/07/the-truth-about-making-money-online-real-opportunities-that-work/,2024-10-07T10:04:50Z,"In the age of digital transformation, the allure of making money online has captivated the imagination of many. Whether you're looking for a side hustle, planning to transition from a traditional job to entrepreneurship, or aiming to build a scalable online business, the internet seems like a goldmine.

But the big question remains: can you really make money online these days?

The short answer is yes, you absolutely can. However, as with any opportunity, there's more to it than the glamorous Instagram ads or YouTube success stories.

One of the most popular and easiest ways to make money online is through gig platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr. The gig economy allows people to offer services like writing, graphic design, web development, and virtual assistance. If you have a skill, you will likely find someone who is willing to pay for it online.

However, competition can be stiff, and building a solid reputation can take time. Many who start as freelancers initially struggle to land high-paying gigs. Success here is about finding a niche, marketing your skills, and continuously improving to attract higher-paying clients. While it can take effort to establish yourself, consistent freelancers can earn a full-time income.

E-commerce has transformed the way we purchase and sell products. Platforms like Shopify, Etsy, and Amazon have made it incredibly easy for anyone to set up an online store. Whether you sell handmade crafts, digital products, or physical goods through dropshipping, the potential is enormous.

The key to success in e-commerce is finding a product that's in demand, mastering online marketing, and optimizing your supply chain. It's not an overnight process, and many who start give up because they underestimate the work involved in managing a business. However, the rewards can be substantial if you can create a sustainable business model and scale it.

If you're more creatively inclined, content creation can be a lucrative option. Blogging, podcasting, YouTube videos, and social media platforms allow creators to build an audience and monetize through advertising, sponsorships, or affiliate marketing.

Affiliate marketing is especially popular as it involves promoting other companies' products and earning a commission on sales. The most successful content creators build trust with their audience by offering valuable, authentic content. But don't be fooled as there's more to it than just posting. You need to understand SEO, audience engagement, and monetization strategies to make it work.

The good news is that the opportunities for content creators continue to grow, especially with platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels offering creators new ways to monetize their presence.

Another avenue growing in popularity is online education. If you have expertise in a certain area, whether it's business, fitness, personal development, or crafting, you can package your knowledge into an online course or coaching program. Platforms like Teachable and Thinkific make it easy to create and sell courses online.

Coaching is also popular, with many professionals offering 1:1 sessions, group coaching, or even masterminds. This space has significant income potential, but it requires deep knowledge in your niche and the ability to market yourself effectively.

While making money online is possible, it's important to recognize the realities:

If you're serious about making money online, the first step is to assess your skills and interests. Are you a great writer? Consider freelancing or starting a blog. Do you love creating content? Build a YouTube channel or a podcast. Do you have deep knowledge in a certain field? Consider creating an online course or coaching program.

Next, invest time in learning. Research platforms, successful strategies, and stories from others who have done it. Knowledge is your best asset, and the more you know, the easier it will be to navigate the online business world.

Finally, commit to the long game. Just like any business, building an online presence takes time. You'll face setbacks and learn through trial and error. But with persistence, the right strategy, and a focus on delivering value, you can build a profitable online business.

The bottom line is that you can make money online these days, but it's not for the faint of heart. You need to be strategic, adaptable, and patient. The opportunities are there, but only those who are willing to put in the work will see the rewards. If you're ready to jump in, do so with eyes wide open and a commitment to growth. The potential is real, and with the right mindset and effort, so are the profits."
New Lower Priced Models Help Xpeng Stock See Record Sales,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/07/new-lower-priced-models-help-xpeng-stock-see-record-sales/,2024-10-07T10:02:13Z,"Chinese luxury EV maker Xpeng delivered a record 21,352 vehicles in September, up 39.5% year-on-year and up 52% from August. Xpeng's total year-to-date sales stand at about 98,561 vehicles, up 21% versus last year. In comparison, Li Auto , the largest of the emerging EV players in China, delivered 53,709 vehicles for September 2024 - an increase of 49% percent year-over-year, with its year-to-date sales growing by 40%. A bulk of the Xpeng's growth appears to have been driven by the company's new sub-brand, Mona, with the brand's first model, the Mona M03, selling over 10,000 units in its first full month of deliveries since its launch in late August. The vehicle has a starting price of about RMB 119,800 (about $17,000), which is well below Xpeng's other models and roughly half the price of Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y.

Now, China's economic growth has been weak due to a downturn in the real estate market and a slow rebound from stringent Covid-19 lockdowns that ended over a year ago. Consumer spending and domestic consumption also remain weak in China. Despite concerns about the economy and weakness in the global EV market, the Chinese EV market has held up with the mix of new energy vehicle sales rising to about 50% of overall automotive sales in the country. Moreover, there has also been a premiumization trend in the Chinese EV market, with cars costing upward of $30,000 accounting for a growing mix of sales. This could play in Xpeng's favor, as it competes primarily in the premium end of the electric vehicle market. Moreover, Xpeng's new lower-end models could benefit from the Chinese government's incentives of RMB 10,000 (approximately $1,410) offered to consumers who switch from gasoline to electric or low-emission vehicles. Separately, the Chinese government recently announced a stimulus plan aimed at stabilizing the economy, which includes lowering interest rates and fiscal support. This could help consumer spending to an extent, further driving the EV market.

The decrease in XPEV stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 18% in 2021, -80% in 2022, and 47% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could XPEV face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?

Xpeng stock trades at just about 1.9x forward revenues. Although this is not an unreasonable valuation, it is higher than its peers Nio and Li Auto. That said, Xpeng's financial metrics have been looking up of late. For Q2 2024, the most recently reported quarter, the company saw revenues grow by 54.1% year-over-year to RMB 6.82 billion ($0.94 billion), while gross margins stood at 14% compared to negative 3.9% for the same period of 2023. This is partly due to a higher mix of sales of the more premium X9 multi-purpose vehicle and a patent licensing deal with Volkswagen.

Europe's Hidden Tech Champions: The Rise Of Bootstrapped Startups,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/josipamajic/2024/10/07/europes-hidden-tech-champions-the-rise-of-bootstrapped-startups/,2024-10-07T09:46:42Z,"In the heart of Europe's bustling tech scene, a quiet revolution is unfolding. While venture capital-backed startups grab headlines with massive funding rounds, a new breed of companies is emerging as the true backbone of the continent's innovation ecosystem: bootstrapped startups. In an exclusive interview with the CEO of a leading tech M&A advisory boutique specialized in small and midcap transactions, he shares insights on how in his experience these self-funded ventures are proving that sustainable growth, profitability, and innovation can go hand in hand, often outperforming their VC-backed counterparts in the long run.

On the surface, European venture capital appears to be thriving. According to Dealroom, European startups raised a record €100 billion in 2021 and although it dropped to €63 billion in 2023, this figure would have seemed unthinkable just a few years ago. However, beneath this glittering façade lies a more complex and troubling reality, especially for scaleups.

""We have so many clients coming to us who built great companies with a range in revenues of, two, three million i,"" reveals Stefan Köppl, CEO of Samira Advisors, a leading tech M&A advisory boutique. ""But they burnt several millions on the way in VC money because from the very beginning they were used to 'Okay, my investors will pay me anyway.'""

This scenario, repeated across countless startups, points to a fundamental issue: the misalignment between VC funding models and the natural growth trajectories of most businesses.

Whereas venture capital is the perfect financing method for a specific subset of high-growth companies in rapidly advancing markets, a lot of companies in a more conservative environment would be better suited to grow more capital efficiently and/or finance their development with different financial instruments.

""We're seeing a surge in highly successful bootstrapped companies across Europe,"" Köppl begins. ""These companies are building sustainable businesses with real revenue and profits in a highly capital efficient way, often outpacing VC-backed startups in terms of long-term viability.""

While venture capital remains an important part of the ecosystem, Köppl argues that the success of bootstrapped companies is challenging the notion that massive funding rounds are necessary for startup success. ""We worked with dozens of bootstrapped companies that have grown to €5-10 million in annual recurring revenue with lean teams of 20-30 employees. They're often profitable from day one and have complete control over their destiny and the pace in which they reach it.""

Köppl shares an illuminating example that highlights the potential of bootstrapped companies:

""We recently worked with a bootstrapped software company.They started in a garage five years ago and had grown to double digit million in annual recurring revenue with just 28 employees. They were profitable from month six and had complete control over their product roadmap and company culture. When they decided to explore acquisition options, they had seven serious bidders and ultimately sold for 8x revenue, a multiple that many VC-backed companies struggle to achieve. Furthermore, the founder could choose between potential acquirers not just based on how much they pay but even more on how he perceives the acquirer to fit to his company, also in cultural terms.""

This success story stands in stark contrast to some VC-backed companies that struggle to find exits despite raising significant capital. Köppl points out, ""How many really large strategic M&As are happening in Europe per year, over 200 million? Very few. And when they do happen, the terms are often not favorable to founders due to complex cap tables and liquidation preferences.""

According to Köppl, bootstrapped companies enjoy several key advantages:

Beyond the financial benefits, Köppl observes that bootstrapping often leads to a healthier work environment for founders and employees alike. ""The founders who build sustainable, bootstrapped companies often end up much happier,"" he notes. ""They're building on their own terms, without the constant pressure of raising the next round.Top-tier VCs already recognized this and are avoiding founders who are not genuinely up for this game.

This approach also allows for a more diverse range of startups to flourish. Köppl explains, ""Not every great idea needs to be a potential unicorn. Bootstrapping enables entrepreneurs to build valuable businesses in niche markets that might be overlooked by VC funds. We're seeing incredible innovation in areas like vertical SaaS, where bootstrapped companies are dominating niche industries. ""

While bootstrapping offers many advantages, Köppl acknowledges it's not without challenges. Limited resources can slow growth, and some industries require significant upfront capital that self-funding can't provide. However, he points out that innovative solutions are emerging:

While private capital plays a crucial role, Köppl notes that public initiatives are also evolving to support a more diverse startup ecosystem. ""It is true that there is still a strong need to boost venture capital in Europe, especially in certain regions and in the growth stage."" he observes. ""But at the same time, there's a growing recognition that supporting sustainable, bootstrapped companies can have a significant positive impact on the economy.""

He highlights several promising initiatives:

Stefan highlights that public support plays a crucial role in venture capital, but it doesn't always align perfectly with market needs. For instance, there is a lot of capital avaliable for seed stage VC funds, despite some regional markets already having sufficient liquidity in that area. The real challenge, he notes, seems to lie more in growth stage funding than in early stage. The Road Ahead

As Europe's tech ecosystem matures, Köppl believes the importance of bootstrapped companies will only grow. ""The future of European innovation lies in a diverse ecosystem that celebrates different paths to success,"" he concludes. ""Bootstrapped companies are showing us that it's possible to build world-class businesses without following the traditional VC playbook.""

Köppl emphasizes that there's room for both models in the ecosystem. ""VC funding is crucial for certain types of businesses,but is more a niche product then it is perceived often right now. We need to recognize and celebrate the bootstrapped companies that are often the unsung heroes of European tech""

As policymakers, investors, and entrepreneurs look to the future, Köppl argues that embracing and supporting bootstrapped startups will be key to building a sustainable and innovative European tech sector. By celebrating these hidden champions and providing them with the resources and recognition they deserve, Europe can foster a new generation of technology leaders that compete on the global stage while staying true to their roots.

The message from Köppl's insights is clear: in the world of European tech, sometimes less outside capital means more innovation, more sustainability, and ultimately, more success. As the continent continues to establish itself as a global tech powerhouse, it's the bootstrapped startups that may well lead the way, proving that with determination, creativity, and a focus on customer value, European entrepreneurs can build world-changing companies on their own terms."
It's a close race for Michigan. These factors could decide it for Harris or Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5130163/michigan-2024-election-harris-trump,2024-10-07T09:06:21Z,"A Trump and Harris sign side-by-side in a neighborhood on Oct. 3, 2024 in Hillsdale, Mich. Sylvia Jarrus for NPR hide caption

Michigan is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House.

The state is part of the ""blue wall,"" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that she and Democrats need to hold to avoid a second Donald Trump presidency.

It's home to some of the key demographics that both parties are courting this election, from white voters without college degrees to the largest Black-majority city, Detroit, and one of the nation's largest Arab American populations.

But the path to victory is not easy this year. Harris and Trump remain in a close battle, as his populist message continues to resonate with white voters and union and blue-collar workers, particularly on the economy.

Dave Dulio, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, says ""in places like Macomb County, with many blue-collar voters and union workers, Trump made inroads by pledging to get the U.S. out of bad trade deals and renegotiate NAFTA, which he did.""

""I think they still give him credit for that,"" he added.

Dulio underscores the state's significance by noting that small shifts could lead to substantial changes for candidates: ""If you take a small shift among the Arab American community and a small shift among union workers, those multiple small shifts could drive a very different result.""

Both candidates have heaped attention recently on the Wolverine State. On Oct 4, Harris visited a Redford Charter Township firehouse near Detroit, meeting union representatives. She met with Arab American and Muslim leaders then appeared with United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain in Flint and vowed support for Michigan's auto industry. Trump held campaign events twice in September and took his presidential campaign to Saginaw Valley State University in Kochville Township on Oct. 3.

Michigan also plays to the strengths of the vice presidential nominees, who hail from the Midwest. Both Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have stumped in the state in the last month.

To better understand the key issues shaping voters' decisions -- from the economy and immigration to abortion and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East -- we are in Michigan this week hearing directly from voters and political observers as part of our ""We, The Voters"" series.

A September poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Michigan voters cared most about the economy, followed by abortion and immigration.

Economy

Michigan's unemployment rate is historically low, according to state data, but it has slowly ticked up in recent months. Meanwhile, inflation has eased, but high costs of living remain a concern.

The state continues to suffer from the decades-long decline of automobile manufacturing, and high interest rates have constricted sales of cars, according to a September study from the University of Michigan.

Both parties are trying to put focus on the economy. GOP attack ads argue that Biden and Harris are responsible for inflation, while the vice president's messaging focuses on plans to uplift the middle class and paint Trump-era tax cuts as benefiting the wealthy.

Meghan Wilson, an expert in public policy and urban development, said Harris could expand the Democratic position on economics by appealing to Black business owners and holders of student debt.

""African Americans in Detroit have a lot of small businesses, and so we're looking for capital for those kinds of small businesses. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job of bringing the small businesses into the conversation,"" Wilson explained.

Organized labor plays a key role in Michigan's economy. Both parties are making a play for Michigan's union members, who accounted for 13% of workers in the state last year. Exit polls in 2020 showed Michigan's union voters favoring President Biden over Trump, and Biden pledged to be ""the most pro-union president"" in U.S. history, which he backed up with a visit to UAW workers striking in Wayne, Mich.

Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said Biden's visit to striking workers helped him bump up his union support, but his policies to advance electric vehicles with tax credits were unpopular with Independent and Republican voters.

""You have Harris leading among union members with 63% which is almost where Biden was in 2020 with 65%, so she's improving her lot among union members, but still, the EVs are a problem,"" he said.

Still, one encouraging sign for the Harris campaign could be Michigan's local Teamsters union backing her candidacy, breaking with the national union that declined to endorse any candidate for U.S. president, after they had supported every Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton.

Abortion

Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a landmark amendment to the state constitution, securing the right to abortion and other reproductive health services.

Democrats won control of all three branches of Michigan's governments since making abortion a central voting issue.

But that success may have made it a less influential issue in the 2024 election. A KFF poll in June found that women in Michigan saw abortion as ""decided"" and they were more concerned about inflation and the rising cost of living.

""The Democrats are putting an awful lot of their eggs in the basket of abortion,"" the pollster Porn said.

Dulio pointed out that Trump's main weakness stems from what has driven Democratic success in every election -- and not necessarily abortion since it's already decided in the state: ""His character remains a key weakness. He's deeply unpopular because of the Jan. 6 spectacle and doubling down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. That just turns off persuadable voters,"" he said.

Michigan is home to one of the largest Black populations in the nation, ahead of Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, and the largest Black-majority city, Detroit.

Harris would herself be the nation's first Black woman president, but some Black voters may not be as motivated to vote as they were in 2020.

""The main challenge is the enthusiasm gap,"" said Ronald Brown, a political scientist at Wayne State University. He said among Black voters in Michigan, those who were in the ""black leadership class"" -- meaning serving in government, churches, Black fraternities and sororities -- were highly likely to vote for Harris. However, those without deep connections to the party, especially working-class and poor Detroit residents, were susceptible to sitting out elections. In particular, he pointed to Detroit's recent voter turnout -- higher in 2020 than it was in 2016 -- as a key factor explaining the state's pick for Biden after it went for Trump four years earlier.

""What could occur is that among working class and poor Black voters, lack of interest could lead to fatigue and this may drive those voters not to vote. And in Michigan, you don't need many. You need enough,"" he said.

Democratic state Sen. Sarah Anthony has a different perspective. She had seen an encouraging gain among young people to help shore up Harris' base.

""The Biden coalition included many working-class white men, a group Vice President Harris has struggled to win over. While there may have been losses there, the data I've seen shows significant gains due to increased enthusiasm among young people and people of color,"" she said.

U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East

The Detroit Metropolitan area has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. Dearborn, often called the Capital of Arab America, is home to a majority of Lebanese residents who maintain strong ties to southern Lebanon.

Arab and Muslim voters here were largely supportive of Biden in 2020. However, many have since been alienated by his handling of Israel's deadly war in Gaza and the administration's ongoing military aid to Israel. Many now are similarly concerned about Israel's continuing bombardment of Beirut and ground invasion along the countries' shared border.

Abbas Alawieh, a Dearborn Democratic strategist and one of the co-founders of the ""uncommitted movement,"" backed Biden in 2020. But earlier this year, he and other organizers successfully secured more than 100,000 ""uncommitted"" votes in the Michigan primary to protest Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.

Alawieh, who had advocated for a Gaza ceasefire, told Morning Edition host Leila Fadel that he feels more despair now as the conflict spreads to his family's homeland, Lebanon.

""This is a grieving community. So, for us to give guidance to vote for Kamala Harris, when she is part of the administration that's actively killing their family members, it's like giving a campaign speech at a funeral.""

Professor Dubio said the uncommitted movement has the potential to ""have a huge impact,"" and while he believes many of them will ultimately vote for Harris, he added, ""it can't and shouldn't be ignored.""

Abbas mentioned sending letters to Vice President Harris's team, including her national security advisor, requesting meetings with those directly affected by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. ""So far, the answer is still no.""

He added that Donald Trump visited the community, took photos with leaders, and invited them to his campaign rally.

Saeed Khan, an associate professor of Near Eastern and Asian Studies at Wayne State University, said Muslim and Arab voters were drifting toward Trump in 2016, and some continue to do so today, not only because of a push away from Democrats, but also a pull toward the Republican party's values. Many Arabs and Muslims, immigrant Muslims, voted for the Republican ticket at least until September 11 and then started to move toward the Democratic Party.

""The Republican message of self-reliance, smaller government or less government intrusion, lower taxes, social conservatism really appealed to many, especially immigrant Muslims and Arabs, because it epitomized the American Dream that they had internalized,"" Khan said."
Battleground Senate candidate unloads on 'radical' Dem opponent for disparaging Trump voters,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/battleground-senate-candidate-unloads-radical-dem-opponent,2024-10-07T08:07:07Z,"PHOENIX, AZ - Arizona GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake is blasting her Democratic opponent Rep. Ruben Gallego and labeling him as ""radical as they come"" after a resurfaced interview of him disparaging Trump voters.

""Isn't that terrible?"" Lake said in response to Fox News Digital reporting of a comment made by Gallego in 2016 where he said that Trump voters were ""dumb"" and the ""worst people in the world.""

""He's been lying about who he is,"" Lake added. ""He's trying to paint himself as a moderate, which is it's laughable if it wasn't so dangerous.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Gallego ""bullied"" moderate Sen. Kyrsten Sinema out of the race ""because she wasn't liberal enough.""

KARI LAKE SHREDS VP HARRIS' 'DESPICABLE' SOUTHERN BORDER VISIT: JUST TO MAKE THE 'MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAPPY'

""Now he is doing all these ads trying to say he's a moderate when, in fact, he's voted to spend our federal dollars, our tax dollars, our money, supporting sanctuary cities and states. He's voted against securing our border every step of the way. He's for an open border America. He's voted to defund the police. He actually co-sponsored the George Floyd legislation, which would have defunded the police nationwide.""

Lake went on to tell Fox News Digital that Gallego has ""never batted an eyelash"" when it comes to spending bills and has not been strong enough defending women's sports.

""He wants biological men to participate in women's athletics.,"" Lake said. ""That means it's an end for girls sports. Anybody out there who played sports? I did for a little bit. It's an end. I mean, if you have to compete with biological men, what's the purpose of having girls sports?""

ENIGMATIC VOTER GROUP COULD SPLIT TICKET FOR TRUMP, DEM SENATE CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA

Lake added, ""It's absolutely crazy and he's as radical as they come.""

Gallego and Lake will both be attempting to sway independent voters, especially in Maricopa County, the largest county in the state, where independents make up a third of the electorate. Lake told Fox News Digital she is optimistic she can win votes from Arizonans who aren't Republicans.

""I do believe that independents are with me, I think we're doing pretty well, our polling is showing that we're building on the independent vote,"" Lake said. ""And I think a lot of Democrats, while he [Gallego] hates Trump voters and he hates Republicans. I don't hate Democrats. I actually believe that disaffected Democrats are going to help us turn the corner.""

""They're realizing, looking at Kamala Harris and Ruben Gallego, and they're saying, wait a minute, this isn't the Democrat Party that I signed up for years ago, the old Democrat Party used to care about the working class. The old Democrat Party wanted a strong economy for everybody. This Democrat Party is a bunch of globalists, and they are for, they want to spend more money helping people coming here illegally than they do people who are American citizens.""

While the Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Gallego leading Lake by about 7 points, Lake told Fox News Digital she is confident the race is much closer and says her internal polling shows that she is within the margin of error.

""We have to go into it acting like we're ten down, but we're not ten down,"" Lake said. ""This is a very tight race. I'm proud of that, considering, as I said, he spent 75 million. He's been outspending us massively and the fact that this is such a tight race is incredible. Chuck Schumer is in a panic about Arizona. He's dumping 5 million bucks a week into Arizona.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Democrats are in a ""tailspin"" in Arizona because their efforts to make the election about abortion have not been fruitful because most voters are focused on other issues like the economy.

Lake also criticized Gallego over his record before he entered politics, including his involvement with a bank that worked with illegal immigrants, a harassment claim against him by a 20-year-old intern while he worked at city hall, and his time working for an ambulance company that was being investigated for fraud.

""The people of Arizona know me and they trust me and I love the people of the state, Lake said. ""I want to represent all of them, including people who maybe don't even vote for me. If you choose not to vote for me, I hope I can earn your vote, but I still want to represent you and I want to do a great job for you in Washington, D.C. We need decent, honest people back to D.C. and Ruben Gallego was not honest before he got into politics.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the Gallego campaign for comment but did not receive a response."
8 Workplace Trends That Will Define 2025,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/10/07/8-workplace-trends-that-will-define-2025/,2024-10-07T06:06:10Z,"The landscape of work is undergoing a seismic shift, propelled by technological breakthroughs and evolving societal dynamics. Much like the ever-changing realms of fashion and music, workplace trends serve as a barometer for the direction and velocity of this transformation, offering us a glimpse into the future of our professional lives. As we navigate through economic uncertainties, demographic changes in the workforce, and rapidly evolving employee expectations, it's crucial to understand these emerging patterns. So, let's explore the nine most significant workplace trends poised to shape the coming year, providing insights into how they might reshape our professional environments and practices.

As AI and automation continue to reshape the professional landscape, the imperative for continuous learning and skill development has never been more pronounced. While certain roles may become obsolete, a plethora of new opportunities are emerging, demanding novel skills and competencies. Organizations offering robust learning opportunities will attract top talent, positioning themselves as growth incubators. Those failing to embrace lifelong learning risk falling behind. In 2025, adaptability and continuous learning will be crucial for both organizational success and individual career resilience.

The four-day workweek is gaining momentum, challenging traditional work structures. In 2025, more organizations are expected to adopt this model, which promises enhanced employee well-being, improved work-life balance, and reduced carbon footprints. This shift suggests that concentrated work hours and extended recovery time can maintain or even boost productivity. As adoption grows, we may see a broader reshaping of work-leisure norms across industries.

The gig economy is evolving beyond ride-sharing and delivery services. By 2025, we expect more skilled professionals to embrace this model, attracted by autonomy and diverse opportunities. This shift is driven by the fading ""job for life"" concept and the desire for flexible, challenging work. It will be prominent in fields with skill shortages, like healthcare, AI, and cybersecurity. Organizations must adapt, focusing on creating appealing project-based opportunities to attract and retain top talent in this fluid landscape.

The AI narrative is shifting from replacement to augmentation. While some roles may be automated, AI tools are increasingly enhancing human capabilities and boosting productivity and creativity. Success in this new paradigm hinges on developing uniquely human skills like nuanced communication, emotional intelligence, and strategic thinking. This human-AI collaboration isn't just about coexistence; it's about unlocking new possibilities. As AI handles routine tasks, humans can focus on innovation and interpersonal aspects that drive true progress.

As AI takes on traditional managerial tasks, leadership roles are transforming. Leaders who foster emotional connections and build cohesive teams will be in high demand. Key attributes include empathy, facilitating human-machine collaboration, and focusing on talent development. This shift represents a fundamental change from task management to nurturing teams through rapid change. Leaders who adapt to this model will be crucial in balancing technological advancements with human needs in the AI age.

In 2025, ""out-of-office"" will be redefined through immersive online platforms. These environments, integrating VR and AR, enable seamless collaboration regardless of physical location. They transform all aspects of work life, from dynamic meetings to immersive training and team building. While the grand ""metaverse"" vision may have faded, its core concepts are finding practical applications in work-focused platforms. This trend is set to redefine remote work, blending in-person interaction benefits with digital flexibility.

AI integration in HR is accelerating, revolutionizing human capital management. It's reshaping core functions like recruitment, performance management, employee engagement, and talent development. As AI handles routine tasks, HR professionals can focus on strategic, high-value activities. This shift transforms HR from an administrative function to a key driver of organizational strategy. The challenge lies in balancing AI efficiency with the human touch in people management. Successful HR departments will leverage AI to enhance, not replace, human judgment and empathy.

Despite their best efforts, attempts (involving either threat or enticement) to persuade employees to give up the freedom of work-from-home have largely proven unsuccessful. The simple fact is that for every company issuing an ultimatum that workers return to their desks full-time, another realizes that offering flexibility is the key to attracting top-tier talent. This means that hybrid working is quickly becoming the default in skilled roles. Forward-thinking employers in 2025 are adopting this new paradigm, creating opportunities for their workforce to improve their work-life balance while also maintaining strong connections to colleagues and company cultures.

As we navigate these transformative trends, it's clear that the future of work will be defined by our ability to adapt, harness technology, and prioritize human potential -- creating workplaces that are not only more efficient and flexible but also more engaging, fulfilling, and aligned with the evolving needs of both individuals and organizations."
The Man Who Stopped Disney From Losing Half A Billion Dollars On 'The Marvels' And 'Quantumania',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2024/10/06/the-man-who-stopped-disney-from-losing-half-a-billion-dollars-on-the-marvels-and-quantumania/,2024-10-06T20:51:50Z,"It's no secret that 2023 was far from a blockbuster year for Marvel Studios. The Disney-owned entertainment giant had to deal with assault charges filed against its up-and-coming star Jonathan Majors, growing discontent from its visual effects staff and the departure of their boss Victoria Alonso. And that was all in the first three months of the year. Surprisingly, the worst was yet to come.

This turmoil was followed by the studio releasing a string of productions which were panned by critics even though they came at a colossal cost. As we recently revealed, The Marvels and Ant-Man threequel, Quantumania, together lost $296.4 million at the box office but it could have been a whole lot worse if it wasn't for the help of an unlikely ally.

Many movie trade titles claim to know how much money films lost at the box office. Although industry analyst Box Office Mojo publishes data about theater takings, which is widely accepted to be accurate, there is no equivalent source for production costs. Studios such as Disney don't comment on the cost of individual productions so trade titles tend to resort to using figures from contacts or estimates and this can lead to wild inaccuracies.

For example, Variety claimed that The Marvels ""cost $250 million"" when, in fact, more than $350 million was actually spent on it. By doing a bit of detective work it's possible to be bang on the money.

The precise costs of movies made in the United States is usually a closely-guarded secret as studios combine the costs of all of their productions in their overall expenses and their filings don't itemize how much they spent on each one. It is a different story in the United Kingdom which is where The Marvels and Quantumania were made.

As we regularly report, studios filming in the UK often incorporate a subsidiary company to make each picture there and they have to file financial statements showing everything from the total sum spent on it right down to the pension contribution paid to the staff who worked on it. Some even disclose the difference in pay between the men and women they employ and the proportion of the workforce represented by each gender.

The companies usually have code names so that they don't raise attention with fans when filing for permits to film on location and when they are correctly matched to the productions they are making it lifts the curtain on their costs.

This is because the terms governing the UK production companies state that they have to show all of the costs, from pre-production right up to delivery of the finished film. What's more, the terms add that movies made in the UK can only have one production company so studios can't set up others elsewhere and hide some of the spending in them. Crucially, the companies have to warrant that the data in their filings is true and accurate so the cost of the movies they make is indisputable. Studios don't disclose this information out of the goodness of their hearts.

They shoot in the UK to benefit from the government's Audio-Visual Expenditure Credit (AVEC) which gives them a cash reimbursement of up to 25.5% of the money they spend in the country.

To qualify for the reimbursement, at least 10% of the production costs need to relate to activities in the UK. Studios set up separate production companies for each picture so that they can demonstrate the spending to the UK government and the filings for the Disney subsidiaries behind The Marvels and Quantumania show that they cost a total of $762.4 million to make.

The movies generated a combined $682.2 million at the box office with around 50% of it going to Disney leaving the studio with a loss of $421.3 million. That doesn't include the revenue from merchandise and Blu Ray/streaming sales as they go to the studio but it too has to cover the cost of marketing the movies which could drive up its loss. However, that's just the start of the story.

The filings also show that The Marvels and Quantumania received a combined $124.9 million in reimbursements from the UK government bringing Disney's loss down to around 300 million dollars. Getting the reimbursement is far from child's play.

In addition to the 10% minimum UK spending threshold, films must pass a points test based on factors such as whether the film showcases the UK and how many of the lead actors are British. It explains why the cast of many Marvel movies is dominated by British actors and why cultural icons from the country sometimes appear on-screen despite seeming so incongruous that it can distract from the action.

A sign in the background of one of the scenes in Avengers: Infinity War shows a Scottish flag and a reference to deep fried kebabs which are an unusual local delicacy. Likewise, at one point in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, a portal opens to reveal a classic British red telephone box.

Neither The Marvels nor Quantumania showcase any British heritage, nor are their ranks filled with British actors. However, the points test also covers aspects such as whether the soundtrack was recorded in the UK and how many of the production team are from the UK. Both movies were made in the UK and passed the points tests as the filings for their production companies confirm that they received final British Film Certificates.

The filings also show that neither The Marvels nor Quantumania used the full 25.5% reimbursement available to them as it only covered 17.8% and 15% of their total costs respectively. As Robby Montoya, an investigative reporter at the Texas Scorecard, astutely observed on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, ""British taxpayers funded box office bombs.""

That said, Disney is isn't doing anything wrong by receiving the reimbursements as it is simply taking advantage of the UK's tax laws. It isn't even a new development as Disney has been filming in the UK for decades. Indeed, its first completely live-action film, Treasure Island, was filmed in the UK way back in 1949. under the supervision of Walt himself.

However, Disney's relationship with the UK government has changed over the years and stepped up a gear a decade ago.

It followed Disney's $4 billion buyout of Lucasfilm, creator of the Star Wars series, in 2012. No sooner was the ink dry on the contract than Disney gave the green light to a reboot of the sci-fi saga which began filming two years later. Disney decided to go all-out on it and, as we revealed, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the first film in its trilogy, became the most expensive movie of all time with total costs of well over $500 million.

In order to recoup some of this staggering sum, Disney made the movie in the UK. With so much money at stake, the studio didn't take any chances and got endorsement from the UK government right from the start.

In 2014 the UK's then-Treasury Secretary George Osborne proudly announced that the historic Pinewood Studios would not just be home to The Force Awakens but also to its two sequels. It was a dream ticket for the self-confessed Star Wars fan though there is no suggestion that Osborne did anything improper or gave Disney any special treatment. In fact, at the time, the UK was part of the European Union and its state aid rules prevent the governments of its members from cutting such deals with companies.

According to the Daily Mail Osborne worked closely with Lucasfilm's president Kathleen Kennedy to ensure the new slate of films, directed by JJ Abrams, were made in the UK, snatching them away from rivals including Canada. Osborne's support was so valued by Disney that it thanked him in the credits of The Force Awakens and gave him several replica Lightsabers.

Disney even invited him on to the highly-secretive set of The Force Awakens for a behind the scenes tour during filming which he described as ""one of the most exciting days in the job."" He added that ""I did walk on the Millennium Falcon and meet Chewbacca. It's like walking back into your childhood. I couldn't actually believe I was meeting these characters.""

He kickstarted a relationship that stands strong to this day. Disney didn't just make its trilogy of Star Wars films in the UK but their two spinoffs, two streaming series and 17 Marvel productions including The Marvels and Quantumania. There is more to come as Disney announced in August that it plans to invest $5 billion over the next five years in films, television and streaming shows made in the UK and Europe.

Osborne, who is now chairman of the British Museum, didn't support Disney because he is a Star Wars aficionado but because of the financial benefit it brings to the UK. Testimony to this, the latest data from the British Film Institute (BFI) shows that in 2019, every $1.31 (£1) of reimbursement handed to studios generated $10.88 (£8.30) of additional Gross Value Added (GVA) benefit for the UK economy. It led to a total of $10.1 billion (£7.7 billion) in GVA being generated by the fiscal incentives for film in 2019.

Released in December 2021, the BFI's triennial Screen Business report showed that between 2017 and 2019, the fiscal incentives to studios generated a record $17.7 billion (£13.5 billion) of return on investment to the UK economy and created more jobs than ever before. Filming in the UK doesn't just generate jobs for locals, it also drives spending on services such as security, equipment hire, transport and catering.

The report found that, in general, between 40% and 60% of production expenditure was spent in the general economy in sectors such as travel and transport, construction, hospitality and catering. In specific, productions with a budget of more than $65.6 million (£50 million) spend 11.7% on construction; 9.8% on travel and transport; 9.7% on locations; 6.5% on hospitality and catering; 4.2% on business supplies; 3.1% on local labor; 2.3% on music and performing arts; 2.2% on fashion and beauty; and 2.1% on digital services.

In 2019, this spend generated 37,685 jobs in London and 7,775 throughout the rest of the UK. The report added that when the wider impacts of the film content value chain are taken into consideration, 49,845 jobs were created in London in 2019 and 19,085 throughout the rest of the UK.

The UK economy is still getting a magic touch from the fiscal incentives. Despite Hollywood being gripped by strikes for more than six months last year, foreign studios contributed around 77% of the $1.8 billion (£1.4 billion) spent on making films in UK according to the BFI.

Critics claim that the impact isn't felt outside the film industry which is still a niche sector in the UK. There is some evidence for this from the government itself. When it introduced its high-end television reimbursement scheme in 2013 it noted that ""this measure is expected to have a positive impact on the high-end television industry, but is not expected to have significant wider macroeconomic impacts.""

However, a senior industry source points out that the UK doesn't just benefit from job creation and the studios spending money on local businesses but also from the increased tax paid by these companies. Furthermore, as the reimbursement is paid to studios after the spending has occurred, the UK government collects the tax before the money is paid out.

""The amount of taxes on the spend makes it pretty cash neutral to start,"" says the source. ""Even better, the spend happens and taxes are paid a year at least before the government writes a cheque in return."" He adds that the film industry workers then spend the money they have been paid which in turn generates more tax receipts for the government. ""If you follow the actual tax collection against the impact of this onward money it vastly exceeds the payout.""

Testimony to this, the Screen Business report estimated that the fiscal incentives for film caused UK tax revenues to surge by 27% from $3.7 billion (£2.8 billion) in 2017 to $4.7 billion (£3.6 billion) in 2019. The source adds that the government puts this to good use as it ""results in our technologies helping cut the trial times for drugs by 50% and my new knee operation time. Direct from R&D done by people like us in film.""

He adds that the fiscal incentives are ""not at the expense of spending on hospitals etc. Without the inward money the payroll and other taxes on the £7 billion plus would not be generated.""

Despite these statistics, some observers feel that efforts might have been better focussed elsewhere in the arts industry. According to Neil Griffiths, CEO of youth charity Arts Emergency, ""austerity politics has been cataclysmic for the long term health of our nation's cultural life and creative industries. It may work as a short term incentive for global corporations to bring business here, but they won't keep coming when the talent pipeline runs dry due to the short term thinking and small minded educational and cultural policies of successive Conservative governments. Community arts and state funded comprehensive education are the bedrock of the UK's global pre-eminence in cultural production and creativity.""

Another counter argument is that the UK's facilities, talent and landscape are strong enough to attract studios to film anyway so the country could reap the benefits from their spending without the government needing to pay out the reimbursements. If the UK had not offered such attractive fiscal incentives to movie-makers it remains to be seen whether The Marvels or Quantumania would have been filmed there anyway and whether their costs would have come down if so. However, there is no doubt that as long as the incentives remain in place, it isn't likely that the curtain will come down on film making in the UK."

An Iranian regime change would mean an end to many global problems, exiled Crown Prince HRH Reza Pahlavi told Maria Bartiromo as he doubled down on his criticism on Sunday.

""[I care about] the welfare of my compatriots. I don't want to see them yet again suffer from the consequences of this conflict,"" he said, drawing a distinction between the regime and the Iranian people.

""The ultimate solution is for this regime to no longer be there, and the best opportunity exists right now, not only for our friends in the region, but for the whole world to understand that a change of regime in Iran would put an end to all of these problems, so we don't have to worry about maritime traffic and the oil prices going up because there is going to be some Houthis striking commercial ships or everything else that you have there. The nuclear threat, the proliferation of this ideology, period, the end of this regime would mean an end to all these problems.""

EXILED CROWN PRINCE OF IRAN DEMANDS REGIME CHANGE AFTER ISRAEL ATTACK: THIS ISN'T OUR WAR, 'IT'S KHAMENEI'S'

Pahlavi has been a prominent critic of the Iranian Islamist regime and its ""warmongering,"" which he insists will eventually contribute to the nation's unsustainable financial expenditure, leading to what he described as ""economic shock.""

He has also been outspokenly critical of the Biden administration for allegedly appeasing Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei after Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel last October, particularly through avenues such as the return to the Iran nuclear deal and readiness to pump billions of dollars into Iran's cash-starved economy.

On a similar note, Bartiromo implied the upcoming election may have a significant foreign policy implication in the region.

IRAN'S EXILED CROWN PRINCE CALLS OUT BIDEN'S WEAK POLICIES, SAYS ISLAMIC REGIME 'EMBOLDENED'

To that end, Pahlavi replied, ""I'm not isolating Washington only, I'm talking about Europe as well. If you are focused yet again on whether or not we can appease this regime and cut a deal with them and negotiate with them and, in a way, expect a behavior change from this regime, that simply means that we have yet to understand the DNA and nature of the system, as opposed to, saying our best allies are the people of Iran.""

"Beijing Must Feel Like It Is Under The Gun, And It Definitely Is",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2024/10/06/beijing-must-feel-like-it-is-under-the-gun-and-it-definitely-is/,2024-10-06T17:50:35Z,"Beijing has again moved to jumpstart China's beleaguered economy. Implicitly admitting that its May stimulus package had failed to do the job, the nation's leadership in September made a dramatic gesture, advancing monetary and fiscal measures far beyond anything to date. These steps may help Beijing meet its 5 percent real growth target for 2024, but they will not restore China's economic momentum.

The fiscal measures present a strange mix. According to China's Xinhua News Service, Beijing plans to issue some 2 trillion yuan (about $284.4 billion) in additional sovereign debt. Half this amount will help already heavily indebted local governments. The other half will go to a number of support programs for individuals and families.

Part of this support for individual Chinese and families will involve giving what Beijing calls ""living allowances"" to the poor, ostensibly to celebrate the 75 anniversary of communist rule. No doubt recipients will spend these monies quickly and provide an immediate fillip to consumer spending. This measure, however, can have little lasting effect. Beijing will also offer an ongoing monthly allowance of 800 yuan ($114) for each child in families with two or more children. This will have a more lasting effect on economic activity, though there are relatively few such families in China these days. No doubt this measure also aims to encourage births and thereby counteract the demographic pressure imposed on the economy by years of low fertility rates. It might help but it will take 15-20 years before any rise in births today can influence China's workforce.

City of Shanghai from its own resources will offer 500 million yuan in vouchers for people to use on dining, and amusements. At less than 1.0% of Shanghai's gross domestic product, this measure can hardly have much overall effect. Beijing has also earmarked 1.0 trillion yuan (about $142 billion) to recapitalize six big banks, clearly an effort to remedy some of the harm done by the failures of the property crisis.

On the monetary side of the ledger, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will cut the 1-year medium-term lending facility rate from 2.3% at present to 2.0%. It will cut the 7-day reverse purchase rate, its main policy tool, from 1.7% to 1.5%. These changes look tiny compared with the latest Federal Reserve half-point rate cuts in the United States, but by the standards of past PBOC measures, the recent PBOC cuts look bold indeed.

To further stimulate lending and presumably economic activity, the bank will reduce the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve against their deposit and loan portfolios. To lift China's falling stock market, the PBOC will also make 500 billion yuan (about $70 billion) available for lending to investment funds, brokers, and insurers. It will make an additional 300 billion yuan available to finance share buybacks by listed companies. The bank's hope no doubt is that a rising stock market will offset some of the household wealth lost to the property crisis and its depressing effect on real estate values. To help real estate directly, the PBOC will cut the rates payable on existing mortgages, a relief for existing homeowners, since unlike Americans, Chinese have no facility to refinance their mortgage. To increase home buying, the bank has also scheduled a drop in the required downpayment on second homes from 25% at present to 15%.

Though this list of fiscal and monetary measures may sound impressive, it will likely fail to do the trick. More than measures to make credit cheaper and more plentiful or to help certain of society's needier demographics, China, if it is to get back its economic momentum, needs to restore confidence among the vast population of Chinese consumers. It also needs to encourage investment spending by private businesses, which are estimated to account for some 60% of the economy and 80% of new urban employment.

Certainly the Chinese consumer needs more help than this package offers. Households have lost confidence and remain unwilling to spend. At last measure the country' consumer confidence index was down about 3% from last spring and almost 30% below its level in 2022. To some extent, this sorry state of affairs reflects the lingering effects of the zero-Covid policies that stopped economic activity and interrupted employment and paychecks long after the pandemic ended. More than this, however, is the effect of the property crisis on real estate values. No pickup in the stock market can repair this burden. A family's home in China constitutes the bulk of its net worth, and real estate prices have fallen more than 12% since 2021, when the property crisis first broke.

Private business owners and managers are no better off. They have slowed their capital spending on expansion, modernization, and hiring to a negligible amount. Fixed capital formation has actually declined over the past year. Part of this shortfall reflects the shock the economy's growth slowdown has had on a business community once accustomed to the rapid growth or earlier years. Private business owners and managers can also remember how not too many years ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping chastised them for caring more about profits than the communist party's agenda. Xi has changed his tune of late, but memories are long, and they have left doubts about Beijing's attitude in future years.

Without policies to restore confidence in these two crucial sectors of the nation's economy, growth will continue to struggle. It is doubtful that China will deliver the targeted 5 percent real growth for 2024. If if it does report such growth, it will more likely come from statistical legerdemain than from genuine economic activity. Beijing has hinted at more stimulus to come. Perhaps these next actions can address the confidence problem. Without help on this front, the economy will continue in its weakened state."

Democratic strategist James Carville said Saturday that the presidential contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump was a ""long way from decided.""

Carville joined CNN's Michael Smerconish, who pressed the Democratic strategist on why Harris wasn't ahead if the economy was doing well, referencing Carville's famed phrase, ""it's the economy, stupid.""

""You know, she's slightly ahead, and it's not the election. These things tend to break one way or the other at the end. There are seven swing states. The least likely result is they break 4-3. But I can't stop the commentariat from saying it's going to be neck-and-neck, and it's going to come down to this. I think it will break at the end. I think someone will carry swing states 5-2 or 6-1. Whoever does that will do well in the House and do well in the Senate. But this thing is a long way from decided,"" Carville responded.

Former Trump campaign adviser David Urban also joined Carville and Smerconish and said that the race is going to be tight, specifically in Pennsylvania.

JAMES CARVILLE WARNS BIDEN EVERY TIME HE LISTENS TO THE LEFT, HE'S 'SCREWED'

He cited the state's electorate and said that he's heard from a lot of voters who think Harris hasn't made her pitch in Pennsylvania yet.

""If she does lose, I think it's because she's kept in bubble wrap on a shelf someplace. They're playing defense, not offense. They're playing like they're 14 points up, not like they're neck-and-neck. And so I think it's going to be close just because the nature of the electorate,"" Urban said.

Carville agreed and said voters still don't know enough about the vice president.

""They know who she is and who Donald Trump is. They know what Donald Trump is. They still want to find out what Harris is,"" he said, before taking aim at criticisms of Harris' lack of media appearances.

He noted Harris agreed to do ""60 Minutes,"" and said it was the ultimate long-form interview.

Carville also recently warned that there would be another surprise ahead of the election.

""Something tells me something else is going to happen. I don't know what it is. But the idea we've got 42 days to go, six weeks. This is a sprint to the finish. I think there's another plot twist coming here,"" he said.

"There Are No Economic Forecasts, There's Just Fallacy",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/10/06/there-are-no-economic-forecasts-theres-just-fallacy/,2024-10-06T14:02:18Z,"Economists quite literally ascribe to themselves an ability to forecast the global economy. Any doubts about the previous assertion can be found by placing ""global recession"" into the search bar of your engine of choice.

The arrogance of such a presumption is astounding. As is written here with some frequency, the mere notion of measuring the street one lives on is beyond comprehension. Even one's own house is a bridge too far. Think about it. After measuring the consumption inside 1234 Maple Street, the more modest of us might stop and contemplate the infinite actions taking place outside 1234 Maple (and around the world) that profoundly inform that consumption.

Economies are just people, and so much of what people do and how much they can do of it is a function of what people and machines do (and don't do) far from them. Measuring an ""economy"" is so pointless, and then when the deep in thought operate under the pretense of an ability to measure the world...

Unfortunately, it gets worse. If there's a justification for what's unjustifiable (and also wildly unrealistic), it can perhaps be that these monuments to misleading (think GDP) presume an economy in a stationary state. Of course, the latter itself speaks to dimwitted nature of it all. An economy that's stationary naturally rejects capital and is soon enough not stationary thanks to rapid shrinkage. Which is kind of the point.

The here and now of an economy not only can't be reasonably measured (see above and the challenges of measuring 1234 Maple Street), but if it's growing there's no realistic way to forecast the growth. As Oklahoma State professor Steve Trost puts it, economic forecasts are a fallacy. So true.

That is so simply because what propels us out of the stationary state is surprise. Economic growth doesn't spring from consumption (think GDP) that can only occur after the actual production (growth) that enabled it, rather it's about increases in production that are logical consequences of infinite global discoveries of how to do things better than previously done.

In other words, entrepreneurial advance is what drives most advance. The problem is that it can't be forecast. By definition.

More realistically, if it could be forecast it wouldn't be entrepreneurial. And it wouldn't be simply because markets are reasonably efficient. What's a known, or what's accepted as a driver of economic advance is what's already being done. Just as a $20 bill lying on the street doesn't go long before being picked up, neither does a good idea sit unused. There's too much money to be made from it.

Which speaks to the genius of entrepreneurs. They're that way not because they did the expected, but because against all odds and in the face of enormous ridicule, they inserted into the proverbial economic bloodstream an all-new way of doing things. Entrepreneurs by their very description introduce surprise that propels us out of the stationary state.

About these leaps, it doesn't insult economists one iota to point out that they're unable to divine the upside surprises that power growth. By extension, it similarly insults economists not one iota that they can't foretell the commercial concepts that will vanish amid all the growth-boosting surprise.

What insults economists is the forecasts themselves, and that presume an ability to foresee the surprises and shocks (business decline) that are the source of economic advance. At least stopped clocks are right twice a day. The same can't reasonably be said of any fallacious economic forecast (a triple redundancy), no matter how ""accurate."""
Robust Job Gains Remove Recession Fears,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/10/06/robust-job-gains-remove-recession-fears/,2024-10-06T11:06:04Z,"The September jobs report on Friday put to rest any fears that the labor market might be on a path to cool enough to endanger U.S. economic growth. On the contrary, the report was so broadly strong as to give rise to worries that the Federal Reserve might pause further cuts and reignited wage growth might be a looming danger.

Employment grew by 254,000 nonfarm jobs, which was well above expectations, and the upwardly revised 159,000 in August. The household survey data was also robust at a gain of 430,000 jobs, with the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, soaring by a whopping 666,000.

The unemployment rate was reported at 4.1% but was close to 4.0% at 4.05%, down from 4.2%.

Wages crept up to 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.8%, which reinforces the strength of the labor demand but might raise questions about renewed inflation pressures. The only blemish on the jobs report was the average workweek hours falling to 34.2, a four-year low also seen in July and January.

The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm that the cooling trend in the labor market has stabilized, with both measures off their respective peaks.

Before the recent decline, the unemployment rate had risen enough off the lows to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. However, there are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle.

Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is further evidence that the labor market does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy.

Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 near all-time highs by Friday's market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved higher as well.

Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. The lower probability of recession after the healthy jobs report is reflected in the better performance of economically sensitive companies.

The crucial economic reports before the next Federal Reserve meeting on November 7 include Thursday's consumer inflation (CPI) and another monthly jobs report. Consensus estimates expect September CPI to slow to 2.3% year-over-year from 2.5%. The Cleveland Fed's CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the November meeting.

Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expected pace of 2024 rate cuts. A short-term interest rate cut of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November and December Fed meetings is implied. In response to the slower expected pace of rate cuts, the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields rose to 3.92% and 3.97%, respectively.

Friday's job report increases the probability that the Federal Reserve can engineer a soft landing with the U.S. economy remaining remarkably resilient. The Atlanta Fed's estimate of third-quarter GDP is at 2.5%, according to their last update on October 1. As the fears of recession recede and have been reflected in all-time high stock prices, earnings will likely need to be the next catalyst for higher prices. Third-quarter earnings season kicks off at the end of the week as if on cue."
Trump's Wall Street Tower Appears To Be Underwater,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacheverson/2024/10/05/donald-trump-wall-street-tower-40-building/,2024-10-06T10:33:44Z,"At one of Trump's biggest buildings, profits are down, expenses are up and the mortgage is about to come due. It's all enough to push 40 Wall Street into the red.

ne of Donald Trump's prized properties, the landmark building 40 Wall Street, is 63 stories high but now appears to be underwater. The remaining 35 years on Trump's leasehold in the Financial District tower is worth about $116 million. That's $2 million less than the estimated $118 million Trump owes on his mortgage, according to an analysis of loan documents, real-estate records, financial disclosures and appraisals.

The building is simply not earning enough money to cover the loan: 40 Wall Street's annual net operating income has dropped from about $20.7 million in 2018 to $12.8 million last year, as the building's occupancy rate plummeted from 94.3% in early 2018 to 73.9% in June, thanks in part to the distressed post-pandemic commercial real estate market.

Adding to the headaches: Trump, who doesn't own the land on which the building sits, has just nine years left until his ground rent escalates dramatically, due to an agreement with the building's German owner. There is a good chance that if net operating income doesn't rebound that the new terms could potentially wipe out all of his profit.

Things could come to a head soon. Trump's debt is due in July but -- with an estimated $566 million of legal liabilities hanging over him and just $413 million of cash -- he does not have the funds to comfortably pay it all back. Refinancing will be hard, too, because any new lender would likely balk at the math behind the deal. That leaves the Republican presidential candidate in a tough spot as the November election approaches, short on funds to save one of his prized possessions.

riginally named after its primary tenant, the Manhattan Company, a bank whose founders included Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, 40 Wall Street was expected to be the tallest building in the world when construction began in 1929. But shortly after the 927-foot-tall Manhattan Company Building was finished 11 months later, it was bested by midtown's Chrysler Building, boosted by its massive spire that had been built in secret, according to New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission.

The business model for 40 Wall Street didn't work out according to the original plan either. Opening just months after the 1929 stock market crash that kicked off the Great Depression, would-be tenants backed out of their commitments, the commission wrote when designating the property a landmark decades later. Nine years after opening, the owners defaulted on interest, taxes and payments, lenders foreclosed on the building, and it was on the auction block, bought by bond holders for the outstanding principal on their loans, the New York Times reported in 1939.

As the American war-time economy ramped up, though, so too did 40 Wall Street, with some of the country's most-reputable tenants including Westinghouse and the Navy taking up quarters there in the 1940s. By 1944, the building was completely occupied for the first time, according to the Times.

The Manhattan Company merged with Chase Bank in 1955. While the new entity was headquartered at Chase's offices, it still maintained a bank and offices at 40 Wall Street, according to the landmark commission. But Chase sold its stake in the building in 1959, when a real estate firm consolidated ownership of 40 Wall Street, paying $32 million for the leasehold and the three separate parcels of land on which the building sits. The following year though, the development was split up again, with Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. buying the land and a London-based real estate company picking up the leasehold. In 1966, it sold the leasehold to the partners of a brokerage firm that was the building's largest tenant.

In 1982, Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda secretly invested in the building. That same year, a group of investors led by members of the reclusive Hinneberg family, a Hamburg, Germany-based shipping dynasty, bought the land from MetLife for $70 million, according to the Landmarks Preservation Commission. After Marcos was deposed, his assets were frozen and 40 Wall Street was auctioned off, again, seven years later. With downtown real estate in the dumps and the building reportedly in disrepair, in 1995, Trump picked up the building and its 1.1 million square feet of office from Citicorp, who had been stuck with it, for a mere $1.3 million. He also inked a 64-year ground lease with the Hinnebergs. Through five companies and a revocable trust of which he is the only beneficiary, Trump is the sole owner of the lease.

With a $5 million loan payment to Capital One coming due, in 2015, Trump refinanced the building, borrowing $160 million from Ladder Capital. Almost immediately the lender sliced up the debt into four separate notes and bundled it up with dozens of other properties that were then sold to investors. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for those four notes, Trump still owes a total of about $118 million of his original $160 million mortgage. That loan comes due in 10 months. Meanwhile, after speaking with experts in NYC commercial real estate, Forbes estimates Trump's leasehold is worth an estimated $116 million. That means Trump's equity could be worth less than zero, quite a drop from an estimated value of $80 million a year ago.

Wells Fargo, the bank servicing the commercial mortgage pass-through certificates that include Trump's loan, had enough concerns about his debt that it has been on a watchlist since December. The bank's accompanying note cites New York state's civil fraud verdict against Trump, 40 Wall Street's occupancy rate and the building's declining operating income to debt service ratio as reasons why.

When Trump took out that loan in 2015, 40 Wall Street's occupancy rate was 94.5%, about one percentage point higher than comparable rental properties, according to Ladder Capital. Up until 2019, the building's rate was pretty stable, ranging from 91% to 98%, per loan servicer reports. But then the Covid-19 pandemic hit, tanking the commercial real estate market, and 40 Wall Street's occupancy rate began dropping: 89.1% in 2019, 86.1% in 2021, 82.9% in 2022, 74.2% last year and 73.9% in June. One notable departure: retail pharmacy Duane Reade, which occupied 6.8% of the building, cleared out of 40 Wall Street in 2023, 4.5 years before its lease was set to expire, according to Morningstar.

Right now, the building's website advertises 73,000 square feet of ""select"" rental space available. The actual figure seems to be much higher according to the loan servicer's report: a 73.9% occupancy rate in a building with 1.2 million square feet of rentable space means that unoccupied area should be closer to 300,000 square feet. It's not clear if the information on the 40 Wall Street website was inaccurate or if new tenants have committed to moving in. Spokespeople for the Trump Organization did not respond to inquiries.

Not surprisingly, the decline in occupancy rate has coincided with a drop in the building's income, which fell from $41.7 million in 2019 to $30.9 million in 2022. An increase in the rent Trump collected last year, however, caused it to bounce back to $33 million (it's not immediately clear why the rent increased while occupancy decreased in 2023). Even still, when Trump signed the loan, Ladder Capital projected 40 Wall Street's annual gross income to be about $43.1 million. Not once has it reached that figure.

The building's annual operating expenses, meanwhile, have exceeded estimates. While Ladder Capital projected them to be $20.6 million a year, they've surpassed that figure every year since 2016, ranging from $20.9 million in 2017 to $23.6 million in 2019. Driven by repairs and maintenance costs that doubled Ladder Capital's estimates, operating expenses last year totaled $23.2 million.

Putting it all together, 40 Wall Street's net operating income in 2023 was $12.8 million. But leasing commissions, tenant improvements and other capital expenditures along with the annual $9.8 million payment to service his debt, resulted in 40 Wall Street putting just $1.2 million in Trump's pocket last year-a far cry from the $11 million Ladder Capital expected him to be raking in.

The future doesn't look any better. The lease Trump signed in 1995 requires him to pay the landowner about $2.5 million of annual rent right now. That is set to change dramatically, assuming he doesn't dump the leasehold or renegotiate. His payments on the ground lease are set to skyrocket in 2033, escalating to at least 6% of the value of the land, according to a lending prospectus. That shift would cause Trump's ground rent to soar from $2.8 million in 2032 to $16.3 million the following year, predicted Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate firm, in 2015 (the latest available). If the rest of 40 Wall Street's financial picture remained the same as it is today, that would leave Trump with a negative $5 million in net operating income in 2033.

Trump will likely struggle to find someone to loan him enough to pay off the entire principal when the mortgage comes due, given the shaky outlook of the real-estate market, the onerous terms of his lease, and the fact that he's likely underwater on his investment. Using his own money to pay off part of the principal and borrowing to cover the rest is still an option. Trump could also declare bankruptcy on 40 Wall Street (it would be his seventh bankruptcy, although it'd break new ground for him by being his first not involving a hotel). Unless Ladder Capital retained a stake in the loan, it will be in the clear, said Amiyatosh Purnanandam, a professor of finance at the University of Michigan. ""The losses will be borne by investors who own these certificates,"" Purnanandam said. ""They can range from banks to insurance companies to hedge funds.""

If Trump does stick around, he could renegotiate his leasehold with the German shipbuilding magnates, right around the time he is either beginning a potential second term as president or figuring out his next move."
Why Starting A Side Hustle Is The Smartest Financial Move,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissahouston/2024/10/06/why-starting-a-side-hustle-is-the-smartest-financial-move/,2024-10-06T10:05:19Z,"In our current economy, where the cost of living has spiked and job security is increasingly uncertain, having one source of income can leave you financially vulnerable. Starting a side hustle has become more than just a trend; it's a financial necessity.

The most obvious benefit of starting a side hustle is the additional income it provides. Having a second stream of income can be a game changer when you're working toward financial goals, whether it's saving for retirement, paying down debt, or building an emergency fund. By maintaining your day job, you reduce the financial risk of entrepreneurship while still reaping the benefits of growing a business on the side.

Unlike relying solely on a paycheck, which can be limiting and risky, side hustles allow you to build financial security over time.

For those dreaming of leaving corporate life behind, a side hustle is often the first step toward entrepreneurship. It allows you to dip your toes into business ownership without the pressure of immediate financial success. You can experiment with ideas, learn valuable lessons about marketing and sales, and refine your offerings -- all while maintaining the security of a paycheck.

Launching a side hustle is the best way to test the waters if you've been thinking about entrepreneurship. As you build your side hustle, you'll gain confidence in your ability to run a business, which could eventually lead to full-time entrepreneurship.

There are tax advantages to starting a side hustle. Expenses such as supplies, software, office space, and even a portion of your home can be written off as business expenses, which can reduce your taxable income.

Every expense related to growing your side business becomes an opportunity to save on taxes, giving you more financial flexibility. By managing these tax benefits effectively, you create a cushion that can help stabilize your personal and business finances as you scale your business.

A side hustle offers something much more valuable than money. It offers empowerment. There's a unique satisfaction that comes from creating something of your own, from being the boss of your time, and knowing that you're not solely dependent on someone else for your financial wellbeing.

By building your own business on the side, you're taking control of your financial future. This financial independence is not only empowering but also crucial as you prepare for retirement or other life transitions. Having that additional stream of income means you can retire on your own terms or continue working in a way that fits your lifestyle.

Let's face it, the traditional retirement age is not as secure as it once was. Pensions are rare, and social security alone won't be enough to maintain your current lifestyle. Starting a side hustle can help bridge that gap. By building a side business that generates passive or active income, you can continue to earn well into your retirement years, giving you more control and security over your financial future.

The bottom line is that starting a side hustle doesn't have to be overwhelming. It can start as something small, such as freelancing, selling products online, or offering services in your area of expertise. The key is to start. Over time, you'll find that this extra income, along with the skills and opportunities it brings, can significantly improve your financial situation."
The Foundations Of Great Career Coaching,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewabela/2024/10/06/the-foundations-of-great-career-coaching/,2024-10-06T09:01:48Z,"Every great career coach draws from their own source of expertise. Matching that source of expertise with your own specific coaching goals can be the key to achieving your objectives.

Coaches draw from different sources of expertise: professional experience, often based on decades in a particular industry or function; formal training; research; wide network of relationships and contacts; and from a sense of deep empathy with their clients.

While many will draw from multiple sources, you can often identify one main source of expertise for each coach. Different types of expertise can be beneficial for different coaching needs.

If you are looking for help with a major transition, or stalled career, a coach that has a formalized set of frameworks for guiding people through such events can be very helpful.

Julie Gerdeman is Global Head of Data & Analytics for BNY (Bank of New York Mellon), and a client of coach Mark Nevins. She uses several frameworks that she learned from Mark, including the ""stakeholder management plan."" According to Julie, ""this involves understanding key influencers and the dynamics of engaging with them to accomplish your most important goals."" With Mark's help, she created a map of all the key individuals in her network -- her own personal stakeholders -- and what roles they play in achieving the outcomes she's working towards, and uses it to guide her interactions with them.

The ""four questions pulse check"" is a framework she finds helpful both for performance review season, and also, with Mark's encouragement, in regular conversations with her direct reports. She attests that it is ""very simple and usually generates a productive discussion."" The four questions, as told by Julie, are:

Julie finds this framework to be highly effective: ""My team members open up quickly and appreciate the 'safe space' to share what might not be going so well and how we can work together to address them. Question 4 in particular is a great way to ensure I am doing what I can to remove obstacles to help achieve our objectives. I have found this framework to work every time, with everyone.""

Coaches working from this source of expertise need the wisdom to adapt their use of frameworks to individual clients. Joel Bines is a retail expert, Managing Partner at Spruce Advisory LLP, author of The Metail Economy, and also a client of Mark's. ""Frameworks are critical to effective coaching,"" he says. ""At the same time, adapting frameworks to the situation, instead of dogmatic adherence to a framework, is what makes a good coach a great coach.""

That flexibility is key. ""When I met Mark, the first thing I said was 'I am uncoachable,' but what I really meant was 'I am different, so don't try a cookie-cutter approach with me.' Had he pushed a framework-first methodology, we would have gotten nowhere. Instead, he adapted his framework to my situation brilliantly, and as a result became an invaluable coach, friend and advisor.""

For those in search of guidance on career fit, a coach whose source of expertise rests on a deep foundation of research can be the right choice, facilitating an evidence-based match between your own personality and preferences, and career alternatives. Jacque Merrit is a Senior Consultant and Executive Coach at Gallup who coaches based on the CliftonStrengths system. CliftonStrengths (formerly called StrengthsFinder) is built on extensive empirical research and identifies a stable set of strengths for each person, which are useful in guiding career choice and development.

Jacque has been coaching with CliftonStrengths since its inception in 1999. She notes that ""CliftonStrengths not only enhances mutual awareness of my clients' natural talents but also helps them gain confidence in their abilities, understand themselves more deeply, and live authentically. This focus encourages them to appreciate the unique strengths of others, build diverse teams, and approach interactions with curiosity rather than judgment, ultimately paving the way for greater success in their leadership roles.""

A powerful source of expertise for coaches can be their own life experience. Working with such a coach can be particularly suitable for someone struggling to climb out of a difficult situation. Daniel Gasser knows about difficult situations. A heroin addict in his late teen years, the Zurich, Switzerland-based coach was able to overcome his drug addiction, only to fall into three decades of alcohol abuse. ""I was a complete a**hole,"" he says in his Swiss-German accent. A severe car accident some years ago was a wakeup call, leading him to reform his life successfully, and he now specializes in coaching women on how to deal with men who are like the person he was.

Coaches not only draw from their source of expertise, they can also integrate their clients into it. This is the case when a coach's source of expertise is their own large network, which allows them to stay current from a wide range of sources and make new connections for their clients. Choose a coach with this source of expertise when you are personally looking to expand your own network to find new customers and business opportunities.

Cory Warfield has half a million followers on LinkedIn, and coaches his clients on how to build their own networks. Alexey Navolokin leads semiconductor company AMD's commercial sales organization in the Asia-Pacific region. When he started working with Cory four years ago, he already had 70,000 LinkedIn followers. Cory ""provided guidance on building and maintaining professional relationships through LinkedIn. He assisted me in creating engaging and valuable content that showcases my expertise and attracts followers, and helped to craft effective messages to reach my target audience and generate leads."" Following Cory's guidance, Navolokin has surpassed his coach's reach, with over 700,000 followers today.

Coaches themselves appreciate the value of a good coach. David Citron's firm, expressocoaching.com, ""helps adults with ADHD who are procrastinating their goals, unleash their superpower in 4 minutes a day,"" according to David, and he is also a client of Cory's. David was having great success with his existing clients, but wanted to reach a broader audience. Working with Cory helped him grow from 9,000 to over 100,000 LinkedIn followers in four months. He now has clients in 31 countries across 6 continents.

When you hire a career coach, you don't just hire the person -- you hire their expertise, experience, background, and connections. Make sure that this package fits what you are hoping to accomplish."
Kurdish official warns US: 'now is not the time' to pull forces out of Iraq',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kurdish-special-representative-talks-about-us-plan-withdraw-from-iraq,2024-10-06T08:21:49Z,"National security analyst Rebecca Grant joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the attack on the U.S. airbase in Iraq and why she believes Biden is nearing war with Iran as tensions escalate.

As the U.S. mulls over a plan to withdraw troops from Iraq, its Kurdish allies have a message: Don't forget us.

""This is not the time to reduce coalition forces in Iraq,"" Treefa Aziz, the Kurdistan Regional Government's special representative to the U.S., told Fox News Digital.

""Extremist groups like ISIS and armed militias continue to pose a serious threat to the people of Iraq and the Kurdistan Region.""

The U.S. announced plans to shrink the U.S. ""footprint"" in Iraq and end the current mission of coalition forces - including the Kurds - to fight ISIS, but declined to say how many of the 2,500 troops currently stationed there would remain.

""A decade ago, Kurdish Peshmerga forces worked alongside U.S. troops to defeat ISIS and continue to actively combat ISIS remnants to prevent a resurgence of terror today,"" Aziz said. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) ""has been a reliable security partner for the United States and remains ready to enhance cooperation.""

But now, if Baghdad is pushing the U.S. out of Iraq, the U.S. could feel it must honor that request or risk making another enemy in the Middle East. The KRG says it would be ""willing and able"" to host U.S. coalition forces in its territory.

The current mission is now set to end by September 2025, with a plan to keep the number of forces on the Iraqi side to back up the 900 U.S. troops in Syria until at least 2026.

News of a plan that could amount to a significant drawdown of U.S. forces called to mind 2019, when former President Donald Trump announced plans to pull out of Syria and the Kurds felt abandoned by a partner they had fought alongside for years - leaving them open to an attack by Turkish forces.

PENTAGON PLANS TO SHRINK US 'FOOTPRINT' IN IRAQ

Trump, at the time, left the Kurds with a warning to their longtime enemies: ""I have told Turkey that if they do anything outside of what we would think is humane . . . they could suffer the wrath of an extremely decimated economy.""

The U.S. relationship with the Kurds - an indigenous group of daring fighters whose quest for their own formal state has been unsuccessful - spans back decades.

When the Turks denied the U.S. passage into Iraq for the invasion in 2003, Iraqi Kurds helped the U.S. overthrow Saddam Hussein.

The Kurds have fought with U.S. coalition forces since they reentered Iraq in 2014 to fight ISIS, and the U.S. pledged arms support and humanitarian aid.

The group faces attacks from terror groups on all sides. And as Iran increasingly encroaches on the Iraqi government, Baghdad has the KRG in a choke-hold, officials say.

US, IRAQ TEAM UP TO KILL 15 ISIS OPERATIVES

""There is growing concern regarding efforts to weaken the federal system in Iraq. The constitutional framework, which is designed to ensure shared governance, is disregarded,"" one Kurdish official said.

""The continued suspension of oil exports from the Kurdistan region has placed significant economic strain. More than a year and half later, we have yet to see the resumption of these exports.""

The KRG has been trying to work with the Iraqis on a power-sharing agreement with no real results.

""Some of these actions appear to align with external influences rather than the broader national interest,"" the official said, referring to Iranian influence. ""With the assistance of our allies, we believe these issues can be resolvable through constructive dialogue and cooperation.""

The KRG is also asking the U.S. government to ""honor its commitment"" included in the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to ""provide the KRG with a comprehensive air defense system.

The law required the Department of Defense to submit and implement a plan for providing the Iraqi security forces and Kurdistan Region with air defenses by July 2024.

""As a steadfast U.S. ally that is regularly targeted by extremist violence, the KRG requires assurances that it will be protected from all threats, both internal and external,"" said Aziz.

Gen. Michael Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, told the House Armed Services Committee in March that ISIS-K, which launched a horrific attack in Moscow earlier this year, ""retains the capability and the will to attack U.S. and Western interests abroad in as little as six months with little to no warning."""
Sense And Nonsense About Taxes,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngoodman/2024/10/05/sense-and-nonsense-about-taxes/,2024-10-06T01:51:36Z,"As we draw closer to the November elections, there is an inordinate amount of attention being paid to ""disinformation,"" and a great deal of fact-checking of candidates' statements.

Yet here are four surprising facts: (1) the subject on which there is the most disinformation is ""taxes""; (2) almost all the disinformation comes from the left; (3) it is spread to the general public by the mainstream media; and (4) it is almost never fact-checked.

Most of the benefits of the 2017 (Trump) tax cuts went to the rich.

The tax code today is just as progressive (if not more so) than it was before the tax cuts went into effect.

Surprisingly, both these statements are true. The first statement is true but misleading. The second statement is simply true.

What is rarely said in policy debates is that for the most part, half the population isn't paying income taxes at all. Specifically, the top one-half of taxpayers are paying 97.9% of all income taxes, while the bottom half pays a paltry 2.3%. So, it's hard to think of a tax cut that wouldn't confer most of the benefits on the top half of the income distribution.

Progressivity is a different matter. Suppose we cut everyone's taxes by 1%. For a millionaire, that would be $10,000. For a $30,000-a-year worker, that would be $300. That's a big difference in raw numbers. But from an equality standpoint, everyone's share of the country's after-tax income would be the same both before and after the tax cut.

If we define the rich broadly (to refer to the upper half), their share is already approaching 100% and that is as high as it can go. But even if we are talking about the really rich, their share is quite high.

The top 1% (people who earned more than $682,577 in 2021) paid 45% of all income taxes collected that year. The top 10% (earning more than $169,800) paid three-fourths of all income taxes.

This reflects the fact that the United States has the most progressive tax system in the world. We tax the rich proportionally more than any other country.

Why is our income tax system so progressive?

Although they don't like to talk about it, Republicans are the main reason. Going all the way back to Ronald Reagan, every Republican tax bill threw more and more people off the income tax rolls. Through this and other provisions, Republicans have been shifting the tax burden to the rich every time they have legislated on taxes.

Both private and government analyses confirm that the same is true of the 2017 tax reform law. In 2018, the top 20 percent of the income distribution faced a lower tax rate, but they paid a larger share of the total tax burden than the year before.

Had Democratic opponents had their way, the share of the tax burden would actually be lower for the rich and higher for low- and moderate-income families than it is today.

What about corporate taxes?

Although corporations send checks to the U.S. Treasury, economists do not regard corporate entities as bearing the real burden of taxation. That burden is borne by people in their role as shareholders, workers, customers, etc.

The Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimates that 20% of the corporate income tax is paid by labor in the form of lower wages and 80% is paid by capital (lower dividends and interest payments, for example). For certain types of tax changes, the TPC assumes a 50/50 split. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assumes that 25% is paid by labor, and it is the official score keeper for Congress.

When Joe Biden and Kamala Harris say that raising the corporate income tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent will not result in a tax on anyone earning less than $400,000, almost no economist will agree with that assertion. If members of Congress vote for the measure, they will be instructed by the CBO that they are voting to take one out of every four dollars of increased government revenue out of the pockets of ordinary American workers.

Also, remember that workers are also shareholders through their pension plans, 401(k) plans and IRA accounts. So, to the extent that corporate taxes fall on capital, workers bear part of that burden as well.

The most sophisticated model of international capital flows and corporate taxes ever developed has been produced by Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff and his colleagues. Their finding: the burden of corporate taxation is almost entirely shifted to labor. If Kotlikoff and his colleagues are right, then almost all of the Biden/Harris proposed increase in corporate taxes will come out of the pockets of people who make less than $400,000 a year.

Taxing capital gains

Last time I checked, the stock price of Microsoft was $416. That's what investors have to pay for the right to share in the company's earnings indefinitely into the future, as long as they hold the stock. The world ""future"" is key. If a sell my share after a rise in price, I will have a capital gain. But that gain does not reflect any increase in income to Microsoft. It merely reflects a change in the market's expectations.

Eventually the future will arrive, Microsoft will experience real earnings, and investors will pay taxes on those earnings. That's why we don't need a capital gains tax on the trading of Microsoft stock. Eventually, all of Microsoft earnings will be taxed by regular income taxes.

It is noteworthy that capital gains are not included in the calculation of GDP. They are nowhere to be found in our national income accounts. Ditto for capital losses.

If there were a logical reason to tax capital gains, there would be an equally compelling reason to allow the full deduction of capital losses. But were that allowed, the government would probably get no net income in the process. By way of analogy, the only reason the government collects any money by taxing the winnings of gamblers is because it doesn't allow them a full deduction for their losses.

Taxing unrealized capital gains is even harder to justify. It would be like taxing the gambler -- not at the end an evening of gaming, but after each time a roll of the dice produces a win, while ignoring each time there is a loss.

What is wrong with taxing investment to pay for consumption?

Take the progressive $5 trillion plan for cradle-to-the-grave benefits, including child care, elder care and everything in between. Like the idea of taxing unrealized capital gains, almost all progressive ideas for new revenue involve confiscating funds that are now in the capital market and using those funds to pay for current consumption.

But less investment means slower economic growth. And that means our children and grandchildren will have a lower standard of living. And since economic growth is the greatest anti-poverty program ever discovered, slower growth means more people will continue to live in poverty for a longer period of time.

That's why many economists - on the right and the left - advocate a progressive consumption tax, with no tax on saving and investment. That would be a fairer tax. It would tax the rich for what they take out of the economy by consuming, but not tax them on what they contribute to the economy by saving and investing."
"Trump returns to rally crowd in Butler, Pa., site of July assassination attempt",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/05/nx-s1-5141961/trump-butler-pa-july-shooting-return,2024-10-06T00:37:59Z,"Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump arrives at a campaign rally at the Butler Farm Show grounds on Saturday, in Butler, Pa. Evan Vucci/AP hide caption

The July 13 assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump's life was a recurring theme at a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pa. on Saturday.

Trump returned to speak at the Butler Farm Show grounds in the small Pennsylvania city -- the site where, nearly three months ago, a gunman's bullets grazed the Republican presidential nominee's ear, as well as killed one rally attendee and injured two others.

""Exactly 12 weeks ago this evening on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me and to silence the greatest movement, MAGA, in the history of our country,"" Trump said in one of his many references to his near-death experience. ""But by the hand of providence and the grace of God, that villain did not succeed in his goal, did not come close. He did not stop our movement, he did not break out our spirit. He did not shake our unyielding resolve to save America from evils of poverty, hatred and destruction.""

Speaking from behind transparent screens owing to heightened security, Trump honored Corey Comperatore -- the man who was fatally shot during Trump's rally in July -- with a moment of silence. Bells tolled and tenor Christopher Macchio's sang Franz Schubert's ""Ave Maria,"" a piece often performed at funerals. Trump also expressed thanks to the Secret Service team and medical professionals who came to his aid.

Crowds waited for hours in the Pennsylvania sun to hear Trump speak. Their cries of ""Fight! Fight! Fight!"" punctuated the action on stage.

Other speakers at the event also referenced the July 13 shooting.

Eric Trump appeared to blame his father's political opponents for the assassination attempt: ""They tried to kill him,"" Trump's son said. ""And it's because the Democratic Party, they can't do anything right.""

Elon Musk focused on Trump's bravery: ""The true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire,"" the billionaire entrepreneur said. ""We had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot.""

Beyond the references to the July shooting, Trump's speech focused on many of his usual talking points, including putting an end to illegal immigration, the importance of fossil fuels to the U.S. economy (""We are going to drill, baby, drill!"") and his plan to turn the country into a ""manufacturing superpower again.""

He also twice repeated his plan ""to keep men out of women's sports"" on the grounds of it being ""so demeaning to women."""
"Latinos shifting to Trump because they have 'internalized racism,' journalist claims",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/latinos-shifting-trump-because-have-internalized-racism-journalist-claims,2024-10-05T21:09:19Z,"Paolo Ramos argues in her new book that Latinos are shifting toward former President Trump because of internalized racism stemming from colonization.

Journalist and MSNBC contributor Paola Ramos, daughter of Jorge Ramos, blamed ""internalized racism"" for why Latinos are leaving the Democratic Party and supporting former President Trump.

Ramos appeared on PBS' ""Amanpour & Company"" this week to address the trend covered in her new book, ""Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means.""

Trump appears to be outperforming his 2020 support among Latinos who prefer the Republican over Vice President Kamala Harris on handling the economy and immigration.

The Democratic Party's advantage with these voters is shrinking, according to NBC News, whose poll last week found the Democrats' edge is at its lowest level in the past four presidential election cycles.

MSNBC GUEST CLAIMS LATINOS 'WANT TO BE WHITE' WHILE DISCUSSING THEIR SHIFT TOWARD GOP

In discussions with Trump-supporting Latinos for her book, Ramos said she found that ""tribalism, traditionalism, and political trauma"" were the three driving forces behind this growing trend.

""Really understanding the sort of racial baggage that I believe a lot of Latinos, including myself, and a lot of us are carrying from Latin America. What it means to sort of been colonized for so many years, the weight of colonization, that, in of itself, I believe, creates a lot of internalized racism, a lot of colorism, that then manifests in American politics in so many ways,"" Ramos began.

""And that's then how you can explain the fact that even someone like Donald Trump feels so comfortable going to the Bronx, talking to a group of Black Latinos, and Latino Trump supporters, because he believes that he can sort of tap into a racial and ethnic grievance that is very familiar,"" she continued.

Ramos told USA Today that traditionalism and trauma also play into the trend.

""There's traditionalism which is just breaking down what centuries of colonization have done to us and has led us to be so fixated on certain gender norms and sexual norms and then also leads us to this slippery slope of admiring things like Christian nationalism and then the trauma of this sort of admiration and a lot of Latinos flirting with the strongman rule and where that comes from,"" she said.

Last week, MSNBC guest Maria Hinojosa claimed Latinos ""want to be White"" while discussing the political shift toward Trump among Hispanics.

""And what I said to you when we asked a question was, Latinos want to be White. They want to be with the cool kids,"" she said.

Hinojosa went on to say that those voters could cost Harris the election.

""But those numbers? They could cost Kamala Harris the election. Everything that I've been saying that Latinos could push her over the top, these are the numbers that could also take her down,"" she said.

Vice President Kamala Harris currently has a 12-point lead among registered Hispanic voters, according to the latest Fox News poll.

Mortgage Rates 5 October 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-05-10-24/,2024-10-05T19:31:10Z,"Bank Rate was held at 5% in September by the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steadying interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Good news on inflation and interest rates has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy. We will know more in its Autumn Budget on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.45%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.47% and 4.20% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 3.59%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 3.79% and 3.68% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.57%, with the best in this category priced at 5.15%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stands at 7.23%, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 October there were 6,645 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,460 on 1 September. The number has been steadily growing as the market improves. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

Nationwide's latest house price report (published 30 September) reported that average property values in September were 3.7% higher than the previous year. It marks the strongest annual house price growth since November 2022. On a monthly basis, the rise was 0.7% when compared to August. Nationwide, which bases its index on mortgage data, puts the cost of the average home in September at £266,094.

The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before. It marks the fifth consecutive month of rises. On a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."
Stunning photos of a vast e-waste dumping ground  --  and those who make a living off it,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/10/05/g-s1-6411/electronics-public-health-waste-ghana-phones-computers,2024-10-05T17:35:53Z,"The now-demolished Agbogbloshie Scrapyard in Accra, Ghana, once received 250,000 tons of electronic waste each year, making it the world's largest electronic waste dump. Muntaka Chasant hide caption

When he was just 18 years old, Emmanuel Akatire traveled about 500 miles from his home in Zorko, Ghana, to Accra, the nation's capital, to find the only work he could -- sifting through vast piles of discarded electronics to find valuable scrap metal. A week's worth of painstaking, often dangerous work, earns him the equivalent of about 60 U.S. dollars.

""I started doing scrap work around 2021 -- after I lost both my parents -- to provide for the rest of my family,"" he told Muntaka Chasant, a photojournalist in Ghana. ""There's no electricity in my community, no development there,"" he said. So he came to Accra, which has become a major dumping ground for the globe's used electronics.

For years, a site called Agbogbloshie in Accra was the world's largest e-waste dump, getting 250,000 tons of discarded phones, computers and other used electronics each year. Many Western media outlets depicted the site as a public health and environmental tragedy, rife with toxic chemicals that leach into the water and poison the air. While that's undoubtedly true, it's not the full story, according to a new collaborative photojournalism project.

The project, called E-Waste in Ghana: Tracing Transboundary Flows, which won this year's Fondation Carmingac photojournalism award, aims to capture both the positive and negative aspects of e-waste.

""The world cannot throw all its garbage here, it has truly negative consequences on the people,"" says Anas Aremeyaw Anas, an investigative journalist in Ghana who co-led the project. ""But there are positive aspects of sending us e-waste,"" he says, as it's sparked a dynamic, informal recycling economy in the country that, while often dangerous, can also help lift people like Emmanuel Akatire out of poverty.

Globally, e-waste is an enormous problem. In 2022, humans discarded about 62 million tons of used electronics, enough to fill a line of trucks that spans the equator. But there's opportunity too, as those trucks contain over $91 billion of valuable metals, the U.N. estimates, though people like Akatire who do the dangerous recycling work reap the smallest share of those potential profits.

E-waste falls into two broad buckets: functional and non-functional. The line between them can be fuzzy, as what's still usable or repairable to one person may not be to another, but the distinction is important. International laws prohibit trafficking of non-functional e-waste containing toxic substances, but the United Nations sees trading functional e-waste as beneficial, as it can lengthen the lifespan of a product.

The project found that exporters often fail to separate functional from non-functional e-waste. ""If you have a container full of TV screens, how on earth are you going to verify each and every one of them to make sure that they are functioning,"" says photojournalist Bénédicte Kurzen, a co-author of the project. As a result, both kinds of e-waste get stuffed into container ships that make their way to low- and middle-income countries like Ghana.

Formally, Ghana prohibits the import of many forms of hazardous e-waste material. But the team found that a well-placed bribe can get port officials to look the other way. As a result, informal e-waste sites are growing across Ghana's coast. There, both functional and non-functional e-waste get dumped into vast piles that are encroaching on residential areas. Thousands of ""pickers"" come to these sites, picking through the rubbish to separate items that might be repaired from waste that could contain valuable minerals.

Many of the pickers are climate migrants from an area of Ghana known as the ""Upper East,"" says project co-author Chasant, where warming temperatures are upending traditional farming practices. ""This area has the highest unemployment rate among young people,"" he says. They come to e-waste sites to earn money during the dry season, Chasant says, which they bring back to the Upper East. ""There's a whole generation of young people that are building their society from e-waste work.""

It's fraught, precarious work. To separate valuable minerals, like copper wire or iron, from useless plastic, pickers often burn the trash, producing noxious fumes. Burns, cuts and other injuries are common. E-waste workers -- many of whom are children, the team found -- are at risk of exposure to over 1,000 harmful chemicals, according to the World Health Organization, including lead, mercury and brominated flame retardants, which are linked to higher rates of diseases like cancer and diabetes.

Bernard Akanwee Atubawuna, a 21-year-old picker from Upper East, died while doing scrap work, says Chasant. His cause of death is unknown, but ""Akanwee was a sickle-cell carrier and should never have been anywhere near fires/picking. But his parents said it was the only way he supported them. He sent his sister to learn a trade. He was also helping the parents to build a house back in the Upper East -- all from picking.""

The harms extend beyond the dumps themselves. ""There are many communities that have run to a halt as a result of the devastating effects of the poisonous gases that are inhaled,"" says Anas. Heavy metals seep into the soil and water too, which can have profound health effects on local communities. ""When people start burning, the poisonous fumes lead to people relocating.""

A burgeoning recycling and repair industry has risen up alongside those harms. The team documented informal marketplaces, where vendors sell scores of busted cell phones to buyers looking to repair circuit boards or extract their precious metals. On Zongo Lane in Accra, the reporters say, hundreds of small, independent shops sell used or repaired equipment, ranging from televisions to computers.

""In Africa, people still have this thing of repairing is important. Don't throw it away. You can still do things about it,"" says Kurzen. In Western countries, people view these objects as much more disposable, she says, which is helping fuel the growth of e-waste worldwide.

The most valuable minerals extracted from Ghana's e-waste often don't stay in Ghana. Many of the most valuable items get cherry picked and sent to more advanced smelters in Europe or Asia, the team found. ""People are dismantling these items in toxic environments, and then the few piles that contain incredibly valuable minerals are going to be re-exported,"" says Kurzen.

She and her colleagues hope that the project prompts people to re-examine their relationship to the electronics in their lives. The few years we spend with a new phone represents just a blip in the story of the materials that power it, Kurzen says. ""Those materials are traveling worldwide,"" she says, ""These [devices] we hold in our hands come at the expense of somebody, somewhere in the world. Nothing comes for free."""
Re-Imagining Jobs And Future Proofing Careers In The Age Of AI,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lindsaykohler/2024/10/05/re-imagining-jobs-and-future-proofing-careers-in-the-age-of-ai/,2024-10-05T17:09:49Z,"In the fast-evolving world of work, there is a lot of conversation and theorizing on which jobs might be displaced by generative AI. While many are focused on the threat, there are two more compelling questions to ask. First, which roles are least susceptible to AI disruption? And second, which roles need to evolve in this new era of working -- regardless of the impact of AI?

We're in a time where businesses are increasingly thinking about the composition of the skills they need, the roles within the organization to deliver their strategy, and what outside support is required. A new report from Indeed's Hiring Lab sheds light on the skills and roles employers are seeking in today's market. Regarding the outside support needed to close any gaps, consultants and freelancers remain the go-to resource -- but they need to evolve their craft, too.

Let's look at the impact of AI first on the talent market. The fact remains that there are some jobs that AI cannot easily replace. ""We assessed all the different skills in Indeed job postings, and the jobs least exposed to AI replacement are those that require hands-on work such as driving and nursing, empathetic skills, and childcare,"" says Jack Kennedy, Indeed's senior economist. It seems that the human touch, whether it's physical or emotional, is still something AI cannot easily replicate.

The flip side, of course, is that many jobs are susceptible to AI disruption. ""There's a whole swathe of the job market that, when you break down which tasks are involved, AI can replace or enhance those tasks,"" says Kennedy. ""It can be productivity-enhancing in some instances; it can completely take over tasks in other instances; and still there are other parts of the role that it can't replace. I think a lot of jobs are going to change in the nature of the work required. It's early days, but we're certainly seeing that more job postings include AI-related terms. Interestingly, a lot of the categories where that's prevalent are not in tech. We're seeing it more and more in occupational job postings, such as research and development, media and communications, marketing, art, banking, and architecture. The job descriptions are incorporating this gen-AI phraseology.""

But, for all the hype around AI, the number of Indeed job postings containing AI-related terms is sitting at just 2-3%. ""Despite all of the focus on AI, for many employers they are more focused on basic computer literacy,"" says Kennedy. ""The pool of candidates with advanced AI technical skills is still quite a limited one. We're still in the early stages."" Dan French, CEO of Consider Solutions, agrees. ""The thing about the AI boom right now that we've got to remember is that AI has been around for decades. What's got people excited in the past 18 months is generative AI, which is a very specific niche. And I think there's less mileage in generative AI than people claim.""

In terms of seeking outside resources for support, businesses continue to turn to freelancers and consultants. There's an active narrative around freelancers and the gig economy -- but no one is talking about how the role of the consultant is also due for an overhaul. ""Traditionally, there are two business reasons that people use consultants,"" says French. ""There's either a new executive, or there's some big business problem where executives want to create some time to take a breath, so they hire McKinsey. They almost don't care what the solution is; it just gives them six months to think about what to do next.""

Now, businesses are looking for real partners and getting more value out of their consultants. ""I think businesses are looking for a genuine diagnosis of business problems, but they don't want to outsource the problem anymore -- they want to own the answer. It has to be a collaborative partnership,"" says French. Moreover, consultants must deliver more value if they want to stay in the game. ""I speak to executives every week who say, 'We've just hired XYZ firm at a cost of 12 million, and all we got was a report of everything we told them -- but nothing extra. We could've used generative AI for that,'"" says French.

As we navigate this era of change, employers must get more creative in how they get the job done -- whether that be reimagining roles, accurately assessing the skills needed in the business, or strategically engaging outside support. Employees should consider how they can future-proof their careers. The question for today's workforce is not just ""Will AI take my job?"" but rather, ""How can I re-imagine my role?"" Now is the time to focus on cultivating skills that AI can't replicate, whether that's empathy, hands-on expertise, collaboration, or the ability to think creatively."
Kamala Harris' support with Arab and Muslim communities in Michigan is 'tenuous': Democratic strategist,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-support-arab-muslim-communities-michigan-tenuous-democratic-strategist,2024-10-05T16:59:38Z,"Political commentator Ameshia Cross warned that Vice President Harris is facing warning signs among Arab and Muslim communities, especially in Michigan.

Political commentator and Democratic strategist Ameshia Cross warned that Vice President Harris is facing warning signs among Arab and Muslim communities, especially in key battleground states like Michigan.

""It's very tenuous at this point,"" Cross said of Harris' support among the Arab community on CNN Friday. ""I think that what we saw over the summer and prior to that with the campus uprisings across the country, we heard from young people who are very concerned, but also saw that certain college presidents lost their jobs and we've seen the community over and over again, specifically the uncommitted vote, call out where President Biden as well as Vice President Harris are on this issue.""

Some Harris allies have also signaled concern at Harris' support in Michigan, with Democratic Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin telling donors that Harris is ""underwater"" with voters in Michigan, per audio obtained by Axios.

76 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS YET TO DO FORMAL PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE EMERGING AS DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

""I think that at this point there has to be especially a concern in Michigan because you have such a large population of Arab voters,"" she said.

""But in addition to that, we've seen this really affect younger voters and their preferences as well,"" Cross continued, also advising Harris that she should ""take a very clear stance on what will happen, how the U.S. will continue to move forward, are we in support of watching thousands of innocent Palestinians continue to die in this war?""

Some recent polls also indicate that former President Donald Trump may be closing in on Harris in the key battleground states of both Michigan and neighboring Wisconsin. Harris received 48% of support among likely Michigan voters in a New York Times/Siena College poll this week, while Trump garnered 47% support in the poll -- effectively locking the pair in a tie well within the poll's margin of error.

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital."
5 Questions For The Fed's Austan Goolsbee -- Including: Did They Move Fast Enough On Inflation?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/05/5-questions-for-the-feds-austan-goolsbee-including-did-they-move-fast-enough-on-inflation/,2024-10-05T12:09:41Z,"It's an unusually tense time at the Federal Reserve as Democrats and Republicans -- including former President Donald Trump -- target the central bank as it starts cutting rates in its most significant monetary policy in decades. Forbes spoke with Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, an alternate member on the highly watched Federal Open Market Committee and a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Obama, about how ""super serious"" central bankers feel about becoming a political football ahead of the election, how the Fed is adjusting to easing inflation and growing recession angst, and what he'd change about the ""behind the curve"" policy leading to the worst inflation crisis in the U.S. since the early 1980s.

Forbes: Have there been any discussions at Federal Open Market Committee meetings about pressure from both sides of the political aisle to act in a certain way heading into the election? Context: The FOMC is the U.S. central bank panel that votes on the target federal funds rate, which heavily influences interest rates on loans across the country, impacting inflation, economic growth and unemployment. The Fed is under heightened scrutiny after rolling out the first interest rate cuts since early 2020 last month. The reaction function refers to how a central bank responds to one event, like lowering rates when inflation rises.

When you become a sworn member of the Federal Reserve, you're out of the election business. Everybody takes that super seriously. The things that determine our decisions are: What are the economic conditions and what are the forecasts. What would we need to see to stop raising? What would we need to see to hold? What do we need to see for stuff to come down? We've been laying out the criteria, and now we're just seeing come to pass the stuff that we've been forecasting, and so the reaction function is pretty well established.

Forbes: What are the data points in the labor market that you are paying the closest attention to meeting to meeting? Context: We interviewed Goolsbee two days before the September jobs report surprisingly revealed the strongest job growth since March, decelerating bets on continued aggression from the Fed on lowering rates and throwing another wrench into the central bank shift as borrowing costs look less likely to tumble.

Goolsbee: The unemployment rate, but everybody knows that. A little bit less, the payroll, job employment numbers. There was a time when, if you had asked me ""what's the single most important number?"" I probably would have said that, but not now, with the uncertainty about immigration and the uncertainty about these [revisions to jobs data].

This has been such a strange, unprecedented moment of new firm creation and self employment and different work arrangements. I think that's why we're having such major revisions on these [data points]. All of those things make me put a little bit less weight [on monthly nonfarm payrolls] since there's more of a question mark around [them]. All the measures that we tend to look at as economists to track the labor market - the ratio of vacancies to the number of unemployed, the employment-to-population ratio of prime age workforce, the quit rate, hiring rate, all of those things, plus the the new unemployment claims - I feel like they're all kind of saying the same thing.

The rate of change is all in the direction of cooling. And if you look in the past, it's quite rare that you see cooling labor markets that just settle into full employment. Usually, when things start to go bad, they keep getting worse. And so that's our challenge now: After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?

Forbes: Let's imagine we have that crystal ball and we're able to look forward to the end of next year. We officially stick the landing, core PCE runs right in that sweet spot of about 2%, and the federal funds rate falls to right around the median forecast around 3%. What risks for the second half of the decade are you most worried about? Context: Core PCE is the Fed's favored inflation metric as it tracks how much Americans spend monthly on goods and services outside of more volatile food and energy categories. Projections shared at the FOMC's latest meeting indicate officials have a median forecast of 3.4% at the end of 2025.

Goolsbee: It's productivity growth.

For productivity growth, the [data] matters the most over the long run, and in the short run, it's one of the most noisy [data points] there is. So that's why it's kind of hard to take that into account in the meeting-to-meeting monetary policy decisions. We saw wild swings in that over Covid...but in the last year-and-a-half, that growth rate of productivity has been averaging well higher than the trend before Covid.

Is that a sign that technology has changed, or is it AI? Is it something else? Is it hybrid work? Is it the business dynamism that we've had all these startups? Because if the productivity growth rate is going to be higher, even if not permanent [but] for the medium term, then the second half of the decade we're going to have a bunch of discussions like the second half of the 1990s, where there was an extended increase in the productivity growth rate. The implications for the economy are that you can grow faster and have more job growth without inflation in a world like that.

And income, wages are going to go up. Nobody needs to be nervous about wages going up at fast rates, because productivity growth will justify it. To me, that's an overwhelmingly important factor that we're going to have to think about in this second half.

Forbes: You're allowed to time travel back to mid-to-late 2021, right before inflation skyrocketed, and you can change one policy within relative reason. What do you choose? Context: After a decade of sub-3% inflation, prices began rising rapidly in 2021, and consumer price index inflation peaked in June 2022 at a 41-year high of 9.1%. The Fed didn't raise rates, the most common response to inflation, until March 2022, and raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to a two-decade high of over 5% in a 16-month span.

Goolsbee: I think looking back, if you had one thing to change, if you could know that the supply shocks were not going to be transitory in the three or four months sense, you would have started moving earlier.

You would not have been raising with this kind of rapidity that the Fed engaged in, 500 basis points in one year. That's about as fast as it's ever gone up. You would have started earlier but also realistically, I think it's worth considering how much lower you think inflation would be if they had done that. If you could have a crystal ball and have perfect timing and recognize it's not going to be a temporary supply shock lasting three months, it's going to be a temporary supply shock lasting two years, how much less would inflation be?

There were a lot of countries that tried both monetary and fiscal policy a lot of different ways, and, for the most part, they basically had the same inflation experience. It is instructive that there are limits to what the Fed could have done. But if I had one thing to do over - I wasn't on the FOMC at that time - but looking back, they were behind the curve, slow to move.

Forbes: I know you're a big fan of ""The Simpsons"" - what do you think Mr. Burns would want the FOMC to do now? What's the conversation like at Moe's tavern when CNBC comes on after the last FOMC meeting? Context: Goolsbee often references ""The Simpsons,"" the animated comedy which features curmudgeonly nuclear power tycoon Mr. Charles Burns and the pub ""Moe's Tavern,"" where Homer Simpson and his more working class drinking buddies congregate.

Goolsbee: Mr. Burns has, in various episodes, lots of cash, lots of equity and/or lots of bonds. So does he want high rates or low rates? I would like to think Mr. Burns, just out of his own pure self-interest, wants whatever is good for the economy. Financial stability seems like it is the order of the day for him. At Moe's Tavern, there's one of the episodes where they're showing old presidential debates, and Kennedy's like, 'I'd like to express my fondness for Duff beer,' and Richard Nixon's like, 'I would also like to express my fondness for that particular beer,' and it cuts Moe's Tavern. And they're like, 'That guy never drank a Duff in his life!' And I fear that Moe's Tavern, they would not be super enamored of the FOMC, but they should be. We're not the bad guys. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

[Goolsbee revised his Burns response in an email: ""Burns is a notorious gold bug that's still complaining that the Coinage Act got rid of the ha'penny in 1857. He's had it out for the Fed since we tipped off authorities in season 9 that he was the one who stole the 1 Trillion dollar bill after WWII.""]"
Opinion | Striking dock workers just set an example for all working folks,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dock-workers-strike-sent-powerful-message-bosses-workers-rcna173849,2024-10-05T11:58:58Z,"Dockworkers strike on a picket line outside of the Port of Houston Authority in Texas on Oct. 1.Brandon Bell / Getty Images

On Tuesday, dockworkers went on strike, shutting down ports across the East Coast and Gulf Coast to demand higher wages and a guarantee that automation won't be used to throw many of them out of work. It was a massive demonstration of the power of working people to grind the gears of the economy to a halt by simply refusing to show up.

The bosses caved in record time. Both sides agreed to a tentative deal Thursday. The dockworkers will return to work in exchange for a 62% pay increase over the next six years. That's a very good thing.

What's alarming is that even as the workers were being demonized by right-wing media outlets like The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, many liberals were fretting that the economic chaos resulting from foreign goods not coming into American ports would cost Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris the election. Even some otherwise left-of-center journalists were criticizing the workers for having the audacity to strike or even calling on President Joe Biden to force them back to work.

Naysayers had argued that the workers were greedy. As they saw it, dockworkers already made more than enough money. Others argued that by blocking automation, the workers were standing in the way of progress. Many observers said that collective bargaining is all well and good within reasonable limits, but shutting down this much of the flow of goods coming into the country was too much of an economic disruption to be allowed.

All of those arguments missed the mark by a mile. The only structural power the working class has in a capitalist system is the power to disrupt the economy by withdrawing its labor. That's the entire point of union organizing.

In this case, the union members stuck to their guns and won. Their victory is a victory for everyone who has to sell their working hours to a boss to make a living.

There were breathless headlines about dockworkers who make ""six-figure salaries,"" but those were about the top earners. As Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pointed out in his statement of solidarity with the striking workers, the average income for these workers is $60,000 a year, with ""many East Coast port workers mak[ing] as little as $20 an hour -- the same wage that a fast food worker in California currently makes."" And loading and unloading cargo ships is demanding work, often involving very long hours. The idea that these workers are overentitled clashes jarringly with these basic realities.

There's a much bigger problem, though, with the idea that striking dockworkers didn't deserve support because they already made good wages. That argument assumes that labor activity is just a way of procuring charity for workers who are poor and desperate enough to need it. That's exactly the wrong way to think about it. The labor movement exists to give the working-class majority of a society a say in what goes on at the workplaces where they spend half their waking hours and some input into how the profits created by their hard work are divided up. It imposes some small measure of democracy on the economy. The more that happens, the more everyone who works for a living benefits.

Every dollar that doesn't reach the pockets of workers pads the profits of already wildly profitable companies. The ocean carriers have made record profits in the last few years: $400 billion since 2020. Meanwhile, the dockworkers whose labor does so much to produce those profits are actually making 12% less than they were two decades ago, when adjusted for inflation. Why should the bosses hoard the benefits of the industry's success? If some dockworkers make more money than you do at your job, then why should your conclusion be that the dockworkers are greedy and not that you should organize with your co-workers for a better deal?

It's all too easy to think of corporate CEOs and shareholders raking in money as the inevitable order of things and working people trying to get a bigger piece of the pie as an imposition. Similarly, we just take it for granted that advances in automation will be used to throw some workers into unemployment while the ones lucky enough to keep their jobs have to work as hard as ever as they see their employers' profits skyrocket.

But that's not the only way things could work. Imagine that these companies were collectively owned by the workers themselves. In that scenario, labor-saving technology could actually be used to save labor for everyone. Workers could all work shorter hours for the same income, spread the work that still needs to be done by humans more thinly among themselves and give themselves more time to spend with their loved ones.

In the world we live in, though, ownership and labor are separated, so bosses decide how automation will be implemented. This is a problem that's going to impact every corner of the economy as technology advances, and any workers who want to avoid being left in the cold at the end of the process need to be ready to follow the dockworkers' lead and draw a line in the sand.

And people who profess to be workers' allies need to take their heads out of the sand.

Lee Fang, a heterodox left-wing journalist I'd expect to be sympathetic to organized workers, assailed the dockworkers on the grounds that Biden has been a pro-labor president and the strike had the potential to ""cause crippling inflation only 1 month out from the election."" He said this ""might take the cake"" as an extreme example of ""self defeats of organized labor.""

Dylan Matthews of Vox went so far as to call for Biden to invoke Taft-Hartley, a notorious piece of union-busting legislation passed in the 1940s, lest the dockworkers' strike ""cause inflation to come roaring back weeks before an election."" Matthews said ""you can support bargaining"" without tolerating the ""sabotage"" of the economy that would come from shutting down traffic at East Coast ports.

But what incentive are employers supposed to have to give concessions if workers can't back up their bargaining demands with a credible threat to walk off the job? That's the only way workers have ever been able to build real power.

As it happened, the bosses caved before the supply chain disruptions could cause inflation. Even if things hadn't worked out this way, though, it's disturbing that Matthews was willing to throw striking workers under the bus for the ""greater good."" If Biden had taken Matthews' advice, the ""pro-labor"" president using a union-busting law to shut down a major strike would have had demoralizing ripple effects throughout the rest of the organized working class.

Even if all you care about is Democrats winning elections, screwing over dockworkers would still have been a bad idea. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is already being supported by a higher percentage of union households than any other Republican candidate in the last 40 years. A Democratic president invoking Taft-Hartley to shut down a high-profile strike would likely only make things worse.

As Chris Isidore and Vanessa Yurkevich point out at CNN, if the union had continued to work under a contract extension, thus delaying any strike until after the presidential election, then they ""would have lost bargaining leverage"" by losing the chance to shut down the ports before the ""pre-holiday shipping season"" really got going. In telling the workers to throw away their best chance to win this massive pay raise to make sure Harris won, Fang and Matthews were essentially telling them not to take action themselves but to trust politicians to look out for their interests. But workers can't exert much influence on the political process if they don't start by building power for themselves where they work.

It's true that in many ways, Biden has been more pro-labor than recent presidents. But his record is more mixed than Fang suggests. He came into office promising to pass the PRO Act, which would make it easier for workers to organize unions, but it hasn't passed and never seemed to have been a high priority for his administration. And two years ago, in a situation much like this one, Biden invoked the Railway Labor Act to prevent a major rail strike. It's good that this time around he did the right thing -- he told reporters that he didn't ""believe in Taft-Hartley"" -- but these blotches on his record show the limits of trusting politicians to be benevolent toward workers.

While Republicans are certainly worse on labor issues, the sad fact is that the working class has relatively limited influence in both parties. There's no way to change that more basic reality without building a bigger and more militant labor movement, one that's not afraid to flex its muscles at times that might be inconvenient for others.

And if you work for a living, then that's exactly what you should want to happen."
'Panic buying begins': TikTok users show port strike fears sparked toilet paper and grocery rush,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/port-strikes-prompt-panic-buying-across-us-social-media-trends-show,2024-10-05T11:11:42Z,"Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg said Thursday that the dockworkers' strikes could have a real impact on the U.S. economy the longer they go on and said the issue needed to be resolved.

U.S. port strikes prompted panic buying of food and other goods nationwide this week, according to social media trends.

Unionized dockworkers from the International Longshoremen's Association went on strike to fight for higher pay after their contract with the U.S. Maritime Alliance expired Monday night.

The strike, which has been halted after workers reached a tentative agreement on a 62% wage increase, blocked some containers of food and other goods from entering the country, causing some Americans to take to TikTok to document their shopping experiences.

""Panic buying begins in Virginia amid the port shutdown,"" said TikTok user @nicolewilliams559 who filmed the long line at her local grocery store. ""BJ's Wholesale almost out of toilet paper and water as of 10 a.m.""

BALTIMORE RESTAURANT OWNER SAYS PORT STRIKE IS ALREADY IMPACTING BUSINESS: 'IT REALLY HURTS'

""Don't panic because the ports are closed,"" she told her followers, ""because guess what people have done here? All the toilet paper is gone and the paper towels, again. Do you know why? People are panicking. Guess what? It's made in the United States. You're going to get it. There is shipping in the United States within our country.""

Kailee, a mother on TikTok, took to the platform to share her experience of going to multiple stores to find the correct formula for her baby.

""I didn't think anything of the port strike,"" she said. ""I knew we were going to be affected, but not to this level.""

Another mother on TikTok said parents like her are crying because there is not enough formula for their children due to the stockpiling.

""Moms, I understand you are stressing out about this formula shortage, but you need to be considerate of others,"" TikTok user @dpags1234 pleaded. ""Us moms should be supporting other moms. I'm seeing moms buy 20 plus cans of formula when stores are now putting limits on formula purchases, which they should. You buying 20 plus cans is leaving us moms with nothing.""

Other users documented their trips to the grocery store to stock up in fears of potential food shortages.

Fox News Digital connected with Mahoney Asset Management President Ken Mahoney who explained the panic buying phenomenon.

""There almost seems to be a phenomenon at grocery stores that shelves stay full, even if those things are not going to be bought, so people do not panic and begin to think there is a shortage,"" he explained.

""In this case, those shelves may not actually be full because there is a shortage and that can lead people to thinking only for themselves and hoarding a ton of products (that they may not even need) just in case,"" he continued. ""Once there is an idea in people's head, there is scarcity, or there is going to be, that is when irrational behavior may start like buying all the bananas at the grocery store for example.""

While many were so worried, CEO and co-founder of Oxygen Financial Ted Jenkin told Fox News Digital that Americans didn't need to hit the panic button just yet.

""For everyday items, Americans don't need to hit the panic button day one,"" he explained, ""However, if the strike last(ed) a couple of weeks or stretch(ed) out for a period of 30 days, people could see a major spike in the prices of seafood, alcohol, and bananas. Cell phones, computers, and auto parts (would) also be at risk for supply as well.""

Jenkin explained that most holiday goods have already been shipped from overseas as some retailers ""stocked up anticipating that this strike was possible.""

""Some companies have already shifted their container shipments to West Coast ports, which shouldn't hurt the holiday supply chain, but consumers could see slightly higher prices due to the increased shipping costs,"" he said."
"Texas residents express frustration with the economy, trust Trump more than Harris",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/texas-residents-express-frustration-economy-trust-trump-more-than-harris,2024-10-05T09:05:44Z,"Residents in Houston, Texas revealed their preferred candidate to boost the economy in conversations with Fox News Digital.

Fox News Digital spoke with residents just south of Houston, Texas this week about the economy and who they trust more between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to boost the economy as president.

After shopping at Costco, local residents expressed frustration with current overall costs and the economy as a whole, both on and off camera.

""All the prices have gone up,"" Melissa told Fox News Digital.

""No, it's not doing well at all,"" said another resident, originally from Egypt.

Ralph said the economy has resulted in increased costs for his family, stating, ""I think inflation is out of control. Housing and interest rates are out of control. Grocery trips have doubled. And a good grocery trip used to be like 150-125. Now an average grocery trip is now 250-300.""

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

Locals also shared who they feel will best handle the economy as president.

""When Trump was in office, you know, things were doing well,"" said Mark.

Ralph said he ""definitely"" trusts Trump more to tackle the economy.

""I don't think Kamala even knows what's going on. I think she's a puppet,"" he said. ""He's got a proven track record, hoping he gets back in and rescuing this Harris economy.""

Another resident also said she trusts the former president more: ""Trump, because he's the only businessman that's capable of running our country.""

Mark cited Trump's time in office compared to the current Biden-Harris administration as a reason for trusting the former president.

""Trump because of what he did the last time, who was in office and what the current administration, what's happened with the current administration over the past four years,"" he said. ""If it's not broke, don't fix it. You know, they tried to fix it. So here we are today.""

No Republican presidential candidate has lost Texas since 1976, but the state has become increasingly competitive in recent elections. Trump won it by less than six points in 2020, a sharp contrast from just 12 years ago when Mitt Romney carried the state by nearly 16.

The economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in the presidential election.

A September Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

While the nation's economic recovery from the pandemic continues, inflation remains a leading concern among Americans.

The former president's up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, and favored by 7 points in an ABC News Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only 5 points in the Fox News poll, and just 2 points in the AP/NORC survey.

Harris has touted what she calls the ""opportunity economy"" and said her administration will crack down on price gouging and also lower taxes for middle-class Americans. Trump has pointed to economic performance under his administration as successful and that a return to office would bring back those days.

The Harris ticket was buoyed on Friday by a strong September jobs report. Also, striking U.S. dockworkers returned to work Friday after reaching a tentative agreement with employers on an improved wage offer."
"Three states show how abortion, schools and taxes are at stake in legislature races",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/05/nx-s1-5124638/state-legislature-supermajority-kansas-arizona-minnesota-elections,2024-10-05T09:04:20Z,"Elections for state legislatures don't get the attention that races for president or Congress do but they often have a big impact on our lives. Congress is divided and gridlocked. In contrast, nearly all state legislatures have both chambers run by one party or another. That makes it easy to pass laws.

And they've been passing a lot. More than 20 states have imposed new limits on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the federal right to abortion in 2022. In education, state lawmakers create voucher programs and determine public school funding. Gun laws, taxes, criminal sentences, access to Medicaid and food stamps are just a few other issues decided by state legislatures.

Redistricting and polarization have increased the political tilt of many legislatures -- even where the state might be more balanced overall.

This year, several legislatures could see power shift if just a few seats flip in the election -- maybe just a matter of hundreds of votes in some districts. Here are three states, Kansas, Minnesota and Arizona, that illustrate the stakes around the country.

TOPEKA, Kansas -- Kansas is one of several states where the Legislature sometimes tilts more conservative than the state's voters overall. While it votes Republican for president, it has elected a Democrat for governor twice in a row and voted with 59% to protect abortion rights.

But Republicans hold 29 of the 40 seats in the Senate and 85 of the 125 seats in the House. That gives them the two-thirds ""supermajority"" to pass bills and override vetoes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.

They've overridden Kelly's vetoes 15 times in the last two years. They used the override to pass a bill requiring doctors to question patients seeking abortions about their reasons. They overrode vetoes to pass laws banning transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports and to limit access to food stamps.

Democrats say they can break the supermajority in this year's elections -- they'd only need to flip two or three seats in either chamber. It would give Kelly a stronger veto in her last two years in office -- and Democrats more leverage over what the majority passes.

""My hope is that with the governor being able to veto and being able to sustain those vetoes, it puts us more at the table for compromise,"" says Democrat Dinah Sykes, the Senate minority leader.

National Democratic party organizations say that goal is within reach. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is highlighting 10 legislative races in Kansas and helping with campaign logistics.

Kansas Republicans, meanwhile, have scorned that contribution as outside interference. And they defend the supermajority.

Republican House Majority Leader Chris Croft says it's a necessary counterbalance to the governor's veto pen.

""[The] supermajority in this case, while it sounds like it's this huge number, in fact, what it does is just gives us a seat at the table,"" Croft told NPR.

Even with their heavy majority, Republican's priorities aren't always veto-proof. Last session, Kelly successfully vetoed three major tax-cut proposals, including one that fell a single vote shy of an override. The fight forced the Legislature into a special session.

""You can't get everything you want in this business. This business has a little bit of give and take and that's the beauty of the process,"" Croft says. ""It's also the frustrating part.""

Supermajorities, like the one held by Kansas Republicans, have become common. Across the country as of their recent legislative sessions, one party or another held a veto-proof majority in 29 states. Republicans had 20 of those, Democrats nine.

Patrick Miller, a political scientist at Kent State University, says supermajorities have spread in part because of polarization and legislators gerrymandering their own districts.

""One of those consequences of supermajority, is a lot more ideological politics and policy,"" he says.

While the U.S. Congress is often locked in stalemate, Miller says state legislatures that are dominated by one party are able to step into the vacuum to pass laws shaping day-to-day life.

""If you care about education, if you care about health care regulation in your state, if you care about abortion, transgender rights, LGBT rights, if you care about whether your roads have potholes ... you need to be looking at your state legislature,"" he says.

TONKA BAY, Minn. -- On a sunny Tuesday morning, Republican state Senate candidate Kathleen Fowke walks door-to-door near Lake Minnetonka just west of Minneapolis. The tree-lined roads by the water are quiet but when she knocks on a door she's reminded that this is hotly contested territory.

""You're in my YouTube all the time,"" says the man inside -- a reminder of the ads targeting voters here.

The contest to win this legislative district could be the state's most expensive ever -- and key to winning the Senate.

For two years, Democrats have controlled the Legislature and the governor's office under Gov. Tim Walz -- now the Democratic nominee for vice president. They've passed more spending for affordable housing and public schools, and guaranteed protections for patients who seek or provide abortion or gender-affirming care.

Now Republicans see a chance to curb the progressive trend. They're just a few seats behind in the state House. The Senate is tied 33-33 and this vacant seat by the lake could be the tiebreaker that ends the Democrats' so-called ""trifecta"" of House, Senate and governorship.

The GOP wants to slow state spending and focus on the economy overall. Fowke, a real estate agent, says that, while voters don't always know about the work the Legislature does, what she does hear about from them is money.

""It's basically affordability, and they can't afford, you know, just to go to the grocery store anymore,"" Fowke says. ""Taxes are high. Inflation is high. They need to find a way to help lower the costs of everything all around them.""

Republicans promise to cut taxes, tighten up on spending and curb fraud and abuse in state programs. ""With one-party, Democrat control, it was easy just to push through partisan policy and partisan priorities,"" House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth says.

Democrats say they address people's cost of living with laws requiring companies to offer paid time off for illness, family leave and safe time and new money for free school lunches.

""They trust the Democrats are going to do more for their economic well being, whereas what they hear from Republicans is, 'Oh, we have to give more tax cuts to corporations,'"" says Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman. The national Democratic Party is helping fund the state party's effort.

Their candidate facing Fowke is civil engineer Ann Johnson Stewart. She's knocking on doors, too, telling people she stands for maintaining legal protections for abortion in the state. ""One of the reasons I'm running is to make sure we can continue on that track,"" she says.

She hopes Democrats will work now on carbon-free energy sources, local infrastructure, expanding mental health care and reducing gun violence.

Andrew Karch, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota, says candidates face an uphill battle getting voters to pay attention to state issues.

""There's a real tendency for these races to sort of fly beneath the radar,"" Karch says. And many voters don't focus on state issues.

""I think politics in Minnesota specifically may have been more distinctive a generation ago than they are today,"" he says. ""State and local politicians are increasingly being asked to comment on issues that we might think of as national.""

Fowke and Johnson Stewart say they hope to keep the conversations focused on what's going on in their district. But they know that's a big ask in a presidential election year.

PHOENIX -- In Arizona, the party that wins the Legislature could determine where tens of thousands of children go to school or how well their schools are funded. At issue is the state's sweeping vouchers program that gives families tax dollars for use in private schools or for homeschooling.

For Chelsea Ellison, a homeschool parent, the program has helped turn things around for a daughter who struggled in public elementary school.

""It took us a little bit of last year to get her where she should have been, in general, and now she's thriving,"" Ellison says. ""She loves school.""

But parents and teachers sticking with public schools say they've paid the price.

""I notice that the amount of resources available to the teachers, directly, it just is not there, any kind of funding for improvements at the school is not there,"" says Miriam Hoban, whose child attends a public school in Scottsdale. She says teachers or parents are forced to pay out of pocket for basic necessities like pencils and markers.

Arizona's program, called Empowerment Scholarship Accounts, is a national model for what advocates call school choice. In 2022, the Republican Legislature and then-Gov. Doug Ducey took a small program offering vouchers for kids with disabilities or in underperforming schools and made it available for any child.

Enrollment in the program leaped from 12,000 students to 78,000 students and growing. Students got a median of $7,409 per year. That added up to a total of about $718 million from the state budget, which was $93 million more than projected, according to the Arizona Department of Education.

Republicans control the Legislature with just a two-seat advantage in both the House and Senate. The narrow margin was in the national spotlight this year as lawmakers just barely repealed an 1864 law that banned abortion.

If Democrats win control, they pledge to scale back the voucher program and they can rely on backing from Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, elected after the program was expanded. ""The previous Legislature passed a massive expansion of school vouchers that lacks accountability and will likely bankrupt this state,"" she said after taking office last year.

Critics point to stories about voucher money going for private lessons in luxury cars and ski resort passes, supposedly part of a child's education. And they say much of the money goes to families that were able to pay for private schools on their own with kids already out of the public schools.

But as the program has grown and gained support among some swing voters, it could be tougher for Democrats in competitive districts to campaign against it. They'll have to temper their ambitions, says Arizona pollster Paul Bentz.

""I don't expect that they could mount a full-fledged repeal,"" Bentz says. ""I think that would be challenging for some of the swing areas for Democrats. But I certainly think at a minimum, there would be regulation on it, and probably some definite changes to the program.""

Ellison, the voucher mom, says her family did try to make it work in public schools before opting to teach at home with voucher support.

""There was larger class sizes, more budget cuts,"" Ellison says of their old public school. ""We had no STEM teacher, we had no music teacher, we had no art teacher.""

Public school supporters say the vouchers drain the money for just those kinds of needs."
A coal power plant demolition serves as a poignant historical moment for the Navajo,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/05/nx-s1-5076973/coal-power-plant-demolition-navajo-new-mexico,2024-10-05T09:04:15Z,"In a small plane flying west out of Farmington, N.M., America's energy transition appeared to be proceeding in an orderly fashion -- a sea change measurable in megawatts, acreage and emission particle parts per million.

Mike Eisenfeld of San Juan Citizens Alliance was our tour guide, his voice crackling over the intercom.

""We're heading toward the San Juan Solar Project,"" he said. ""It's the biggest project going right now, economically.""

Rows and rows of black rectangles planted in bone-dry earth stretched out below us.

Then the plane headed south, where two enormous coal-fired power plants crouched on the landscape.

""At one point San Juan Generating Station and the Four Corners Power Plant, according to Los Alamos National Lab, were the largest source of point-source pollution in the United States,"" Eisenfeld said.

But on this day, the San Juan Generating Station sat dark and inert -- it shut down two years ago. As we flew over the Four Corners Power Plant, puffs of white smoke told us it was still producing energy.

""This is the last coal plant up here,"" Eisenfeld said of Four Corners. ""All the others have been retired. Gone.""

When Eisenfeld first moved to the area nearly 20 years ago, coal mining and coal power were on the rise in northwest New Mexico. Today, several large-scale solar projects are in the works.

He'd scheduled these tours with EcoFlight on Aug. 24 to showcase these big changes but also to witness the demolition of the San Juan Generating Station. That was the day its long, slender smokestacks collapsed into dust.

From the air, the coal and solar power facilities look like pieces like a gameboard. On the ground, the emotional weight of the energy transition is heavy and the complexities are palpable. Public Service Company of New Mexico, signaled years ago that it would decommission San Juan Generating Station; the plant burned its last load of coal in 2022. But the smokestacks are visible from hundreds of miles away. They have been a monumental presence on this landscape since the 1970s, and they've become powerful symbols to the people who live in the region -- especially Navajo people.

The Aug. 24 demolition was a poignant moment in the Navajo Nation's long and complex history with energy development. Over seven decades, coal and the energy made from it have become entwined with the Navajo's cultural beliefs, community life and the Navajo Nation economy.

On the morning of the demolition, employees of Public Utility of New Mexico transported visitors in a passenger van to a dirt lot on site. We drove past the massive concrete block of a building, weaving between heaps of scrap metal slated to be recycled.

There was a whiff of post-apocalypse in the air.

Dozens of contract laborers arrived in trucks and cars to watch the industrial carnage. Elsewhere on site, where former plant employees and local elected officials were gathered, the mood was somber. Still more spectators -- those without an invitation -- parked on the road outside the gates.

For the demolition team, a California contracting company called Integrated Demolition and Remediation, which has demolished dozens of smokestacks at coal power plants all over the U.S., this was business as usual.

""I'm going to do a loud '10, 9, 8, 7, 6,' "" said Rodrigo Roman, an explosives expert with the demolition team. ""Then I'll do a silent, '5, 4, 3, 2, 1.' He's gonna yell, 'Fire in the hole.' You're gonna hear a click. And then it's game on.""

Another member of the crew instructed me to lean back against one of the trucks.

""You're going to feel a shock wave,"" he said. ""It'll push you back a bit.""

Everyone gazed up at the 400 concrete cylinders, bathed in yellow morning sunlight for the last time.

But for at least one Navajo woman, the moment was too heavy to bear.

""I didn't attend the demolition because I'd probably cry,"" Christina Aspaas told me when I met with her in the nearby town of Kirtland, N.M. ""Knowing all that I know of how many jobs lost, the impacts that I'm seeing as a school board member to our district. Going to this demolition? I don't think that would have been good for my whole being.""

Aspaas' family history is embedded in the coal economy here. Her earliest memories of San Juan Generating Station date back to when she was a child.

""It was just some place we dropped my dad off at work,"" she said. ""He was a welder, but he helped build that power plant.""

Grandfathers, uncles and aunts worked at power plants and coal mines across the region, and eventually, Aspaas joined them as a utility worker in one of the mines.

""I worked two jobs before,"" she said. ""Both those checks put together, did not even come near the first check I got as a utility worker. And when they told me how much I was making, I thought I was rich.""

Decades later, she's a journeyman electrician at Navajo Mine and a union member. Her income supports dozens of family members.

""It provided for me and my daughter,"" she said. ""And I'm connected to four different clans and my wealth is not accumulated to myself. When I hear of ceremony or other things going, I help with food, groceries, cash.""

In the span of a decade, thousands of middle-class Navajo people have lost jobs connected to the coal economy; many have moved out of state. When utilities decommissioned the Navajo Generating Station near Page, Ariz., in 2019, the Navajo Nation lost more than $40 million in revenue. New Mexico labor data shows that displaced energy workers are making nearly $30,000 less a year on average since the San Juan power plant closed in 2022.

As a school board member, Aspaas is concerned that in five years, student enrollment has dropped 25% and student homelessness has tripled.

""What industry do we bring in here immediately to make up the tax revenue that's lost?"" she asked.

On the morning of the demolition, Elouise Brown drove more than an hour to park her car outside the gates of the San Juan Generating Station.

""I wanted to witness this with my own eyes,"" she said. ""We've been working on this for a long, long time, and I was very, very excited to see this.

Brown also has memories of the plant from childhood, driving in the car with her grandparents.

""It looked like a huge stove,"" she recalled. ""When my grandma said they burn coal, I was thinking, 'Jeez, how much coal would you burn to make all that smoke come out of those smokestacks?' ""

As an adult, she became concerned about the haze of air pollution all over the reservation.

""It didn't look safe!"" she said. ""How could you have a healthy life if you have a lot of smoke?""

Brown became an anti-coal activist in December 2006, after she learned that former Navajo Nation President Joe Shirley was backing a new coal-fired power plant in the region. The so-called Desert Rock project would have put a third coal plant within a few miles of the other two.

Brown sleuthed around online and discovered that construction was already underway. She drove to the site and started ripping out survey flags. When a semitruck hauling construction materials arrived, she maneuvered her car to block the driver.

""I went off the road, and I went right in front of him,"" she said. ""He had to stop, he had no choice.""

It was the beginning of her journey as an activist.

""He was a huge guy,"" Brown said of the driver. ""He was looking at me and just yelling at me. And I said, 'I don't care what the Navajo Nation president told you. He has no right to do what he did without informing us. So you're not coming through.' ""

Later, Brown blockaded the road with other activists. She picketed in the New Mexico Capitol building in Santa Fe for 60 days straight, and she fought the project until it fizzled in 2009.

""In our Navajo way of life, you don't mess with Mother Earth. You don't mess with the resources inside,"" she said.

For more than 75 years, Navajo people, who call themselves Diné, have forged a complex relationship with coal. Since the 1960s, utilities have burned coal on or near Navajo land, sending electricity to Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, San Diego and Albuquerque.

For some Navajo people, this story is simply a modern kind of colonialism, according to Diné sociologist and historian Andrew Curley.

""How these non-Native communities, especially white communities prey upon Diné people and resources, replicating a pattern of colonial marginalization and dispossession that goes back more than a hundred years,"" Curley said.

Curley's book Carbon Sovereignty explores the Navajo relationship with coal. Many Diné workers he interviewed said their labor in the coal industry was intrinsically and even culturally meaningful.

""[Coal work] became a form of empowerment,"" he said. ""It was a form of identity-building between workers at a site.""

In the 1970s, with the rise of the Red Power movement, Navajo workers and elected officials began to leverage their sovereignty.

""Our tribal leaders started to negotiate royalty rates with extractive companies operating in Indian Country to give more money back to the tribe and give more rights to Diné laborers,"" Curley said.

As coal declines and new resources power the grid, those replacement industries are not supporting Navajo workers the way coal did.

""Oil, gas, solar, wind -- we're not seeing the same type of benefit to workers within any other kind of energy,"" Curley said. ""And they're not getting that social mobility through coal work that we in the social sciences were able to demonstrate existed.""

On the morning of Aug. 24, as the clock ran down, the demolition team shouted out a five-minute warning, then a one-minute warning, followed by the shrill sound of a siren.

For activist Elouise Brown, the demolition was a long time coming.

""I felt chills come down my whole body,"" she said. ""I was telling my family, what a great way to start your morning. What a blessing.""

Coal mine electrician Christina Aspaas watched a video of the implosion later that day on social media.

""It just brought back memories,"" she said, as she wiped away tears. ""My childhood, my dad, my mom.""

Aspaas posted a few words online to honor the generations of Navajo workers who have labored in coal.

""We took them for granted,"" she said. ""I just wanted them to know that I remember you.""

The detonation and shock wave pushed spectators backward, and then, in slow motion, the columns seemed to fall, concrete dissolving into air.

It takes less than a minute to demolish smokestacks.

It will take years, maybe decades, for Navajo communities to come to terms with what they've gained and what's been lost."
Sweden's Environmental Minister Reiterates No Bail Out For Northvolt,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/heatherfarmbrough/2024/10/05/swedens-environmental-minister-reiterates-no-bail-out-for-northvolt/,2024-10-05T08:34:48Z,"Two years ago, the 25-year-old Liberal Romina Pourmokhtari became Sweden's youngest ever minister to take office, taking on the joint responsibilities for Climate and Enterprise.

Early this year, Pourmokhtari and the government's climate policy survived a vote of no confidence, with critics arguing it had failed to include concrete measures to deal with climate change and gone back on many of its earlier climate pledges. Sweden is on track to miss its 2030 targets as a consequence of its decision to cut tax on petrol and diesel and sharply reduce the amount of biofuel that needs to be blended with these fuels.

""Northvolt is an example of how much the economic aspects of production also have to be taken into consideration [as well],"" says Pourmokhtari. At a conference organised by the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in the UK, she ruled out providing finance to Northvolt, the ailing Swedish battery maker. The company's aim is to be the major European battery maker, large enough to be able to compete with CATL, BYD and Tesla. The minister argues adequate private capital available and well equipped; public capital is not.

""I see myself as an important partner to clean tech in Sweden, bringing forward solutions... and enabling Sweden to gain from its expertise and global exports of clean goods and services, providing and lowering emissions all over the world,"" she says in an interview with me after the event.

""I've actually just recently put out an inquiry for our authorities to count the possibilities of how much of a carbon sink Sweden can create by .. [the] export of goods and services lower carbon emissions in other places than our country."" This can get her into trouble.

""I often get criticism [with people asking] why are you doing that? That's just lowering emissions somewhere else.""

Her response is that official politics don't have a cross-boundary perspective necessary [to deal with] the climate crisis. ""Emissions don't stop at the country's borders. They travel freely across our oceans and through our forests and through the products we are importing and exporting. And that perspective is often a bit lacking amongst governments. I try to incorporate it as well as I can, to the extent that I can.""

Sweden's economy still depends to quite a large extent on major industrial companies whose carbon emissions have - for instance, SSAB, Atlas Copco, Scania, Sandvik, SKF, Volvo. Despite unparalleled investments in green steel production, some 12 per cent of Sweden's emissions are still generated by steel manufacturing. While there is a misconception, the minister believes, that the more conservative, traditional industries might be less prone to engage themselves in the risk-taking that comes with climate transition, in fact the opposite is true.

What she can do as a government minister is ensure policies create the conditions for a reliable energy system, a key component of clean steel production. ""If I can provide conditions for them to decrease their emissions by 98%, which is the goal they have set, then I can make a real difference,"" Pourmokhtari says.

""Not standing in their way with the process of applying for permits taking up to seven years, not letting bureaucracy from a completely different time stand in the way of the progress that needs to be made. There is an urgency now, a competitiveness between companies and countries. So we're making very big shifts to how we handle permits, carry out risk analysis and assess the reliability of the infrastructure, and investing in skills and training in universities, in aspects such as battery technology.""

In November 2023 the Swedish government effectively changed policy towards building nuclear reactors and announced it would construct two large-scale reactors by 2035 and the equivalent of 10 new reactors, including small modular reactors, by 2045.

If Northvolt fails, it will be a major economic and political blow to Sweden but the country is on track, Pourmokhtari says, for its 2050 emissions targets. ""We've done this before, in the 1970s when 70% of our electricity system was dependant on imports of oil. We have two decades this time as well."""
76 days: Kamala Harris has yet to do formal press conference since emerging as Democratic nominee,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/76-days-kamala-harris-has-yet-do-formal-press-conference-since-emerging-democratic-nominee,2024-10-05T04:16:53Z,"'The Five' co-hosts discuss Vice President Kamala Harris' media strategy heading into November.

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 76 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Trump has held six news conferences where he took questions from the media since the beginning of August, including another on Friday after meeting with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp about hurricane relief efforts.

President Biden also held a news conference in the White House press briefing room on Friday, where he joked about getting back into the 2024 race.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey last month at a star-studded campaign event. This week she taped an interview on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

The S&P 500 Carry Trade,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevincoldiron/2024/10/04/the-sp-500-carry-trade/,2024-10-05T01:19:00Z,"Tim Lee, Jamie Lee and I published The Rise of Carry in late 2019. We described how and why carry trades have grown to dominate financial markets. The result is that markets, and by extension the global economy, now follow the typical carry trade pattern of small, steady growth punctuated by occasional sudden selloffs.

Now that we have a bit of distance from the August implosion of the yen carry trade it's worth thinking through what REALLY causes these selloffs. Because we will see them again.

It's gratifying to see our ideas become more widely accepted. However, it's still a smidge frustrating that the carry trade we identified as the most important - the S&P 500 - is still not really recognized as such.

In many way that's understandable. Thinking of the ""stock market"" as a carry trade isn't intuitive. We're working on a second book where we'll explain this idea in even more detail. But since the whole world seems to be talking carry trades, I thought I'd use some material from our drafts to discuss it now (and whet your appetite for the next book...)

Below is one of the key passages in the Rise of Carry. The paragraph explains in geeky terms why the S&P 500 is the central global carry trade. I'll try to de-geek it in next 800 words.

The first line - ""S&P 500 volatility has become global volatility"" is straightforward.

The S&P 500 is the most visible and heavily traded risk asset in the world. It's the risk asset at the center of a staggeringly large ecosystem of products that investors around the globe use for speculation and hedging.

Below is a graph I've been working on for the new book. WARNING: it's incomplete1 and I haven't double-checked all the numbers. Still, it presents a fascinating picture of the annual trading volume associated with the key products linked to the S&P 500. And, yes, all the numbers are in trillions of dollars.

No other equity market comes close to this hyper-liquid ecosystem and this makes the S&P 500 the global epicenter for risk taking and risk hedging. S&P 500 volatility is therefore a proxy for volatility of risk assets everywhere.

Now for the geekier bits.

How does this turn S&P 500 volatility into ""generic liquidity risk""? And why would this ""define the value of money""?

Being ""liquid"" means having access to cash. For levered traders that means being able to quickly and cheaply sell what they own in exchange for cash. In The Rise of Carry we document how the world has grown ever more levered over time. Each year more actors need more liquidity. The S&P 500 ecosystem has grown in a symbiotic fashion to provide it.

The table below is a very simple stylized example of a levered trader's need for liquidity. The trader starts Day 1 with $100 and borrows an additional $100 to buy the S&P 500. The first row is the trader's balance sheet after setting up this levered position. If the S&P 500 falls by 10% on Day 2, leverage goes up to 225%. To return it to 200% the trader needs to sell $20 worth of the market and use the cash - the liquidity they've accessed - to pay down their debt. Once they've done this they're back their starting leverage.

Even though it's very simple, the example highlights three important points.

First, reducing leverage back to target involves trading with the market - selling after it falls.

Second, this trading is not optional. Ok, for small market moves it is - lenders allow leverage to fluctuate around agreed levels. But for big moves the trader must sell to reduce leverage or the person that lent them the money will do it for them.

Third, to supply the liquidity the levered trader needs, some brave soul (or brave algorithm) must take the other side.

I say ""brave"" because the liquidity supplier buys as the market falls. This exposes them to crashes. For example, imagine you supply liquidity by purchasing the S&P 500 when it's down 3% on Friday. If it falls another 3% on Monday you're nursing losses and far less willing to supply yet more liquidity.

It's easy to see how the non-linear, sharp falls we experienced in the last few days emerge. A big enough jump in volatility causes liquidity supply to fall just as liquidity demand rises. That's what we mean by volatility ""defining the value of money"". When volatility spikes, the value of having cash goes up. And the volatility that matters is S&P 500 volatility because that is a proxy for generic risk asset volatility.

Why should providing this type of liquidity be the ""best paying risk in the world""? Because you can't diversify it away. When S&P 500 volatility spikes there is literally nowhere to hide. Suppliers of liquidity in the S&P 500 ecosystem are taking on the risk of a global crash. That's why their risk should very well compensated.

The S&P 500 ecosystem didn't always work this way. At the start of the carry regime it was more like the stock market we read about in textbooks, where things like earnings and interest rates are the main drivers. Below is my graph of the ecosystem from 1995. Index options did exist but volumes were tiny, so I left them out.

Calling this an ""ecosystem"" is a stretch. Still, the futures were liquid enough to give the S&P 500 an advantage over other markets in terms of being the preferred location for speculating and hedging. From there growth in the market value of the index, the assets controlled by levered traders and the range of related derivative products reinforced each other. Gradually and steadily the S&P 500 ecosystem became the central risk marketplace it is today.

When volatility rises a reflexive feedback loop develops within this ecosystem. Liquidity providers pull back and that forces liquidity demanders - the levered traders - to sell at lower prices. That in turn pushes prices lower and causes a further diminution in liquidity supply.

Most of the time this doesn't happen. In fact most of the time there are plenty of liquidity suppliers and their activity helps the market self-stabilize. But when some force, random or fundamental, triggers a big enough jump in volatility, the feedback loop switches to being self-reinforcing and we get a sudden crash.

This is how carry trades work. They make money ""when nothing happens"", when volatility is stable or falling. But when something does happen and volatility spikes we get a sudden and very sharp drawdown. That's exactly the pattern of returns the S&P 500 has adopted as the carry regime has progressed over the last thirty years. And that's why we say the ""absorption of generic liquidity risk must convert the S&P 500 into a giant carry trade"".

This isn't your grandfather's S&P 500. It's the most important carry trade in a world awash with them."

Stephanie Ruhle: By all measures we have a strong economy. So why don't Americans feel that way?,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/job-report-inflation-economy-biden-rcna174092,2024-10-04T20:53:06Z,"The Biden administration woke up to some good news on Friday. The U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs in September, blowing past the 150,000 expected. Not only did September's numbers beat economists' expectations, but data from previous months were also revised upward and the unemployment rate fell from 4.2% in August to 4.1%.

This is good news. By almost all measures, we've got a strong economy, except for one thing that matters an awful lot: how Americans feel about it. It's a reason why Donald Trump continues to poll better among likely voters on handling the economy.

That feeling is largely frustration that prices are still too high. I'm not talking about the pace of inflation -- just the fact that everything seems to cost more.

Now, the administration and the Harris campaign point to all the recent positive economic news, but they don't always connect the dots to one reason behind those prices: the rise in wages.

Yes, price increases can be due to ""greedflation."" Corporations have held wages low for years while raising prices and pocketing big profits. Many businesses could increase wages and benefits without higher prices. That's why many politicians, including Vice President Kamala Harris, want to investigate and go after those engaging in price gouging.

However, a lot of workers -- especially lower-wage earners -- have gotten a raise in recent years. And when wages go up, prices likely do as well. We want lower-wage earners to be able to support their families, but if you're paying people who work at fast-food joints or pizzerias $20 an hour, then you're not likely going to get $1 menu items anymore, and you're not going to get a pizza that costs less than $20.

Here's an example: My son works at a deli and takes home $20 an hour for making sandwiches. When my mother rolls in to pick him up from work, she can't understand why the sandwiches are $22.

But it's not just about ""greedflation"" and price gouging. Employers are paying people more and it's going to impact all kinds of companies. And if employers pay their workers more, especially small business owners, it has to come from somewhere, and often that means raising prices for consumers.

Let's not forget, this increase in wages is also good news. Wage growth has been rising fastest for the lowest-wage workers. That's a good thing, even if it means we might have to pay a little more for fast food, pizza and sandwiches."
Politicians are trying to tie immigration to our housing crisis. They're lying.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/housing-prices-forced-deportation-immigration-rcna174048,2024-10-04T20:08:28Z,"By Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council

There's no doubt that we need to change our broken immigration system. And there's no doubt that we need more housing. But while some politicians are trying to tie immigration to our housing crisis to justify extreme policies like mass deportation, the available evidence tells a much different story.

Some politicians try to make the United States' housing shortage -- estimates of the deficit run anywhere from 4 million to 7 million homes -- a simple equation of supply and demand. Add more people, and housing prices go up; deport more people, and housing prices go down. The reality is far more complicated. Undocumented immigrants don't just use housing. They also build housing, maintain housing and put money into the pockets of Americans who buy or rent housing.

A new report from the American Immigration Council, where I am a senior fellow, finds that mass deportations would lead to a widespread economic downturn. The impact would be concentrated in industries that rely on undocumented workers, the most prominent of which is construction, the industry necessary to address the country's housing shortage.

Our analysis finds that 1 in 7 people employed in the construction industry as of 2022 were undocumented, accounting for more than 1.5 million workers. Within many of the trades relevant to housing construction and maintenance, the proportion is higher. We estimate that more than 1 in 3 roofers, ceiling tilers, stucco masons, plasterers and drywall installers are undocumented. These workers not only build many of the roughly 1.79 million new units that go onto the market each year, they also maintain and repair existing housing stock. If you think getting a contractor is hard now, wait until the workforce has been cut by a third.

Some might argue that deported construction workers would be replaced by U.S. workers. However, the data suggests that is not true. As of 2024, the construction industry has an extreme labor shortage, even though wages are 80% higher than the average nonfarm job. With persistent hiring problems across the industry, the likeliest outcome of deporting 1.5 million construction workers wouldn't be 1.5 million Americans choosing to fill those jobs; it would be the closure of firms and fewer construction jobs, period.

But even if firms could eventually find new workers, there would be years of turmoil in the interim. In the last year, 1.48 million new residential building permits were issued. How many of those projects would even begin if a third of workers were deported? It could take years before the industry recovered and housing construction got back on track. Americans would suffer in the meantime.

More broadly, there is little evidence that Americans are dealing with high housing prices because of undocumented immigrants -- who are much less likely to be homeowners than the population at large. We estimate that in 2022, the homeownership rate for undocumented immigrant households was 39%, compared to 65.3% for the entire country.

Most undocumented immigrants are renters, and there too, the evidence does not show migrant arrivals have driven up rent prices. According to Apartment List, median rent began spiking in January 2021, peaked in August 2022, and began slowly falling after that. That trend does not align with migration. Our analysis of Department of Homeland Security data shows roughly 1.5 million migrants entered the country during the period when rents were spiking. But from August 2022 through May 2024, an additional 3.6 million migrants entered the country. In short, migration rose dramatically even as rent prices plateaued and fell. This strongly suggests that migration across the border is not directly correlated to rent prices.

Immigration is not a zero-sum game. One migrant entering the country and working does not mean one American will lose a job. In fact, the opposite is true. Immigrants are job creators in multiple ways. We estimate that undocumented immigrants hold $256 billion in spending power, much of which is distributed back into the community, growing the economy and stimulating consumer demand.

As demand rises, the need for labor goes up, more jobs are created, and native workers fill those jobs. When the economy contracts, demand goes down, fewer jobs are needed, and native workers lose their jobs. One recent study found that for every 500,000 people deported, 44,000 American citizens lose work. We estimate that mass deportations would cause the U.S. gross domestic product to fall anywhere from 4.2% to 6.8%. By comparison, the GDP dropped 4.3% during the Great Recession, which at its peak saw 15 million Americans out of work.

The answer to the country's housing shortage is obvious: build more housing to make up for years of stagnant growth following the 2008 housing crash. Mass deportations are not a realistic economic strategy. They would leave us all worse off, facing a collapsing construction industry, rising food prices and destabilizing labor shortages across the supply chain.

Rather than destabilize the economy for the sake of harsh enforcement, we should increase resources to the government agencies that manage the enforcement and adjudication system to ensure that people have their cases heard in a reasonable period of time, while pursuing a path to permanent status for the long-term residents whose hard work makes us better off in the long run. When millions of people leave, they take their skills, money and hard work with them, and American workers, renters and homeowners suffer."
Has The Fed Cut Rates Too Much And Too Soon?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2024/10/04/has-the-fed-cut-rates-too-much-and-too-soon/,2024-10-04T19:53:12Z,"Winter it seems, across much of Europe, has come early. Two instincts that grow as the evenings darken are the inclination to have a tipple in the evening and to watch a good film. One Danish work that captures both sentiments is 'Druk' or 'Another Round', which won the Oscar for best international film in 2021. I recommend it.

In the film a group of four school teacher friends decide to test the hypothesis of a Norwegian psychologist that humans have a deficiency of alcohol in their blood, and the protagonists undertake an experiment to maintain a 'warm' level of alcohol in their blood. It is an experiment I attempt often, but the real lesson today is with central banking.

It seems that central bankers have decided that in the spirit of 'Druk', the liquidity in the world financial system is not sufficient and have set out to administer near daily injections of cheap money. The number of central banks changing policy (i.e. to negative) is the greatest it has been, apart from the global financial crisis and the COVID period. In September alone there have been 24 rate cuts from central banks around the world.

Chief amongst these has been the 50-basis point cut from the Federal Reserve and the very dramatic, multiple policy moves by China. In short China has cut rates, infused the banking system, made mortgages cheaper and generally tried to spread liquidity over the emerging cracks in China's economy. In the spirit of 'Druk' it is the equivalent of going on a five day bender in order to cure a serious disease.

Nonetheless, the easing in policy from the Fed and China, together with what will likely be a couple of more rate cuts this year from the European Central Bank mean that the world financial system is flush with liquidity. Chinese markets - hitherto the worst performing markets of a major economy - show the impact and importance of liquidity. The market cap of the Hang Seng index has grown by a quarter in less than two weeks. China has overtaken the US in terms of equity market performance to date.

There is no change to fundamentals - I don't see this policy move having a decisive impact on the downward trend in Chinese earnings, but that doesn't matter in the near term - liquidity is coursing through the pipes of the Chinese financial system, and in turn might bring a temporary easing to conditions in the property market.

For all the analysts who devote time to measuring earnings and calibrating valuations, the reality is that in this era of 'quick to please' monetary policy, liquidity matters a lot for asset prices. My rule of thumb in constructing a measure of liquidity would encompass money supply, the state of central bank balance sheets, the key role of the dollar and net issuance of debt by treasuries.

The arcane notion of financial liquidity has attracted enough attention that the Financial Times recently ran an article breaking down its component parts. A couple of top-flight economics consultancies run their own measures of liquidity - such as LongView Economics and Michael Howell at CrossBorder Capital. The latter holds that we are on the cusp of a significant upswing in global liquidity.

If that is true, the implication for markets is 'Druk'- a persistent giddyiness whilst central banks keep rates low and liquidity flush, amidst an acceptable level of GDP and profit growth. Friday's job market figures in the US were very strong, suggesting that in fact there was no need for a large rate cut. This is the kind of macro climate we have seen in the mid and late 1990's, and one that tends to dampen the market implications of turbulent geopolitics.

From the point of view of asset prices, there are a couple of possible trajectories. Historically, the Fed has started to cut interest rates when the price to earnings ratio on the S&P 500 has been close to 10 times (1960's to 1990's). Now, like in 2000, it is in the mid 20's which suggests that extra liquidity now could run asset prices in bubble territory proper, and cultivate the next bout of inflation, something the central banks' bank, the BIS, has warned about (helpfully the BIS has taken a counter view to that of its members ahead of a number of crisis).

For the time being, the upturn in liquidity may be most meaningful for capital markets activity and assets in the private economy. They have been in the doldrums. If the 'Druk' hypothesis is working we should see a rise in IPO activity into 2025, and intensification in private equity deals and a rise in funding activity (beyond AI firms) in venture."
Broke And Unemployed? Here Are 5 Steps To Financial Recovery,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/truetamplin/2024/10/04/what-if-youre-broke-and-unemployed-5-steps-to-financial-recovery/,2024-10-04T18:13:03Z,"Being broke and unemployed is undoubtedly one of the most stressful financial situations one can face, with the pressure to make ends meet -- buying food, paying rent, or keeping the lights on -- seemingly impossible. Nonetheless, there are steps you can take to regain control. This article offers practical strategies to help reduce expenses, access assistance, and quickly generate income. By taking swift action, you can ease financial pressure and work toward long-term stability. Even in difficult times, small, focused efforts can make a significant difference in securing your financial future.

Before making decisions about managing your finances, you must first fully understand where you stand. Knowing the extent of your resources and liabilities will provide a clearer picture of what needs to be done.

Gather a complete list of all available resources, such as any cash you have on hand, money in checking and savings accounts, or funds held in PayPal or other payment services. You should also consider any assets that you could potentially liquidate, such as unused electronics, jewelry, or other valuables.

This step serves as your financial baseline, a way to determine how much you have to work with. While the number may seem small, it's crucial to have clarity on the exact amount of money you can draw from in the short term.

The next step is to examine where your money is going. Categorize your expenses into essential and non-essential groups. Essentials are things like rent, utilities, food, and transportation. Non-essentials may include streaming services, dining out, entertainment, or other discretionary purchases.

A detailed breakdown of your spending will enable you to construct a minimal budget centered around survival. This is the initial stage of identifying areas where you can cut back.

Based on your expenses, you'll need to estimate how much money is required to cover your essential costs over the next one to three months. This timeframe provides a short-term view, allowing you to focus on immediate survival while planning for longer-term recovery.

Write down exactly how much you need for basic living expenses and subtract this from your current assets to understand any pressing shortfall.

This is one of the most critical steps in managing a financial crisis. In some cases, it might mean making difficult decisions about what to cut, but reducing expenses as quickly as possible is necessary to stretch your available resources.

Cancel or pause your streaming services, gym memberships, or other subscriptions. Even though these services may provide comfort or routine, they are not important for survival.

You should also refrain from dining out, going to the movies, or shopping. By cutting out all non-essential expenditures, you can redirect the money saved toward critical living costs.

Many service providers, from utilities to ISPs, are willing to offer flexible payment plans or temporary reductions for individuals facing financial hardship. Contact these companies directly and explain your situation.

Landlords may also be willing to negotiate, particularly if you're at risk of eviction. Depending on your location, there may be legal protections against eviction for those who are unemployed. Negotiating can buy you time, reduce your financial burden, and prevent essential services from being cut off.

If you are carrying debt, reach out to creditors to explore options for deferring payments, reducing interest rates, or restructuring your debt. Some creditors offer hardship programs designed for individuals going through periods of unemployment or financial crisis.

If deferring payments isn't an option, focus on making minimum payments to avoid additional late fees or damage to your credit score. Although debt can be stressful, your basic needs, such as housing and food, should take precedence over aggressive debt repayment during this time.

There are a variety of emergency assistance programs available, designed to help you cover essential costs like food, housing, and utilities when you cannot do so on your own.

Several government programs offer financial assistance to those who are unemployed and struggling. Unemployment insurance provides temporary income to eligible individuals who lost their jobs through no fault of their own, and can be applied for through your state's Department of Labor.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program helps low-income individuals and families purchase groceries, while Temporary Assistance for Needy Families provides cash assistance for basic living expenses. For healthcare, Medicaid offers free or low-cost coverage to qualifying individuals based on income. Research what programs you qualify for and apply as soon as possible. These programs can provide the financial lifeline you need to get through the toughest months of unemployment.

In addition to government assistance, many charitable organizations provide food, housing assistance, and other resources to those in need. Local food banks can provide groceries, allowing you to cut food costs from your budget while still ensuring you and your family are fed.

Non-profit organizations often offer rental assistance, emergency housing, and utility support. Religious organizations may also provide financial aid or community support. These resources are usually available at little to no cost and can offer significant relief.

Even with reduced expenses and assistance programs, there may still be a gap between your needs and available resources. You can earn money quickly through these temporary measures:

Look around your home for items you no longer need or use that can be sold, such as electronics, furniture, appliances, or even clothing. Use platforms like eBay, Craigslist, or Facebook Marketplace to post these items for sale.

While this isn't a long-term solution, it can provide the funds needed to cover a bill or buy groceries. Even small sales can add up and provide some breathing room in your budget.

If selling items isn't enough, you might consider short-term borrowing. You can ask friends or family to lend you cash, but be sure to communicate clearly about repayment terms to avoid straining personal relationships.

You may also consider taking out a personal loan from a credit union. However, be cautious with payday loans or other high-interest borrowing options, as these can trap you in a cycle of debt that's difficult to escape.

The gig economy offers numerous opportunities to earn an income without the need for long-term commitment. Apps like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, TaskRabbit, and Upwork allow you to take on freelance work, driving, or small tasks that can bring in money quickly.

Many of these jobs offer flexibility, allowing you to work as much or as little as you need. While gig work may not provide the stability of a full-time job, it can be a useful short-term strategy to cover your essential expenses during this period.

After stabilizing your immediate financial situation, the next step is to focus on building a strong foundation for long-term financial health. This involves not only finding a sustainable income but also creating a financial safety net and developing better financial habits. By addressing these three critical areas, you'll be better prepared to weather future financial challenges and steadily build wealth.

Securing stable employment is a crucial part of moving forward financially. Be strategic and persistent in your job hunt. Reach out to former colleagues, connect with industry groups, and engage on professional platforms like LinkedIn. Remember to tailor your resume for specific roles and focus on sectors that align with your goals.

You may also use this period of unemployment as an opportunity to reassess your career path and identify ways to enhance your job prospects. Instead of rushing to accept any available job, think about how you can increase your skills and qualifications to align with industries that offer better job security and growth potential.

After you've landed a stable job, your next priority is building a financial safety net. This will protect you from future emergencies and give you peace of mind knowing you have a buffer to fall back on in times of crisis.

Establish an emergency fund and aim to save three to six months' worth of living expenses to cover unforeseen situations like job loss, medical emergencies, or major car repairs. Building this fund may take a while, but even small, regular contributions can grow significantly over time. Automate your savings to ensure consistency, with a portion of each paycheck regularly transferred into a separate savings account.

If you incurred debt during unemployment, managing and reducing it is key to improving your financial standing. Prioritize paying off high-interest debt first, such as credit cards, as these can quickly spiral if left unchecked. Once your debts are under control, your available income can be directed toward savings and investments, allowing you to focus on long-term financial growth.

This will ensure you don't fall into financial crisis again. For example, budgeting is the foundation of good financial management. There are several tools and apps that simplify the budgeting process and allow you to track your spending more efficiently.

Aside from short-term budgeting, think about the bigger financial picture. Set concrete goals such as saving for retirement, buying a home, building a business, or investing for future growth. For instance, if your employer offers a retirement plan, contribute as much as possible, particularly if they provide matching contributions. You may also consider investing in low-risk, diversified options like index funds or ETFs.

Even modest, consistent investments can benefit from compound interest, significantly increasing your wealth in the long run. Or if you have an entrepreneurial spirit, there are ways to start a business with zero capital. Whatever you decide, remember that your investment strategy should align with your goals and risk tolerance to ensure that you're building a secure financial future.

The struggle of unemployment and financial hardship can be overwhelming. However, by making timely interventions to cut expenses, access emergency resources, and generate quick cash, you can alleviate some of the pressure and maintain control over your financial situation. Remember to remain proactive and seek help when needed. Financial recovery is possible, and by taking it one step at a time, you can move toward a brighter future."

"Trump can win on these 3 key issues, Michigan voters tell Fox",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-can-win-three-key-issues-michigan-voters-tell-fox,2024-10-04T17:40:00Z,"Trump supporters in Saginaw, Michigan, told Fox News Digital the top issues Trump should hit as he seeks to win the critical swing state.

Michigan voters attending former President Donald Trump's Saginaw rally Thursday told Fox News Digital that the former president needs to focus on the economy to win the critical swing state, particularly job creation and curbing inflation.

""Opening up the pipelines to get the jobs back,"" one voter who attended Trump's rally on the campus of Saginaw Valley State University said when asked which issue the former president needs to focus on to win Michigan.

The comments come as Trump made yet another visit to the crucial swing state of Michigan, a state that could play a decisive role in determining who wins November's election. It also marked the second time the former president visited mid-Michigan in just a few weeks, a blue collar area of the state where the campaign believes it can make inroads with voters in what promises to be a close race.

TRUMP'S 2ND TERM FOREIGN POLICY LIKELY TO FOCUS ON 'STRENGTH' AND 'DETERRENCE': EXPERT

Vice President Kamala Harris is set to visit the same area of the state Friday, signifying the importance of Michigan as the clock nears the end of a dramatic election season.

Polls show Michigan as a toss up as of Wednesday, with the Real Clear Politics Polling average giving Harris a thin lead of just 0.7 points in the state. However, polls also showed Trump trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Biden in Michigan by 5.3 and 5.7 points respectively, numbers that turned out much more favorable to Trump on election day.

Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016 before dropping it to Biden in another close race in 2020, but voters in mid-Michigan believe Trump's focus on the economy should help put him over the top in 2024.

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

""Bring inflation down and safety and security in the state of Michigan,"" one voter told Fox News Digital.

""Illegal border crossings and the economy,"" another voter said. ""Keeping jobs in America, lowering inflation.""

However, other voters signaled that Trump could win on a range of issues, including national security and reducing crime in inner cities.

""Our national security does come first. But if the people at home, if they can't make ends meet, they're living in misery, that's just as important,"" a voter told Fox News Digital. ""Being truthful to the American people, which he has been.""

""Focusing on the inner cities. Putting together ways to decrease the violence,"" another voter said.

Meanwhile, one voter who said she was at the rally to support Trump said that the former president could lead the charge in helping Michigan residents see the issue of abortion differently.

""I think one of the bigger things to look at has been abortion... Michigan has been one of the stronger states in supporting that,"" the voter told Fox News Digital. ""He can do a very good job in getting us to just see the value of life."""
The U.S. saw stunningly strong growth in jobs last month. Here's what to know,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140039/labor-market-jobs-economy-interest-rates,2024-10-04T17:19:53Z,"U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs in September -- more than forecasters had expected. Gains for July and August were also revised upward. Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images/Getty Images hide caption

As far as economic data goes, it was a bit of a stunner.

Economists had expected U.S. employers to have added about 150,000 jobs in September. Instead, they created more than a quarter-million jobs last month, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, according to a report Friday from the Labor Department.

Here are five things to know about Friday's surprisingly strong jobs report.

In total, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs in September. Restaurants, retailers and construction companies all added jobs at a healthy pace.

In addition, employment gains for July and August were revised upwards by a total of 72,000 jobs. That means that, on average, employers have added 186,000 jobs in each of the last three months.

While that's a slowdown from the first three months of the year, when employers added an average of 267,000 jobs a month, it's still a solid pace.

A separate report earlier this week also showed the number of job openings increased slightly in August to 8 million.

But not all industries are enjoying a boom. Manufacturing has been in a slump for most of the last two years. Factories cut 7,000 jobs in September, although factory employment is still higher than it was just before the pandemic, by 137,000 jobs. Most of September's job cuts were in the auto industry.

A survey of factory managers released this week by the Institute for Supply Management shows manufacturers are still struggling with high interest rates and uncertainty about the upcoming presidential election.

By contrast, another ISM survey shows continued growth in the much-larger services side of the economy -- things like restaurants and car repair.

In order to keep adding jobs, employers need workers. Fortunately, the U.S. labor force continues to grow.

Friday's report shows 150,000 people joined or re-joined the workforce last month. Much of this growth is driven by immigration. The foreign-born workforce has grown rapidly over the last year, adding 1.4 million workers, while the native-born workforce shrank by nearly 600,000 workers.

Were it not for immigrant workers, job growth might well have stalled. The decline of the native-born workforce is primarily the result of baby boomers retiring. By contrast, the share of people in their prime working years (25 to 54) is near an all-time high.

Average wages in September were up 4% from a year ago. That's likely more than enough to outpace rising prices, giving workers a real boost in their purchasing power.

Inflation data for September won't be released until next week, but in recent months, prices have been climbing at a modest pace -- 2.5% for the 12 months ending in August. In fact, wage gains have exceeded price hikes for fifteen months and September's increase probably extended that trend.

The Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates last month with an aggressive half-a-percentage-point move, signaling a turning point in its years-long battle against inflation.

But Fed chairman Jerome Powell says he and his colleagues may move more cautiously in the future, cutting rates by a quarter point at a time.

""This is not a committee that feels like it's in a hurry,"" Powell said Monday.

Friday's surprisingly strong jobs report is likely to reinforce that patient approach. According to CME's FedWatch tool, odds of a quarter-point rate cut at the next Fed meeting rose to nearly 95% after the jobs report was released, from 68% the day before.

Fed policymakers will get one more monthly jobs report before their next scheduled meeting in early November."
"In swing-state Wisconsin, new districts threaten the GOP hold on the Legislature",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5108996/wisconsin-election-voting-legislature,2024-10-04T16:50:56Z,"GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Smoke from portable grills filled the air with the smell of bratwurst on a recent Sunday in the parking lots that surround Lambeau Field.

People were gathered to watch the Green Bay Packers take on the rival Minnesota Vikings, but in a state and city where football is a staple of the culture, they were also there for the pregame tailgate and the experience of one of Wisconsin's premier gathering places.

In one of the crowded lots, the Packers Tailgate Band meandered its way through lawn chairs and folding tables full of food. Brass and woodwind instruments carried the tune while a makeshift drum set mounted to a stroller kept the time. When the band played ""Roll Out The Barrel,"" a Wisconsin polka staple, people got up from their seats and danced.

""It's probably like the best job I have,"" said Tim Kozlovski, the band's sousaphone player. ""It's just having fun with people and partying with them and getting them in the spirit for the game.""

Kozlovski said the Packers unify people in Wisconsin -- he calls it a ""good place in your heart."" And in an atmosphere like that, he said there are some things you just don't talk about, like politics.

""You gotta learn to keep that to yourself when you're trying to make people happy,"" he said.

Not everyone has that luxury in Green Bay, where for the first time in years, Lambeau Field and the surrounding community are part of a fierce campaign that could decide control of the Wisconsin Legislature. A couple of parking lots over, local Democrats are tailgating, hoping to unlock the political power they were granted when the state redrew its political maps and turned this once-safe GOP district competitive.

""I actually enjoy talking about politics,"" said Ryan Spaude, the Democratic candidate running to represent this area at the state Capitol in Madison. He's a local prosecutor. ""I enjoy having a respectful dialogue with other folks about politics. I also think we can do better than some of the yahoos that are down there in Madison right now.""

Spaude is well aware of the divided nature of his district. President Joe Biden would have won this district in 2020 -- former President Donald Trump would have carried it in 2016. He jokes that this district is as purple as some of the Minnesota Vikings jerseys in the crowd that day.

""Ninety-nine seats in the state Assembly,"" Spaude said. ""There's about a dozen that are like mine that could go either way. These seats will determine who gets the majority.""

When it comes to races for statewide office, Wisconsin has a well-earned reputation as a swing state. Four of the last six presidential contests have been decided by less than a percentage point.

But in races for the Legislature, it's been anything but competitive ever since 2011, when Republicans took control of state government and redrew the state's legislative district lines, cementing their power for years to come.

""There would be a couple competitive seats in the state Assembly every year, but the outcome of them was basically inconsequential,"" said John Johnson, a redistricting expert at Marquette University Law School. ""There was no chance that majority control of the chamber would change.""

The GOP used its majorities to shift Wisconsin's politics to the right. When Republican Scott Walker was in the governor's office, they famously passed laws that weakened unions in a state with deep ties to organized labor.

Even after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers took office, their legislative majorities effectively gave Republicans veto power. As neighboring states expanded Medicaid or legalized marijuana, the GOP was able to block Evers' plans that would have had Wisconsin join them.

This election, in this 50-50 district, the debate is different. Spaude said the number one issue he hears from voters is about the cost -of -living.

""The second issue is -- why can't you people work together? Just the gridlock you see,"" Spaude said.

Nearby, Patrick Buckley, Spaude's Republican opponent is also making the rounds. He's a small business owner and former police officer who currently chairs the board of Brown County, home to Green Bay.

""We get a lot of stuff done at the county,"" Buckley said. ""I'd like to take what I've learned there at the county to the state level. Because I think we need that there.""

Buckley said the new map created an opening for him because this new district had no incumbent. But he insists he hasn't really thought about how his race could tip the balance in the Legislature. When asked about the top three things he talks about with voters, Buckley has a clear answer.

""Economy, economy, economy,"" Buckley said. ""A lot of people are hurting out there, and we gotta figure out what we can do as government to give them some sort of relief.""

The idea that Wisconsin could be in this position seemed, just a few years ago, almost impossible. Even with Evers in the governor's office, the Legislature redrew Wisconsin's maps to make them even more powerful with the help of a then-conservative majority on Wisconsin's Supreme Court.

But everything changed in 2023 when voters flipped control of the court from conservative to liberal, and the new majority ordered new maps drawn

In an unexpected twist, the Republican-controlled Legislature chose maps that were drawn by Evers, making the political calculation that it was their least-worst option. In a brief speech before their vote, Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said the new maps would be ""very competitive,"" and the Legislature would be ""up for grabs.""

""We will have the ability to decide if we want to go toward the direction of Minnesota and Michigan,"" Vos said, referencing two states where Democrats control both the state Legislature and the governor's office.""Or [if] we want to stay in the direction that we're heading in Wisconsin, where we have the ability to have a lower tax burden, a lower regulatory touch, and still a historically good economy for Wisconsin. So I'm optimistic.""

This will be the first test of how that debate plays out in Wisconsin. As with many political issues, the answer could be complicated.

A few blocks away from Lambeau Field, Bud Hearley was watching the game with family and friends from the comfort of a one-car garage turned into a bar. Hearley, who lives in a nearby district, said there are too many extremes in politics, and he'd like to see more compromise.

""I'm looking for a little more give and take on both sides with the issues that they make so extreme,"" Hearley said. ""There's not enough middle.""

Hearly doesn't fit neatly into one box when it comes to the issues. He favors the legalization of marijuana and thinks women should have the right to abortion, with some limits. He's also a strong supporter of capitalism who is leery of government overreach. And he tends to vote for Republicans.

Back at the tailgating event, Democratic voter Denise Gaumer Hutchison concedes that Democrats may or may not win it all this year, but for the first time in years, she said they'll at least be able to force Republicans to have a dialog. That was never possible, she said, under the state's old maps.

""Those maps were not fair to the point that legislators wouldn't even try,"" Gaumer Hutchison said. ""They wouldn't even do doors. They wouldn't even come talk to people who might be of a different opinion because they didn't have to. Now they have to.""

It's not just Lambeau Field's Assembly seat that's up for grabs this year. The district next door is so close it would have been won by both Evers, a Democrat, and Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson two years ago. The surrounding Senate district could also flip and give Democrats a chance at winning that chamber in 2026.

Regardless of the outcome, there's already been a political sea change in Wisconsin, a state where the race for president is seemingly always up for grabs, and now the state Legislature is, too."
AI Training Data Dilemma: Legal Experts Argue For 'Fair Use',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2024/10/04/ai-training-data-dilemma-legal-experts-argue-for-fair-use/,2024-10-04T16:28:49Z,"In the race to build smarter Artificial Intelligence (AI), should knowledge be locked behind paywalls or flow freely? Generative AI, as a technology djinn, has burst onto the digital scene, enhancing productivity by answering questions, solving complex problems, and creating content across multiple domains -- capabilities that are only possible thanks to breakthroughs in machine learning (ML).

The Legal Battleground: Creators vs. Tech Giants

Beneath this magical facade lies a brewing conflict that pits content owners against tech giants. Content owners have filed several lawsuits against AI companies: Getty Images sued Stability AI over image use; authors like Sarah Silverman sued Meta and OpenAI for using their books without permission; the New York Times and eight daily newspapers have taken legal action against OpenAI and Microsoft for utilizing their articles; and Artists have filed a class-action lawsuit against Midjourney and Stability AI, and more. The crux of the matter is the alleged unauthorized use of copyrighted works to train AI models.

An AI track mimicking Drake and The Weeknd hit streaming platforms before legal removal; Wacom and Hasbro facing backlash for using AI images in marketing; OpenAI's Sora producing realistic videos from text prompts; AI language models are generating news articles and opinion pieces; and more. Over 200 artists signed an open letter against AI voice cloning; Wizards of the Coast admitted to using AI in marketing materials for Magic: The Gathering (tabletop and digital collectible card game); ongoing lawsuits debating copyright infringement in AI training; and discussions continuing on ethical guidelines for AI-generated content.

At first glance, the solution seems deceptively simple -- make the tech giants pay for the training data. But this knee-jerk reaction could be a Trojan horse. By erecting a paywall around data, one risks not only fortifying the very monopolies that are being challenged but also concentrating AI's benefits in the hands of established cash-rich tech corporations rather than distributing them widely across society.

Restricting AI's access to the vast repository of data and knowledge, on the other hand, will severely hamper its ability to learn, significantly impeding potential advancements and curtailing broad societal benefits. And, if AI trains and learns from its own outputs or synthetic data, it risks a downward spiral where its output becomes less varied, less accurate, and of lower quality, leading to hallucinations -- a process researchers call ""model collapse.""

In fact, many legal scholars argue that ML systems should generally be allowed to use copyrighted databases for training purposes under the already established ""fair use""doctrine.

Fair Use and Fair Learning

While it may appear that AI tools create content from nothing, this is not the case. Behind the scenes, generative AI platforms are trained and developed on massive datascapes and question snippets, leveraging billions of parameters constructed by software processing massive archives of images and text data.

Dan Cahoy, a Professor of Business Law at Penn State's Smeal College of Business, states, ""Ultimately, there are four broad and somewhat amorphous factors to determine fair use: the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and the effect on the potential market for the original work. The first factor generally favors fair use if the work is ""transformed"" into something that is different in terms of its message or use from the original. It looks at whether new ideas, meanings, or value has been added for a different audience. This change might create fresh information, artistic elements, insights, or viewpoints beyond simply copying the original.""

Mark Lemley, the William H. Neukom Professor of Law at Stanford Law School and the Director of the Stanford Program in Law, Science, and Technology, writes about ML models in a recent paper, ""To perform, they must first learn how -- generally, through a process of trial-and-error of epic proportions. And in order to create the right conditions for this learning process, engineers must begin by collecting and compiling enormous databases of exemplary tasks for machines to practice on, known as ""training sets."" ML systems generally require a more permanent training data set to test successive iterations of the software against. [...] Creating a training set of millions of examples almost always requires, first, copying many more millions of images, videos, audio, or text-based works. Those works are almost all copyrighted."" It's like creating the ultimate study guide.

Lemley posits further, ""AI isn't competing with authors or artists. Instead, it is using their work in an entirely different manner. [...] ML systems generally copy works, not to get access to their creative expression (the part of the work the law protects), but to get access to the uncopyrightable parts of the work -- the ideas, facts, and linguistic structure of the works."" He proposes 'fair learning' as a principle that the use of copyrighted works to train ML systems should be fair even if fair use factors -- the nature of the work, and the amount taken would otherwise weigh against fair use.

Take a language AI model trained on millions of books. It's not interested in the stories, characters, or themes; instead, it aims to learn linguistic patterns - things like grammar rules, sentence structures, and word relationships. Similarly, for an AI model to learn what a dog looks like, it needs to analyze millions of dog photos. The system isn't interested in the artistic composition or the specific dog in each photo - elements that might be protected by copyright. Instead, it's learning to recognize general features like fur, four legs, tails, and typical dog shapes. In fact, ""verbatim copying"" is the necessary intermediate step toward accessing the unprotectable ""ideas and functional elements"" of works that allow AI systems to learn generalizable patterns and concepts rather than simply memorizing specific content. AI models instead encode patterns from training data into parameters, generating responses using learned probabilities and not by referencing stored content.

The concept of ""enablement"" in patent law requires inventors to fully disclose their innovations in depth -- akin to a detailed recipe or instruction manual containing all essential information to teach someone skilled in the field to understand, use, and recreate the invention. The principle of ""thorough knowledge"" sharing underpins the legal framework to drive progress and should apply to the ethos of both human inventions and ML.

Behind the Curtain: AI's Insatiable Data Appetite

To illustrate AI's exponential appetite for data, consider the GPT series' evolution: GPT-1 (117M) → GPT-2 (1.5B) → GPT-3 (175B) → GPT-4 (est. 1T*). This approximately 8,547-fold increase in parameters (the AI's adjustable components) over four generations helps explain why AI needs vast datasets. More parameters allow AI to understand the context and generate human-like responses across diverse topics but require exponentially more training data.

The unprecedented scale of data required to train modern AI models lies at the heart of the current controversy. At a certain point, it's no longer about selecting data; it's about crawling the entire internet. Both ML systems and humans learn from information, but machines require vastly more data to excel at tasks.

Colossal Expenditures into Widespread Technological Empowerment

Developing large ML models not only requires massive amounts of data - it also demands enormous capital investments in data centers, top-tier tech talent, mega-scale energy utilities, and infrastructure. The scale of this spending is staggering. In the latest quarter alone, tech giants Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta poured a combined $52.9 billion into capital expenditures. Meanwhile, venture capital firms are investing $64.1 billion in AI startups so far in 2024.

Despite the huge upfront costs borne by tech companies and investors, the benefits of AI are poised to ripple across the entire business and consumer landscape. Enterprises of all sizes and individuals will be able to piggyback on these AI breakthroughs through efficiencies in the AI value chain. As a result, they will be able to solve their unique problems: streamline operations, create new services, boost productivity, and spark innovation -- all without spending billions on research and development. The features and benefits of AI will be broad and egalitarian, empowering businesses, individuals, and diverse sectors globally to dramatically enhance productivity and actively shape the evolving economy.

AI's Creative Surge Challenges Art, Ethics, and Law

AI-generated content is blurring the lines between human and machine-made art and challenging notions of creativity, authenticity, and human expression. AI can create artwork in the style of celebrated masters, compose music as fluently as skilled musicians, play complex strategy games, write software, produce writings that are difficult to distinguish from those of real journalists, and more -- all at a blazing speed. While these AI feats inspire awe, they simultaneously fuel worries about artificial intelligence as a genuine competitive threat. And what we're seeing now is just the tip of the iceberg in AI's potential.

The uncannily realistic AI outputs are sparking debates about intellectual property rights, attribution, and accountability. Who can claim the right to an AI-produced image, text, or song as their own? Artists whose works are part of the massive training data sets that the computers utilize to generate their results should be credited and paid for? How should the legal system respond to the blurring lines between human and AI-created works?

Copyright Law: Adapting to the AI Era

Rebecca Tushnet, who teaches law at Harvard, has a different take on this. She believes the rules about who owns creative work are already pretty clear when it comes to using AI. Tushnet points out that for a long time, the U.S. Copyright Office has only given copyright to things that were mainly made by actual people. She says courts have backed this up over and over. In her words, ""The U.S. courts are generally in agreement that you need a human being sufficiently in the loop to have an author. And a lot of AI-generated works are not that."" Basically, she's saying that if a computer does most of the work, it might not count as something you can copyright.

Imagine an AI system trained to recognize Prince across various artistic representations, processing millions of images, including Warhol's iconic pop-art portraits. While the AI's goal is simply to identify Prince within all artistic variations, it's not specifically trying to learn Warhol's techniques. Yet the model inadvertently gains the ability to mimic Warhol's style as a byproduct of its extensive training.

Such cases raise questions about authenticity and artistic content ownership across myriad creative genres, not just visual art, and allude to why many lawsuits are making their way through the legal system. However, in the short term, the low-hanging solutions are with the companies themselves.

Solutions are already being implemented in the form of bot-filters to prevent the output of content that closely resembles existing copyrighted works. YouTube uses technology to spot when someone uploads a video with copyrighted music or clips; once it catches these, it takes them down automatically. AI companies could similarly build smart filters that look at what their AI is producing and conclude, ""This looks an awful lot like that famous painting,"" or ""This tune is super close to that hit song from last year."" If it's about to spit out something that's practically a carbon copy of something that already exists, these filters would step in and block it.

Professor Lynda Oswald of the University of Michigan sums it up: ""One of the biggest legal challenges of the mid-21st century will be figuring out how to regulate AI effectively. Consider the complexity of the ownership and monetization issues posed by AI and its voracious consumption of data, the breakneck pace of advancing AI technology and the shuffling pace of the law trailing behind it, and the diverse and often conflicting interests and objectives of the myriad stakeholders involved. Crafting a regulatory response that adequately accounts for all of these factors and allows AI development to proceed on an orderly track will be a herculean task.""

Conclusion

As we navigate the complex landscape of AI and copyright law, a nuanced understanding is emerging. Legal scholars suggest two key points: the input data used for AI training may often be permitted under ""fair use"" or ""fair learning."" At the same time, purely machine-produced output is typically not copyrightable. This perspective recognizes that ML, at its core, is about extracting patterns and facts rather than copying creative expression. Ultimately, fair use is about more than transforming existing works. It's about preserving our collective ability to create, share, and build upon ideas. Or it's about preserving the ability to learn -- whether the entity doing the learning is a human or a machine."
"With Robust Hiring In September, Here's What Lies Ahead For Job Seekers In October And November",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/10/04/with-robust-hiring-in-september-heres-what-lies-ahead-for-job-seekers-in-october-and-november/,2024-10-04T16:28:16Z,"The job market in September showed remarkable strength as the United States economy added 254,000 new jobs last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday.

Hiring lived up to the hype of the ""September surge,"" as the government data outpaced the Dow Jones consensus forecast of 150,000. Employment continued to rise in sectors such as food services and drinking establishments, healthcare, government, social assistance and construction, while unemployment fell to 4.1%.

August's total was adjusted upward by 17,000, while July experienced a significant increase of 55,000, bringing the overall monthly growth to 144,000.

Adding to the positive momentum, the Federal Reserve is anticipated to implement another interest rate reduction on November 7, following an initial cut on September 18.

Market projections suggest a 0.25% decrease in interest rates, bringing them to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. However, there's a possibility of a more substantial 0.5% cut, contingent on the economic data released in the upcoming weeks.

Looking ahead, this buoyant hiring mood could continue into the coming months, potentially leading to further job growth. Although, challenges remain for job seekers, as competition for positions may intensify.

As October and early November roll in, job hunters find themselves in a prime window of opportunity, with many companies generally eager to fill positions before the holiday season commences.

Historically, this period often sees an uptick in hiring activity as businesses look to maximize their remaining budgets before year-end. The fall hiring season typically parallels the busy recruitment cycle of January and February, which are peak months for interviews as staff return from vacations, according to Indeed.

However, candidates must act swiftly, as this productive phase is fleeting, with a slowdown expected to take hold around Thanksgiving.

Moreover, the current economic climate has introduced some uncertainty to this hiring pattern. Job growth has been slowing overall, with the economy adding fewer monthly jobs compared to the previous years.

The average monthly gain over the past 12 months is 203,000, down from 251,000 in 2023, 377,000 in 2022 and 604,000 in 2021, according to BLS.

Job seekers should approach this period with realistic and flexible expectations, as well as a well-prepared strategy -- such as networking -- to maximize their chances of success. With fewer job openings, competition may be fiercer.

Certain sectors may still see increased hiring activity. Industries directly affected by the holiday season, such as retail and hospitality, often ramp up seasonal hiring during this period.

Amazon announced on Wednesday its plans to hire 250,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal roles across its customer fulfillment and transportation operations in the U.S."
Why Leaders Who Can't Unplug Are Sabotaging Their Own Success,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/soulaimagourani/2024/10/04/why-leaders-who-cant-unplug-are-sabotaging-their-own-success/,2024-10-04T16:28:15Z,"Burned-out leaders lead burned-out companies... but's be honest: taking a real vacation feels almost impossible. Over half of U.S. workers admit they're still checking in with colleagues during their time off, according to LinkedIn's Workforce Confidence survey.

And here's the kicker: the higher you climb in the leadership ranks, the worse it gets. Nearly 80% of directors and senior leaders are guilty of doing the same, and they're carrying something even more dangerous -- guilt.

Yes, guilt. The kind that gnaws at you when you're sipping a cocktail on the beach but still sneaks a glance at your phone. The kind that tells you that stepping away, even for a week, could make everything fall apart. So, you stay tethered to your email, half-present, and ironically, half-effective. But this is where we need to take a step back and think about the real cost of this behavior -- not just to us as leaders but to our teams and businesses.

Let's break this down. Why are leaders so bad at unplugging? According to the data, 41% of senior leaders feel guilty for even daring to take a break, compared to 35% of individual contributors. The higher you go, the more that guilt tightens. I've been there. When you're responsible for strategy, people, and performance, there's a pervasive feeling that things might unravel if you're not constantly ""on.""

But the problem isn't just personal -- it's cultural.

Many organizations (and their investors) expect leaders to be always available, equating constant accessibility with dedication. It's as if taking time off signals a lack of commitment, and that's where things start to break down. In reality, an ""always-on"" leader isn't showing commitment; they're showcasing a lack of trust -- in themselves, their teams, and the systems they've built.

You're not just fighting your instincts; you're up against company culture. Many businesses run on the belief that if you're out of sight, you're out of touch. This creates a toxic feedback loop where everyone needs to be plugged in 24/7, no matter the cost to personal well-being. And let's be real: technology hasn't helped. Our phones are both the tools that keep us connected and the shackles that make it impossible to step away.

Think about the message this sends to your team. If you can't take a break without checking in, why would they feel empowered to unplug themselves? Leadership sets the tone, and when leaders can't truly disconnect, neither can their people. We end up with an entire organization running on fumes, constantly reacting instead of being proactive.

Now, add a layer of complexity: global organizations. In the U.S., long hours and minimal vacation days are almost seen as badges of honor. But in countries like France or Denmark, where taking time off is sacred, the contrast is stark. These countries understand something we haven't quite mastered here -- that real breaks lead to real productivity.

As leaders in a global economy, we need to recognize that the way we handle work-life balance can vary drastically across borders. What works in New York doesn't necessarily work in Paris. So, the question becomes: how do you create a culture that supports your team in a way that's culturally aware but universally healthy?

The real challenge is figuring out how to disconnect in a world that's wired for constant connection. The truth is, completely ""going dark"" might not be realistic for many leaders, but there are ways to make it manageable without sacrificing sanity -- or productivity.

Here's what works:

Let's get practical. If you're constantly checking in, you're not leading with your best energy, creativity, or clarity. You're not bringing new ideas to the table or inspiring your team. You're firefighting instead of building.

At the end of the day, time off isn't just a perk. It's a necessity for leadership success. And frankly, your business will benefit more from you fully recharged than half-engaged.

So, the next time you're tempted to check that email on vacation (or during the weekend), ask yourself: is this really what great leadership looks like? Or is the real power in stepping back, trusting your team, and coming back ready to take on what's next?"

A Florida restaurant owner struggling to keep doors open in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic received a surprise message of support from former President Trump.

""I'd like to ask everybody to pitch in and help save Harry and the Natives. It's a special restaurant, a very special place. People love it. It's been around a long time. Like a really long time. But it's fallen prey to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden's economy,"" Trump told owner Harry MacArthur in a pre-recorded message Friday on ""Fox & Friends.""

""We have to keep the good ones open, especially when it comes to Florida. Florida is a very, very special place, and that's a very, very great restaurant. So Harry and the Natives, keep it going. We love it. And you're going to be around for a long time.""

'ECONOMY WAY BETTER UNDER TRUMP': BLACK VOTERS SHARE IF THEY WERE BETTER OFF 4 YEARS AGO

Co-host Steve Doocy hosted Friday's show from the packed restaurant in Hobe Sound after MacArthur wrote on Facebook he would have to shut down unless something changed by October 12.

The community, however, rallied behind MacArthur by supporting a GoFundMe set up by his son, Wyatt.

MacArthur called the response from Trump and the community ""overwhelming.""

""Turns out everybody cares,"" he said.

The restaurant has been in MacArthur's family for 72 years. Although the business was originally run by his parents, MacArthur reopened the business as Harry and the Natives after his father died in the 1980s.

MacArthur's business was close to bankruptcy in 2021, but after a ""Breakfast with Friends"" segment, the business was able to hold on. But the financial struggle was not over.

China's 30% Stock Rally Has An Economic Problem,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2024/10/04/chinas-30-stock-rally-has-an-economic-problem/,2024-10-04T15:42:59Z,"The bulls charging through Shanghai are beginning to look over their shoulders.

Gaining on them is economic reality that has many wondering if the more than 30% surge in equities from a September low is overdone. The problem is an underlying economy facing intensifying headwinds. And one failing to keep pace with the sudden surge in investor optimism toward China.

This stock rally follows an extraordinary barrage of moves to cut interest rates, slash mortgage rates, relax rules for homebuyers in major cities and lower the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping is hinting at bigger steps to come to boost national growth.

These maneuvers changed the subject from China's deflation-generating property crisis, high youth unemployment and weak consumer demand.

Not for long, though, as Chinese data suggest more trouble ahead. In August, industrial industry profits plunged 17.8% from a year earlier, the sharpest contraction so far in 2024. Other data on retail sales and fixed asset investment add to worries Asia's biggest economy is slowing anew.

So much so that some economists think Xi's Communist Party should issue about 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) in special debt to lift confidence via infrastructure projects. Count Jia Kang, head of private think tank China Academy of New Supply-Side Economics, among them.

""As these projects get underway, they will create jobs, increase income for citizens, and unlock consumption potential,"" says Jia, the former head of a research institute linked to the Ministry of Finance, told Chinese publication The Paper.

In other words, what Team Xi has done to date isn't gaining the traction economists hoped. One problem is that China is doing more to throw money at the forces generating deflation than implementing policies to reverse them.

Hence concerns that the stock surge is racing ahead of concrete efforts to raise China's economic game. Or even to meet this year's 5% growth target in credible ways.

It's a reminder that China needs to treat the underlying causes of its economic slump, not just the symptoms. It was those causes that had Chinese shares plunging two weeks ago. That selloff reflected concerns the economy is stumbling.

Yet even as the bulls charge again, those concerns remain real.

In an op-ed for news organization Project Syndicate, Chinese economist Yu Yongding argues ""it's fair to say that China's 'economic miracle' of maintaining an average annual growth rate of 10% is over. Still, I believe that with wise macroeconomic policy, market-oriented reforms, and a genuine commitment to opening up its economy, the economy should be able to maintain a solid growth rate of 5-6% for the foreseeable future.""

Yu was on the Chinese central bank's monetary committee. Now, he's on the frontlines of another epochal debate.

""Chinese economists have debated for years whether policymakers should adopt more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate GDP growth, or focus instead on structural reforms aimed at eliminating overcapacity,"" Yu argues. ""But given this year's lackluster economic performance, their views are increasingly aligned. In fact, one could even say that all Chinese economists now advocate expansionary measures.""

Even more important, though, are steps to end the property crisis once and for all. Lessons from Japan abound. In the 1990s, Tokyo acted glacially to get bad loans off banks' balance sheets, paving the way for 25 years of deflation.

Japan comparisons only go so far with China. But the slow pace of stabilizing a property sector pivotal to gross domestic product has helped no one in China. It's the biggest cause of Chinese deflation.

Xi's inner circle has been slow to get bad assets off property developers' balance sheets. It's lacked urgency to address China's fast-aging population and catalyze a bigger, more disruptive startup boom. It's been too slow for comfort to build social safety nets to encourage households to save less and spend more.

Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's Analytics, can't help but think back to a market mini-crash that happened nine years ago. Recent data suggest Chinese officials aren't recalling the lessons from Tokyo's lost decade.

""Outside of the pandemic, this is the lowest it has been since the 2015 stock market crash,"" Cruise says. ""With the domestic economy struggling, deflation fears are elevated.""

The 2015 crash still traumatizes Xi's party. In a three-week period, from July to August 2015, Chinese shares plunged 30%. At the time, China Inc. circled the wagons. Xi's party pumped tidal waves of state funds into markets, scrapped all initial public offerings, suspended trading in thousands of companies and let mainlanders pledge homes as collateral to buy shares.

Yet then, as now, Beijing did more to address symptoms than the underlying causes. The more the bulls catch on, the more Chinese stocks may be vulnerable to a big correction."
Why Are Concert Tickets So Expensive? It's Not (Entirely) Ticketmaster's Fault,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/why-are-concert-tickets-so-expensive/,2024-10-04T14:34:44Z,"These days, it seems like snagging affordably priced tickets to a concert should be its own Olympic sport. It wasn't that long ago when Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain was famously shocked to learn some musicians charged $50 or more per ticket; in comparison, Nirvana was only charging about $17. If someone told you today they got a ticket to a Taylor Swift concert for only $50, you'd probably wonder where they found their magic lamp. Which leads to the inevitable question: Why are concert tickets so expensive these days?

To find out why things have changed so much in the live entertainment industry, we spoke to Eric Renner Brown, senior editor at Billboard and a former staff writer and editor at the concert-centric publication Pollstar, as well as Tatiana Cirisano, a senior music industry analyst at MIDiA Research and a former music business reporter at Billboard.

As you might imagine, it's a little complicated, with multiple factors conspiring to raise prices. Some factors, such as inflation, aren't especially surprising, but others are more subtle and involve the way modern day musicians make money right now.

As with other sectors of the economy, inflation has impacted the concert industry, causing the price of supplies to spiral upward. But there's more to it than that, because it largely started during the COVID-19 pandemic.

When the global economy slowed down and large public gatherings stopped in 2019 and 2020, many professionals were forced to take a step back from their work when concerts were canceled for health and safety reasons.

""A lot of bus drivers and truck drivers who transport musicians and crews, and, in some cases, semi-trucks full of production equipment for tours -- a lot of those people left the concert business,"" says Brown. ""They went to work in freight trucking, Amazon and other big companies transporting goods because that was still happening during the pandemic.""

Once concerts started up again, however, getting those workers back into the touring business didn't happen right away. With fewer people available to work on tours, wages (and consequently prices) escalated. So if concert producers wanted those goods and services, they had to pay more for them, post-pandemic. That lead directly to higher ticket prices.

Cirisano adds that inflation affects the cost of everything, including the gas to get to tour stops, airfare and hotel accommodations. There's also been a multi-year global supply chain crisis, which impacted many goods and services, including the tour buses themselves.

""There was a point where they were really scarce, so the prices went up,"" says Cirisano. ""If you have to spend more on that as an artist, you end up maybe pricing tickets a little bit higher.""

Big-name artists such as Taylor Swift and Beyoncé don't live directly off the money they make from touring; they have additional income streams like record sales, merchandise, endorsement deals, royalties and more.

But that's not the experience for many smaller artists, who generally rely on touring income as a main source of revenue. That's even more true now than it was a decade or two ago when record sales were higher and streaming wasn't the predominant way for people to consume music. Factor in that many artists were sidelined for a year or two because of the pandemic, and the result is that many musicians need to earn back what they lost during those non-touring years.

""Most artists don't make any meaningful income from streaming, so they have to supplement it with these other things [such as merchandise or live performances],"" Cirisano says. ""For a lot of artists, touring is their bread and butter.""

Moreover, Brown points out that many tours taking place across the U.S. are much bigger productions today than they were in the past. ""When you're looking at these extremely highly produced arena and stadium tours, fans expect a more immersive, multi-faceted concert experience than they might have expected before,"" Brown says.

Having a band play onstage with little-to-no production simply doesn't cut it with modern audiences -- which means that there are extra costs to create a monumental performance -- and that obviously becomes the fans' burden.

While this is a complicated question, Brown says it's a safe bet that the bigger the artist, the more control they have over their business, including ticket prices. Even if the artist doesn't have the final say over the final ticket price, they do have leverage. That said, artists simply don't have control over reseller prices on the secondary market.

Longtime bands such as The Rolling Stones and The Eagles tend to have some of the priciest tickets in the concert business, and fans will typically pay the high costs to see these legendary artists. It's a case of supply and demand, Brown points out.

Back in 2022, ahead of his 2023 U.S. tour, Bruce Springsteen faced controversy over exorbitant dynamic prices -- as much as $5,000 per ticket -- and that's before tickets hit the secondary market. When asked by Rolling Stone about the choice to price that high, Springsteen said he told his team, ""'Hey, we're 73 years old. The guys are there. I want to do what everybody else is doing, my peers.' So that's what happened."" The Boss then explained how ""most of [his] tickets are totally affordable"" but if ""the ticket broker or someone is going to be taking that money, [he thought,] 'Hey, why shouldn't that money go to the guys that are going to be up there sweating three hours a night for it?'""

In the pop world, Taylor Swift tickets could easily set you back four figures if you're seeing her in the U.S. this year. Tickets to her European shows were priced significantly lower. However, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end business analysis, Swift's average ticket price was about $239, the highest in 2023. Beyoncé's average ticket price came in at No. 2, around $209. Interestingly, according to Pollstar's 2024 mid-year report, the publication noted a 9.4% increase in the average ticket price, going from $116.41 to $127.38. The report stated the price hike ""marks only the third year on record with an average ticket price over $100. The 2022 average was $105.55, while the 2019 average topped out at $92.42.""

On the flipside, Ed Sheeran is a major artist who's managed to keep his ticket prices relatively low. Brown cited Sheeran's smaller band as a possible contributing factor to lower ticket costs. Per Pollstar, Sheeran's average ticket price was about $105 in 2023.

Another example is Robert Smith from The Cure. He worked to significantly lower prices, spurning dynamic pricing. Many of the tickets to The Cure's Shows of a Lost World tour in 2023 only cost fans $20 apiece. Smith worked with Ticketmaster after learning fees on the platform doubled the $20 tickets and surprisingly was able to refund fans for part of the service charge.

Web searches for concert tickets can sometimes lead to misleading perceptions of ticket prices. Google ""Taylor Swift tickets,"" for example, and the first few results you see will generally be resale sites on the secondary market, not the primary market. Cirisano notes that Ticketmaster is part of both market types, which can be especially confusing to fans trying to purchase tickets from their website.

""I think that's added to this perception that ticket prices are skyrocketing, when, a lot of the time, it's not actually the original ticket price you're looking at,"" Cirisano explains. ""It's the one that's been marked up by, in many cases, professional resellers who employ bots to buy hundreds, if not thousands, of tickets and resell them at higher prices.""

In May 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Live Nation, Ticketmaster's parent company, over an alleged monopoly. According to a press release, ""The lawsuit, which includes a request for structural relief, seeks to restore competition in the live concert industry, provide better choices at lower prices for fans, and open venue doors for working musicians and other performance artists.""

Could this lawsuit be successful? Cirisano believes that the case depends on whether the Justice Department can prove Live Nation is putting artists who do not book through their venue system at a disadvantage. Without that evidence, the suit could be in jeopardy.

Also in May 2024, the so-called Taylor Swift bill was signed into law by Minnesota Governor (and now vice presidential candidate) Tim Walz after the politician was unable to purchase tickets to Swift's tour stop in Minneapolis in 2023. This law, according to The Associated Press, ""will require ticket sellers to disclose all fees up front and prohibit resellers from selling more than one copy of a ticket, among other measures. The law will apply to tickets purchased in Minnesota or other states for concerts or other live events held in Minnesota."" Basically, it will provide stronger protections for digital consumers and goes into effect on January 1, 2025.

The internet is ablaze with memes about Ticketmaster's controversial fees, but where do these fees actually go? Who's benefiting? For starters, the main benefactors are (perhaps surprisingly) the venues themselves.

Some of the fees are going to credit card processing as well. ""What a lot of fans don't realize is that when they're seeing those fees that are added on, a lot of them are not actually going to Ticketmaster,"" Cirisano says. ""It creates this perception like, 'Oh, Ticketmaster is adding all of these fees,' when a lot of those fees are being passed on to others.""

Of course, some of the fees do go directly to Ticketmaster, though the site claims that they are used to improve the platform and services.

Case in point: One way Ticketmaster has tried to improve the users' experiences is to use All-In Pricing for certain shows. (Some states, such as New York, Tennessee and Connecticut mandate the use of All-In Pricing.) All-In Pricing requires Ticketmaster to include all fees as part of the ticket price right up front, so there aren't any surprises when a fan goes to check out. For tickets that don't offer All-In Pricing, Ticketmaster created a feature that lets you toggle to view the total price with fees.

Advocates for All-In Pricing, such as the National Independent Venue Association (NIVA), also want an itemized list of fees presented at the time of purchase for better pay transparency.

All-In Pricing can be the make-or-break solution for fans who budget a maximum price of, for example, $100, for a specific concert, then learn at the checkout their final cost will now be $200 with fees. The timer counting down how long they have to make a decision creates added pressure to what may already be a stressful situation. Fans in this predicament are forced to make a choice and it could be between having money for bills or getting to attend their dream concert. Knowing all the facts upfront can lessen the anxiety and make the experience a more relaxing purchase.

Make no mistake: If the next time you go to purchase a concert ticket and have to do a double take when you see the final total, it's not your imagination. Prices have gone up significantly in recent years.

Yes, Ticketmaster and other ticket sellers frontload ticket prices with additional fees that benefit the venue, credit card companies and the ticket sellers themselves. But don't discount the pandemic and all its financial repercussions, along with the need to offset the revenue artists have lost in the transition from CD sales to online streaming. It's no secret that Spotify just doesn't pay the bills for most musicians.

Artists have to adapt to these changes, which can ultimately trickle down to consumers through ticketing platforms. But in the words of Oasis, ""Don't look back in anger"" -- or, at least try not to when you remember a ticket to one of their shows in 2009 was about $50, but a ticket for their 2025 tour starts around $180.

Job Market Strong in September - Will It Slow Fed Rate Cuts?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/harryholzer/2024/10/04/job-market-strong-in-septemberwill-it-slow-fed-rate-cuts/,2024-10-04T14:34:24Z,"The jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for September was considerably stronger than expected.

Economists had been predicting payroll growth of 140-150,000 jobs; instead, payrolls rose by 254,000. The estimates for July and August were revised up substantially; the average for the last 3 months is now 185,000, which is considerably higher than earlier estimates. The strongest growth was in eating and drinking places, where employment rose by a very robust 69,000 jobs.

Wage growth has also been more robust than in previous months. Combining August and September, monthly wages have risen by about 5% (on an annualized basis). And, from the household survey, the employment rate out of the population grew by .2 percentage points (60.0 to 60.2%), while the unemployment rate fell - especially among high school dropouts and Hispanic workers.

It would probably be a mistake to read too much into this, or any other report, that covers just a single month. The monthly employment statistics tend to bounce around, and 3-6 month averages present a more informative picture. Also, other measures like the job vacancy rate (which held steady at 4.8 percent in August), suggest a steadier labor market. And another reading in the coming weeks on productivity will also be important - since the relative strong productivity growth (above 2 percent) over the past year and a half suggest we can live with wage growth of 4 percent or higher.

Still, the large bump in payrolls in September, combined with upward revisions for July and August as well as more robust wage growth, suggest that the job market weakness we had detected in the late spring and summer months might have been a bit overstated, or perhaps a more temporary lull than we thought. The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a half percentage point earlier this month, indicating its concern about a slowing economy. The current data might cause it to slow down further rate reductions a bit, until we get a clearer picture of where the job market is really heading."
"'Lies throughout': Trump-backed challenger, longtime Dem senator face off in heated battleground debate",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lies-throughout-trump-backed-challenger-longtime-dem-senator-face-off-heated-battleground-debate,2024-10-04T14:14:11Z,"Lackawanna County, Pa., has emerged as a key battleground county this election cycle, with voters on the streets of Scranton speaking with Fox News Digital about their top issues.

Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick squared off in their first debate Thursday evening, less than five weeks ahead of what is expected to be one of the most closely watched races this election cycle.

Casey and McCormick took the debate stage Thursday at 8 p.m. in Harrisburg, where the two traded barbs over issues such as the economy and inflation, immigration, abortion. The race, which is rated as ""leans Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report, is expected to be one of the tightest Senate races across the country, with Casey himself acknowledging earlier this year that it will be a ""close, tough race.""

Casey has long been a Pennsylvania Democratic stalwart, first winning his election to the U.S. Senate in 2007. The Casey name also has deep roots in the state, with Bob Casey Sr., the senator's father, serving as the Keystone State's governor from 1987 to 1995, following years of serving in various other elected roles.

McCormick is an Army combat veteran and former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, who served as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security as well as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under former President George W. Bush's administration. Former President Donald Trump endorsed McCormick in April, lauding him as a ""a good man"" who ""wants to run a good ship.""

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY

The Senate race comes as the federal election spotlights Pennsylvania once again as a key battleground state that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential election. Former President Donald Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while President Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.

As the pair squared off for the first of two debates ahead of Nov. 5, Fox News Digital compiled the top five moments of Thursday's event.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

Casey and McCormick both weighed in on the federal election, including Casey lauding Harris following his staunch support of Biden before the president ultimately dropped out of the 2024 race as concerns about his mental acuity and age mounted over the summer.

""From your perspective, who is the better candidate for Pennsylvania? Biden or Harris?"" moderator and ABC27 anchor Dennis Owens asked Casey.

""I think Vice President Harris, who's running a strong campaign, I think she'll carry Pennsylvania. It's going to be very close, just like the Senate race will be close. But she's running a strong campaign. But the people of our state have to make two basic decisions - in addition to other statewide races. They have decided in the presidential race, and they have to decide our race, and this race is very clear,"" Casey responded.

When asked whether he believes Biden or Harris would be a better president for Pennsylvania voters, Casey brushed off delivering a direct answer.

""Oh, I don't know, Dennis. I mean, we'll never know the answer to that, but the voters are gonna make a decision,"" he said.

McCormick, on the other hand, was asked if he could offer one example where he does not agree with Trump after slamming Casey during the debate for overwhelmingly voting with Biden over the last three and a half years.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

""[Trump] recently said that he wanted to get rid of the ban on SALT taxes, which Sen. Casey supported, too"" McCormick responded. ""Listen, that's a that's a tax break for millionaires in New York and California at the expense of PA taxpayers. So I wouldn't support that.""

""But listen, Senator Casey stood next to Joe Biden when he could hardly finish a sentence. We saw this on the debate stage, he said 'he's ready to go,'"" McCormick continued, referring to Casey's support of Biden remaining in the presidential race until Biden ultimately dropped out. ""Then Sen. Casey said, 'Kamala Harris is great. You're going to love her when you get to know her.' This is a woman who, in the last few years, says she wanted to ban fracking, legalize illegal immigration, give them federal benefits, take away our guns, defund the police. This is her position, so she's flip-flopped on everything, and Bob Casey standing there by her.""

Both candidates accused the other of ""lies"" throughout the debate, including McCormick touting a new website called CaseyLies.com, and Casey accusing McCormick of misrepresenting himself as a Pennsylvanian.

""For your viewers tonight, I have a website that's been established today, it's just been launched, CaseyLies.com. You can go and see the actual facts by third-party sources of all the things he's saying. There will be lies throughout. But you should ask yourself, 'Why is a senator with an 18-year track record, who should be able to run on his record, running his entire campaign with a negative set of attacks on me, most of them lies?'"" McCormick said towards the start of the debate.

McCormick claimed that Casey often launched ""lies"" at him during the debate because he ""doesn't have a track record"" in the Senate to run on.

Casey shot back during the debate that McCormick has misrepresented himself as a full-fledged Pennsylvanian.

""We've heard a couple of times tonight about telling lies, but probably the biggest lie told in this whole election, that probably most Pennsylvanians have never heard a bigger lie, was the lie when my opponent said he lived in Pennsylvania, when he was living in Connecticut. The Associated Press on August the 14th, 2023, did a story that proved that he was living in Connecticut,"" Casey said.

McCormick defended that he was born in Pennsylvania and has spent ""the majority of my life"" there, but also lived in Connecticut for years when he served as CEO of Bridgewater Associates.

PENNSYLVANIA SURVEY FINDS HARRIS LEADING TRUMP NARROWLY, IDENTIFIES HER 'BIGGEST WEAKNESS,' POLLSTER SAYS

The economy is among the top concerns for voters in Pennsylvania, as well as the nation at large, with both candidates outlining how they would tackle spiraling inflation if re-elected or elected to the Senate, and what they believe is behind the rise in consumers' costs.

""Prices are too high, especially when you go to the grocery store to buy food or household items, items that people need every week, or at least every other week. And these big conglomerates, these big corporations, rig those prices and jack them up to levels we've never seen, all while they're getting record profits,"" Casey said, while defending his efforts targeting corporations he has accused of ""greedflation.""

So-called greedflation is understood as corporations allegedly exploiting inflation woes by increasing prices on consumers to produce greater profits.

""We can take it on by passing a price gouging bill to go after those companies, hold them accountable,"" Casey said.

The Democratic senator also addressed his campaign against ""shrinkflation,"" which he explained as corporations shrinking products for consumers while not lowering prices.

""We did a report on shrinkflation, which covered a lot of companies around the country. And if that's happening with regard to a Pennsylvania company or any other company around the country, they should be held accountable. When they take a product, shrink the contents of the product, or what's in a bag, and don't shrink the price, that's deceptive. That's ripping people off,"" he said, adding that such companies should be held legally accountable.

McCormick shot back that higher costs on Americans in recent years is due to ""out of control spending"" at the hands of Casey and other Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and President Biden.

""When you've spent your entire life in public service, elected office, 30 years, you're like a hammer looking for a nail. The cause of inflation is the policies, the out-of-control spending of Biden, Harris and Casey. Bob Casey voted 100% of the time for that $5 trillion of new spending. The experts at the time, Larry Summers, the San Francisco Fed, said this would create inflation,"" McCormick said.

""Bob Casey doesn't understand how the economy works. That's why he's trying to do all this economic voodoo stuff with price controls,"" he later charged.

Casey and McCormick were both grilled about their current abortion stances during the debate, as abortion once again sits atop many voters' list of election concerns following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Casey positioned himself as a pro-life Democrat earlier in his career, but he voted to codify abortion protections nationwide following the overturning of Roe.

""In 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned a 49-year right, it overturned Roe v. Wade, I think everyone had to make a decision, including senators. I made a decision to support the Women's Health Protection Act. I don't support Republican efforts to ban abortion across the country,"" Casey said.

BATTLEGROUND STATE DEM DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM DEFUND MOVEMENT, BUT POLITICAL RECORD SHOWS DIFFERENT STORY

McCormick was questioned about his remarks in 2022 that he supports rare exceptions for abortion, such as when the health of the mother is at risk, and has since said that he supports additional exceptions for abortion.

""This is an extremely polarizing issue. As you know, I have six daughters, so this is something we spend time talking about. I believe this should be a state's right. I believe states should decide. Pennsylvania has had a law. It's been supported by Democrats and Republicans, like was signed into law by the Senator's father, Governor Casey. I support the three exceptions. I would not favor an abortion ban of any kind,"" McCormick responded.

Casey recently came under fire from a Pennsylvania sheriff who slammed the Democratic senator's border policies for the influx of fentanyl into the U.S., which the dad said had led to his son's death.

""We can't bring back the people we've lost. But we can get rid of the weak politicians like Bob Casey who let it happen,"" Blair County Sheriff Jim Ott said in a recent McCormick campaign ad.

Casey was asked about the sheriff's remarks during his debate Thursday.

""Mr. Casey, the Blair County Sheriff, blames you for the fentanyl death of his son, saying you have not done enough to secure the border. What is your response to that,"" Owens asked.

""I met so many families across the state, and whether it's a sheriff in Blair County or a mom in Allegheny County, Janet that I met, who talked about her daughter, Brianna, this is an awful, awful tragedy for those families. That's why we need to invest in the strategies that we know work. [McCormick] won't do that, because he's weak in the face of the political pressure from his own party. . . . We can solve this problem by investing in the technology, hiring thousands more Border Patrol, so we can inspect every single vehicle coming across the border,"" he said.

Amid the immigration debate, McCormick blamed the Biden-Harris administration and Casey for the immigration crisis at the southern border.

""The border crisis is the direct result of the weakness of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Bob Casey supported them every second. What chutzpah to run an ad on how tough he is on the border, when he voted against funding for the Border Patrol. He ran an ad in front of the wall that he voted against. He voted for sanctuary cities, he voted for federal benefits for illegal immigrants. And the fentanyl crisis that's come across our border is the direct result of the weakness of Bob Casey not standing up to these terrible cartels,"" McCormick argued.

The pair have agreed to another debate, next taking the same stage in Philadelphia on Oct. 15."
Strong September Jobs Report Reduces Recession Fears,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/10/04/strong-september-jobs-report-reduces-recession-fears/,2024-10-04T14:03:49Z,"The September jobs report was stronger than expected and is likely to assuage recession risks and fears, driving up hopes for ""soft landing"" or ""no landing"" economic scenarios. This report is likely to reduce the chances that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 0.5% on November 7, but the recent trend of slowing payrolls is still supportive of a 0.25% rate cut. An uncertain presidential election outcome could still push the Fed to cut rates by 0.5%.

The Employment Situation report, known to economists and analysts as the jobs report, was strong for September. It showed a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%, strong net payroll gains of 254,000, and strong upward revisions to payrolls by 72,000 for the previous two months. This was a much stronger report than economists and analysts had been forecasting, and it reduces the perceived downside risks to the U.S. labor market and economy.

While the jobs report supports the claim that the U.S. labor market is relatively solid, other recent data also reinforce this notion. After all, initial and continuing jobless claims are very low. Continuing claims are at 1.826 million, which is only around 1.1 percent of the labor force. Initial Jobless Claims are also very low, at just 225,000.

Strong Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data showed that there were over 8 million open jobs in August 2024. While this is around 4.2 million fewer open jobs than the U.S. historic high in March 2022 of 12.2 million, 8 million is still around 1 million more open jobs than before the COVID pandemic. With over 6 million more open jobs than people collecting unemployment, it is difficult to expect very large net payroll losses across multiple months anytime soon.

The Fed has a dual mandate to support full employment and keep inflation rates low and stable. The September jobs report, August JOLTS data, and recent weekly jobless claims reflect full employment in the U.S. labor market, but consumer prices are not yet low and stable - or at least not yet at the Fed's 2% inflation target. The combination of above-target inflation and a solid labor market could incentivize the Fed to cut interest rates by only 0.25% rather than 0.5% in its next policy decision on November 7.

Of course, we don't yet have September inflation data, and there is also a U.S. election to contend with before the next Fed meeting.

The September CPI and PCE reports will be critical for the November 7 Fed decision. Year-on-year inflation rates are likely to have made more progress toward 2% in September, and Prestige Economics is forecasting year-on-year September total CPI to be 2.4%, with core CPI at 3.1%. However, it may be the November election outcome - or uncertainty about that outcome by November 7 - that could push the Fed to cut rates by 0.5%

A strong September employment report with payrolls well above August levels and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1% is a signal that the Fed can take its time with rate cuts, which is likely to support the greenback and bond yields. Additionally, this solid report could still have positive impacts on equities, oil prices, and industrial metals prices because it assuages concerns about recession."
Here Is What A Government Efficiency Commission Should Look Like,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesbroughel/2024/10/04/here-is-what-a-government-efficiency-commission-should-look-like/,2024-10-04T13:53:51Z,"Elon Musk has floated the idea of a government efficiency commission aimed at addressing wasteful spending and regulations in Washington. Former President Donald Trump embraced Musk's idea, stating that if re-elected he would establish such a commission with Musk at the helm. While government efficiency commissions can indeed be powerful tools for reform, they are also easy to ignore or sideline, particularly when their recommendations are controversial or if they are set up merely for political optics rather than substantive change. The success of such a commission therefore lies in its structure and its role within a broader policy mandate to overhaul government, such as through an explicit government-wide goal of reducing regulation.

Musk and Trump can learn from the past, starting with looking at commissions that have offered valuable recommendations that went unheeded. A prime example is the 2010 Simpson-Bowles fiscal commission, which was formed during the Obama administration to address the federal deficit. The commission's recommendations were well-researched and pragmatic, tackling tough issues like Medicare and Social Security reform. Despite the balanced and informed nature of its suggestions, Congress ultimately chose not to act on them. The commission's failure was largely due to the politically sensitive nature of its proposals and a lack of consensus within Congress, underscoring the importance of not just having good ideas but having the political will and bipartisan cooperation to see those ideas through.

Similarly, some commissions are formed to create the illusion of action without any genuine intention to make changes. This is similar to how Congress sometimes requires a study of a particular problem instead of addressing the problem itself. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's Georgians First Commission made thoughtful recommendations on how to reduce regulatory burdens in the state, yet they remain unimplemented. This suggests the creation of the commission was more of a political maneuver than a substantive effort to reform government bureaucracy.

To be effective, therefore, Trump and Musk's proposed commission should seek to avoid these pitfalls and instead build upon models that have yielded tangible results. One example comes from New Jersey under former Governor Chris Christie. During Christie's tenure, New Jersey created the Red Tape Review Commission. The commission was proactive, met regularly, and included members from different political backgrounds and sectors.

The New Jersey commission also produced regular reporting, which was impactful in part because it included powerful stories illustrating how problematic regulations were interfering with the daily lives of people. These were stories of business owners, workers, and residents struggling to jump through government-created hoops in their efforts to improve their stations in life. The commission's recommendations were acted upon multiple times by the legislature. Although an effort to make the commission permanent ultimately failed, it had broad support, with only one opposing vote in the legislature. The failure was due to Governor Phil Murphy's veto and his reluctance to hand a political win to former Governor Christie.

Trump and Christie may have their differences, but regulatory reform could be an area of productive collaboration. It might even make sense for Trump to consider involving Christie in the proposed commission.

A key challenge for any efficiency commission is that it inherently lacks enforcement power. It can make recommendations, but it cannot compel anyone to act. This is why commissions are easy to ignore, particularly in the face of competing interests within government. Federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency or the Securities and Exchange Commission operate independently and have their own priorities. Even if a commission led by Musk were to identify a regulatory problem, there is little reason to believe agency heads would prioritize it. Most prefer to spend time cementing their legacies with new initiatives, rather than revisiting the work of their predecessors.

The effectiveness of such a commission will also depend on its ability to produce recommendations that are driven by consensus and backed by evidence. This is why a bipartisan makeup is important. Musk may ultimately lead the commission, but it should include representatives and stakeholders from both major parties. Without bipartisan participation, any recommendations risk being dismissed as political -- by Congress, by agency staff, and even in some cases by members of Trump's own cabinet. A broad coalition of support will help guarantee that recommendations are seen as pragmatic and in the public interest.

Like in New Jersey, the commission should produce regular reports -- annually, if not more often -- identifying programs and regulations in need of reform. It should engage with nonpartisan offices like the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office to collect data and ideas. Academic research should be gathered and summarized, ensuring that recommendations are well-supported by empirical evidence. The more rigorous and transparent the commission's work, the harder it will be for its findings to be ignored.

The proposed commission should also work in tandem with other regulatory reform mechanisms, such as a regulatory budget and reduction goals -- both of which were features of Trump's first term. Setting a regulatory budget limits the total cost that regulations can impose on the economy, forcing agencies to prioritize eliminating outdated and inefficient regulations rather than adding new rules to the pile. A regulatory reduction goal similarly incentivizes agencies toward achieving a desired outcome. A goal of, say, cutting the Code of Federal Regulations by 25,000 pages or reducing annual compliance and paperwork costs by $200 billion, is realistic and actionable, and would give the commission an idea of its intended purpose.

In Trump's first term, his administration also appointed ""deregulation officers"" within agencies. These were people whose role was to make sure that the regulatory reduction agenda was being implemented. Individuals who are empowered within agencies to advocate for reform from the inside could be powerful allies to an efficiency commission. Their roles should be reinstated to complement the work of the commission.

The idea of an efficiency commission, particularly one led by Elon Musk, is an exciting prospect, but it must be implemented wisely. It has to be more than just a symbolic gesture. Every recommendation should be backed by evidence and presented in a nonpartisan light, forming part of a comprehensive plan to streamline the federal bureaucracy and foster greater accountability in government. A government efficiency commission is a good idea, but how it gets set up matters."
'The View' co-host to lead anti-Trump event in Pennsylvania,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/the-view-co-host-lead-anti-trump-event-pennsylvania,2024-10-04T13:50:22Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former Trump staffer and ""The View"" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin will join former GOP lawmaker Liz Cheney and other anti-Trump Republicans for an event in Pennsylvania next week warning of the dangers of re-electing former President Donald Trump.

Former Trump administration staffer Cassidy Hutchison - who testified against her former boss in the Jan. 6 Committee hearings - as well as Trump's former deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews will be part of the event that is meant to help deliver the swing state to Vice President Kamala Harris in November.

The panel will ""offer a warning about the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy and the rule of law,"" a source connected to the event recently told CNN.

WORKING CLASS WILL COME HOME TO HARRIS, RALLYGOERS IN POSTINDUSTRIAL PENNSYLVANIANS SAY

The aim of the chat is to convince voters of ""the need for independents, moderates, and Republicans to stop him from getting back in office,"" the source added.

The women-led program will be hosted by liberal super-PAC Democracy First in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania on Oct. 9, and is reportedly the first of many that will feature the four women speaking to voters in multiple battleground states.

Cheney, Hutchison, and Matthews have endorsed Harris for president. Griffin has not, though the media personality is a staunch critic of Trump on ""The View"" and in her role as a CNN political commentator.

The event comes as Trump and Harris are neck and neck in battleground states, with the race being especially close in Pennsylvania.

'ABUSE OF POWER': HOUSE GOP OPENS PROBE INTO UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

Recent Fox News polling in Pennsylvania finds Harris only two points ahead of Trump among registered voters in the state, while they are tied at 49% among likely voters.

""Pennsylvania is not breaking open and shouldn't be expected to,"" says Democratic Pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News surveys alongside Republican Daron Shaw. ""Both candidates have a little way to go to consolidate their bases and whoever does a better job there could determine who wins the state.""

According to the survey, the economy is the top issue for Pennsylvanians, with 71% of voters having a negative view of it. Trump has a six-point advantage over Harris on the issue, while she is viewed far more favorably on abortion.

Port strike longshoremen union boss linked to murdered mobster in 'farce' racketeering case he beat at trial,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/port-strike-longshoremen-union-boss-linked-murdered-mobster-farce-racketeering-case-he-beat-at-trial,2024-10-04T13:40:45Z,"FOX Business' Cheryl Casone previews the September jobs report, break downs the tentative agreement with the International Longshoremen's Association and discusses the hold on Biden's student loan forgiveness plan.

Harold Daggett, the president of the International Longshoremen's Association, which went on a brief strike this week in a labor dispute that could have created a shipping crisis across the U.S., was once cleared of federal racketeering charges in connection with alleged mafia ties to the same union.

Daggett's attorney, his cousin George Daggett, said the 2005 charges were politically motivated and based on weak evidence.

""This trial was a farce,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""People say to me, 'You did a great job.' And I tell them a law school student could've won that case. It was actually generated by the Waterfront Commission in New York, and they hated the union.""

The Justice Department failed to convict - but the case had deadly results. One of the co-defendants, a reputed Genovese family captain named Larry Ricci, disappeared mid-trial and was later found dead in the trunk of a car outside the Huck Finn Diner in Union, New Jersey, 20 miles west of New York City.

DOCKWORKERS' UNION REACHES TENTATIVE AGREEMENT, WILL SUSPEND PORT STRIKE UNTIL JANUARY

""He's either been abducted -- that is unlikely because he'd be far too difficult a person to keep hostage -- or killed,"" Ricci's attorney Martin Schmukler told the court after he vanished mid-trial, The Associated Press reported at the time. He was later acquitted in absentia.

The commission, at the time a joint oversight operation between the states of New York and New Jersey, pressured federal prosecutors to bring charges it couldn't prove, George Daggett told Fox News Digital.

This trial was a farce. People say to me, 'You did a great job.' And I tell them a law school student could've won that case. It was actually generated by the Waterfront Commission in New York, and they hated the union.

-- George Daggett, cousin and lawyer of ILA President Harold Daggett

Harold Daggett denied the criminal accusations and said he was a victim of mob extortion. He testified that another mobster, George Barone, put a gun to his head and threatened to massacre his family.

MOBSTERS CHARGED IN INTERNATIONAL PLOT TO CONTROL NEW YORK GARBAGE TRUCK INDUSTRY

""I was so nervous, I urinated all over myself,"" he testified at the time, according to a New York Post report. In a separate deposition, he denied knowing Barone was a Genovese ""soldier,"" court documents show.

Prosecutors had alleged that Daggett had ties to the Genovese crime family as far back as 2000, and the union has long been accused of handing no-show jobs to mobsters' relatives and providing kickbacks.

In exchange for union contracts, the mob was supposed to protect the careers and salaries of corrupt ILA officials, prosecutors alleged.

UNION LEADER SLAMS 'MONEY CRAZY' SHIPPING COMPANIES FOR REFUSING TO 'SHARE' 'BILLIONS' EARNED DURING PANDEMIC

The Justice Department couldn't convince jurors that the defendants were guilty of a crime.

George Daggett, the attorney, said the case began after his cousin asked a Catholic priest for financial advice and had $18 million in union funds placed under the supervision of the same money manager who worked with Our Lady of the Lake Church in Sparta, New Jersey.

""So at the trial, every time a mobster's name was mentioned, the government had a big board, and they made a circle, [and] every time a mobster was mentioned, they put his picture up on this big board,"" he said. ""The government's case ended, and I took Father Cassidy's picture and I put it in the middle of all those mobsters. So that's the kind of trial it was.""

Although the case had to do with allegations of extortion and interference with commerce, prosecutors asked their first witness how many people he'd killed, Daggett said.

""You knew for the government it was all downhill after that,"" he said.

After Ricci's disappearance, his attorney continued to work on his behalf at trial and clear his name.

DESANTIS TAKES MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS AS 'UNACCEPTABLE' STRIKE THREATENS PRODUCT SUPPLY

""What happened was it was not a good fact-pattern for the government, but the Waterfront Commission was pushing so hard that the eastern district said OK,"" Daggett told Fox News Digital. ""Larry Ricci lost his life because, I guess, people thought that everybody was going to be guilty. There was no way [the verdict] could've been guilty.""

Another co-defendant, Albert Cernadas pleaded guilty, but jurors went on to find Daggett, Ricci and Arthur Coffey, another ILA executive, not guilty at trial.

No one has been charged with Riccis' death, although federal prosecutors said they overheard on wiretaps a New Jersey mobster discussing the retrieval of the murder weapon with his son. That man, Michael Coppola, was sent to prison in another RICO case, which involved ILA kickbacks, identity fraud and the 1977 murder of a man named John ""Johnny Cokes"" Lardiere.

Prosecutors have also hinted that Ricci's murder opened a path for other suspected mobsters to corruptly profit off of the ILA, according to court documents.

Harold Daggett became the union's president in 2011. He has been purported to drive a yacht and a luxe Bentley car, live in a sprawling mansion in Sparta, New Jersey, and brought home more than $900,000 in union pay last year - $728,000 for being union president, and another $173,000 for his past role in local 1804-1, which he left in 2011, FOX Business reported.

The ILA, which represents dock workers on the East and Gulf Coasts, went on strike this week in a dispute over what the union calls unfair pay against a backdrop of steep inflation, a rising minimum wage that has outpaced union raises, and the threat of losing human jobs to automation.

The union was demanding concessions from the U.S. Maritime Alliance, or USMX, before the sides reached a deal late Thursday.

The ILA, which represents 45,000 U.S. workers at ports along the East and Gulf Coasts, said the sides reached a provisional wage agreement that extends the current contract until Jan. 15, 2025.

""Things were rough back then [in 1977, when] we went on strike for 80 cents,"" Harold Daggett told FOX Business Tuesday. ""The companies only made like $5 to 10 million, but since COVID and before COVID 'til now, they're making billions and billions of dollars. It's a whole different story, but they don't want to share it. They'd rather see a fully automated terminal right here on the East Coast so they can make more money. They're money crazy.""

The strike could have crippled the U.S. supply chain and cost the country's economy more than $4. billion a day, according to one JPMorgan analysis."
Great news on job growth strengthens Dems' pre-election pitch,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jobs-job-growth-democrats-biden-harris-economy-election-2024-rcna174006,2024-10-04T13:28:30Z,"As Election Day 2024 approaches, Republicans desperately want voters to believe the economy is terrible. Reality keeps getting in the way.

Expectations heading into this week showed projections of about 150,000 new jobs having been added in the United States in September. As it turns out, according to the new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job market fared quite a bit better than that. NBC News reported:

In addition to the encouraging top-line data, the same Labor Department report showed that wage growth continued to outpace inflation.

This is not the final jobs report before Election Day -- that will be released the morning of Nov. 1, five days before voters go to the polls -- but the new data will help drive the public conversation about the economy in the race's final weeks.

The encouraging job numbers also come the week after a surprisingly good report on U.S. economic growth, which led White House National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard to note in a written statement, ""We learned this morning that the economy has grown by 3.2% per year during Biden-Harris Administration -- even stronger than previously estimated -- and better than the first three years of the previous administration.""

As the 2024 election cycle nears its end, Republicans desperately want voters to believe the economy is terrible. Reality, however, keeps getting in the way of GOP talking points.

Let's also circle back to previous coverage to put the data in perspective. Over the course of the first three years of Donald Trump's presidency -- when the Republican said the U.S. economy was the greatest in the history of the planet -- the economy created roughly 6.38 million jobs, spanning all of 2017, 2018, and 2019.

According to the latest tally, the U.S. economy has created over 16.5 million jobs since January 2021 -- more than double the combined total of Trump's first three years. (If we include the fourth year of the Republican's term, the data looks even worse for him.)

For some additional context, consider job growth by year over the past decade, updated to reflect the latest data revisions:"
Is It A Goldilocks Economy?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/04/is-it-a-goldilocks-economy/,2024-10-04T13:06:32Z,"Temporary Strike Resolution Offers Short-Term Relief For Impacted Industries

Stocks were relatively quiet on Thursday as markets awaited this morning's employment situation report. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite was flat. Small cap stocks were the biggest movers for the day, falling over 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%.

This morning, the Labor Department released the latest employment report. Forecasts were calling for 147 thousand new jobs and an unchanged unemployment rate of 4.2%. The actual numbers were 254 thousand new jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. We also saw upward revisions for both July and August, suggesting the economy continues to show strength. We'll get the latest Consumer Price Index late next week and a chance to see if prices are continuing on their trajectory of moderating. Thus far though, the net effect of recent data implies an economy continuing on target for a soft landing. However, there is one potential caveat to that, oil.

On Thursday, oil was up over 5% as the world awaits Israel's response to Iran's missile attack earlier in the week. For the week, crude oil prices are up nearly 10% and that is something with the potential to upset the progress made vis-a-vis inflation. If there is one commodity that has the potential to jumpstart inflation, it is oil. Therefore, in addition to both the humanitarian and geopolitical repercussions, there is the potential for economic upheaval as well. The 200-day moving average for crude oil is right around $75 and that is a level I'll be watching. A close above that could be bullish for those who are long but bearish for inflation.

The other big story on Thursday was the temporary end to the strike at ports along the East Coast. Employers offered workers a pay increase of 62% spread out over six years. The International Longshoremen's Association and port operators said this agreement will last until late January as the two sides work on a long-term deal. One of the main sticking points in the negotiations is automation and how that will impact jobs. Seeing as how the strike lasted just three days, any economic impact was likely muted. However, this is an issue we may hear about again come early next year. In the meantime, we're seeing some of the companies that could have been negatively impacted by a prolonged strike trading higher in premarket activity. Shares of Walmart are up 0.5% along with Target, which is trading higher by nearly 1%.

For today, I'm keeping an eye on how the jobs data report is spun and oil. The market's initial reaction to the jobs number has been bullish. Index futures jumped when the report was released. Heading into this morning's report, sentiment was largely in the camp that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by a quarter point when they meet in November. Expectations for that quarter point cut were relatively unchanged after the employment number was released. One other thing I'll be watching today is the VIX. Last Friday, volatility increased right near the end of the day. I believe that was largely due to the situation in the Middle East and investor concern about the potential for increased hostilities over the weekend. Given the state of affairs as of Friday morning, I would not be surprised if we saw a similar situation today. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."
The Latest Employment Numbers And The Presidential Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2024/10/04/the-latest-employment-numbers-and-the-presidential-election/,2024-10-04T12:44:31Z,"The Employment Situation Report for the month of September was released this morning. It showed what everyone expected: very little change in the unemployment rate. At 4.1%, it was actually slightly lower than that for August (4.2%). One open question was the impact of Hurricane Francine on jobs, but ""Our analysis suggests that Hurricane Francine had no discernible effect on national payroll employment, hours, and earnings from the establishment survey, or the national unemployment rate from the household survey.""

As important as these releases are in normal times, they take on extra significance in the lead up to an election. In fact, experts claim that the economy is particularly important to voters this year. It has consequently been a running theme for both parties, with Democrats focusing on low unemployment and robust growth and Republicans on the recent spike in inflation.

What's curious about this campaign is the fact that the Democrats are having to scramble to defend themselves. You'd think that theirs was the high ground given that:

Meanwhile, though it is true that inflation accelerated temporarily, there is little question that this was related to factors outside of the US and has calmed down considerably.

Despite this, however, voters have a very dim -- and flawed -- view of the state of the economy:

""Nearly everything Americans believe about the economy is wrong, according to a recent Harris-Guardian poll...The poll, conducted earlier this month, found that perceptions of the U.S. economy are often at odds with reality. For instance, most Americans (55 percent) think the economy is shrinking, with about the same share saying we're in a recession.""

Unfortunately for the Democrats, perceptions are more important than reality in situations like this.

There are three more key indicator announcements before the November 5th election:

If any of these is out of line with what we have been experiencing of late, it could have an impact on voters.

That said, economists do not expect any significant deviation from our current low unemployment, solid GDP growth, and moderating inflation. Even if the dockworkers' strike (now resolved) and recent flooding were to raise prices, the October 10 CPI announcement only covers September. It simply wouldn't show up yet.

What this suggests is that the releases will include very little new information and both parties will simply recycle their earlier talking points. If the outcome is going to be affected by the state of the economy, it is going to be because one party did a better job of spinning than the other.

Federal Trade Commission Sues Big 3 Pharmaceutical Benefit Managers,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/aldenabbott/2024/10/04/federal-trade-commission-sues-big-3-pharmaceutical-benefit-managers/,2024-10-04T12:44:27Z,"My Forbes commentary published yesterday highlighted a July 2024 Federal Trade Commission interim staff report critical of pharmaceutical benefit managers, ""middlemen"" firms that specialize in negotiating with drug makers for rebates on the list prices of drugs. I explained that the interim report's analysis is at odds with economic research that delineates the substantial economic benefits of the PBM system.

This commentary turns to an assessment of a September 2024 FTC lawsuit against the three major PBMs. The lawsuit is weak and economically problematic.

Background On The Lawsuit

In a September 20 press release, the FTC announced a legal challenge to the practices of the ""big 3"" PBMs:

""Today, the Federal Trade Commission brought action against the three largest prescription drug benefit managers (PBMs) -- Caremark Rx, Express Scripts (ESI), and OptumRx -- and their affiliated group purchasing organizations (GPOs) for engaging in anticompetitive and unfair rebating practices that have artificially inflated the list price of insulin drugs, impaired patients' access to lower list price products, and shifted the cost of high insulin list prices to vulnerable patients.""

In a nutshell, the FTC claimed that the ""big 3"" PBMs' rebate practices caused a 1,200% rise in the price of Humalog, a brand-new Eli Lilly insulin medication, between 1999 and 2017. These actions allegedly were illegal ""unfair methods of competition"" (an antitrust-type of concern) and ""unfair acts or practices"" (a consumer protection type of concern) that violated Section 5 of the FTC Act.

The FTC's legal complaint in this case will be heard by an in-house FTC administrative law judge, whose initial findings can be reviewed by the FTC. The FTC's decision, if history is a guide, will almost certainly uphold the legal complaint. The FTC's holding can and most likely will be appealed to a federal U.S. Court of Appeals.

The FTC's Case Is Weak As A Legal Matter

The Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts, which forbid monopolization and anticompetitive agreements among firms, do not apply. No single big PBM (the big 3 together have 80% of the PBM market) is a monopolist, and no anticompetitive agreements by the big PBMs are alleged by the FTC.

Admittedly, courts have stated that the FTC Act Section 5 prohibition against ""unfair methods of competition"" goes a bit beyond the Sherman and Clayton Acts. Nevertheless, it is doubtful that merely favoring higher-priced formulary drugs over lower-priced ones - which lies at the heart of the PBM case - would be viewed as a form of problematic competition on review by federal judges. (There are no federal court holdings that would support such a result.)

The FTC also alleges that the PBMs are committing ""unfair acts or practices"" in violation of Section 5 by keeping lower-priced insulin drugs off their formularies and by targeting those consumers who must face high unrebated list prices for certain insulin products.

But Section 5(n) of the FTC Act specifies that the ""unfair acts"" prohibition is only triggered if harm to consumers is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. The PBMs would have a strong argument that the procompetitive benefits of the formulary system, summarized in yesterday's commentary, do indeed outweigh the harm to certain insulin consumers.

The FTC's Remedy Is Economically Harmful

Finally, the FTC's suggested remedy for the violations it alleges strikes at the heart of the PBM rebate system. Specifically, the FTC would prevent the big PBMs from accepting rebates based on a particular price benchmark. It would micromanage the PBMs' decisions as to the drugs included on a formulary. And it would prevent PBMs from basing patients' deductibles or coinsurance on a drug's list price, rather than its net cost after rebates.

The FTC's remedy would substitute government regulation for PBM decision-making. It would thereby wreak havoc with a system that has bestowed enormous benefits on the American economy. Consumers as well as businesses would likely be the long-term losers.

The FTC Should Drop The PBM Lawsuit

The FTC should vote to withdraw from administrative litigation its complaint against the major PBMs. That complaint is fraught with major legal weaknesses. Most importantly, it poses a threat to the economically beneficial PBM model.

There is, admittedly, legitimate reason to be concerned about the excessive cost of the U.S. health care system and, in particular, high drug prices to consumers. Government should, however, seek to address this problem through economically efficient measures that do not distort markets.

Comprehensive procompetitive regulatory reform of the American health care system would be a good step forward. Moreover, specific remedies, such as targeted payments to poorer drug consumers, may warrant consideration.

But a bureaucratically-led legal attack on welfare-enhancing PBMs should be avoided at all costs."
Bruce Springsteen endorses Kamala Harris in new Instagram video: 'Vision of America',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/bruce-springsteen-endorses-kamala-harris-new-instagram-video-vision-america,2024-10-04T11:39:42Z,"Bruce Springsteen announced he would be voting for Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz in November for ""one of the most consequential elections in our nation's history.""

""Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually, and emotionally divided as it does then at this moment. It doesn't have to be this way,"" Springsteen said in an Instagram video Thursday. ""The common values, the shared stories that make us a great and united nation are waiting to be rediscovered and retold once again. Now that will take time, hard work, intelligence, faith and women and men with the national good, guiding their hearts.""

The ""Born in the USA"" singer attacked former President Trump as ""the most dangerous candidate for President in my lifetime"" with a ""disdain for the sanctity of our constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law, and the sanctity of the peaceful transfer of power.""

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, BARACK OBAMA LAUNCH PODCAST TOGETHER

""On the other hand, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are committed to a vision of this country that respects and includes everyone regardless of class, religion, race, your political point of view or sexual identity, and they want to grow our economy in a way that benefits all, not just the few like me on top. That's the vision of America I've been consistently writing about for 55 years now,"" Springsteen said.

Springsteen acknowledged ""everybody sees things different"" and that he respects other choices but stood by his.

""That's why come November 5th, I'll be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,"" he closed.

He joined several other singers such as Taylor Swift who have publicly supported Harris ahead of the November election.

Springsteen has been openly supportive of Democratic candidates in the past and frequently attacked Trump.

In 2020, he said, ""I believe that our current president is a threat to our democracy. He simply makes any kind of reform that much harder. I don't know if our democracy could stand another four years of his custodianship.""

Springsteen later provided a voiceover as well as his song ""My Hometown"" for a pro-Joe Biden ad.

""We are rudderless and joyless. We have lost the cultural aspects of society that make America great. We have lost our mojo, our fun, our happiness, our cheering on of others,"" Springsteen said in the 2020 ad. ""The shared experience of humanity that makes it all worth it. The challenges and the triumph that we shared and celebrated. The unique can-do spirit that America has always been known for. We are lost. We've lost so much in so short a time.

"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: October 4, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-10-04-24/,2024-10-04T10:36:58Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are going down. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can park some cash? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are infamous for paying paltry interest rates. But if you know where to look, you can find rates 10x higher. Several online banks and credit unions pay rates that are far more competitive than those offered by brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you score a basic savings account with a rate in that general area, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield also was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.23%, Curinos says. APY, or annual percentage yield, shows the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts often pay substantially higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the thing to know is you may have to meet tough requirements set by the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.89%. You'll be in good shape if you can get an account offering a rate close to 4.89%. Last week at this time, the best rate was 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's about the same as last week's APY.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

That's tough to say -- it depends on the path of inflation and the overall economy.

The highest interest rates in recent history were seen in the early 1980s when the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to over 19%. That was in response to record-breaking inflation that had prices rising at a rate of over 14% annually.

In the early 1980s, the average five-year CD paid almost 12%, compared to less than 2% today, according to Bankrate data. Savings rates eventually fell as inflation cooled and the federal funds rate was brought back down.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."

Democrats Mobilize Crypto Voters To Counter Trump's Bitcoin Appeal,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2024/10/04/democrats-mobilize-crypto-voters-to-counter-trumps-bitcoin-appeal/,2024-10-04T10:05:16Z,"As the 2024 election approaches, cryptocurrency is no longer a fringe topic. Once dismissed as a niche concern, crypto asset and blockchain policy has rocketed to the forefront for millions of Americans who recognize the critical role of crypto in driving future economic growth and innovation. This shift underscores a broader divide among voters, particularly within the crypto space, with some leaning towards the Democratic Party, while others rally behind former President Donald Trump, positioning him as the so-called ""champion"" of their bitcoin holdings. In response, Suite View PAC has launched Crypto Rides, a direct effort to mobilize Democratic-leaning pro-crypto voters in a way that counters the GOP's bitcoin-only voter narrative.

Crypto Rides represents a dynamic example of how Democrat-leaning voters for this election are reclaiming crypto support by focusing on balanced and responsible regulation. Offering Uber ride vouchers to pro-crypto, pro-tech voters in New York, this initiative seeks to boost turnout for those committed to advancing thoughtful, nuanced oversight of digital assets -- especially in stark contrast to the ""bitcoin maximalism"" embraced by Trump's base.

The Rise Of The Single-Issue Bitcoin Voter

Trump's transformation from bitcoin skeptic to crypto advocate has been one of the most notable shifts in his political stance as he vies for the presidency in 2024. Once dismissive of bitcoin -- calling it a ""scam"" in 2021 -- Trump now positions himself as a champion of cryptocurrency, promising to turn the U.S. into the ""crypto capital of the world."" His pledges to dismantle the Biden administration's war on crypto, and his purchase of a meal with bitcoin, has endeared him to a growing segment of bitcoin maximalists and crypto entrepreneurs who see his return to office as a potential boon for deregulating the industry.

The allure of Trump's pro-bitcoin stance is hard to ignore for many in the crypto community. Despite what some described as his ill-timed and questionable DeFi project for accredited investors, Trump has attracted millions of dollars in donations from crypto founders and investors, and his promise to make bitcoin a centerpiece of his economic policy has galvanized a bloc of voters solely focused on this issue. However, while Trump's campaign may appeal to single-issue bitcoin voters, a broader group of Democratic and independent crypto enthusiasts are concerned about what his broader policies under Agenda 47 (based on Project 2025) could mean for the industry's future stability and inclusivity.

The Democratic Crypto Agenda: More Than Bitcoin

While Trump courts the bitcoin vote, many Democrats are focusing on a more nuanced approach to crypto regulation. Rather than pushing for the wholesale deregulation of digital assets, Democratic crypto voters are calling for policies that balance innovation with consumer protection, financial inclusion, and economic equity.

This difference in approach was highlighted in a recent letter sent to Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign by leaders in the Web3 and DeFi communities. Industry stalwarts like Olayinka Odeniran, Founder and Chairwoman of Black Women Blockchain Council, emphasized the importance of ensuring that Black, Latino, AAPI, and Indigenous communities -- early adopters of cryptocurrency -- are included the regulatory conversation. She, and other diverse Web3 and DeFi leaders, advocated for policies that foster capital formation and financial access for these groups, while also protecting consumers from fraud and ensuring transparency in the industry. For these voters, the stakes are high -- not just for bitcoin's survival but for the entire ecosystem of emerging technologies that could reshape the global economy to be as inclusive and democratizing as its promise, and as articulated in Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper. And according to a recent Morning Star poll, crypto voters are evenly divided.

Resetting The Democratic Stance On Digital Assets

In addition to voter mobilization efforts like Crypto Rides, the Crypto4Harris initiative has emerged as a key movement aiming to reshape the Democratic Party's stance on digital assets. This group of cryptocurrency advocates, which includes high-profile figures like Mark Cuban, Anthony Scaramucci, and Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA), is rallying behind Harris's campaign with a clear agenda: influence future regulatory direction for the crypto industry.

One of the most notable developments within the Crypto4Harris group is the backing of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who participated in a virtual rally hosted by the initiative. Schumer expressed strong support for pushing through crypto legislation this year, warning that if the U.S. does not take a proactive approach to regulate digital assets, the industry could move overseas. Schumer's involvement indicates that key Democratic leaders are becoming increasingly receptive to the crypto community's concerns.

Additionally, Jonathan Padilla, CEO of Snickerdoodle Labs and a leading organizer for Crypto4Harris, confirmed that the group has been in early discussions with the Harris campaign, aiming to shape policy and influence regulatory appointments. However, skepticism remains due to Harris's obvious connection to the current anti-crypto administration as the Vice President.

Despite the limited constitutional role of a Vice President to preside over the Senate, break ties in case of a 50/50 vote, to serve at the pleasure of the Chief Executive (the President), and to replace the President in times of crisis, vice presidents are inextricably linked to policies advanced during their time in office. Nonetheless, Harris has begun the challenging and nuanced task of separating herself from the current anti-crypto policies in favor of a pro-digital asset and blockchain stance in alignment with her Opportunity Economy policies to bolster the middle and working classes. She even went so far as to be the first Democratic presidential candidate to publicly declare support for pro-digital asset innovation and reasonable regulations, a stark contrast from Biden's approach.

If the Crypto4Harris movement succeeds in resetting the Democratic Party's stance on digital assets, it could lead to increased investment and innovation in the U.S. digital assets industry and broader Web3 economy. However, the outcome may turn on how willing the Harris campaign is to engage with the ""proof of pivot"" demands of the crypto industry and push back against more stringent regulatory measures of the current administration.

Polling Data Shows Crypto's Growing Importance In The Election

New polling data from Consensys and HarrisX reveals just how much cryptocurrency has risen in importance as an election issue. Nearly 49% of U.S. voters now consider a candidate's stance on crypto to be ""important"" when deciding their vote. This is a massive shift from previous elections and highlights the increasing relevance of digital finance in shaping the political landscape.

The 2024 election is shaping up to be pivotal for the crypto community, with 92% of crypto holders planning to vote -- a striking statistic that makes them a demographic both parties are keen to win over. Yet, the crypto community is anything but monolithic. Recent data shows that 40% of respondents favor the GOP's stance on crypto, while 38% align more with Democrats. This split highlights an opportunity for Democrats and independents to connect with voters who, while perhaps skeptical of the GOP's bitcoin maximalist approach, are seeking a more balanced and inclusive regulatory framework.

Swing States: Crypto as a Deciding Factor

Swing states could very well be where the crypto vote makes the most significant impact. A poll by DCG and The Harris Poll reveals that 26% of voters in these crucial states are actively considering candidates' positions on digital assets when deciding whom to support. With crypto emerging as a key issue in these battlegrounds, initiatives like Crypto Rides are essential in rallying Democratic crypto supporters.

Crypto Rides: Mobilizing the Democratic Crypto Vote

This is where Crypto Rides enters the fray as a direct counter to the GOP's single-issue bitcoin voter. By offering Uber ride vouchers to pro-crypto, Democratic-leaning voters in New York, Crypto Rides ensures that voices advocating for innovation, consumer protection, and financial equity are heard at the polls. ""Crypto Rides isn't just about turnout,"" says founder Will Schweitzer, ""it's about turning out the right votes."" While Trump may have rallied a faction of the crypto community around bitcoin, Schweitzer emphasizes that initiatives like Crypto Rides focus on a more inclusive and responsible approach to digital finance.

The Importance Of Down-Ballot Voting

Though much of the spotlight is on the presidential race, it's crucial to recognize that lasting regulatory reform comes from Congress. Lawmakers across the country will be pivotal in shaping the future legal framework for digital assets, whether in a swing issue or one with a clear party leaning. Initiatives like Crypto Rides remind voters that real change happens up and down the ballot, ensuring that representatives pushing for smart crypto regulation are elected to Congress.

As we approach November 5th, the race for the crypto vote is intensifying. Trump may have energized the bitcoin vote, but Democrats, independents, and never-Trump voters are expanding the tent and the conversation with initiatives like Crypto Rides and Crypto4Harris. The outcome of this election will undoubtedly have lasting implications for the future of digital assets. Whether through ride vouchers, grassroots efforts, legislation or shaping regulatory appointments, the Democratic crypto vote is making its presence felt -- and it could well tip the balance of power in Washington."
Headwinds For Li Auto Despite Strong Deliveries,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/04/headwinds-for-li-auto-despite-strong-deliveries/,2024-10-04T10:05:12Z,"Li Auto, the largest of the emerging EV players in China, delivered a record 53,709 vehicles for September 2024 - an increase of 49% percent year-over-year. Sales also expanded by about 11.6% compared to August. Li's total deliveries year to date stand at about 341,812 vehicles, an increase of 40% compared to last year. Li's performance for the quarter was also better than its rival XPeng which delivered 21,352 EVs in September, a 39% year-over-year growth. Although Li Auto didn't break down the key drivers of its growth, it's likely that the Li L6, the most affordable model in the company's lineup, had a big part to play. The vehicle has gained popularity among younger consumers. The vehicle, which was launched in April, is priced at about RMB 250,000 (about $34,500). Li also lowered prices for several of its models a few months ago and this has also likely helped support sales to an extent.

Now despite the strong growth. Li Auto stock remains down by about 31% year-to-date. There have been a couple of headwinds for Li Auto. While the company's Q2 2024 results, published a little over a month ago, were better than expected, Li's profitability and average selling prices per vehicle are seeing some pressure due to mounting competition. The Chinese EV market is crowded, with over 100 brands competing in the space. Li is also likely seeing a lower mix of premium EV model sales (such as the Li L7, Li L8, and Li L9) and a higher mix of the low-priced L6 model. Li has seen its average selling prices decline by about 13% year-over-year to about RMB 280,000 during the most recent quarter. Li Auto's gross margin stood at 19.5% in Q2, down from 21.8% in the year-ago quarter. Separately, China's economic growth has been weak due to a downturn in the real estate market and a slow rebound from stringent Covid-19 lockdowns that ended over a year ago. Consumer spending and domestic consumption also remain weak in China. However, the government recently announced a stimulus plan, which includes lowering interest rates and fiscal support and this could help consumer spending.

Now, the decrease in LI stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -36% in 2022, and 83% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that LI underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could LI face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?

Despite concerns about the economy and weakness in the global EV market, the Chinese EV space is still showing promise. With China offering incentives to consumers who replace their gasoline cars with electric and low-emission vehicles, the mix of new energy vehicle sales has jumped to about 50% of overall automotive sales. Moreover, there has also been a premiumization trend in the Chinese EV market, with cars costing upward of $30,000 accounting for a growing mix of sales at the expense of lower-end EVs. This could play in Li Auto's favor, as it competes primarily in the premium end of the electric vehicle market. Overall, Li says that it has about 17% of the market share in the premium EV segment, for vehicles priced over RMB200,000 ($28,500), making it the leader among premium Chinese EV brands.

Li's valuation is also fair, with the stock trading at just under $26 per share - a little over 15x estimated 2024 earnings and roughly 11x 2025 earnings, which is not very expensive considering that the company's revenues are projected to grow by over 15% this year and by over 35% next year per consensus estimates.

The October surprise: Harris is navigating a pair of them,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5137967/kamala-harris-hurricane-israel-iran-october-surprise,2024-10-04T09:09:19Z,"Vice President Harris hands out food to people at the Henry Brigham Community Center in Augusta, Ga., on Oct. 2, during a tour of hurricane damage in the area. Brendan Smialowski/AFP hide caption

With only a month left until Election Day, Vice President Harris is navigating a pair of external challenges in the month of October that pose risk to her campaign.

At home, there's the recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Helene -- including in the vital swing states of North Carolina and Georgia. And abroad, there's the real risk of escalating conflict in the Middle East.

The twin crises present a unique challenge for the Biden administration and, by extension, Harris -- who is a key part of that team. So her campaign and the White House are pulling out the stops to try to show voters they're on top of things, even as Harris pushes ahead on the campaign trail.

For Harris, there's the fear that these ""October surprises"" go sideways and she gets some blame. In a race this close, every vote matters.

But these kinds of high-profile crises also present an opportunity to demonstrate leadership, said Democratic political strategist Ian Russell.

""What she has to do, and what she is doing, is showing up and showing that she's engaged, showing that she's capable of stepping up to the challenges that the country and the world face and I think she's doing that very well,"" Russell said.

Harris took a break from the campaign on Wednesday to visit a Georgia neighborhood ravaged by Hurricane Helene where more than half of residents don't have power and many don't have running water.

""The president and I have been paying close attention from the beginning to what we need to do to make sure the federal resources hit the ground as quickly as possible,"" Harris said. ""That includes what was necessary to make sure that we provided direct federal assistance. And that work has been happening.""

President Biden also surveyed Asheville, N.C., where some of the most severe storm damage occurred, as he and Harris try to reassure voters in the critical state that their administration is up to the task. Harris' campaign has said she plans to tour storm damage in North Carolina soon, too.

Her opponent, former President Donald Trump, is slated to be it the state on Friday for a town hall.

The International Longshoremen's Association decision to go on strike on Tuesday had been another challenge for Harris, threatening to upend the economy heading into the election.

But on Thursday, the union dockworkers and port operators reached a tentative agreement on wages and agreed to extend their contract to Jan. 15. Harris and Biden had sided firmly with the union, and on Thursday Biden said both sides had acted ""patriotically"" to reopen the ports to ensure supplies were available for hurricane rebuilding efforts.

The Trump campaign is on the lookout for anything they can use against Harris in the closely contested race -- including the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

On Tuesday, Trump told his supporters that he was the person to take on Iran after it attacked Israel. ""We have a nonexistent president and a nonexistent vice president, who should be in charge, but nobody knows what's going on,"" Trump said.

Harris made sure to get out in front of cameras this week to reaffirm her support for Israel. ""As I have said, I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist militias,"" she said.

""And let us be clear: Iran is not only a threat to Israel; Iran is also a threat to American personnel in the region, American interests, and innocent civilians across the region who suffer at the hands of Iran-based and -backed terrorist proxies.""

How the White House, Harris and her campaign are able to navigate these ""October surprises"" is critical in a race this close, with only a month left.

""There's always going to be something that could go wrong at home or abroad,"" Russell said. ""And our leaders need to be able to step up and deliver while also being politicians."""
Disapproval mounts both at home and abroad as US avoids direct action against Houthi rebels,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/disapproval-mounts-home-abroad-us-avoids-direct-action-against-houthi-rebels,2024-10-04T08:09:52Z,"Fox News senior strategic analyst Ret. Gen. Jack Keane joins 'Fox Report' to discuss the escalating tensions in the Middle East amid fears of a wider war.

While much of the world has eyes on Israel's battles with Hezbollah and Hamas, the U.S. Navy has its sights set on another of Iran's proxies, the Yemeni Houthi rebels.

With a mission to keep international waterways at peace, the Navy now finds itself fending off attacks from the shadowy gang of pirates who have gone from arming themselves with assault rifles, pickup trucks and motorboats - to a seemingly unending supply of drones, missiles and other weaponry.

The Houthis often attack unarmed Western ships carrying goods through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden - while the U.S. has responded in kind with drone attacks on Yemen.

ISRAELI AIR FORCE STRIKES HOUTHI TARGETS IN YEMEN WITH 'EXTENSIVE' OPERATION

That's led to perilous waters along a trade route that typically sees some $1 trillion in goods pass through it, as well as shipments of aid to war-torn Sudan and the Yemeni people.

And as the attacks continue, some experts argue the U.S. response has not been strong enough to deter the Houthis from inflicting billions of dollars worth of damage to the global economy.

""The U.S. response has been ineffective,"" Can Kasapoglu, a Turkey-based Hudson Institute fellow who specializes in Middle East political-military affairs, told Fox News Digital.

""We have very limited intelligence about [the Houthis] and they are in a different part of the world, in a distant corner of the Middle East. But that corner also happens to be right next to a choke point on global trade... The Houthis are the most daring of the Iranian proxy network. And the U.S. has never gone into a preemptive phase where they target the Houthi leadership.""

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

The U.S. has responded to attacks with air and missile defense efforts, drone and missile interceptions - only engaging the Houthis once an attack is imminent, said Kasapoglu.

""We never saw a high-yield targeted killing campaign by the United States, for instance, Israel killed [Hezbollah leader] Hassan Nasrallah. Or just like Israel went after, for instance, the higher, high-level Iranian Revolutionary Guards generals, so this is what is missing - the U.S. acting against critical leadership.""

In addition to destroying goods destined for the West, the regular Houthi attacks drive up insurance costs: premiums for some shot up tenfold. They force some ships to travel the long way - down around the Horn of Africa, which can add $1 million in fuel costs for a round trip.

""They are launching relatively low-cost weapon systems, and inflicting major economic damage on the West on behalf of Iran. This is a very lucrative business,"" said Kasapoglu.

One argument for restraint could be the cost of action: Houthi drones are estimated to cost a few thousand dollars each. The Naval missiles the U.S. fires back at them can run around $2 million a shot.

Houthi attacks ramped up after Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel, targeting 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones over the past year.

They've seized one vessel and sunk two and killed a total of four sailors. A U.S.-led series of airstrikes in May killed at least 16 people, the rebels said.

BIDEN ADMIN NEEDS 'MORE AGGRESSIVE' PLAN TO TAKE ON HOUTHIS

On Tuesday, the rebel group claimed it shot down a multimillion-dollar, U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper drone flying near Yemen. The U.S. acknowledged losing one of the drones, which costs around $30 million apiece.

In January, the Iran-backed militias killed three U.S. service members and injured 40 others in an attack on a U.S. base in Jordan. The U.S. responded forcefully to that attack with a barrage of airstrikes on 85 targets across Iraq and Syria.

""That response proved to be effective, and I think that we could do more of that certainly - take that approach,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Schwartz, former security coordinator of the Israel-Palestinian Authority.

Since the Houthis seized the country's north and its capital of Sanaa in 2014, the U.S. military has seen Reapers shot down in Yemen in 2017, 2019, 2023 and 2024. The U.S. military acknowledged the Houthis shot down two MQ-9s in September.

The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel. In response, Israel Defense Forces launched aggressive retaliatory strikes in Yemen's key port city of Hodeida.

The rebels have maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel's campaign in Gaza against Hamas. But many of the ships they attack have little connection to the conflict - some were even bound for Iran.

BIDEN SAYS HE WOULD NOT BACK ISRAELI STRIKE ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR SITES

Last month, they attacked the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion, which was carrying 1 million barrels of oil in the Red Sea.

And last week, Houthi rebels fired half a dozen ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. All were intercepted by Navy destroyers, a U.S. official said Friday.

""This gets resolved when we finish our dealings with Iran, whatever that looks like in the long term,"" said Seth Krummrich, a retired Army colonel and former chief of staff at Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT).

Sources say the U.S. lacks a will to put boots on the ground to fight the Houthis. Central to the Biden administration's global strategy is a concern over escalating tensions that could lead to a full-scale confrontation with Iran - a nation that, by many estimates, is only weeks away from having the capability to build a nuclear bomb.

""The Israelis have the will to fight the Houthis, but they have limited capability, and they're also engaged with two wars going on right now, so it necessitates American intervention if the West really wants to stop them,"" said Kasapoglu.

US FORCES DESTROY HOUTHI WEAPONS

""Avoiding escalation is an obsession right now. It is a psychological case, not a political case. And it is imprisoning American military capabilities.""

Krummrich argued that the Pentagon ""has been staring at the Houthi problem long enough to understand that there is a limit to what you're going to be able to do without putting boots on the ground.""

""That would be like a giant sponge. It can absorb an endless amount of our resources,"" he said. ""But the Houthis are also smart. They launch and then retreat quickly... if they stay outside of our rules of engagement, they will be less likely to be struck.""

But others say there is more to be done that does not amount to ground forces.

""Yemen has proven time and time again that they're willing to absorb a lot of lethal activity from the U.S. and the coalition and still attack vessels, still attack Israel,"" said Schwartz.

""There's this fear of escalation, doing something that's so provocative that we're going to have a broader war. Yemen is at war with the United States from their perspective, right? Just like Lebanese Hezbollah is at war and has been with Israel, and the same with Hamas prior to Oct. 7.""

""We overestimate our concern in terms of a broadening conflict, because at the end of the day, the Houthis in particular, they're not a viable military force,"" Schwartz went on.

""We could be much more aggressive in terms of our military response to the Houthis and find an overwhelming response that falls well short of getting the U.S. mired in some type of major conflict."""
"New poll reveals Trump has significant lead on immigration, border security in key battleground state",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-poll-reveals-trump-significant-lead-immigration-border-security-key-battleground-state,2024-10-04T08:09:41Z,"Economist Steve Moore comments on the border crisis and illegal immigration on 'Fox Report.'

Former President Donald Trump holds a firm lead in a key state over Vice President Kamala Harris on the question of how to handle immigration -- as the border crisis remains a top issue for voters.

A new poll released this week from Marquette Law School finds Harris leading Trump overall in Wisconsin by 52-48%.

But when it comes to immigration and border security, Trump dominates. Of voters, 49% favor Trump while just 37% favor Harris, with 8% saying they'd be about the same, and 6% saying neither are good on the issue.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

Trump holds a similar 12 point lead on handling the war between Israel-Hamas, while Harris has an 11 point gap on handling Medicare & Social Security and a 17 point lead on abortion.

Of the issues polled, immigration was near the top of the issues, with 15% of voters saying it was their most important issue, the same number who said abortion, and only behind the economy -- which was top issue for 37% of voters.

The poll is the latest indicator that Harris still has a fair way to go in convincing some voters that she is the better candidate on a topic that has dominated the headlines and remains a top issue for voters. Wisconsin, along with states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona could be election deciders in the election on Nov 5.

Harris was put in charge of handling root causes of migration to the southern border in early 2021 as border numbers began to skyrocket. She was eventually dubbed the ""border czar"" by media outlets and critics -- although the White House rejected that title.

HARRIS SHIFTS KEY POSITIONS ON BORDER, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AS CAMPAIGN PROMISES 'PRAGMATIC' APPROACH

Republicans have hammered Harris on the border, saying it was the rolling back of Trump-era policies that led to the record numbers at the border. They have also pointed to her embrace of left-wing positions in her 2019 presidential bid. Since then, her campaign says her views have been shaped by the current administration, including on decriminalizing illegal crossings and closing immigration detention centers.

""Harris can never be forgiven for her erasing our border, and she must never be allowed to become president of the United States,"" Trump said in Wisconsin on Sunday.

Harris has sought to present herself as better situated to handle the border. Her campaign has noted a recent drop in border encounters since President Biden signed a presidential proclamation in June limiting asylum entries. She has also thrown her support behind a bipartisan border security bill that would place similar limits on asylum and provide additional funding and detention beds.

Conservatives said that the bill would enshrine high border numbers, but Harris accused Trump of blocking the bill for political purposes. She did so again on a trip to the southern border in Arizona last week.

""He picked up the phone and calls some friends in Congress and said, stop the bill. Because, you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem,"" she said. ""And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games."""
How To Transform Profit Into Purpose And Elevate Corporate Ethics,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/soulaimagourani/2024/10/03/how-to-transform-profit-into-purpose-and-elevate-corporate-ethics/,2024-10-04T01:40:23Z,"With the buzz from UNGA 24 still echoing in our ears, it's clear that the world is ready for a shake-up.

As headlines spotlight the urgent need for companies to step up on issues like sustainability and social responsibility, it's time for us leaders to rethink our game plans. Profit is great, but let's face it -- today's consumers are looking for more than just a bottom line. They want to connect with brands that stand for something meaningful. So, how do we shift gears from just chasing dollars to building a purpose-driven culture?

As the late Philip Windsor wisely stated, true progress lies not in mere tolerance but in active toleration -- embracing our differences as a source of strength. Now is the time for leaders to reflect on our collective narratives, engage in meaningful dialogue, and strive for a world where every individual's voice is heard and valued.

The question is no longer whether businesses should engage in corporate responsibility, but rather how we can integrate it into our core strategy.

For too long, many corporate structures have prioritized profits over ethical considerations, leading to alarming consequences for individuals and society at large.

In the U.S. alone, consumer debt has surged to a staggering $35 trillion. Many individuals find themselves ensnared in a cycle of financial hardship, exacerbated by the absence of protective regulations against predatory lending. This is not just a crisis of ethics; it's a crisis that undermines the very foundations of our economy.

As leaders, we must recognize that we cannot build sustainable businesses in a society riddled with suffering.

Companies that prioritize ethical practices, like Milton Hershey's unwavering commitment to fair wages and community development, serve as powerful reminders that social responsibility and financial success are not mutually exclusive.

As we contemplate our roles as leaders, we must empower our teams to connect their personal stories and values with our organizational mission. This alignment can catalyze transformative change within our companies and beyond.

Take inspiration from defenders in conflict zones who bravely work to bridge divides and foster understanding. Leaders can adopt similar principles by encouraging dialogue and collaboration within their organizations, nurturing an inclusive culture that values diverse perspectives.

Consider the United Arab Emirates, where over 50% of parliament members are women! This remarkable achievement not only empowers women but also exemplifies the profound impact that diverse leadership can have on shaping societal norms and driving sustainable progress.

As we engage in conversations about corporate responsibility, we cannot overlook the role of technology -- particularly artificial intelligence. While AI presents challenges, it also offers unprecedented opportunities to democratize access to information and empower individuals across the globe.

As we innovate, we must ensure that our technological advancements are rooted in human values, fostering a sense of community and cooperation. This approach is not just ethically sound; it's essential for building a resilient society that embraces diversity, tolerance, and coexistence.

Let us commit to rethinking our corporate frameworks, reinforcing individual responsibility, and championing innovation that uplifts communities. By embracing ethical practices and fostering inclusive leadership, we can not only transform our organizations but also contribute to a brighter, more equitable future for all.

As leaders, we must ask ourselves: how do we build organizations that not only thrive financially but also contribute meaningfully to the communities we serve?"
MEDIOCRE JOB GROWTH REPORTS BELIE MAJOR PROBLEMS AHEAD FOR US ECONOMY,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2024/10/03/mediocre-job-growth-reports-belie-major-problems-ahead-for-us-economy/,2024-10-04T01:40:11Z,"The September job report (10/4 @8:30am) is expected to show 150,000 new (non farm) jobs and an unchanged 4.2% unemployment rate. These numbers are not overwhelming, but neither are they disastrous. Importantly, anything close (or even weaker) will be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to proceed with continued interest rate cuts. This is key to further market advancement.

But the jobs reports, thus far, in 2024 are not signaling the massive problems on the horizon. As a population, we are an old country and getting older. Moreover, we are not creating jobs like we used to and have resorted to outsourcing many jobs that we could keep ""in house"". Further, we have lately resorted to a propensity to create ""non productive"" jobs to maintain employment. For example, over the past 5 years, the United States created 350,000 MORE jobs in government, social services and healthcare than overall total jobs created.

It should come as no surprise that the US has long since lost its competitive edge in manufacturing. However, our job growth is now dependent on aging baby boomers with many refusing to retire. This may be due to economic necessity or desire to keep active, but eventually, the issue becomes moot. Sooner or later they leave the workforce. Many individuals will no longer contribute wealth to our society and will become an added burden to limited support and services.

Surprisingly, in a close election year, marked by animus from one political party to the next, the economic news has taken a back seat to other issues deemed more worrisome. It shouldn't. Current economic issues, the direction of job growth and the inevitable, irreversible decline in the US workforce, should take center stage. The next four years will be critical to the economic direction of the US economy. In the absence of a visionary change in direction, economic retooling, incentives and policy changes, our overall economy is headed for a vicious downward cycle.

There are some key fundamental demographics which are not going away. Ever. The US has an aging workforce with 75m baby boomers. Notably, by the year 2030 the number of Americans who are 65+ will exceed 20%, almost doubling the level in the year 2000. Each year, more than 4m Americans are eligible to retire. This will continue for the foreseeable future and have a profound impact on the size of the civilian labor force, the employed population ratio, and the unemployment rate. To place these numbers in perspective, one needs to understand that in the past 5 years, only 3m new jobs were created. There are currently 40m+ Americans who are 65-75 and in the next 6 years another 25m will join them. Approximately 1/3 of them work (up for 1/4 10 years ago). This implies that within the next 5 to 10 years, the US can expect 20m+ retirements. Given the current level of 161m employed Americans, on a civilian non institutional population base rate of 268m, the employed population ratio could plummet from 60% to 50%. In other words, in only 5 to 10 years, the US could be in a situation in which 1/2 the civilian non institutional population (above 16, non military, not in jail or nursing home) would not be working.

Compounding the problem is that the US has added to taken a leadership role in outsourcing talent -- notably to Eastern Europe and India for technical IT support and Philippines and Viet Nam for bookkeeping and accounting support. Millions of jobs, both high and low wage jobs are being sent overseas.

Meanwhile, the job growth in the US has come from 3 key areas: HealthCare, Government, Social Assistance. In fact, over the past 20 years, 2/3 of the new jobs from these areas and in the past 5 years, more than 3.5m jobs were created in government, health care and social services than overall jobs!

Given the aging population, the trend in healthcare will clearly continue. Moreover, the demand for social services will likely also continue to rise as additional illegal immigrants enter the country.

Is there a solution to avoid this impending doom? Possibly, but we would need immediate corrective actions. Unfortunately, job growth, and in particular, long-term job creation has not received the attention that it requires. Minor tweaks are being made to extend retirement age among some workers from 65 to 67, but this does not address the larger issue that will happen within 5 to 10 years.

Policies need to be implemented to create economic incentives for companies to keep jobs in America and bring other jobs back home. Along these lines, tough policies regarding minimum wages need to be considered in the context of not forcing employers to shut down, move or outsource talent. America also needs to grow it's educated work force, especially among young people. Simple solutions, such as keeping foreign college students in our country longer, might go a long way to helping resolve this developing crisis.

Finally, the US cannot continue to create jobs primarily in government, social services and health care. Jobs that help reduce global balance of payment deficits are required for long term economic growth. This cannot happen with governmental or social service jobs. As part of this action, governmental policy regarding the increased cost of millions of illegal aliens entering our cities needs to be addressed.

The forthcoming jobs reports for the next few months will likely continue without major surprise. But it is just a matter of time before baby boomer retirements kick in. At that point, it will become clearer that the US has major problems ahead. Hopefully, our future policy makers will make these issues a top priority. The growth of our economy and the future for our children depend on it."
AI And The Gig Economy Is Reshaping The Workforce. Here's How,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/timothypapandreou/2024/10/03/ai-and-the-gig-economy-is-reshaping-the-workforce-heres-how/,2024-10-04T00:11:59Z,"The gig economy, once primarily associated with entertainment or low-wage service jobs, is undergoing a profound transformation, driven in part by the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence. As AI technologies continue to mature, they are enabling new forms of work, creating opportunities for individuals seeking greater flexibility and autonomy. Many younger adults are turning to platforms like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash to earn extra income on their own terms. This trend is not limited to these jobs; white collar professionals are also embracing the gig economy through platforms like Toptal, Fiverr and Upwork, seeking greater flexibility and the ability to work on projects that align with their passions.

One of the most significant ways AI is reshaping the gig economy is through the development of AI agents. These platforms can match workers with tasks, manage projects, and even automate certain aspects of the work. For example, AI agents can be used to:

The rise of the gig economy has significant implications for traditional entry-level employment. As more individuals choose to work independently, the demand for full-time jobs will change, particularly in sectors such as retail and food service. The gig economy offers a diverse range of individuals the opportunity to work on their own terms. However, the reasons for choosing gig work vary significantly across demographics.

The growth of the gig economy has led to a surge in the popularity of the ""digital nomad"" lifestyle. This trend is particularly appealing to highly educated individuals who seek greater flexibility and the ability to work remotely. Automation and AI platforms have played a crucial role in enabling this lifestyle by providing the tools and payment infrastructure necessary for remote work.

For example, AI-powered collaboration tools and cloud-based software have made it easier for digital nomads to connect with clients and colleagues, regardless of their location. Additionally, AI-powered translation and communication tools have broken down language barriers, allowing digital nomads to work with clients from around the world. These systems have simplified payment and opened up a much larger employee and employment catchment area beyond the traditional hubs.

Demographics of Gig Workers:

Millennials and Generation Z are particularly likely to embrace gig work due to their preference for flexibility and their comfort with technology. Parents often choose gig work to balance their childcare responsibilities with their careers. Students may turn to gig work to earn extra income or gain experience in their field. Many retired individuals choose gig work as a way to stay active and earn supplemental income. Gig work can offer flexible opportunities for individuals with disabilities who may face challenges in traditional employment.

The AI gig economy's growth presents both opportunities and challenges for the larger economy. On the one hand, it can create new jobs, flexibility and stimulate economic growth. On the other hand, it can also lead to increased income inequality, job insecurity and a race to the bottom. Notably, in the AI-driven gig economy, gig workers often find themselves working not directly for clients but through AI agent intermediaries. These AI agents assign tasks, facilitate payment, and dispatch work, creating a new dynamic in the labor market that requires careful consideration and regulation.

To ensure that the gig economy benefits all segments of society, policymakers must address issues such as worker classification, benefits, and labor protections. By establishing clear guidelines for AI deployment, governments can help to mitigate potential risks such as algorithmic bias, privacy violations, and job displacement. These guidelines should address issues like transparency in AI decision-making, data privacy protections, and safeguards against discriminatory outcomes. Additionally, ensuring worker protections is crucial to prevent exploitation and maintain a fair working environment.

The gig economy is undergoing a rapid transformation, driven in part by the advancement of AI. As AI technologies continue to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative forms of work emerging. By understanding the trends and challenges associated with the gig economy, individuals and businesses can better position themselves to thrive in this new era of work."
"Tensions are rising in the Middle East, but the rise in oil prices is muted - so far",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5137118/israel-iran-conflict-oil-price-risks,2024-10-03T23:50:09Z,"The sun shines behind a refinery in the South Pars Gas-Condensate field in Asalouyeh Seaport in Iran. Iran's oil and natural gas infrastructure is a possible target for Israeli attacks as tensions in the Mideast mount. Oil prices have risen as a result -- but remain relatively low, compared to most of 2024. SAEID ARABZADEH/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty hide caption

Global crude oil prices rose by more than 4% on Wednesday, surging after President Biden told reporters he was ""discussing"" the question of whether the U.S. would support an Israeli attack on Iranian oil facilities.

""We're discussing that,"" Biden said. ""I think that would be a little ... anyway.""

The cryptic remark sent oil up significantly - but even so, prices are not particularly high by historical standards.

Brent, the global benchmark for crude, closed at $77.62, still lower than it was for most of 2024.

""In the past, if we're talking about any kind of conflict in the Middle East that concerned Iran, prices would probably be above $100"" a barrel, said Amrita Sen, the founder of the energy research firm Energy Aspects. ""People were talking about, like, $120, $130 crude.""

Although tensions between Israel and Iran are currently as serious as they have been for decades, said Sen, ""the market has been completely brushing it aside.""

Why are markets so sanguine? The biggest reason, analysts say, is that the OPEC+ alliance could make a lot more oil -- if it wanted.

As a group, OPEC+, a coalition of oil-producing countries, has an incentive to make less oil; lower supply means higher prices. But individual countries have a strong incentive to produce more oil, which funds their national budgets. Balancing those two competing motivations is the central diplomatic challenge of the cartel.

And for a few years now, the group - and particularly Saudi Arabia - have cut production significantly, trying to hold up prices. That means OPEC+ could, hypothetically, easily make up for missing Iranian oil.

Rystad Energy, an energy research company, estimates that Iran produces about 4 million barrels of crude per day, and exports about 2 million. OPEC+'s spare capacity - the amount of oil the group could make, but is choosing not to - ""currently sits at more than 5 million barrels per day, which could be deployed relatively quickly,"" Claudio Galimberti, the chief economist of Rystad Energy, wrote in a research note.

Whether the alliance would choose to deploy that production is another question.

Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader with CIBC Private Wealth, notes that OPEC+ kept a tight lid on production even after Russia invaded Ukraine and prices spiked. She thinks this time, they'd choose to sell more barrels. Probably.

""Do we know that they will? Nope,"" she said. ""And they love to make surprises."" But the possibility is helping to keep prices from skyrocketing.

There are a few other reasons for the lack of alarm.

Oil prices slid dramatically in September, thanks in part to lower-than-expected demand from China's slowing economy. China has just launched a massive stimulus program, but it's not yet clear how much that will translate into oil consumption.

Meanwhile, the geopolitics of oil have shifted dramatically, shaped in large part by the shale boom, when new drilling methods like fracking unlocked vast oil reserves. The U.S. is now the largest oil producer in history, and a net oil exporter. (Crude exports have not been affected by the port strike this week on the East and Gulf coasts of the U.S.)

And because the U.S. is far less reliant on oil from the Mideast than it used to be, traders think Iran has less incentive to shut down the Strait of Hormuz than it did a few decades ago.

More than a quarter of the world's seaborne crude travels through that waterway, which lies between Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Any blockage would cause ""runaway"" oil prices, Galimberti of Rystad Energy says.

But it would cause less pain to the U.S. than it once would have - and more pain to Iran and its primary customer, China.

Sen thinks markets are currently underestimating how much this conflict could upend markets, and that if an attack on oil infrastructure does happen, the price response will be dramatic. ""This is the biggest short the market has ever had,"" she said.

Babin thinks the market's factoring in the risks just about right. After all, oil markets aren't waving off these risks entirely. Prices are up more than $6 this week, a significant jump. Babin notes in the options market, some traders are placing bets that would only pay off if prices spike more.

But overall, she said, when she looks at the price of oil, ""I see this as very measured: a market that's not panicking, not running away with itself. We're not at $90."""
Harris claims ad quoting her 2019 vow to ban fracking is 'mischaracterization' to make people 'afraid' of her,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-claims-ad-quoting-her-2019-vow-ban-fracking-mischaracterization-make-people-afraid-her,2024-10-03T23:33:00Z,"The 'Fox & Friends Weekend' hosts react to a resurfaced video of Kamala Harris saying she would 'put an end to fracking once and for all.'

Vice President Kamala Harris argued this week that an ad showing a clip of her past rhetoric about fracking is misleading and ""intended to make people afraid of my presidency.""

CBS Pittsburgh's Jon Delano spoke with Harris in an interview on Tuesday, challenging her to clarify her evolving stance on fracking, one of many key issues where she has been accused of flip-flopping for political gain.

""I wanted to ask you, there's a political ad on TV from a 2019 climate hall town meeting that you had, in which you basically said, quote, 'There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,' unquote,"" the interviewer said. ""The ad claims that if you are elected president you will ban fracking and you will cost Pennsylvania over 300,000 jobs. Have you changed your view on fracking, and if so, why?""

HARRIS DODGING FLIP-FLOP ATTACKS AS FACELESS SURROGATES FLIP KEY POSITIONS: 'PLAYING POLITICS'

""So let me start by saying that that ad, as you described it, is absolutely a mischaracterization, that I think is intended to make people afraid of my presidency,"" Harris said.

""Let me be absolutely clear, as I've been when I said it back in 2020, I will not ban fracking. I did not as vice president. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to open up more fracking leases,"" she added, referencing her role as vice president in getting the so-called Inflation Reduction Act through the deadlocked Senate.

In 2020, Harris was asked about fracking during her vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence, but did not reveal a reversal of her stated 2019 opposition to fracking, instead simply saying that Biden would not ban fracking as president.

""Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that,"" Harris said.

""I will repeat and the American people know that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact,"" she added during another portion of the debate.

CNN FACT CHECKER HITS KAMALA HARRIS FOR CLAIMING SHE 'MADE CLEAR' IN 2020 SHE WOULDN'T BAN FRACKING

On Tuesday, Harris said, ""My perspective on this is grounded in a number of things, including that we don't have to ban fracking to do the work that we can do to also invest in a clean energy economy.""

She then made multiple promises to American voters.

""I'm going to bring jobs back to rural communities. I'm going to make sure that we invest in those communities that have done the kind of work that you have in mind when you talk about Pittsburgh, when you talk about the greater aspect of Pennsylvania,"" she pledged. ""And I'm going to keep doing that work.""

The strike by tens of thousands of dockworkers on the East and Gulf Coasts has been called off, after the International Longshoremen's Association and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, representing ocean carriers and port operators, reached a tentative agreement on wages.

The two sides also agreed to extend the existing contract until January 15, 2025. In the meantime, they will return to the bargaining table to negotiate all other outstanding issues, including the union's demand on a ban on all automation at the ports.

The International Longshoremen's Association had been seeking $5-an-hour raises in each of the next six years, amounting to a 77% increase over six years. A day before the strike began, the U.S. Maritime Alliance had offered nearly 50% in raises.

The White House had downplayed the economic impact of a short strike, despite warnings from House Republicans and more than 170 industry groups that a work stoppage would have a devastating impact on supply chains and the broader economy.

President Biden repeatedly vowed to let the collective bargaining process play out.

""I don't believe in Taft-Hartley,"" President Biden told reporters days before the strike, citing the federal law that allows the President to call for an 80-day cooling off period when the nation's safety is at risk.

More than $2 billion worth of goods typically flow through these ports daily, from chemicals and clothing to bourbon and bananas. This week, dozens of container ships had started to line up, offshore, waiting for the strike to end.

The affected ports -- from Boston to Houston -- normally handle more than half of all cargo containers coming into the U.S., or about a million containers a month, as well as more than 300,000 containers heading out of the country, according to the freight-tracking company Vizion.

""The botched withdrawal from Afghanistan under the Biden-Harris Administration in 2021, led to the unnecessary deaths of thirteen brave American troops at Abbey Gate and left untold billions of dollars of high grade military equipment to the Taliban, making it the most well-armed terror organization in the world.""

Additionally, 40 retired U.S. ambassadors, 75 retired senior military officers and several hundred officials from previous Republican administrations signed the letter, praising Trump's diplomatic efforts on cease-fire agreements between Turkey and Kurdish fighters in Syria and the Abraham Accords.

Oil Surges On Israel-Iran Tensions: OPEC+ Strategy Shifts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdaugherty/2024/10/03/oil-surges-on-israel-iran-tensions-opec-strategy-shifts/,2024-10-03T21:42:38Z,"In the span of 24 hours, President Biden met to discuss an Israeli attack on Iranian facilities causing oil prices to surge while the Saudi oil minister has said prices could drop to as low as $50 per barrel if so-called cheaters within OPEC+ don't stick to agreed-upon production limits, according to delegates in the cartel. Benchmark U.S. crude saw its largest one-day gain in a year, jumping 5.1% to $73.71. The news also impacted U.S. stock indexes negatively. The Saudi oil minister's remarks were interpreted by other producers as a veiled threat that the kingdom is willing to launch a price war to keep its market share if other countries don't abide by the group's agreements.

This stark juxtaposition of geopolitical tensions and internal OPEC+ dynamics underscores the complex forces at play in the global oil market. As the threat of conflict pushes prices up, internal disagreements within OPEC+ threaten to pull them down, creating a volatile environment for oil prices. Daniel Yergin, the legendary authority on energy, geopolitics and the global economy, has consistently shared insights about oil prices. He notes, ""Energy is a strategic commodity, and those who control its production and distribution wield considerable power"" and ""If a war started, the oil price probably would go up until you saw other oil from the extra supplies that are available elsewhere coming into the world, into the market.""

As tensions escalate in the Middle East, with Israel retaliating against Iran's recent launch of 200 missiles (most of which were intercepted or landed in unoccupied areas), the global oil market finds itself on edge. The potential for conflict in this volatile region raises concerns about disruptions to the world's oil supply, with implications that extend far beyond the immediate participants. Iran, a key player in this unfolding drama, contributes significantly to the global oil market. Producing approximately 3.99 million barrels per day, Iran accounts for about 4% of the world's oil supply.

Any disruption to this output could have immediate and far-reaching consequences for global energy markets. Iran's smuggling network is sophisticated; the country's petroleum business is run by the National Iran Oil Company (NIOC), a state monopoly. Its main customer is China -- not the country's large, state-owned firms, which are exposed to Western sanctions, but ""teapot refineries"" that snap up 95% of Iranian supplies. However, the concerns don't stop at Iran's borders. The fear of a wider regional conflict looms large, potentially impacting other major oil-producing nations in the area. Saudi Arabia, the world's second-largest oil producer, contributes a staggering 11% to global supply. Iraq and the United Arab Emirates each account for 4%, while Kuwait adds another 3%. Collectively, these Middle Eastern nations form the backbone of global oil production.

The interconnected nature of the global oil market means that disruptions in one area can quickly ripple across the entire industry. The potential for price volatility extends beyond the immediate term. If a conflict were to escalate and impact multiple producing countries, the effect on oil prices could be much more dramatic. Historical precedents, such as the 1973 oil crisis, serve as stark reminders of how geopolitical events in the Middle East can send shockwaves through the global economy. Furthermore, as Yergin points out, higher prices tend to incentivize increased production from other sources. This market response can help to balance supply and demand over time, though the process is neither immediate nor without its own complexities.

The impact of oil price fluctuations extends far beyond the energy sector. Transportation costs, manufacturing, and consumer goods prices are all influenced by the cost of oil. Central banks and policymakers watch oil prices closely, as significant increases can contribute to inflationary pressures and impact economic growth. For oil-importing nations, particularly in the developing world, sustained high oil prices can pose significant challenges to economic stability and growth. Conversely, for oil-exporting countries, including those in the Middle East, higher prices can boost government revenues but may also intensify regional tensions.

For investors looking to capitalize on potential oil price increases, especially if further hostilities break out in the Middle East with direct conflict involving producing nations, two stocks stand out as potentially beneficial: Exxon (ticker: XOM) and Imperial Oil (ticker: IMO). Both of these companies are poised to benefit from higher oil prices and have less exposure to activities in the region than major oil producers operating directly in the Middle East. However, as with all investments, thorough research and consideration of one's individual financial situation and risk tolerance is advised before making any investment decisions."
"Thursday, October 3. Russia's War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/katyasoldak/2024/10/03/thursday-october-3-russias-war-on-ukraine-news-and-information-from-ukraine/,2024-10-03T21:22:47Z,"Regional. Kharkiv region. On October 3, a Russian glide bomb hit a residential building in the city of Kharkiv, wounding 12 residents, including a 3-year-old girl.

Chernihiv region. On October 3, A Russian drone struck a gas truck delivering fuel to residents in the village of Snovska 30 miles from the Russian border, resulting in the deaths of three people. The strike also caused a devastating explosion and subsequent fires, wounding four others.

Donetsk region. Russian shelling has severely damaged two water facilities in northern Donetsk, disrupting the water supply for about 260,000 residents. Local authorities are seeking alternative water supplies to mitigate the crisis.

War Crimes. Russian forces reportedly executed 16 Ukrainian prisoners-of-war in the largest known mass killing of POWs of the war, according to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office. A video recording of the incident, which took place near the front line in the Donetsk region on September 30, has circulated on social networks. The footage shows Russian troops lining up Ukrainian soldiers along a wooded area under Russian control, then shooting the men and finally killing the wounded with shots at close range.

Reports of Russian forces murdering Ukrainian POWs execution-style have appeared with alarming regularity. Near the occupied city of Novohrodivka in the Donetsk region, Russian troops in September reportedly barbarically killed a Ukrainian soldier with a sword.

National. Civilian casualties in Ukraine surged over the summer, with deaths rising by a third to 589 and the number of wounded increasing nearly 50% to 2,685, according to a UN report. By contrast, the spring ended with 444 civilian deaths and 1,817 wounded. Autumn casualty lists might confirm this upward trend as the number of casualties has remained high due to relentless glide-bomb attacks on residential buildings in the Sumy, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia regions and the intensified Russian offensive in the Donetsk region. The war has resulted in at least 11,743 civilian deaths and 24,614 wounded. The UN has also documented 1,358 educational facilities and 580 medical facilities destroyed or damaged.

According to estimates by the Kyiv School of Economics, Ukraine's economy has suffered indirect financial losses exceeding $1.2 trillion in lost revenue since the war started. The total estimated indirect losses, including current and projected revenue, amounts to $1.164 trillion, with an additional $385.7 billion expected in future losses. Besides lost revenue, Ukraine is grappling with substantial costs stemming from the conflict, including $42 billion for mine-clearing.

Russia has carried out 25 mass attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, launching more than 1,400 rockets and 500 drones in total against these facilities over the past two years. Russia has used approximately 1,200 cruise missiles in the attacks. Although Ukrainian air defenses have intercepted some 75% of these missiles, Russian ballistic missiles frequently reach their intended targets. Fully 98% of the drones employed were Iranian-made Shahed models, of which Ukraine shot down about 90%.

On August 26, Ukraine endured the largest and most devastating aerial attack to date. The strike, involving more than 200 Russian missiles and drones, inflicted an estimated of $1.2 billion in damage to energy infrastructure.

Ukraine can produce 4,000,000 drones annually, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed during the second International Defense Industry Forum in Kyiv attended by 115 domestic and 168 foreign companies from 30 countries. Zelenskyy outlined significant Ukrainian advancements in long-range technologies, including the long-range drone missile ""Palyanytsya"" and a newly developed ballistic missile that has completed its flight tests. In the first half of 2024, Ukraine manufactured 25 times more ammunition for artillery and mortars than in 2022, he added.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has invested up to $4 billion in arms manufacturing this year. The government also allocated $580 million for drone procurement in August, with 500 Ukrainian companies now engaged in drone production.

World. During his first foreign visit as NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte met President Zelenskyy in Kyiv on October 3. Zelenskyy encouraged NATO to intensify air defense support, stressing the critical need to reinforce Ukraine's defenses against missiles and drones, and to expedite implementation of key air defense commitments from the July NATO summit before the onset of winter.

Zelenskyy also acknowledged the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the eastern stronghold of Vuhledar, emphasizing the necessity of preserving soldiers' lives in the face of relentless Russian aggression. ""Without adequate weaponry, we cannot halt the Russian Federation, which is wreaking havoc on our positions. The safety of our soldiers is paramount; they are our citizens, and their lives matter more than any infrastructure,"" Zelenskyy asserted at a joint press conference with Rutte.

To bolster Ukraine's chances of getting through this winter, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has allocated $825 million, nearly twice as much as last year. During a visit to Kyiv on October 2, USAID Administrator Samantha Power emphasized the urgency of this funding as Russian forces continue to target energy facilities, using harsh winter conditions as a weapon against the Ukrainian people. In addition to energy aid, USAID is launching a five-year rehabilitation program called ""Rehab for You,"" with a budget of $13 million, allocating $237 million for humanitarian assistance and supporting Ukrainian education with 3.2 million newly-printed textbooks.

Switzerland has committed $1.7 billion over the next four years to support Ukraine's reconstruction efforts. Almost two-thirds of the funds will go to governance, mine-clearing and humanitarian aid while the remainder will fund recovery initiatives in collaboration with the Swiss private sector.

Ukraine has received a Patriot air defense system from Romania. This delivery is a crucial step in boosting its hard-pressed defense capabilities. NATO allies have pledged a total of seven air defense systems to support Kyiv, although former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba previously noted delays in delivery of some promised Patriot systems."
"Immigration Isn't The 'Crisis,' But Planning Of Markets Activity Is",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/10/03/immigration-isnt-the-crisis-but-planning-of-markets-activity-is/,2024-10-03T21:10:21Z,"Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has taken to blaming the Republicans for problems associated with a surge of immigrants at the southern border. Republicans have hit back. Commentary at the Wall Street Journal asserted that ""Blaming the surge on Republicans evades years of failed policies.""

Without taking sides, it should be obvious to Republicans that ""failed policy"" is a redundancy of sorts. We're talking government after all, and government policies are but the substitution of the knowledge of the few for that of the marketplace itself.

Applied to the southern border, naturally the policies have failed. Central planning of a market phenomenon always fails. Which is no insight.

At the same time, some readers will no doubt reject the assertion that human beings massing at the southern border is a market phenomenon, but if not, what is it? Really, what explains the paucity of humans north of the United States desperately trying to get to the U.S.?

Hopefully the implied point is sufficiently illuminating. Though not Singapore, Canada's economy is largely free and sufficiently prosperous such that the desperation to exit Canada isn't so great.

South of the U.S., and right on down to Venezuela at the very least, let's just say there's too much ""policy"" of the economic kind. And where there's an excess of central planning, there's invariably an outflow of people in search of the much greater opportunity that exists where policy isn't so ubiquitous. That's the United States. People have been coming here to cure their poverty for as long as the U.S. has existed, and surely before that.

Which is evidence yet again that this human migration to the U.S. is a market phenomenon. Even those who seek more border-patrol enforcement, a wall, or both, might agree. Figure that Haiti doesn't have a ""problem"" of desperate people trying to make their way there, but the U.S. generally always does. It's markets at work.

Conversely, let's call central planning the ultimate wall. Though invisible, it guards against the arrival of people better than any wall of any size ever could. Just the same, free markets and freedom ultimately overwhelm any wall, or any kind of border enforcement.

Which is a not-so-insightful way of saying that it's free markets borne of a lack of economic policy exerting their powerful pull for human capital from countries defined by a lack of free markets, and way too much policy. Think about it. Before Maduro and Chavez in Venezuela, was Venezuela's loss of human capital nearly as substantial? Hopefully the question answers itself.

In being answered, ideally it can be said that people generally do best economically where rules and regulations concerning commercial matters are the lightest. Yes, people do best in locales where policy is least apparent.

Applied to the U.S., its market economy is in so many ways a beautiful picture of human cooperation. At the same time, how ironic that the chaos and misery at the southern border resembles what it's like in the countries that would-be U.S. immigrants are trying to escape.

Why aren't Republicans talking about this? Why aren't they showcasing the always and everywhere failure of policy? Just as a policy meant to regulate the number of laptop computers, cars, and chips imported into the U.S. would amount to overwhelming failure, so do efforts to centrally plan people.

Which means we can end the chaos at the southern border in one of two ways: either mimic the economic policies of the countries migrants are exiting so that the U.S. is no longer attractive, or legalize work in the free-market U.S. so that wages and prices can dictate who comes to the U.S., and where. Anything else is central planning."
10 Practices To Mitigate Toxic Business Conversations,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinzwilling/2024/10/03/10-practices-to-mitigate-toxic-business-conversations/,2024-10-03T20:08:44Z,"In my work with business professionals over the years, I have met many who seem quick to engage in contentious dialogs with peers and constituents. These may be experts in their field, and have more experience, but they often exacerbate the problems rather than resolve them. The most effective leaders seem to be able to turn toxic conversations into more healthy dialogs.

I've always admired the art of dealing with toxic people and tuned by own habits to improve. I found some excellent recommendations along these lines in a new book, ""Habits of a Peace Maker,"" by Steven T. Collis, a recognized thought leader on this subject. I will summarize here his top ten practices, adding my own business perspective, for your own efforts to be more effective:

1. Show intellectual humility by first reframing the issue. Relating a tough business issue to another context will help conversations focus more on making progress and gaining new insights, rather than proving someone else wrong. Prioritize discussing potential win-win solutions and avoid trying to show off your expertise or role authority.

2. Practice real learning by seeking constructive dialog. Don't rely totally on social media or favorite news sources for market information and a position. Generate knowledge together and seek to understand what is meaningful to both of you, rather than choosing your position from competitor and customer catchphrases and interactions.

3. Assume the best about people, rather than the worst. You know that in business, your teams are normally motivated to do the right thing since hurting the business may also hurt their career. You should assume they just can't express their position in the best light, or allow their emotions to take control, so reframe their comments in the best light.

4. Avoid feeding the fears in your peers or adversaries. Always listen more than you talk and speak with kindness and a gentle tone. Be slow to state your own opinions, leaving open the possibility that you could be wrong. Acknowledge and avoid your own business biases and use that knowledge to tone down your inherent position on hard issues.

5. Seek to understand the best argument against you. Don't waste time on specious or weak arguments - reframe them to define the toughest counter-argument and address this one in your thinking before you respond. Listen for irrelevant facts and always politely keep the focus on business facts that matter. Don't respond to slogans or emotion.

6. Show willingness to change your mind with new info. Always take the time needed to reflect on business issues and arguments, acknowledging to yourself and your team that the best outcome may require you changing your mind. Put principle above loyalty to specific groups or causes and be willing to stand alone if necessary for the right answer.

7. Spend time with people on non-contentious activities. You need to spend uplifting recreation time with all members of your team, doing anything other than talking about the business challenges. This will help build bridges to understand legitimate concerns justifying why they believe what they believe, and help you take each other seriously.

8. Insert a sliver of humor into the business discussion. Humor can be a powerful tool for putting people at ease and allowing more fruitful conversations. You need to learn to recognize when you own humor is not working and adjust your style to the type most team listeners appreciate. Also be sensitive to formal situations that don't call for humor.

9. Build mental and emotional health for inner peace. Use meditation, intentional breathing, and other forms of mindfulness to achieve inner calm and emotional stability. You need to protect the daily time necessary to do those things that work for you, and be humble enough to ask for help from business mentors, peers, or outside professionals.

10. Embrace the reality of not closing every difference. Many of the most challenging business problems are complex for a reason, so you must recognize it is okay to not be able to resolve any specific one totally. Small steps to these solutions are important, so always minimize moments of hostility and argument, and celebrate every progress step.

By nurturing these habits, I am confident that both you and your team will be more effective in addressing the many new and complex business challenges that every company faces in this age of instant communication in a global economy. Make your handling of difficult and potentially toxic situations your career and competitive advantage rather than a barrier you can't overcome."

Tuesday night's vice-presidential debate offered a refreshing change from the combative tone that has plagued our political discourse over the past eight years.

For many viewers, it was a relief to witness a civil exchange between two candidates who, surprisingly, seemed to respect one another. Sen. JD Vance showcased his skills as both an orator and debater, garnering a more favorable opinion from many voters.

On the other hand, Gov. Tim Walz, while appearing somewhat nervous and lackluster, managed to connect with viewers through his likability and relatability. The unfortunate reality, however, is that neither candidate did enough to change any votes.

VANCE VS. WALZ DEBATE LEAVES AMERICANS WITH THIS BIG TAKEAWAY

So, what can we take away from this debate?

Despite various pundits highlighting the strengths of the two vice presidential candidates, Tuesday night's debate ultimately had little impact on undecided voters. While Walz's performance had its successes, his nervous start and notable gaffes left much to be desired. In the end, both candidates offered a little something for everyone -- but for those still weighing their options, there were no compelling reasons to change their minds.

As we approach the final stretch of the presidential election, the challenge for both candidates and their running mates is clear: how can they win over undecided voters in just 33 days? The answer lies in two crucial areas:

Given the current economic climate, this task may be easier for former President Donald Trump, especially in light of the anticipated repercussions from the port strike and escalating energy prices due to turmoil in the Middle East.

Voters are understandably anxious about the future, and both candidates have already tapped into this concern -- Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz highlighting the threats to democracy and Trump and Vance focused on the difficulties we face with the economy and immigration.

As the clock ticks down to Election Day, the ability to inspire confidence and reassure voters will determine the next leader of this nation."
Don Draper's Mistake: Why Creator Marketing Needs More Than Money,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiegutfreund/2024/10/03/don-drapers-mistake-why-creator-marketing-needs-more-than-money/,2024-10-03T18:21:48Z,"In one of television's most memorable scenes, Mad Men's Don Draper famously told a frustrated Peggy Olson, ""That's what the money is for!"" when she asked for a simple ""thank you.""

While Draper's view may be from another era, many marketers today still see the creator economy through the same transactional lens. It's an outdated perspective that assumes a paycheck alone guarantees excellent work. But this approach falls flat in today's media landscape.

To succeed in creator marketing, brands must move beyond short-term transactions and build long-term partnerships.

Many advertisers see creators as content producers and little more. However, creators are entrepreneurs who can unlock growth and build long-term brand value if given the proper support. Beyond a paycheck, creators want mentorship, business guidance, and opportunities to expand their careers.

Billion Dollar Boy, a global influencer marketing agency known for iconic campaigns for brands like Amazon, Dove, Kenvue, Loewe, and Ulta, recognized this gap and created FiveTwoNine: The Creator Club. The name ""FiveTwoNine"" flips the traditional 9-to-5 workday on its head, acknowledging that many creators juggle multiple jobs while striving to make content creation their full-time career.

FiveTwoNine is more than just a community -- it's a physical space in London designed to support creators' development as leaders and business owners. It features production facilities, soundproof studios, and classrooms where creators can collaborate, take business courses, and connect with senior marketing leaders.

For example, this past September, the space hosted an event, ""Free to Be Me: The South Asian Experience in Creator Advertising,"" to bring industry players together to foster inclusivity and discuss the importance of representation in advertising.

FiveTwoNine's founding members include a diverse range of creators, such as:

* Lucy Edwards - Beauty and accessibility creator and disability activist.

Along with Lipton as a founding brand partner, these creators set the tone for the club's mission to build meaningful partnerships between brands and creators.

""FiveTwoNine isn't just a place for creators to create,"" says Edward East, Founder and Group CEO of Billion Dollar Boy. ""It's designed to help creators build the business skills they need to thrive -- whether through coaching on brand partnerships, financial planning, or simply having a space to meet and share ideas.""

FiveTwoNine already supports a community of over 1,000 creators and is expanding with a new location in New York City, set to open in early 2025. ""When creators succeed, brands benefit from access to a strong, sophisticated talent ecosystem that can deliver meaningful results,"" says Becky Owen, Global Chief Marketing Officer & Head of FiveTwoNine at Billion Dollar Boy.

Research by Billion Dollar Boy revealed that 73% of creators prioritize business consultancy services. Their top needs include financial advice, pricing and negotiation guidance, and support for diversifying income streams. Recognizing this, FiveTwoNine offers workshops and coaching sessions on supply chain logistics, legal considerations, and financial planning.

""Creators are essentially small business owners, and like any business, they need more than revenue to grow,"" explains Owen. ""By helping creators develop entrepreneurial skills, we're creating a talent ecosystem that helps creators thrive and enables brands to connect with a dynamic network of innovative partners.""

However, Owen emphasizes that this approach isn't for every brand. ""The marketers that see the best results are those that understand their growth is based on a long-term investment in creators and the creator economy,"" says Owen. ""It's not for everyone. Some won't get it, and that's okay. It's about focusing on the right brands committed to supporting creators.""

Lucy Edwards, one of FiveTwoNine's founding creators, shares the value of these deeper relationships: ""When I started, I had to wear many hats -- editor, producer, director, and business owner. Education and guidance weren't there for me, but FiveTwoNine is changing that for the next generation of creators. It's about giving creators the support they need to succeed long-term, ultimately benefiting their brand partners.""

Deeper Engagement and Loyalty: Creators who receive mentorship and business support are more invested in the success of the brands they partner with, leading to more robust relationships.

Better Business Outcomes: When creators have access to resources like financial planning, negotiation guidance, and supply chain logistics, they can focus on producing higher-quality content and driving better results for brands.

Access to a Dynamic Talent Network: Supporting creators' growth helps brands tap into a sophisticated, skilled network of creators who can deliver deeper insights, creative ideas, and innovative solutions.

Long-Term Value: By building long-term partnerships, brands benefit from creators' continuous growth and evolving influence, positioning them to access new audiences and stay relevant in an ever-changing media landscape.

Success in creator marketing doesn't require more spending; it requires shifting how brands see creators -- from mere content producers to long-term partners. By investing in creators' development and supporting their entrepreneurial goals, brands can build deeper relationships that deliver sustained growth and value.

With the right approach, creators become brand ambassadors and strategic collaborators who can help shape a brand's future. Don Draper may have believed, ""That's what the money is for,"" but in today's landscape, money alone won't buy the loyalty, creativity, or lasting impact that true partnerships can deliver."
Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg says port strikes could have real impact on economy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/transportation-secretary-pete-buttigieg-says-port-strikes-could-have-real-impact-economy,2024-10-03T18:10:06Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Thursday that the port strikes could have a real impact on the economy during an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

""The longer this goes, the more economic impact you're going to see. Look, if you just think about the pace of ocean shipping, obviously something you're expecting to get overnight isn't something you're sending in an ocean liner. But it doesn't take long for this to really have an impact. Our supply chains are all interconnected,"" Buttigieg told host Willie Geist.

The International Longshoreman's Association (ILA) began its first strike since 1977 after its six-year contract with the U.S. Maritime Alliance (USMX), which represents port employers, expired Monday night.

""A lot of the retailers, the stores, they did see that this might be coming. This is an issue we've been tracking for months. And so some of them rerouted to the West Coast or they frontloaded their orders and got more things into the warehouses earlier this year,"" he added.

US SHOPPERS START TO 'STOCK UP' ON ESSENTIALS AS PORT STRIKES PRESSURE PRICES TO GO 'HIGHER THAN EVER'

Buttigieg explained that the dockworkers' union was negotiating for better wages because shipping companies have had their profits increase by ""about 350%"" over the last eight years. He said the wages of the workers have only gone up about 15%.

""They're negotiating for better wages and other issues, and they have not been able to come to terms, them and the ocean carriers and ports, in order to reach a new contract. That has resulted in this strike, the work stoppage,"" he said.

""It's a big issue, this needs to get resolved,"" the transportation secretary added. ""We've been in touch with the different parties urging them to bridge their differences, in particular urging these ocean carriers, which again, have become extremely profitable in recent years to put forward an offer that is enough to bring the union back to the table and get this hammered out.""

The ongoing union dockworkers' strike has left several U.S. ports on the East and Gulf Coasts at a standstill for days, halting trade at the hubs that collectively handle about half of U.S. imports.

Major retail and business associations are sounding the alarm over the impact the work stoppage could have on the broader economy, and new data shows which companies have shipped the most goods into the affected ports over the past year.

"Voters in critical Michigan county focused on economy, candidate character as 2024 race tightens",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/voters-critical-michigan-county-focused-economy-candidate-character-2024-race-tightens,2024-10-03T18:04:18Z,"Voters in Kent County, Michigan, a swing county in one of the most critical swing states, told Fox News Digital about the issues weighing on their mind and whom they support in the upcoming election.

Voters in Kent County, Michigan, could play a large role in determining who wins November's presidential election, but many voters in the area are still undecided about their choice.

""I think there is too much division in his country. I think people on the left and people on the right hate each other a lot and I don't think that's right,"" said one Kent County voter, who told Fox News Digital he is still undecided.

The comments come as Kent County, which includes Michigan's second-largest city of Grand Rapids and much of the surrounding area, figures to play an outsized role in November.

While Michigan is well-known as one of the seven key swing states in the upcoming election, Kent County figures to be one of the key counties. Holding over 6% of the state's population, the county has traditionally been known as a conservative haven.

TRUMP TAKES NFL, NBA TO TASK ABOUT KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM

However, that trend has started to reverse itself in recent years, starting when former President Barack Obama was able to capture the county in 2008. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, won the county during his presidential bid in 2012, while former President Donald Trump took Kent County in 2016. It went back to Democrats in 2020, when President Biden was able to capture this important part of Michigan.

This year's race promises to feature Kent County again, though some voters there remain unconvinced by the candidates.

""Something which stood out to me about Trump is that he didn't bring us into any wars,"" one undecided voter said before noting that he believed Vice President Kamala Harris' ""stance is a lot clearer on LGBTQ rights.""

Immigration stood out as an issue to some Kent County voters, with one telling Fox News Digital the issue was a matter of human rights.

""People having the rights to be in our country and the rights to health care,"" said0 the voter, who indicated he was voting for Harris.

""Hopefully she can bring down housing costs and pretty much just inflation for young people like myself,"" he added. ""Trying to buy a house, trying to get loans and cars and things like that is very important for people of my age.""

However, another voter disagreed on the economy, arguing Trump is the right candidate to lead the country forward.

""I believe that a person who has run a company, that's been in business, can do a better job than a lifelong politician in terms of making decisions,"" the voter said.

That voter also indicated support for Trump on foreign policy, arguing he garnered the respect of world leaders.

""I think he was not afraid to stand up for what he felt is right,"" he said. ""I think other world leaders took note of that.""

Another voter, who indicated foreign policy was a key issue, disagreed.

""One candidate gets it and the other doesn't,"" the voter, who indicated support for Harris, told Fox News Digital of the reason he is voting for Harris.

""She understands the importance of our standing on the global stage, international politics, and our national security. I don't think Trump understands that,"" the voter continued.

Yet others had more trouble picking a candidate, most notably because of the divisive nature of modern politics.

""One day I'll go one way and another day I'll go another way,"" one undecided voter told Fox News Digital.

""It's hard to take her seriously, nothing sticks out about her,"" she said on Harris, while also noting that he finds it ""very hard to believe"" that someone as rich as Trump "" could care about people that don't have any money.""

The voter also deducted points from Trump because of the ""tone of his voice.""

""The name calling, I don't particularly care for that,"" the voter said."
Trump's newest economic claim is even more wrong than usual,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-newest-economic-claim-even-wrong-usual-rcna173850,2024-10-03T17:59:30Z,"Donald Trump says he's responsible for creating the best economy ever -- even if we include data from 2020. That's demonstrably ridiculous.

It's not uncommon for Democrats to note that Donald Trump left the White House with the worst record on job creation since the Great Depression, with a net loss of over 2 million jobs over four years. Technically, that's true, but I've never been altogether comfortable with the talking point because it lacks context.

To be sure, if we simply tally up all of the monthly job totals from January 2017 (the month of Trump's inauguration) to January 2021 (the month he grudgingly stepped down), the results look dreadful: The Republican was the only president since Herbert Hoover to leave office with the United States having fewer jobs than when he came in.

But the context matters: To arrive at this conclusion, one has to include the Covid-era data, when the pandemic sparked a sudden and sharp recession. To hold Trump directly responsible for the fact that the U.S. economy lost over 20 million jobs in April 2020 has never struck me as altogether fair.

A better assessment, I've long argued, is to focus on the first three years of Trump's term, which have never been as amazing as he's claimed.

The GOP candidate, however, has apparently concluded that my approach is all wrong -- and that there's no reason to exclude the 2020 data. Trump sat down with personal-finance author and radio host Dave Ramsey this week and boasted:

None of this is true. Not even a little.

If we exclude 2020, and focus just on the former president's first three years, Trump's economic record appears fine, but underwhelming. Job growth during the Republican's first three years, for example, not only fell short of his pre-election promises, they were also lower than the job growth from Barack Obama's final three years in office.

How has Trump explained why job growth slowed down after he took office? So far, he hasn't. Instead, he claims the job numbers ""were the best ever,"" which is demonstrably wrong.

Meanwhile, economic growth during the Trump era -- again, before the Covid crisis -- wasn't bad, but it failed to reach 3% GDP growth, it fell short of the kind of growth we saw under other modern presidents, and it didn't come close to the growth the Republican promised to deliver during his 2016 campaign.

But in light of his latest comments, if we take the former president's advice, ""go all four years,"" and include the 2020 data, all of the data looks even worse.

I'm mindful of the fact that Trump might very well win a second term, largely because Americans have been told ad nauseum that his economic record is amazing. But reality tells a very different story."
These Are The EVs The EPA Says Are The Most And Least Energy Efficient,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2024/10/03/these-are-the-evs-the-epa-says-are-the-most-and-least-energy-efficient/,2024-10-03T17:55:11Z,"The number of miles an electric vehicle can run on a charge is inarguably the most important specification for shoppers to consider, as it can make the difference between reaching one's destination or being stranded at the side of the road with a depleted battery. The longest-running EVs on the market can run for as many as 300, even 400 miles on a full charge, but even the most limited of the bunch in this regard at around 150 miles are usually able to accommodate modest commutes.

But an EV's operating range on a charge only tells half the story. In a sense it's like buying a car or truck on the basis of its gas tank capacity, while totally ignoring its fuel economy. An EV that consumes killowatts (kWh) of electricity at a quicker rate than another will cost more to operate, just as a conventionally powered ride that travels fewer miles per gallon will be more expensive to run.

As with gas-fueled cars, EVs are tested for both their operating range and energy consumption under controlled conditions in a laboratory, with the process supervised by the Environmental Protection Agancy (EPA). They're ""driven"" on a dynamometer, which is like a treadmill for cars, using multiple standardized driving schedules to simulate city and highway motoring. An EV begins testing with the battery fully charged, and is operated until it becomes fully drained.

Like other vehicle types, EVs are required by federal law to prominently display the electric-equivalent energy consumption estimates (called MPGe) for city, highway and combined city/highway driving on the so-called Monroney sticker that also shows the vehicle's retail price and other data. The sticker also shows the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity that's needed to run the vehicle for 100 miles (this is expressed as kWh/100 miles). The EPA says this measurement is actually more meaningful when comparing costs and energy consumption between EVs than the MPGe rating.

The sticker also shows the average annual cost to keep an EV running, based on 15,000 miles driven in combined city/highway use at a predetermined cost for electricity. (The EPA's fueleconomy.gov website allows users to tailor these estimates based on actual miles driven and the local cost of electricity.)

Not surprisingly, larger and heavier electrified rides, especially full-size EV pickup trucks and SUVs, are among the biggest kilowatt guzzlers. The worst models here are the brawny GMC Hummer EV Pickup and SUV, which are both rated at a combined 47 MPGe and estimated to consume 72 kWh of electricity per 100 miles driven. By comparison, the Lucid Air sedan is rated at 146 MPGe and just 23 kWh per 100 miles. The latter would average an annual running cost of $500, versus $1,600 for the former. For those keeping score that means a Hummer owner would spend an average $5,500 more in electric bills over a five-year ownership period than one driving a Lucid Air.

Now to be fair, even the worst EVs in this regard will still be cheaper to operate than a gas-powered equivalent. The Chevrolet Silverado EV, for example, is estimated to cost its owners an average $1,200 per year in electricity costs when driven 15,000 miles, while the most powerful conventional version with a 6.2-liter V8 engine will more than triple that amount at a projected $4,100. That's a whopping $14,500 more to keep the gas version running over a five-year period than the EV. What's more, an EV produces zero tailpipe emissions in the process, though the local power plant generating the electricity used to run the vehicle may produce more or less pollutants of its own.

However, as with gas-powered rides it should be noted that an EV's real-world energy consumption depends on a number of variables. Lead-footed acceleration and driving at higher speeds will tend to drain both an EV's battery faster than will maintaining a smooth and steady pace. Driving on under-inflated tires will also cost an EV owner additional kilowatt-hours of electricity, as will driving with a full load of passengers and cargo. An EV will also consume kilowatts far quicker while towing heavy loads and driving in extremely cold or hot weather.

As they say, your mileage may vary.

These are the most and least energy-efficient models among the current fleet of electric vehicles, according to the EPA. We're noting the MPGe ratings, the number of kilowatts it takes to drive 100 miles and the average estimated annual energy costs for the best and worst-performing variants in each model line:"
Chinese EV Firms Are Suffering Losses,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2024/10/03/chinese-ev-firms-are-suffering-losses/,2024-10-03T17:51:24Z,"Beijing had made a big bet on electric vehicles (EV). But like so many other efforts of China's centrally planned economy, things have not gone well. Intense price competition among China's many EV producers as well as waning demand -- both in China and abroad -- have put manufacturers into financial trouble, with some reporting losses despite still considerable public support. Beijing has begun to step away from the effort, leaving local governments to pick up the subsidy slack. It is not a sustainable situation.

This now failing effort began more than five years ago. According to the MIT Technology Review, the raft of subsidies, tax breaks, procurement contracts, and other more oblique incentives to ramp up production and make China dominant has cost Beijing the equivalent of some $230 billion. The push eventually created a market for 13.1 million vehicles that accounted for 60% of EV ownership globally. Beijing also pushed for global sales of Chinese-made EVs. That effort made little headway in the United States even before Washington began to show increased levels of hostility toward China and Chinese products. The effort did, however, have considerable success in Europe.

Now global sales seem set to decline. Washington has imposed tariffs on a number of Chinese products, including EVs and their components as well as Chinese-made batteries and parts. Washington's moves changed little, of course, since Chinese EV's had made little-to-no headway in North America. But tariffs and general levels of hostility do make it clear to Chinese EV producers that they have no hope of eventually making gains in the United States. Further squelching hopes for Chinese EV sales in this country are the difficulties facing the EV efforts of domestic U.S. producers, except perhaps Tesla. Chinese sales would in other words have faced difficulties even if Washington was not hostile. Meanwhile, Europe, where Chinese EV sales had been strong, has begun to complain that China is dumping low-priced vehicles on European markets and in the process is stymying the development of independent European EV production. Accordingly, the EU is ready to place tariffs of up to 45 percent on imports of Chinese EVs, squelching any hopes that Chinese producers can look to robust European sales any time soon.

Beijing, already stuck with other planning errors that have created overcapacities in other areas of China's economy, has backed away from the EV push. It has cut that support back nearly 66% from what it had offered the industry in 2018. Such an action would normally force a consolidation in the industry. Weaker, less efficient firms with poorer products would go out of business after a while, leaving others to find financial health at lower production levels. But that is not what is happening. Instead, local governments, many already in difficult financial straits, have spent to keep what are rapidly becoming zombi firms afloat.

Some regions-Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Changping stand out-have begun offering Chinese EV buyers rebates ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 yuan a vehicle. Some localities are trying to support EV producers more directly. They claim to be doing this in order to retain and expand the high-income workforces associated with EV production. Some of the local governments have little choice. In the salad days when Beijing was giving the industry a lot of support, these local authorities found ways to involve themselves in the effort through direct investments in EV producers or taking out loans and issuing bonds on behalf of these manufacturers. The City of Hefei, for instance, stands to lose its 5-billion-yuan investment in the EV division of NIO, Inc.

This situation is clearly untenable. These local governments already face financial difficulties. They can little afford to support unprofitable companies, especially since a global sales pickup is highly unlikely. Ultimately the consolidation will occur, private investors will face losses as will local governments, even as they also lose the high-income workforces they are striving to retain. China then will face another bump in the road to economic recovery."
YouTube Stars Sam And Colby Prove Creator Appeal Extends To Cinemas,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianshepherd/2024/10/03/youtube-stars-sam-and-colby-prove-creator-appeal-extends-to-cinemas/,2024-10-03T17:51:11Z,"The lines between social media stardom and traditional entertainment continue to blur as top YouTube creators expand their empires into film and beyond. Leading this charge are paranormal investigators Sam and Colby, who are blazing new trails with a nationwide theatrical release, while French adventurer Inoxtag has found success on the big screen in Europe.

Sam and Colby Go Nationwide with Theatrical Release

Known for their ghost hunting expeditions and paranormal content on YouTube, Sam and Colby are taking a big leap with the nationwide theatrical release of their new film ""The Legends of the Paranormal"". Building on the success of last year's limited release, the duo has partnered with Cinemark for a full week-long run in over 350 theaters across the US.

""This one is particularly special because it's not being shared on YouTube,"" Sam explained in an exclusive interview. ""Last year was more of a trial run. We had a one day release partnered with Cinemark, which was amazing, we were able to sell out about 168 theaters nationwide. And because of that, we were able to work this entire year on more of a feature film length version of that video.""

The film, which premieres this week, expands beyond their usual ghost hunting fare. As Sam shared, ""What's interesting about this one is, unlike our usual content, which is primarily about ghost hunting, we were able to expand the search. And so we went to this place called Mount Wilson Ranch, not only in search of the paranormal, but also there have been a lot of alien sightings and the sightings of cryptids or skinwalkers.""

Beyond just translating their YouTube style to the big screen, the theatrical release allows Sam and Colby to expand their storytelling. Sam noted, ""You get to see the raw moments of Sam and Colby, and we get to edit it a little bit more relaxed and different."" Colby added, ""It's a slower paced movie... fans really get to sit back and see us in a different light.""

The duo sees this as just the beginning of their cinematic ambitions. ""Hopefully we get better and better at this, and we bridge the gap more and more to where this becomes at least a yearly event, to where we can start making more and more movies in the future,"" Sam shared.

Colby echoed this sentiment, saying, ""Honestly, the sky's the limit. This is a learning process for us and so if the fans keep enjoying it and we're enjoying it as well, then we're just going to keep making better and better movies and hopefully striking cooler deals as time goes on.""

Hell Week and Expanding the Sam and Colby Universe

While the film represents a major milestone, Sam and Colby aren't slowing down on other fronts. Their annual ""Hell Week"" Halloween event is approaching.

""We can't spill all the beans about it, but we have, some really exciting announcements and news about this spot,"" Colby revealed. ""We spent an entire week where we couldn't leave at all, we had to stay there every single night in this elementary school... it was probably one of the craziest things we've ever experienced.""

Inoxtag Conquers Everest and the French Box Office

While Sam and Colby pioneer in the US market, across the Atlantic, French YouTuber Inoxtag is making waves with his own cinematic debut. His documentary ""Kaizen,"" which chronicles his year-long journey to climb Mount Everest, has become a sensation in French theaters.

Partnering with MK2, a French film group with a dedicated ""YouTube Cinema Club,"" Inoxtag's film sold an astonishing 350,000 movie tickets in just one day. The film's success highlights the power of creator fandom, with Inoxtag's 8.4 million YouTube subscribers eagerly supporting his big-screen debut.

MK2 co-CEO Elisha Karmitz told Variety, ""We thought it would be a success, and that's why we scheduled it in 350 screens, but it was like a tidal wave and a level of enthusiasm that we hadn't seen before.""

Notably, Inoxtag insisted on making the film available in small towns, recognizing that many of his French fans were from rural locations. This strategy paid off, with Karmitz noting that more than 40% of the screens that aired ""Kaizen"" ""are arthouses in small cities throughout France.""

After its theatrical run, Inoxtag made the decision to release the film for free on YouTube, where it has already racked up 24 million views in just four days. This move demonstrates the creator's commitment to his online community, even as he expands into traditional media.

A New Era for Creators

The success of creators like Sam and Colby and Inoxtag in traditional media formats signals a significant shift in the entertainment landscape. These YouTubers are leveraging their massive online followings to break into cinemas and beyond, while still maintaining their core YouTube presence.

This trend is not just a win for individual creators, but a positive sign for the creator economy as a whole. It demonstrates that the skills, audience connections, and storytelling abilities honed on social media platforms can translate to success in more traditional media formats.

As Sam and Colby aptly put it, ""The sky's the limit."" With creators continuing to push boundaries and explore new mediums, the future of entertainment looks increasingly creator-driven. For fans, industry professionals, and aspiring creators alike, this new frontier promises exciting possibilities and a continued blurring of the lines between digital and traditional media."
The Longshoremen Strike Is A Battle Of Workers Versus Automation,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/10/03/the-longshoremen-strike-is-a-battle-of-workers-versus-automation/,2024-10-03T17:37:39Z,"Thousands of longshoremen and dockworkers along the Eastern seaboard of the United States and the Gulf Coast walked off the job on Tuesday after the International Longshoremen's Association failed to reach contract agreements with the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports.

The ILA's initial proposal was for a 77% salary increase over the six-year duration of their contract with USMX, as well as a complete ban on the automation of gates, cranes and container-moving trucks at its ports. These union members earn a base salary of approximately $81,000 each year; however, those who work significant overtime can earn more than $200,000 annually, the Associated Press reported.

To avert the strike, the shipping industry group offered a nearly 50% wage hike on Monday and committed to maintaining the automation restrictions from the previous contract, but the union rejected the deal as it would not protect the workforce from semi-automation.

""The ILA is steadfastly against any form of automation -- full or semi -- that replaces jobs or historical work functions,"" the largest union of maritime workers in North America said in a statement. ""We will not accept the loss of work and livelihood for our members due to automation. Our position is clear: the preservation of jobs and historical work functions is non-negotiable.""

From the picket line at the Maher Terminal in Port Elizabeth, New Jersey, ILA president Harold Daggett reiterated that the union, which boasts upward of 85,000 longshoremen, seeks ""absolute airtight language"" to ensure there will be no automation.

The combined 36 ports on the Atlantic to Gulf coasts play a crucial role in both U.S. and global trade, handling 57% of U.S. container volume and a quarter of annual international trade valued at $3 trillion. According to the Conference Board, this sheer size limits alternative supply chain options for U.S. businesses, making the potential impact of a strike severe. A one-week work stoppage could cost the economy $3.78 billion and drive up consumer goods prices.

The ILA has expressed significant concerns over the implementation of automation, which it believes could reduce the need for human labor. The union seeks to maintain job security in an era where technological advancements are increasingly transforming port operations, and promises to strike until they reach a deal.

""The ILA intends for the demonstrations to continue round the clock, 24/7, for as long as it takes for United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) to meet the demands of ILA rank-and-file members,"" the organization said.

The ascendancy of technology has long been a point of contention between workers and employers since the Industrial Revolution, when mechanized production began replacing manual labor. This tension has only intensified with the rise of artificial intelligence, as the threat of disruption or obsolescence is widespread across various sectors and job functions.

The deployment of robotics and automated technology in ports globally has been a trend aimed at increasing efficiency, reducing costs and ensuring the health and safety of workers in handling the growing volume of cargo.

Although, its adoption in container terminals remains limited in the global shipping industry. According to research published in Maritime Economic and Logistics, as reported by Axios, only 62 out of 1,300 global container terminals were automated or semi-automated by the end of 2021.

U.S. ports are lagging behind their Asian and European counterparts in adopting automation. This technological gap has resulted in slower container ship unloading times at most American ports compared to those in Asia and Europe. Industry experts warn that without embracing more automated systems, U.S. ports risk becoming increasingly less competitive in the global shipping landscape. Additionally, American consumers end up paying for this inefficiency through increased import prices.

The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have led the way in implementing automation among U.S. ports. According to research conducted in 2022 by the Economic Roundtable of Los Angeles, which was commissioned by the West Coast dockworkers union, the introduction of partial automation at these California ports resulted in an annual loss of 572 jobs during 2020 and 2021.

However, data from 2015 to 2021 shows the ILWU workforce in the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports experienced an 11.2% growth, surpassing the 8.4% growth seen at other West Coast ports.

During this same period, the two automated terminals in these ports saw a significant 31.5% increase in paid hours, while non-automated terminals only experienced a 13.9% increase. The substantial difference in paid hours was attributed to efficiency improvements that allowed them to process more than twice the number of containers compared to their non-automated counterparts."
How Americans Think The Election Will Impact Their Personal Finances,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/presidential-election-personal-finance-impact/,2024-10-03T16:32:49Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

The economy is the top issue on the minds of voters heading into the 2024 presidential election, and Americans are divided on which candidate will improve their personal finances, according to a Forbes Advisor and Talker Research survey of 2,000 registered voters. Of these, 48% were Democrats, 39% were Republicans and 10% were independents.

For instance, 48% of respondents said Vice President Kamala Harris would deliver a better economy compared to 44% for former President Donald Trump.

However, 52% said their personal finances were healthier four years ago, when Trump was in office, compared to less than a quarter who said they're doing better now during the Biden Administration.

Voters want the eventual winner to focus on bringing down prices; 60% cited inflation as the top priority for the next administration.

A look at the topline figures paint a positive picture of the public's appetite for a potential Harris Administration.

Nearly half (48%) of respondents said the economy would improve under her presidency, compared to 36% who said it would worsen. Another 16% said it wouldn't change.

Meanwhile, 44% said that a Trump Administration would bode well for the nation's economic future, while 42% believed the economy would suffer. A seventh (14%) replied that the economy wouldn't change much in a second Trump Administration.

But when you drill down on the specific issues that affect personal finances, including borrowing costs and the stock market, Americans seemed to have a better appreciation for a Trump victory.

More than half of respondents (52%) said their finances are worse than four years ago, compared to just 23% who think they're better off. Another 20% said they were about the same, while another 5% weren't sure.

Republicans (70%) and independents (65%) were far more likely to think they're finances have gotten worse over the past four years than Democrats (35%).

This finding jibes with a series of data points and sentiment surveys.

For instance, median household income adjusted for inflation was higher in 2019 ($81,210) than in 2023 ($80,610), according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Just 31% of Americans believe the economy is getting better, according to Gallup, which is down from 51% at the end of 2019.

High prices continue to plague the American consumer.

Even as the rate of inflation has come down, prices are still growing much faster than the Fed's preferred target of 2%.

The personal consumption expenditures (core PCE) price index that strips out volatile food and energy prices, which is the Fed's preferred gauge, rose by 2.7% in August over the previous 12 months.

That's why 60% respondents in our survey think that easing the cost of living should be the top priority of a future Harris or Trump administration.

The next most important issues, lowering income taxes and creating more jobs, were each selected by just 10% of respondents.

Those results dovetail with what Americans say is impacting their decision this November.When asked to name the two biggest economic issues in the election, nearly three-quarters (74%) identified inflation. The second most popular response was healthcare expenses at just 33%.

This is a bipartisan issue: 79% of Republicans and 69% of Democrats selected inflation as one of their biggest concerns.

Americans are likely taking their vote seriously since 68% of respondents either somewhat or strongly agree that the president has a tangible impact on their financial situation.

Meanwhile, 54% think macroeconomic events, such as inflation or stock market performance, have the biggest impact on their financial health, compared to just 20% who say their personal choices are more important.

That makes sense given the massive events American consumers have faced over the past four years, from pandemic-era business and school closures to stimulus checks to sky-high inflation.

While folks believe that the outcome of the election will impact their personal finances, few will wait for a winner before making financial decisions.

In 2016, while President Barack Obama, a Democrat, was finishing his final year in office, those with a Democratic party identification were optimistic about the economy (+18), according to Gallup's U.S. Economic Confidence Index, while Republicans were gloomy (-31).

In 2017, when Obama was replaced by Trump, a Republican, the two sides flipped. Republicans (+46) were now ecstatic, while Democrats (-20) were miserable.

Independents were even-keeled throughout.

Obviously, these voters were viewing events through their partisan lens; people's fortunes didn't radically shift overnight.

This can have real consequences.

A Democratic voter who believed Trump would bring a market collapse missed out on years of stock market gains, for instance.

While your political passions may run hot, don't let them influence how you operate your personal budget.

Of course, big events impact your personal finances. Anyone who has lived through the past four years may have seen wild fluctuations in the value of their home, the interest rate on their high-yield savings account or the annual percentage rate (APR) on their credit card.

Where you run into trouble, though, is believing that these events have a bigger impact on your financial health than your own actions.

Research shows that financial self-efficacy, which is the belief that you're in control of your fate, is key to financial success.

Yes, big stuff happens. But big stuff always happens. The 2000s, for instance, were bookended by two recessions that led to a lost decade for stocks and a housing bubble burst.

You can thrive by learning how to navigate rough waters.

China Market Update: Hong Kong Takes Breather As Fiscal Policy Bazooka Awaits,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brendanahern/2024/10/03/china-market-update-hong-kong-takes-breather-as-fiscal-policy-bazooka-awaits/,2024-10-03T16:27:22Z,"Asian equities were lower on Middle East tension and a stronger US dollar except for Japan, which rose on a weaker yen as Mainland China is on holiday until next Tuesday. South Korea was closed for National Day, and Taiwan for a typhoon again.

Yes, Hong Kong was lower/took a breather from the recent epic run, though the Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech closed well above intra-day lows of -4.46% and -7.45%, indicating some bought the dip. Yesterday's top performers, such as internet and real estate, were today's worst performers. Investors understandably took some profits after the Hang Seng jumped 31% from September 11 and +50% since the January 22 low. Before today's pullback, the Hang Seng Tech was up +50% since September 9 and +71% since its bottom on January 31.

Bloomberg News had a good piece articulating why investors bought today's dip as former Ministry of Finance economist Jia Kang stated the Chinese government could issue RMB 4 trillion to RMB 10 trillion of government bonds to ""...lift confidence by drastically raising government investment in pubic projects"". Issuing long-term government debt at these low interest rates makes sense. RMB 7 trillion of stimulus would be 5.5% of GDP (China's GDP is $18 trillion), higher than our estimates/chatter of 1.5% to 3% of GDP. Yes, the monetary policy bazooka has been fired. However, it is critical to understand fiscal policy support hasn't been fully articulated, though it is coming based on last Thursday's release from President Xi and the Politburo. That would mean there is more likely to be more good news in the coming weeks, right?

As China's economy recovers, Chinese economic data will improve as year-over-year comparisons make for easy comparisons, i.e., more good news. Sell-side analysts have only started upgrading price targets for a few internet names. At the same time, most strategists haven't made any significant China overweight adjustments, nor have any economists reversed their recent downgrades of China's GDP. Those positive developments will happen over time, ie, more good news. Are investors prepared for this? I don't think so, as Q3 review/Q4 outlook investment committee meetings, board meetings, and trustee meetings are taking place.

The re-rating of Chinese equities is in a very early stage as pullbacks/corrections, such as today, will happen, which is a good thing/healthy. Next Tuesday will be must watch TV as the Mainland market and Southbound Stock Connect reopen. It is worth noting that Meituan was Hong Kong's most heavily traded by value as the stock bucked the downdraft +3.96% at a level 3X the pre-rally levels, trading 78mm shares versus its 1-year average of 37mm. Hong Kong still traded 282% of the 1-year average. As we reported yesterday, brokerage stocks also bucked the downdraft on reports of sixty brokerage houses remaining open to open new accounts. Yicai Global reported that the number of Chinese traveling by rail hit a record on Tuesday with 21.45mm railway trips as an anticipated 175mm passenger trips are expected over the 10-day national holiday.

Ohio GOP Senate candidate Moreno hits Brown on Inflation Reduction Act vote in ad that's part of $25M buy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ohio-gop-senate-candidate-moreno-hits-brown-inflation-reduction-act-vote-ad-thats-part-25m-buy,2024-10-03T16:19:51Z,"FIRST ON FOX - Ohio Republican Bernie Moreno is hitting incumbent Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown on his Inflation Reduction Act vote in a new ad that's part of a $25 million new buy ahead of Election Day.

The 30-second ad spot, which will run on television and digitally, opens with a single mother from Versailles, Ohio, saying she can't believe the current prices for groceries.

""It's a lot tougher to provide for my kids with the Democrats' inflation,"" the woman, Carla, says. ""Sherrod Brown's only made things worse. Brown supported Kamala, not us, and voted for her radical Inflation Act, and now prices are at a 40-year-high. Bernie Moreno will fight to lower prices and stop inflation. That's why I trust Bernie Moreno to help Ohio families.""

The ad, first obtained by Fox News Digital in advance of its planned roll out, also includes the message on screen: ""Sherrod Brown voted for Kamala's Inflation Act.""

VIRGINIA SENATE DEBATE: CLINTON EX-RUNNING MATE KAINE, GOP CHALLENGER CAO SPAR ON IMMIGRATION, DEI IN MILITARY

It was paid for by Bernie Moreno for Senate and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

""Hardworking Ohioans are suffering under the record-high inflation created by Kamala Harris and Sherrod Brown,"" Moreno said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""While he claims to fight for Ohio, families are unable to afford basic necessities. In November, we will send him packing and get our economy back on track.""

Moreno's campaign told Fox News Digital that the ad is part of an additional $25 million in spending. It comes just 33 days before the Nov. 5 election. Early voting in Ohio starts Oct. 8.

The contest is on track to be the most expensive Senate race this cycle, with $310.4 million in spending from both campaigns as of August, according to Axios.

As of August, Moreno shelled out $158.4 million and Brown spent $152 million, Axios reported.

Brown's campaign announced Wednesday it will report raising nearly $31 million in the third quarter.

Fox News has labeled the race between Moreno and Brown as a toss-up.

NRA TARGETS SEN SHERROD BROWN IN 7-FIGURE AD BUY IN OHIO: 'VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT'

Fox News Digital reached out to Brown's campaign and congressional office for comment about the new ad but did not immediately hear back.

Ohio is center stage on the presidential ticket this cycle with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, as former President Trump's vice presidential running mate. Moreno ran against Vance in the 2022 GOP Republican primary for Senate, which Vance won, and has supported the Trump-Vance bid for the White House.

In August 2023, on the one-year anniversary of President Biden signing his Inflation Reduction Act into law, Brown's campaign issued a statement championing the legislation as having included ""key priorities Brown fought for to save Ohioans money, crack down on Wall Street stock buybacks, and attract investment and good-paying jobs to Ohio.""

""The Inflation Reduction Act is already saving Ohioans money at the pharmacy counter and spurring Ohio to lead the country in manufacturing the technology of the future - and those cost savings and Ohio jobs will only grow in the coming years,"" Brown said in a statement at the time.

As of August 2024, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) in the Midwest - which includes Ohio - rose by 2.6% over the last 12 months.

The bureau said the index for all items, less food and energy, advanced 3.2% over the year, while food prices increased 1.8%. Energy prices declined 2.6%, ""largely the result of decreasing prices for gasoline,"" it added."

After Hurricane Helene devastated much of the southeastern U.S., survivors of the wreckage wrought by the storm are grappling with another issue: How to pay for goods and services. Across much of the region, particularly in the hardest hit areas, credit card networks have been disabled in tandem with power and internet outages. Merchants who managed to open their doors were sometimes demanding that customers use cash only because of an inability to process credit or debit card transactions. [Payments Dive]

The Buying Power of Your Credit Card Points Is Tanking

Inflation is eroding the value of credit card points that are converted to dollars, losing about 20% of their purchasing power since 2018. Airlines and hotels are changing the points needed to redeem flights and rooms to reflect cash prices that have risen with inflation. Experts recommend redeeming points soon after earning them to avoid ""pointsflation"" and suggest using cards with easily transferable points to get the best deals. [The Wall Street Journal]

U.S. Senator Warren Asks Regulator to Impose Growth Curbs on Citi

A prominent Democratic U.S. senator called on a top regulator on Wednesday to impose growth restrictions on Citigroup as the Wall Street bank struggles to fix ongoing regulatory problems. In a letter to Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that Citi's years-long struggle to fix data, controls and other management problems show it has become ""too big to manage"" and should be curtailed. A prominent bank critic who has previously taken aim at Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and others, Warren cannot force Hsu to take action but her letter can still put pressure on him to be tough on Citi, and draws more attention to the bank's problems.

Mastercard to Buy Swedish Startup That Makes It Easier to Manage and Cancel Subscription Plans

Mastercard said it's agreed to acquire Minna Technologies, a software firm that makes it easier for consumers to manage their subscriptions. The move comes as Mastercard and its primary payment network rival Visa are rapidly attempting to expand beyond their core credit and debit card businesses into technology services, such as cybersecurity, fraud prevention, and pay-by-bank payments. The payments giant said that the deal, along with other initiatives it's committed to around subscriptions, will allow it to give consumers a way to access all their subscriptions in a single view, whether inside your banking app or a central ""hub.""

UK Banks to Put Four-Day Hold on Suspicious Payments

UK Banks will have the power to pause payments for up to four days to give them more time to investigate fraud, the government has said. Currently, transfers must be processed or declined by the end of the next business day, but the new law will allow an extension of three more days. For years, banks have needed to have reasonable grounds to suspect fraud before being able to investigate but have also faced pressure from customers who want payments to be made instantly. The long-proposed new regulations will come into force at the end of October, later than originally planned. [BBC]

E-payments Are Essential in China, But Still Tricky for Foreign Visitors

China's digital economy has been evolving at a faster pace since the pandemic. Daily tasks like calling a cab or ordering and paying at a restaurant are all done mostly through Alipay and WeChat. According to the Chinese central bank, in 2023 there were 340 trillion yuan ($48 trillion) worth of third-party online payments. Alipay and WeChat make up over 90% of mobile payments. However, it has not been easy for foreigners to sign up for the payment apps. To attract more foreign visitors, cities like Shanghai, aided by the country's central bank, have pushed to make mobile payments more visitor-friendly. Foreigners residing in China must provide passport details and a scan of their passport information page. [Marketplace]

Average Cost of Credit Card Processing Fees

You can give your customers more payment options by accepting credit cards, but you will pay a credit card processing fee to do this. The average credit card processing fee, which will be taken out of a merchant's sales revenue, is in the range of about 1.5% to 3.5%. Merchants can negotiate their card processing fees, and they are not set in stone. [Bankrate]

Baby Boomers Still Have the Highest Credit Limits

A recent Experian survey found that baby boomers have an average credit limit of $41,906, up nearly 4% from the year before and more than three-times the average for Generation Z ($12,899). While it's tempting to be jealous of other people's financial positions, there are some good reasons why baby boomers outpace everyone else with their credit limits. For one, boomers have decades-long credit histories. Lenders love long credit histories, and those who've paid their bills on time have likely earned higher limits. Second, baby boomers generally have a higher credit score than most generations, with an average score of 743. [The Motley Fool]

43% of Americans Have at Least One Unused Gift Card

More than 2 in 5 Americans have at least one gift card, gift voucher or store credit they haven't used. The average amount in unused gift cards, gift vouchers or store credit is $244 per person. More than 1 in 3 Americans have lost money with a gift card misstep. The data shows that 55 percent of households with annual incomes of $100,000+ have at least one unused gift card, more than any other income bracket. The average amount of unused gift cards for this income bracket is $348. This contrasts sharply with households making under $50,000 annually. Just 35 percent of them have unused gift cards with an average value of $180. [Bankrate]

Visa Launches Spend Management Partnership with Denmark's Cardlay

Danish FinTech Cardlay is working with Visa to improve spend management for commercial card issuers. The partnership combines Cardlay's spend management platform with Visa's market position, payment network and data capabilities to offer clients ""fully embedded"" commercial cards and expense management solutions. Research by PYMNTS Intelligence has projected that the global value of virtual card transactions will grow from about $2 trillion to $6.8 trillion by 2026, a sign of the growing recognition of their simplicity and security when compared to outdated methods such as paper checks. The research also showed that 55% of companies were using virtual cards more frequently. [PYMNTS]"
"Biden will 'wreck' US economy by failing to intervene in dockworkers' port strike, GOP leader warns",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-wreck-u-s-economy-failing-intervene-dockworkers-port-strike-gop-leader-warns,2024-10-03T15:26:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., slammed President Biden for failing to intervene in the dockworkers' port strike, expressing concern over the impact it will have on American families who are already struggling with crippling inflation.

Scalise accused Biden of potentially allowing the strike to ""wreck"" the U.S. economy during ""Fox & Friends,"" arguing that consumers will struggle even more with rising costs as the International Longshoremen's Association's (ILA) strike drags on.

PORT STRIKE WILL BRING ANOTHER HIT TO FARMERS, SAYS FORMER TRUMP OFFICIAL

""The president said we're just going to let it go on and wreck the economy,"" Scalise told Lawrence Jones. ""We're losing over $5 billion a day and costs are going to start going up even higher on families who are already struggling under the Biden-Harris inflation economy. Food on the shelves is going to become more scarce.""

Although Biden could invoke the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act to intervene in the strike, he has insisted against taking action. Under that law, Biden could enact an 80-day ""cooling off"" period for negotiations to resume while workers are back at work.

The ILA, which represents 45,000 dockworkers, began its first strike since 1977 after its six-year contract with the U.S. Maritime Alliance (USMX), which represents port employers, expired Monday night.

The 36 ports impacted by the strike on the Gulf and East coasts handle 55% of all U.S. container traffic and large volumes of exports, including about half of U.S. pork and almost three-quarters of U.S. poultry. About half of all imported fruits and vegetables come through these ports as well. In pharmaceuticals, nine out of 10 imports and seven out of 10 exports are being disrupted.

Negotiations between the ILA and USMX have been deadlocked thus far over the union's demands related to wage hikes and compensation, as well as protection from automation at ports.

Scalise argued that Congress would not support a ban on automation despite demands from the ILA.

""When we're competing globally, we're not just competing one city against another,"" he said. ""You've got ports all around the world that are heavily automated, and they still have humans, by the way, who actually run the devices. These automated devices aren't running themselves, but they're already making with overtime over $200,000 a year, in some cases, and they want to shut the economy down to get more.""

THE TAFT-HARTLEY ACT: WHY BIDEN COULD USE THIS LABOR TO PREEMPT A PORT STRIKE

""Who pays for this? And this will add even more to inflation,"" he continued. ""There are a lot of families making 50,000 a year that are saying please stop adding to the costs, and Biden and Harris won't do anything because they want to see those prices keep going.""

Meanwhile, the president has faced fierce scrutiny for spending numerous days at the beach while the nation faces implications of the strike along with various other crises - the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and surging violence in the Middle East.

""We see Joe Biden on the beach. He comes to the White House whenever he wants to,"" Jones said. ""Kamala Harris is on the campaign trail. The Cabinet members are just on the Sunday shows as allies of Kamala Harris. You're in leadership of our government, but who's running the country right now?""

""It's a really scary thought,"" Scalise responded. ""When you look at some of the bills we passed, we passed bills to secure the southern border. Joe Biden came out, said he's against it. Kamala Harris said she's against it. We have bills to produce our own American energy, so we don't need to give Iran and Russia billions of dollars a month. President Biden and Kamala Harris oppose that, so... you see a clear divide. The country is going to speak really loudly on this.""

""I think JD Vance said it best at the debate the other night,"" he continued. ""Kamala Harris talks about what you do on the first day. Kamala Harris's first day was 1,400 days ago, and look at the results. The world's on fire. Americans can't drive to go to the grocery store, let alone put food on the table."""
The Best Dividend Plays For Fed Rate Cuts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/10/03/the-best-dividend-plays-for-fed-rate-cuts/,2024-10-03T14:52:20Z,"Now that Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell has pivoted towards his ""other mandate,"" we should take a cue from my six-year-old, who yells from the back seat:

""FedEx!""

For years she has been enamored with the FedEx Corp (FDX) logo. Neither her sister nor her parents are sure why, but the affinity is real. See a truck on the road, yell ""FedEx!"" loudly to score the point.

I didn't have the heart to tell her that FedEx disappointed investors with a sanguine outlook a couple of weeks ago. The stock corrected lower, as usually does after earnings.

(Seriously, the best time to buy FedEx lately has been right after the company talks to Wall Street and the suits sell their shares. They rally in between earnings calls.)

FedEx is the type of stock I always watch, waiting for a pullback. It directly benefits from a megatrend, a bull market in e-commerce sales. E-commerce as a percentage of retail sales gained for two decades and then spiked in 2020. After a brief respite, e-comm sales are heading to new all-time highs:

FedEx is increasingly fulfilling e-comm shipments. My in-house FedEx fan recently received her brand-new rainbow basketball via her favorite courier via my order from DICK's Sporting Goods (DKS).

Instead, FedEx got the call and this beautiful roundball -- sans air -- was shoved into a shoebox.

FedEx may be delivering even more rainbow basketballs shoved into shoeboxes thanks to an accommodative Fed. Chair Jay Powell spent the last two years focusing solely on the Fed's key mandate: stable prices. Now, he needs to make an about-face and hit the second mandate -- labor. So long, inflation concerns and hello, accommodation!

With lower rates and quiet QE on the menu, it is time to ask ourselves ""what if"" the economy surprises everyone and the Fed stimulus fuels growth. After all, the economy has been growing since April 2020. Rates are down 50 ""bips"" with more to come. What if we see neither a hard or soft landing but rather no landing at all?

In this scenario. FedEx benefits. In fact its stock price has 40% upside from here just to catch up with its ever-rising dividend.

And our Fed isn't the only dovish central bank! Last week the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced a sweeping set of stimulus measures. The PBoC lowered interest rates (including mortgage rates) and announced ""stock market support"" plans to help companies buy back their own shares and to allow investors to borrow against their portfolios.

Yee haw, China! Shares of Chinese firms spiked last week and copper miners popped with them.

Energy prices have, thus far, remained subdued. But this flood of global liquidity is obviously supportive of dividend king Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP ). When energy prices jump, the pipeline stocks that AMLP owns boost their dividends. Just look:

However! If you cleverly own the stock through AMLP, no K-1! Just a normal 1099 showing your sweet dividends received. Which dish an elite 8% as I write today, supported by central banks everywhere."
"Virginia Senate debate: Clinton ex-running mate Kaine, GOP challenger Cao spar on immigration, DEI in military",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-senate-debate-clinton-ex-running-mate-kaine-gop-challenger-cao-spar-immigration-dei-military,2024-10-03T13:08:23Z,"Virginia Gov. Glen Youngkin joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the 2024 election as early voting starts in the key swing state.

U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican challenger Hung Cao clashed on the debate stage Wednesday night on a range of issues including immigration, education and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the military.

Kaine, who previously served as governor of Virginia and was Hillary Clinton's vice presidential running mate in 2016, made his case during the hourlong showdown at Norfolk State University on why he should keep his seat in the upper chamber of Congress. The only debate of the campaign focused on national issues and matters that resonate in Virginia and the coastal city of Norfolk, which is home to the country's largest Navy base.

Cao, a 25-year Navy veteran endorsed by former President Donald Trump, criticized COVID vaccine mandates for service members and the Biden-Harris administration's botched Afghanistan withdrawal when asked about the military's collective failure to recently meet recruiting goals. He also criticized DEI efforts.

""When you're using a drag queen to recruit for the Navy, that's not the people we want,"" Cao said. ""What we need is alpha males and alpha females who are going to rip out their own guts, eat them and ask for seconds. Those are the young men and women that are going to win wars.""

VIRGINIA SCHOOL BOARD TO PAY 'WRONGFULLY FIRED' TEACHER WHO REFUSED TO USE STUDENT'S PREFERRED PRONOUNS

Kaine, who is on the Senate Armed Services Committee, responded by saying that railing at DEI ""is a red herring"" and the real challenge is informing more Americans about the benefits of the military when only about 1% of the population serves in the armed forces. ""We need to do a better job of talking about the G.I. Bill and other benefits as well as the tremendous leadership training that you get in the military,"" Kaine said.

Cao, meanwhile, brought up the G.I. Bill when challenging Kaine on student loan forgiveness. The incumbent Democrat had praised the Biden administration for having forgiven ""the loans of more than a million public servants in thanks for the public service they provide, whether it's in the military, whether it's teaching, whether it's working as a frontline health professional or working for a local or state government.""

The moderator then posed a question to Cao on how the Republican candidate would ease the burden, noting that the U.S. Department of Education reports more than a million Virginians owe a collective $43 billion in federal student debt as of last October, impacting their ability to contribute to the state's economy.

""If you're struggling to pay for your school, then get a G.I. Bill,"" Cao said. ""That means go out and serve in the military. You'll get a stipend as well as tuition. We need to fix education, and we need to do it now. But here's the thing with people like Senator Kaine, you've been an officer for 30 years in various offices, in the U.S. Senate for 12. Why have you not fixed it yet?""

VIRGINIA FAA CONTRACTOR ALLEGEDLY SPIED FOR IRAN, SHARED PRIVATE INFO ON US AIRPORTS, ENERGY INDUSTRY: DOJ

Kaine responded by saying Virginia ""was named the best state for a child to be raised in the United States"" and ""the best managed state and the best state to do business"" when he was governor from 2006 to 2010.

""Oh, again, he says what he's going to do,"" Cao shot back. ""Honestly, of the 227 bills that Senator Kaine has proposed, only three of them made it through... That's a 99% failure rate.""

""Check the tape on that. That's completely wrong,"" Kaine insisted.

However, Cao retorted, ""There's two truths in the world, okay? Never walk into a target store wearing a red shirt and never go against an Asian when it comes to math. Trust me.""

""He's got a 99% failure rate,"" Cao added. ""If I just had 99% failure rate, and I defused bombs, I wouldn't be here right now.""

The moderator also pressed Cao, whose family fled Vietnam during the 1970s, on whether he supports the mass deportation of ""all undocumented immigrants.""

""When Vietnam fell, we had nowhere to go, and America had brought us in and my parents waited in line for seven years. We all did for seven years to get our citizenship. The last thing that my dad had [hung] over his bed when he passed away two years ago was his naturalization certificate. I love this country so much that I wrote a blank check - up to including my life - to defend it for 25 years in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia and other parts of the world,"" Cao said. ""Here's my thing to anybody who wants to come here, don't ask for an American dream. If you're not willing to be American laws and embrace the American culture, because I did.""

""If you come here illegally, then you need to leave, especially if you're a violent crime person,"" Cao said, citing new Immigration and Customs Enforcement data provided to lawmakers last week.

""There are 13,000 convicted murderers and 16,000 convicted rapists that came across under their watch. That's unacceptable. We need to protect Americans every single day,"" Cao said.

""If you came here illegally, you've basically screwed up the whole system,"" Cao said. ""You can't jump the line - I mean, you go to Costco and jump the line, what do you think is going to happen? You can't come here and expect the American dream if you're not willing to obey the American laws and embrace the American culture.""

""Deport anybody that's committing crimes right now,"" he added. ""That's the first thing we need. Secure the border.""

Kaine said he never supported mass amnesty but believes it would ""devastate the economy"" to deport the 10 million illegal immigrants who crossed the border during the Biden-Harris administration - a figure the moderator cited and the Democratic candidate echoed. He also slammed former President Donald Trump for asking Republicans to oppose the last congressional border deal.

""We recently negotiated a very tough border deal that would have put a lot of resources on the border to stop illegal immigration,"" Kaine said. ""President Trump asked for Republicans to oppose it, even though it was supported by the border control union.""

Another subject was Trump's proposal to place more tariffs on imported goods.

""What we need to do is not tax our industry here,"" Cao said. ""What we need to do is tax other countries bringing in goods.""

Kaine criticized Trump's proposal. ""The Trump tariffs would be a massive tax that would cause prices on all of these items that are imported to go up,"" Kaine said. ""On that, I differ strongly from my opponent.""

With Kaine's seat considered solidly Democratic, the race has not seen the kind of dead-heat polling as the national presidential contest or the high-stakes drama of other Senate races such as those in Montana and Ohio, where Democratic incumbents face tough re-election bids, according to The Associated Press.

Trump has endorsed Cao, and political scientists say his path to victory is narrow given Virginia's moderate electorate, aversion to Trump in 2020 and Kaine's salience with voters, according to the AP.

Kaine won his last race in 2018 by 16 percentage points, although he said he was preparing for a tough race this year. The most recent Republican from Virginia to hold a U.S. Senate seat was the late John Warner, a centrist with an independent streak who last won in 2002.

Author Darlene Cordero Is Helping Healers Turn Purpose Into Profit,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleemariepreston/2024/10/03/author-darlene-cordero-is-helping-healers-turn-purpose-into-profit/,2024-10-03T13:05:17Z,"The wellness industry has evolved far beyond its niche origins, emerging as a mainstream force in media, entertainment, and consumer culture. What was once limited to self-help books and exclusive retreats is now front and center in mass media, with influencers, celebrities, and thought leaders championing holistic living. The global wellness economy, valued at $5.6 trillion in 2022, is projected to exceed 8.7 trillion by 2027, fueled by increasing interest in the healing arts, mental health, and other spiritual practices.

Amid this booming landscape, Darlene Cordero has become a transformative figure within the sector. An author, strategist, and thought leader, Cordero has been instrumental in shaping the careers of some of the most prominent names in wellness, including Deepak Chopra and Jay Shetty, including a collaboration with reggaeton superstar J Balvin. With her new book, The Healer's Playbook: Empowering Wellness Entrepreneurs, she offers a blueprint for those looking to turn their spiritual gifts into thriving businesses.

With more than a decade of experience as a business strategist, Cordero has mastered the art of merging purpose with profitability -- a skill she shares generously in The Healer's Playbook. Each page offers readers practical tools, reflective prompts, and actionable strategies to help them craft clear, meaningful goals that align with both their personal and professional aspirations. For many wellness entrepreneurs, the challenge often lies in balancing the heart-centered work of healing with the pragmatic demands of running a business.

Exploring that balance further, Cordero sat down for an interview with ForbesBLK contributor Ashlee Marie Preston to discuss the inspiration behind The Healer's Playbook and her vision for empowering wellness entrepreneurs.

Ashlee Marie Preston: The Healer's Playbook has hardly been out a week and is already resonating with so many wellness entrepreneurs, spiritual teachers, and healers. What inspired you to write this book, and what impact do you hope it will have on those who read it?

Darlene Cordero: When I worked at Chopra Global as the Director of Talent and Partnerships, I saw a significant gap in the wellness industry. While millions of dollars are funneled into wellness brands, products, and apps, very few resources are directed toward the practitioners -- the healers, yoga instructors, meditation teachers, and therapists who are at the heart of this work. These individuals carry the responsibility of guiding others toward healing and care, yet they often lack the tools and resources to navigate the business side of their practice and their own self-care. I've walked alongside them, witnessed their challenges, and realized there wasn't a comprehensive guide to help them balance their deeper purpose with the realities of running a sustainable business.

This realization, combined with my own experience working on impactful projects like the ""Renew Yourself: Body, Mind, Spirit"" 21-Day Meditation Challenge with J Balvin and Deepak Chopra, where we brought meditation tools to Spanish-speaking communities that had never been reached before, solidified my vision for The Healer's Playbook. That collaboration wasn't just about bringing mindfulness to a new audience -- it was about creating a bridge between culture and wellness, offering tools for deep personal growth, and ensuring the wisdom holders behind these practices were supported as well.

Through The Healer's Playbook, I want to continue this work, not just for the communities who benefit from these practices, but also for the healers themselves. My hope is that this book provides a roadmap for aligning their purpose with sustainable growth, empowering them to feel less alone in their entrepreneurial journey. Whether it's helping them refine their business model, find their voice, or make meaningful connections, I want them to walk away feeling equipped, inspired, and ready to embrace their unique path with confidence.

Preston: As you've mentioned, you have worked with some of the biggest names in the wellness industry, including Deepak Chopra and Jay Shetty. What key lessons have you learned from these experiences, and how have they influenced your own approach to wellness and business?

Cordero: I feel very fortunate to work with these brands and individuals who have and continue to lead with such impact and reach. I love that they are bold in forging a path of knowledge and wisdom from their teachers and lineage. I resonate deeply with the idea of passing down teachings and stories, and now with advancements in media and technology, more people -- no matter where they are in the world or their stage of personal growth -- can access this knowledge. They can take what resonates with them at the moment, whether it's staying true to one lineage or mixing elements to create something authentic to who they are.

Deepak Chopra has been a guiding figure, showing me how crucial it is to lead with authenticity and alignment. The Jay Shetty Coaching School, which has been a client, has demonstrated the importance of making coaching accessible to a wide audience. I became a Life Coach this past year and loved the program and community. Through the school, I've seen how personal growth tools and wisdom can be spread in a modern way that aligns with people's lives and stages of development. These experiences have taught me the value of creating your own path and not trying to be anyone but yourself. Both have been authentic in their journeys, not trying to follow anyone else's path but their own. That's something I've taken to heart -- staying true to your own inner knowing, and from there, creating and leading boldly.

Preston: Many wellness practitioners struggle to balance their passion for healing with the practicalities of running a business. What advice would you give to someone just starting out in the wellness industry?

Cordero: One of the biggest challenges wellness practitioners face is balancing their passion for healing with the often overwhelming realities of running a business. My advice? Embrace both. As much as you may want to focus solely on the healing and service you provide, it's essential to learn the business fundamentals that will support your practice in the long term. Too often, I hear practitioners say, ""I'm not good at marketing"" or ""I don't know anything about business."" These mental blocks prevent them from learning and moving their business forward with confidence. My advice is to stay curious.

You don't have to become an expert in everything, but understanding the basics of pricing, branding, and client acquisition will make you a more empowered entrepreneur. When you approach these aspects with an open mind, you'll not only learn but also better understand the experts you may eventually hire to support you. Additionally, surrounding yourself with a community of like-minded individuals is key. Find mentors, build a network, and seek out resources that support both your personal and professional growth. The wellness industry can feel isolating, but when you align yourself with others who share your vision, the journey becomes far less daunting.

Preston: One of the most admirable things about you is your unyielding spirit. You've recently opened up about your journey with stage four cancer; yet that hasn't deterred you from your life's purpose. How has your health journey shaped the way you approach your work, both as an entrepreneur and as a healer?

Cordero: This journey has fundamentally shifted how I approach every aspect of my life. When you're faced with your own mortality, you're forced to reevaluate what truly matters. For me, it has brought a heightened sense of clarity and purpose. Every moment, every interaction, and every decision now feels more intentional. The diagnosis didn't stop my ambitions; it fueled them. I realized that life is precious and fleeting, and I no longer have time to second-guess my decisions or hold back. This experience has taught me to lead with more presence, more gratitude, and a deep sense of surrender -- not surrender in a passive way, but surrender in the sense of trusting the process, even when the outcome is unknown. It has also deepened my empathy for others. I understand, on a visceral level, that healing is not linear, and it's not just physical -- it's emotional, spiritual, and mental. This perspective allows me to show up in my work with more authenticity, and it has made me laser-focused on creating meaningful, lasting impact in everything I do.

Preston: One of the major themes in The Healer's Playbook is the importance of storytelling in business. Can you share more about how healers and wellness practitioners can use storytelling to grow their practice?

Cordero: Storytelling is one of the most powerful tools available. It's how we connect with our clients, share our values, and demonstrate the transformation we can offer. In The Healer's Playbook, I write, ""Healing begins when you honor your story and use it to light the path for others."" When practitioners share their personal journey -- whether it's how they discovered their passion for healing, the challenges they've faced, or the lessons they've learned -- they create a deeper connection with their communities. This allows potential clients to see themselves in that story and feel more confident that they're in the right place. Storytelling also humanizes your brand. It's not just about what services you offer; it's about why you offer them. The more you can share your authentic self, the more naturally you will attract the right clients and opportunities.

Preston: In your book, you emphasize the value of building authentic relationships in the wellness industry. What are some of the ways entrepreneurs can foster meaningful connections and community within their work?

Cordero: At the heart of any successful wellness business is connection -- true, authentic relationships built on trust and service. One of the most effective ways to foster these relationships is by approaching each interaction with a mindset of ""How can I serve?"" rather than ""What can I gain?"" Being present, offering support, and listening deeply are all essential to creating meaningful connections. It's also important to maintain integrity in everything you do, whether that's in how you run your business or how you show up in partnerships. Authenticity builds trust, and trust builds lasting relationships. Lastly, don't be afraid to collaborate. Some of the most powerful partnerships I've seen come from wellness practitioners working together to amplify their reach and impact. The key is to focus on how you can create value for others, and in turn, the right opportunities and connections will flow to you.

Preston: As the wellness industry continues to grow, what trends or shifts do you foresee in the coming years, and how can wellness entrepreneurs prepare for these changes?

Cordero: The wellness industry is expanding at an incredible pace, and we're seeing wellness become more integrated into everyday life. However, mental health remains a significant challenge, both in America and globally. A recent report from Mental Health America showed that nearly 60 million adults in the U.S. experienced a mental illness in 2021-2022, with more than 12.8 million reporting serious thoughts of suicide -- the highest number ever recorded. Youth are particularly affected, with 13% of young people aged 12-17 experiencing serious thoughts of suicide.

As wellness becomes more ingrained in the public consciousness, we're also seeing a rise in accessibility and the democratization of wellness tools. Therapy, meditation, nature walks, and practices like breathwork are becoming more widely accepted. I see technology, especially AI, playing a significant role in making wellness more accessible. Wellness entrepreneurs will need to prepare for a future where digital services, apps, and AI tools play a larger role in connecting with clients.

That said, human connection remains irreplaceable. As technology grows, wellness entrepreneurs will need to find the balance between innovation and staying grounded in authentic, human relationships. Wellness practices will continue to focus on community, connection, and shared wisdom to provide holistic solutions for well-being.

Preston: What's next for you? Are there any new projects or initiatives on the horizon that you're excited to share?

Cordero: I'm really excited about the launch of Healer Space Membership, a community platform I've co-created with a partner to support wellness entrepreneurs. This membership will provide tools, mentorship, connections, and opportunities to promote wellness practitioners who are dedicated to growing their businesses with purpose. We'll be offering curated resources, weekly calls, and access to an engaged network of professionals in the wellness space. I'm also continuing to expand The Healer's Playbook through workshops and partnerships with organizations that work with or employ wellness practitioners. I am known, as the ""Wellness Connector,"" my mission is to connect the best and most talented individuals with brands and opportunities, helping more people access the tools they need to heal and thrive. I'm excited for what lies ahead and to continue serving this incredible community."
How To Be Resilient Like Successful Founders (Lessons From The Top),Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jodiecook/2024/10/03/how-to-be-resilient-like-successful-founders-lessons-from-the-top/,2024-10-03T12:04:46Z,"Sometimes everything is terrible. Other times you wake up excited before you've even gone to sleep. The entrepreneurial rollercoaster is a very real thing. But it's resilience that sets apart thriving entrepreneurs from those who fold under pressure. In business, where problems pop up as often as wins, all you have to do is stay in the game.

Lucky for you, resilience isn't something you're born with. It's a skill you can learn and improve. Here's how top entrepreneurs build their ability to handle anything their working week throws at them.

Failure is part of success, not its enemy. Entrepreneurs don't see failures as dead ends. They see them as detours on the way to winning. The best do, anyway. Sara Blakely, billionaire founder of Spanx, spent years selling fax machines door-to-door, facing rejection daily before her breakthrough. Hamdi Ulukaya started Chobani yoghurt after buying a rundown factory, despite having no experience in large-scale yoghurt production.

To think this way, change how you talk. Don't say ""I failed."" Say ""I learned."" Write down your setbacks and what they taught you. This isn't just to feel better. It's to get value from everything that happens, good or bad.

Playing the victim kills resilience. The best entrepreneurs don't blame the economy, their team, or bad luck when things go wrong. They take charge of everything. Jennifer Hyman, co-founder of Rent the Runway, faced numerous challenges including sceptical investors and logistical nightmares, but always focused on solutions rather than excuses.

Stop saying helpless phrases like ""I had no choice"" or ""It's not my fault."" When you face a problem, ask yourself, ""What did I do to cause this, and how can I fix it?"" Switch from reacting to acting to build better resilience.

The toughest entrepreneurs know they need other people. They surround themselves with mentors, peers, and cheerleaders who offer advice and sometimes just listen. Sarah Kauss, founder of S'well, credits much of her success to building a strong network of advisors and fellow entrepreneurs who provided guidance and support.

Set yourself up for success from the very start. Join groups for business owners, go to industry events, or find a mentor. Make real connections with people who can help you hire, fire, and enjoy your winnings.

Don't avoid discomfort, push the edges of your comfort zone. Successful entrepreneurs put themselves in stressful situations on purpose to build their tolerance. Leah Busque, introvert founder of TaskRabbit, consistently pushed herself when scaling her company. ""I remember having this conversation with myself one day and I just said, you know what? This is not rocket science. You're gonna figure it out,"" she said.

Set some big goals but start small. Call five new potential customers a day or learn a new skill quickly. Then make it harder over time. The aim is to build your stress muscle so you're ready when big challenges come.

Building resilience like top entrepreneurs means preparing yourself to grow through challenges. See failure as a lesson, own everything, build a support team, and get used to stress. Set yourself up to thrive when problems hit, and breeze through every challenge like you've seen it before.

Setbacks make comebacks. Breakdowns make breakthroughs. Make resilience your superpower."
Trump Immigration Plan May End Deportation Safeguards For 2.7 Million,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2024/10/03/trump-immigration-plan-may-end-deportation-safeguards-for-27-million/,2024-10-03T12:04:45Z,"Up to 2.7 million people will lose protection from deportation in a second Trump administration if Donald Trump ends current immigration safeguards. New data show individuals in Temporary Protected Status and other immigration programs could see their legal protection expire in the next two years. Trump officials could add millions of people to potential deportation rolls by allowing immigration safeguards, such as TPS, to end. Immigration enforcement personnel in a second Trump administration could find targeting long-time residents and workers an advantageous way to boost deportation numbers.

""Protection from deportation may expire for up to 2.7 million people within the next two years,"" according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis. ""The vast majority face dismal prospects if forced to return to their birth countries, and obstacles in Congress mean legislation may not rescue even the most sympathetic groups.""

NFAP gathered the data from the Department of Homeland Security and other sources. The immigration programs and categories include Temporary Protected Status, humanitarian parole programs for Cubans, Venezuelans and others and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. Some individuals paroled into the United States, such as Ukrainians, could also hold TPS. The 2.7 million does not include individuals on Deferred Enforced Departure from Liberia, Hong Kong and elsewhere, participants in smaller parole programs or people who received parole at ports of entry.

Donald Trump stated he intends to implement mass deportations of immigrants without legal status that include ""sprawling camps."" Some have argued the plans will be difficult to implement. However, the existence and likely known whereabouts of millions of people who would lose protection from deportation during a second Trump administration adds credibility to the threat. Many of the up to 2.7 million people have lived in the United States for one to two decades or longer.

Economists have warned that reducing the supply of available workers through deportations or new immigration restrictions will harm U.S. workers and the economy. According to an analysis for the Peterson Institute for International Economics by George Mason University economics professor Michael Clemens, it is likely that for every one million unauthorized immigrant workers removed from the United States, 88,000 U.S.-born workers will be ""driven out of employment."" Deporting three million unauthorized immigrant workers per year ""would mean 263,000 fewer jobs held by U.S. native workers, compounded each additional year that mass deportations continue.""

Entrepreneurs will invest in fewer new businesses when ""hit by sudden reductions to labor supply,"" writes Clemens, and business owners will ""invest their capital in other industries and in technologies that use lower-skill labor less intensively, reducing demand for U.S. workers too."" Fewer immigrant workers will also shrink the demand for U.S.-born workers due to less consumer spending on ""grocery stores, leasing offices and other nontraded services."" According to the American Immigration Council, ""Due to the loss of workers across U.S. industries, we found that mass deportation would reduce the U.S. gross domestic product by 4.2% to 6.8%.""

Today, 863,880 people live in the United States under Temporary Protected Status, notes the Congressional Research Service. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, ""During a designated period, individuals who are TPS beneficiaries . . . are not removable from the United States; can obtain an employment authorization document; [and] may be granted travel authorization.""

TPS will expire in 2025 for 13 of the 16 countries, while the TPS designations for Haiti, Somalia and Yemen will end in 2026 unless extended. ""The Trump administration is likely to terminate most if not all new TPS designations in addition to not renewing prior designations,"" according to Elizabeth Carlson and Charles Wheeler, attorneys with CLINIC. Courts blocked attempts by Trump officials to eliminate TPS for at least 300,000 beneficiaries. However, the Ninth Circuit later vacated a lower court injunction, and legal avenues for helping people whose TPS designation has expired might prove fruitless in a second Trump administration.

Donald Trump has denounced Haitians as pet eaters and Venezuelans among migrants ""attacking villages and cities all throughout the Midwest,"" so expect the 200,005 Haitians and 344,355 Venezuelans currently living in America with TPS to be high priorities for deportation. In an interview with NewsNation (October 2, 2024), Trump said he would ""absolutely"" revoke TPS for Haitians and ""bring them back"" to Haiti. ""The Venezuelan government is unlikely to accept the return of its nationals, which would put the Trump administration in an unusual position if it ended the legal status of over 300,000 people but could not remove them from the United States,"" notes the NFAP analysis. More than 180,000 Salvadorans have lived in America with TPS since February 2001.

Trump has promised to end the humanitarian parole programs for several countries. According to data NFAP obtained from DHS, 528,000 individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela arrived in America after the Biden administration approved them for the CHNV humanitarian parole program. As of August 31, 2024, there are 110,000 approvals for humanitarian parole for Cubans, 210,000 for Haitians, 92,000 for Nicaraguans and 116,000 for Venezuelans. The numbers represent differing migration patterns.

DHS has received more applications than the 30,000-monthly allotment, resulting in a selection process, which may have limited the program's effectiveness in reducing illegal immigration. Still, even with these restrictions, after the humanitarian parole programs began, Border Patrol encounters declined by 92% for Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans as a group between December 2022 (the month before the parole programs started) and November 2023 compared to an 18% increase for nationals of non-parole countries, according to an NFAP analysis. Illegal entry also declined for Venezuelans, although that was shorter-lived, likely due to the greater demand and other factors affecting Venezuelans.

Eliminating the humanitarian parole program will likely increase illegal entry, in part because of the expected response from Mexico. The Mexican government agreed to accept 30,000 migrants a month from the four countries if expelled after unlawfully entering America. ""Normally, these migrants would be returned to their country of origin, but the U.S. cannot easily send back people from those four countries for a variety of reasons that include relations with the governments there,"" noted PBS.

After the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Biden officials granted humanitarian parole to Ukrainians under a new program called Uniting for Ukraine. The United States also paroled Afghans following the fall of Kabul.

According to DHS, 651,000 Ukrainians have been approved for humanitarian parole in the United States: 221,000 from Uniting for Ukraine and an additional 430,000 other Ukrainians. Under Operation Allies Welcome, 77,000 Afghans came to America and were approved for humanitarian parole, along with approvals for an additional 56,000 Afghans. If a future administration does not allow them to remain paroled in the United States, the 651,000 Ukrainians and 133,000 Afghans could be subject to deportation unless they can live legally in the United States through other means, such as TPS or asylum.

The Biden administration provided a ""re-parole"" process for Ukrainians in February 2024 and Afghans in June 2023. If Kamala Harris wins in November, her immigration team could use a similar process for individuals in the CHNV program.

Voters have heard little lately about Dreamers, young people without legal status brought to America by their parents. According to DHS, there are 535,030 DACA recipients in the United States as of June 30, 2024. DACA recipients could be deported should the U.S. Supreme Court rule against them. The Biden administration has sought alternative ways for Dreamers to remain in the United States, such as qualifying for H-1B status. A Supreme Court ruling stopped Trump officials from removing current DACA recipients from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

During the vice-presidential debate on October 1, 2024, GOP candidate JD Vance said a second Trump administration would prioritize criminal aliens when attempting to deport millions of people living in the United States without legal status. Analysts point out that is unlikely to be the case and belies how bureaucracies work: Once numerical targets are set, immigration agents will go after the easiest people to find and deport.

Shaul Schwarz, a filmmaker on the six-part Netflix documentary Immigration Nation, had unprecedented access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during the Trump administration. ""I think we repeatedly saw a desire to get numbers,"" he said in an interview in 2020. ""I think anybody who works in ICE knows it, because it was kind of everywhere we went. . . . We definitely saw a lot of agents wanting to hit numbers.""

In other administrations, under normal practice, ICE agents focus on criminal aliens due to limited resources. Yet once an administration decides all undocumented immigrants should be deported, the priority on criminals will fade. ""We thought a number of times during this administration that the priorities had shifted to be that it's no longer just detaining egregious criminals, but there was a wider mandate to say that anybody here illegally could potentially be a target,"" said Schwarz.

Economists note that deporting individuals who have lived in America and worked for years will harm U.S. workers and the American economy. It would also upend the lives of millions of people who sought and were granted protection in the United States."
Will Rate Cuts And AI Benefit Applied Materials Stock?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/03/will-rate-cuts-and-ai-benefit-applied-materials-stock/,2024-10-03T12:04:07Z,"Applied Materials stock gained almost 10% over the past month and remains up by about 30% year-to-date. In comparison, Applied's semiconductor industry peer Texas Instruments stock has gained about 22% this year. Here's a closer look at some trends driving Applied Materials' recent gains.

Rate Cuts Can Drive Capex Spending By Chip Companies

The Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, marking the first rate cut in close to four years. With the current benchmark federal funds rate standing at 4.75% to 5% post the cut, there also remains room for the central bank to lower interest rates further. Also, check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed's next move? As a major supplier of highly specialized semiconductor fabrication equipment, Applied Materials is dependent on the capital spending cycle of major chipmakers such as TSMC and Samsung. Now lower interest rates effectively reduce borrowing costs for manufacturers and make larger projects more viable. This in turn could drive up demand for the high-end equipment that Applied - the largest U.S.-based semiconductor equipment maker - supplies. Moreover, lower rates are also generally beneficial to growth sectors such as technology, which have higher earning potential in outer years. Looking for more companies that can benefit from increased digitization and AI deployment? See our analysis of Internet Infrastructure Stocks.

AI Demand, Stronger Logic Chip Market

Beyond interest rate cuts, the semiconductor industry at large is also stabilizing. Applied Materials faced challenges last year due to reduced capital spending post-Covid-19, but conditions have improved. In Q3 2024, the company reported a 5% year-over-year revenue increase to $6.8 billion and earnings of $2.12 per share, surpassing expectations. For Q4 FY'24, Applied is guiding revenue of about $6.93 billion, plus or minus $400 million, while adjusted diluted earnings are projected to be between $2.00 and $2.36 per share. This could represent up to 8.5% growth at the upper end of the guidance range. The semiconductor downcycle has bottomed out, with logic chip demand recovering alongside the PC market and growing GPU demand from data centers. Meanwhile, the memory market is shifting toward advanced high-bandwidth memory, driven by the AI sector's robust demand. AI workloads require significant computational power, higher memory capacity, and complex chips that rely on advanced manufacturing processes. Applied Materials is well-positioned in these areas, offering tools and services in materials engineering, process control, and integration. Now Nvidia has been the hottest of the AI stocks. But did you know there is a lesser-known AI name that could offer more upside than Nvidia?

What Lies Ahead For Applied

The increase in AMAT stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 84% in 2021, -38% in 2022, and 68% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could AMAT face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

Applied Materials stock currently trades at about $201 per share. Applied stands to benefit from potentially higher orders and a rising mix of higher-end equipment driven by applications such as AI and the shift to more advanced process technologies. This is also driving the company's margins higher. Gross margins were up 100 basis points year-over-year to 47.3% in Q3. We value Applied Materials stock at $222 per share, about 10% ahead of the current market price. See our analysis of Applied Materials Valuation for a closer look at what is driving our price estimate for the stock.

"Wisconsin poll shows Harris leading Trump by 4, former president ahead on key issues",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wisconsin-poll-shows-harris-leading-trump-4-former-president-ahead-key-issues,2024-10-03T11:47:44Z,"Dr. Linda Lee Tarver, a member of Black Americans for Trump, joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss former President Trump's popularity among the Black faith community in Michigan ahead of Election Day.

Vice President Kamala Harris is maintaining her lead over former President Trump in Wisconsin despite Trump leading on the key issues, according to a Wednesday poll.

The new poll from Marquette Law School finds Harris leading Trump in a 52%-48% match-up. The poll also found that voters are deeply invested in the election, with 46% of respondents saying they have stopped talking to someone about politics due to the presidential race.

Marquette conducted the survey from Sept. 18-26, polling 882 Wisconsin registered voters and 798 likely voters. The poll advertises a margin of error of 4.4%.

Despite trailing in the polls, Trump leads Harris in the top issues in the race, including border security, the economy, and handling the Israel-Hamas war.

YOUNG SWING STATE VOTERS DELIVER ADVICE FOR KAMALA HARRIS

Trump enjoys a sizable 49-37% lead over Harris on immigration. Meanwhile, 50% of Wisconsinites say he will handle the economy better than Harris, with the vice president getting just 42% support. Trump also enjoys a 45%-33% lead when it comes to Israel's conflict in the Middle East. He also has a narrow lead over Harris when it comes to foreign relations more generally.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

Harris does have a lead over Trump in a number of other issues, however, namely abortion and election concerns. Roughly 53% of respondents said they trusted Harris to handle the former, compared to 36% for Trump. Another 49% said Harris would be better for ensuring a fair and accurate election, compared to Trump's 39%.

Wisconsin is among a handful of swing states that are likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. Other states like Ohio and Pennsylvania are also critical to either a Trump or Harris victory.

Pennsylvania in particular is one of the tightest contests in the nation, where Harris leads Trump in a razor-thin 49%-47% match-up, according to new data from AARP.

The failed policies of the Biden-Harris administration gave America 40-year-high inflation, labor unrest, and now potentially the costliest strike in American history. By directing its 45,000 members to walk off the job, the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) union is crippling eastern seaboard ports and costing $5 billion per day.

In October 2021, I warned that the tax-and-spend agenda of the Biden-Harris administration would set an inflationary fire and torch Americans' finances, resulting in labor unrest. By the fall of 2023, we had the largest auto strike in history as the United Auto Workers (UAW) demanded higher wages to counter their losses from inflation.

While the UAW strike was disruptive to the auto industry, it didn't cause severe economic harm or noticeably impact the consumer. The ILA walk-off is an order of magnitude worse, with the potential for severe disruptions to the economy if it lasts more than just a few days.

BALTIMORE RESTAURANT OWNER SAYS PORT STRIKE IS ALREADY IMPACTING BUSINESS: 'IT REALLY HURTS'

The 36 ports on the Gulf and East coasts handle 55% of all U.S. container traffic and large volumes of exports, including about half of U.S. pork and almost three-quarters of U.S. poultry. About half of all imported fruits and vegetables come through these ports as well. In pharmaceuticals, nine out of 10 imports and seven out of 10 exports are being disrupted.

In short, America's international trade has been severely hamstrung, with consumers and businesses alike about to get hit hard if this labor dispute isn't resolved quickly.

The primary reason for this and other labor unrest over the last three years has been the stratospheric rise in the cost of living, which stems directly from mismanagement by the Biden-Harris administration.

Biden and Harris pushed for runaway federal deficits, fueled with newly created money from the Federal Reserve, destroyed one-fifth of the dollar's value in less than four years. It also caused violent fluctuations in interest rates for everything from mortgages to credit cards.

The result has been a cost-of-living crisis with homeownership affordability plunging to some of the lowest levels on record, while families pay over $300 billion annually just in interest on their outstanding credit card balances. Despite the average American's weekly paycheck being larger than ever before, it buys less than it did just four years ago.

But the plunge in the dollar's purchasing power has hit businesses every bit as hard as consumers, and the Biden-Harris administration's own data proves it. Prices paid by firms and by customers have both increased 20% since January 2021, meaning businesses have merely passed on their cost increases to consumers.

Inflation has massively increased both the cost of living and the cost of doing business, leaving no winners but government. So, while workers are demanding higher wages to combat today's sky-high cost of living, management is desperate to control increases in the cost of doing business -- and that includes labor costs. With such tight margins, any pay increases to workers will result in higher prices for customers.

But that didn't stop the Biden-Harris administration from weighing in and siding with the strikers, citing growth in corporate profits as somehow indicative of management's misbehavior. Corporate profits have increased in the same sense that families' paychecks have increased, but both buy less, on average, than they did four years ago because of the hidden tax of inflation.

Of all the politicians in Washington, D.C., Vice President Kamala Harris owns a disproportionate amount of the blame for inflation over the last four years. Not only was she the biggest cheerleader of the president's big-government agenda, but she also cast the tie-breaking vote on trillions of dollars in inflationary federal deficit spending.

What's particularly worrisome is that Harris hasn't learned from her mistakes. She's doubling down instead, proposing more of the same economic malfeasance that got America into this mess. If public policy continues down the path of the last three-and-a-half years, it will mean more inflation, more labor unrest, and evermore disruptive strikes."
Elite colleges shocked to discover students 'don't know how' to read hooks: 'My jaw dropped',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/elite-colleges-shocked-discover-students-dont-know-how-read-hooks-my-jaw-dropped,2024-10-03T11:12:31Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Several university professors expressed concerns to The Atlantic about students who come to college unable to read full-length books.

Assistant editor Rose Horowitch spoke to several teachers from elite schools like Columbia, Georgetown and Stanford, who each described the phenomenon of students being overwhelmed by the prospect of reading entire books.

Columbia University humanities professor Nicholas Dames described feeling ""bewildered"" when a first-year student told him that she had never been required to read a full book at her public high school.

""My jaw dropped,"" Dames said.

COLLEGE ADMISSIONS EXPERT SENDS SHOCKING MESSAGE ABOUT IVY LEAGUE PRESTIGE: 'IS IT WORTH THE INVESTMENT?'

Some professors do find a few students up to the task but described them as ""now more exceptions"" rather than the rule, with others ""shutting down"" when facing difficult texts.

""Daniel Shore, the chair of Georgetown's English department, told me that his students have trouble staying focused on even a sonnet,"" Horowitch wrote.

""It's not that they don't want to do the reading,"" she said. ""It's that they don't know how. Middle and high schools have stopped asking them to.""

Horowitch reported how a recent EdWeek Research Center survey of about 300 third-to-eighth-grade educators found ""only 17 percent said they primarily teach whole texts"" with nearly 25 percent saying whole books themselves are no longer the focus in their curriculum.

While private schools are not immune to this issue, the problem is more prominent with students who attended public schools, where standardized test prep is blamed.

""Private schools, which produce a disproportionate share of elite college students, seem to have been slower to shift away from reading complete volumes -- leading to what Dames describes as a disconcerting reading-skills gap among incoming freshmen,"" Horowitch wrote.

In response, colleges have been reducing their reading load, albeit with some additions for diversity.

""The Columbia instructors who determine the Lit Hum curriculum decided to trim the reading list for the current school year. (It had been growing in recent years, even while students struggled with the reading, as new books by non-White authors were added.),"" Horowitch wrote.

Psychologists told her they suspected the abundance of social media apps like TikTok and YouTube have overtaken recreational reading.

""It's changed expectations about what's worthy of attention,"" Daniel Willingham, a psychologist at UVA, said. ""Being bored has become unnatural.""

Another reason, Horowitch suggested, was the state of the economy with students more concerned over jobs rather than reading for fun.

""Some experts I spoke with attributed the decline of book reading to a shift in values rather than in skill sets. Students can still read books, they argue -- they're just choosing not to. Students today are far more concerned about their job prospects than they were in the past,"" she wrote.

Though professors have willingly begun scaling back their curriculum in favor of shorter texts or excerpts, many still mourned the loss of cultural enrichment that comes from reading.

Industrial policy is back in the United States, and the community college sector is needed more than ever before. There has never been a more important time for community college trustees to understand and support their institutions' contributions to science- and technology-based economic development, emerging technology sectors, and regional innovation ecosystems.

Scientific and technological innovation spurred by federal and private investments in R&D and economic development is catalyzing job creation, augmentation, and elimination nationwide. Community colleges will be critical to reskilling and upskilling incumbent workers, expanding pathways for young people beginning their careers, and meeting employers' labor market needs in a way that also diversifies the workforce and the jobs that will comprise the future of work.

Community colleges have always been pivotal in providing accessible, affordable, and workforce-oriented career preparation in healthcare, skilled trades, manufacturing, and transportation industries. However, all across the country, community colleges are also evolving to meet the workforce needs of the future of work - jobs and industries catalyzed and shaped by emerging technologies.

Today, community colleges have expanded customized training, certificates, associate's degrees, apprenticeships, and even applied baccalaureates (available in 24 states) tailored to opening doors to jobs in industries incubated and shaped by artificial intelligence, biotechnology, green energy, and quantum technology -- and, as a result, creating inclusive pathways to careers that define the skilled technical workforce for the jobs of today and tomorrow.

Their role in the innovation economy will only grow due to a massive influx of federal investments from the bipartisan CHIPS & Science Act, alongside the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. These bills have catalyzed new funding opportunities and the need for community college partnerships, job training, and sector strategy around emerging technology fields.

Notably, CHIPS created the first new arm at the U.S. National Science Foundation in over thirty years-the Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships Directorate. Under the new division, NSF has significantly expanded funding for community colleges in emerging technology fields, building on the successes of NSF's Advanced Technological Education program, which has been in operation since 1994.

CHIPS also created new opportunities for community colleges at the U.S. Economic Development Administration, such as through the Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs or ""Tech Hubs"" program.

More than fifty community colleges are partners across the thirty-one Tech Hub designees which will receive more than half a billion dollars in funding to create jobs and companies around technologies of the future, like quantum, semiconductors and personalized medicine.

The more trustees understand these science and tech-focused industrial policy investments and how their states and economies can leverage the funds, the better positioned they will be to help realize the promise of the innovation economy for students.

New America's Future of Work and Innovation Economy is dedicated to the study and support of community colleges in technology-based economic development and for job training in evolving and advanced technology sectors.

This spring, I provided an overview of these new programs in a recent podcast episode for the Association of Community College Trustees. This story, which builds on article that appeared in the association's magazine, further explores how trustees could connect their institutions to emerging industries.

Why trustees are critical for the community college in the innovation economy

While presidents, deans, workforce leaders, and faculty all have critical roles in unlocking equitable pathways to good jobs resulting from R&D investments, trustees have an especially important role to play.

First, as stewards of an institution, trustees can partner with a president and leadership to take a ""forest view"" of the college's offerings and their alignment with the region's economic development goals and, trustees might be elected, political appointees, or otherwise have political, business, and community ties that could help reinforce their colleges' tether to the needs of their local economy.

Second, trustees offer colleges stability in a time of turbulence. Presidential turnover and retention are becoming a growing problem for all higher education institutions, including community colleges. According to an analysis by the American Council on Education in 2023, presidential turnover has reached its highest level since the association began tracking such data in 2006.

Generational transitions will also impact college leadership. According to a recent survey from the American Association of Community Colleges, more than half of sitting community college leaders indicate they plan to transition out of their position within the next five years, and one-third expect to retire in that timeframe.

Faculty and staff, too, are in a period of transition. A 2022 survey from the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources found that more than half of surveyed higher education workers plan to leave their roles. An EAB analysis has found that community colleges have faced a 13% staff decline from 2020-2022.

That leaves trustees among the last lines of defense to help a college take a long-term perspective. That viewpoint is especially valuable when considering technology-based economic development predicated on investments in emerging technology sectors and the innovation economy. Silicon Valley wasn't built in a day, and neither will new innovation hubs catalyzed by federal investments, the AI revolution, or other future technology-driven paradigm shifts.

Trustees have a critical role to play in understanding, supporting, and advocating for their institution's role in job training relating to emerging technologies and to excel as partners in ""regional innovation ecosystems"" and technology-based economic development to grow and retain high-paying jobs.

What trustees and colleges can do: Three case studies

We interviewed trustees of three community colleges on the leading edge as workforce partners for the innovation economy - MiraCosta College in California, Miami Dade College in Florida, and Harper College in Illinois. Our conversations focused on the college's work and what trustees could do to support their college's role in regional innovation ecosystems.

First, I spoke with Frank Merchant, a MiraCosta trustee since 2015, to learn about a capacity-building effort MiraCosta undertook to better prepare the college for the future of work.

Situated in the southern California biotechnology hub, MiraCosta College is a recognized leader in education for the future of work. For example, in 2022, MiraCosta launched the nation's first community college baccalaureate in biomanufacturing to meet the workforce needs of Fortune 500 biotechnology giants like Pfizer, Abbott Laboratories, and Thermo Fisher Scientific. But MiraCosta's foresight has less to do with chance and more with strategy. MiraCosta was one of the first grantees of NSF's CHIPS-enabled new Experiential Learning for Emerging and Novel Technologies (ExLENT) program, which it is using to scale internships and apprenticeships in the biomanufacturing and microelectronics sector. But MiraCosta's success has less to do with chance and more to do with strategy.

In 2019, MiraCosta College partnered with the Institute for the Future, a Palo Alto-based non-profit, to undertake an institution-wide training in ""futurist thinking"" methods. The president, members of its Board of Trustees, top administrators, students, faculty, and staff took part in a series of trainings on ""futurist thinking"" methods, meant to help them foresee long-term trends and assess the possible implications for the institution, students, and neighboring communities. The college used institutional immersion to take an entirely new long-view approach to its strategic planning and operating process.

Not everyone at the institution was bought into the trendy-sounding training. ""You have to convince people that the futures process thinking is not the flavor of the day but your savior. It was key that I and other trustees go through this entire training process to let everyone in the institution know that this is important,"" Merchant told me.

Merchant recommended trustees explore similar training approaches that help institutionalize a proactive approach to the innovation economy - emphasizing the value of data to drive decision-making. ""Proactive expansion of offerings across these emerging technology areas is something that board members can support.""

Next, I spoke with Roberto Alonso, a trustee of Miami Dade College. Miami Dade is one of the nation's leading community colleges in AI education, becoming one of the only institutions to offer credit and non-credit certificates, associate's degrees, and bachelor's degrees in applied AI. In 2021, the college named Antonio Delgado its first Vice President of Innovation and Technology Partnerships, who has gone on to serve as the first 2-year representative on NSF's Computer and Information Sciences Directorate Advisory Committee.

In 2024, Miami Dade was recently awarded a $2.8 million grant from the NSF to partner with Houston Community College and Maricopa Community College District to launch a consortium dedicated to scaling and improving AI education at 2-year institutions.

Trustee Alonso emphasized the importance of trustees in ensuring that their institutions not only meet employer demands but also prioritize ethics across emerging technology training. ""We are democracy's colleges. We are an institution that gives access to all students. If we don't give students the knowledge they need to use AI in a positive way, we won't be tackling the biggest need,"" Alonso told me. Alonso encouraged trustees to consider how their institution can foster technologists in the public interest. Miami Dade is a member of New America's Public Interest Technology Network, which cultivates tech professionals who are ethics-savvy.

Trustee Alonso, who also serves as a Miami-Dade County School Board member, encouraged fellow trustees to tether their institutions' work in regional innovation ecosystems to their local communities through their own relationships. While 70% of Miami Dade's booming AI enrollment is above 26 and 30% above 41, Miami Dade offers an AI summer camp for high school students to immerse in the college's applied AI curriculum at no cost. Additionally, Mr. Delgado, himself as the college's tech workforce leader, serves as a senior advisor for tech talent development to the Mayor of the City of Miami to foster town-gown relationships.

Lastly, I spoke with William ""Bill"" Kelley, Board Chair of William Rainey Harper College, located outside Chicago, Illinois. Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker has envisioned Illinois as a ""global quantum capital"" and recently Nestled in the heart of a booming quantum science and technology hub, buoyed by a recent half-a-billion dollar investment in quantum technology. Harper is well-aligned with the tech-enabled future of its region's economic development strategy.

In fall 2022, Harper launched the Innovation Accelerator, a new collaborative unit designed to focus specifically on emerging technology workforce training. Writing for the American Association of Community Colleges, Harper President Avis Proctor described how the accelerator is developing accelerated career pathways in cybersecurity, quantum computing, and cloud-computing.

""Under Dr. Proctor's leadership, we set aside $900,000 from our HEERF [Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund] funding to creat the Innovation Accelerator,"" Kelley told me. ""We complemented that funding from the U.S. Department of Energy, NSF, and other agencies.""

Harper was one of the first grantees of NSF's new CHIPS-enabled Enabling Partnerships to Increase Innovation Capacity (EPIIC) grant funding program which it is using to work with a consortia of 2-year and 4-year institutions to improve employer partnerships in quantum fields. Trustee Kelley recommends trustees look at how the entire institution can support its tech goals. Harper engaged its philosophy program to support its ethics course in AI. ""We had to reach out to different departments for how to work better together as well as the college's foundation,"" Kelley told me.

Policy to Empower Community Colleges

Trustees Kelley, Alonso, and Merchant aren't alone as college leaders supporting their institution's evolution to address the future of work, but they are among the early adopters. All three trustees emphasized the need for federal and state governments to better recognize the need and value of community colleges in the innovation economy. Policy innovations such as allowing community college baccalaureates, funding apprenticeship and quality short-term training, and funding upstart costs all came up as needs.

Federally, Congress has only appropriated a portion of the funding of the CHIPS & Science Act authorizations. In July 2024, four community college presidents, including the presidents of MiraCosta and Harper College, joined New America to publicly call on Congress to fully appropriate funding for NSF. NSF encountered a budget cut in March, hamstringing its support of community colleges. ""Getting the other half of the loaf would be huge for the next wave,"" Kelley quipped.

As the U.S. government advances the vision of CHIPS and a bipartisan approach to industrial policy, community colleges will be critical to a successful and equitable innovation economy."
"Metal detectorists stumble across 1,000-year-old Viking 'wallet' full of treasure: 'Highly unusual'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/metal-detectorists-stumble-1000-year-old-viking-wallet-full-treasure-highly-unusual,2024-10-03T10:15:00Z,"Fifty skeletons from the 9th and 10th centuries were found during an excavation in Åsum, Denmark, west of Copenhagen, according to the Museum of Odense. (Credit: Reuters)

British historians recently announced the remarkable discovery of a 1,000-year-old Viking ""wallet,"" thanks to two curious metal detectorists.

Manx National Heritage, an organization based on the Isle of Man, announced the discovery in a Sept. 30 press release. In a statement, the organization explained that the coins were actually uncovered in May.

Two metal detectorists, John Crowe and David O'Hare, found the treasure hoard while searching private land on the island. The findings consist of 36 silver coins minted between 1000 and 1065, when Vikings were known to inhabit the Isle of Man.

""The majority [of the coins] were minted during the reign of Edward the Confessor (AD 1042-1066) with the English kings Aethelred II (AD 978-1016) and Canute (AD 1016-1035) also represented,"" the press release noted.

Canute, also known as Cnut, was a Viking ruler who united the kingdoms of England and Denmark.

""There are various English mints represented, including York, London, Lincoln, Cambridge, Hastings, Ipswich and Exeter,"" the statement added. ""The Irish coins date from the middle of decades of AD 1000 and were all minted in Dublin. They feature the profile of King Sihtric Silkbeard who served as Norse King of Dublin from AD 989 to 1036.""

Dr. Kristin Bornholdt Collins, a researcher, noted the discovery could be likened to a wallet due to the variety of currencies.

""The new hoard might be compared to a wallet containing all kinds of credit cards, notes and coins, perhaps of different nationalities, such as when you prepare to travel overseas, and shows the variety of currencies available to an Irish Sea trader or inhabitants of Man in this period,"" she explained.

""Combined, the hoards provide a rare chance to study the contents side by side, right down to the detail of the dies used to strike the coins,"" the expert added. ""Having this much closely dated comparative material from separate finds is highly unusual.""

Historians believe the hoard was abandoned around 1070. Experts say the treasure sheds light on the trade history of the time.

California Study Shows Which College Programs Pay Off And Which Don't,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2024/10/03/california-study-shows-which-college-programs-pay-off-and-which-dont/,2024-10-03T10:09:51Z,"A new report from the College Futures Foundation and the HEA Group identifies the return on investment that undergraduate students can expect to see from thousands of college programs in California.

The good news is that almost 9 out of 10 academic programs in California allow graduates to recoup their educational costs within five years. The bad news is that more than 100 programs yielded no economic ROI, leaving a majority of their graduates earning less than a high school graduate five years after finishing the program.

The results are contained in California College Programs That Pay: Measuring Return on Investment Across Majors and Credentials, by Michael Itzkowitz, President of the HEA Group. They are based on an analysis of outcomes for 260,000 graduates from 2,695 undergraduate certificate, associate's and bachelor's degree programs offered at 324 institutions in California.

Using data from the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard, the researchers calculated a Price-to-Earnings Premium (PEP) to assess how long it takes program graduates to recoup their educational costs after earning their credential.

Each college program's PEP is based on two factors: 1) out-of-pocket -- or net -- costs that students pay to complete a credential and 2) the earnings premium that they gain by completing a certain field of study.

To determine how much each credential costs, the researchers assumed that students pay one year of net costs to earn a certificate, two years to earn an associate's degree, and four years to earn a bachelor's degree. Of course, this is a conservative estimate because many students take longer and pay more out-of-pocket costs to complete their academic program.

They then used the annual out-of-pocket expenses after all grants and scholarships are deducted to calculate the total cost of earning a credential. Because cost data were not available for individual programs, they applied an institution's net cost to each of its programs regardless of the specific field of study.

The earnings premium each college program produces for its graduates is defined as the additional income a college graduate makes five years after completing the program compared to the typical high school graduate in California with no college experience (pegged at $26,073 per year). Programs that allow graduates to earn more than this amount yield a premium that can then be used to pay down the out-of-pocket costs required to earn the credential.

The new report is a sequel to the foundation's initial report published last spring that focused on institutions' ROI for low- and moderate-income learners. This report examines the economic ROIs across specific majors and credentials offered throughout the state and included all students who received a loan or grant from the federal government.

Among the highlights of the report:

The report also indicated that a student's college major sometimes matters more for economic ROI than the institution itself. ""We found outcomes for 'time to recoup' that differ across different programs at four-year institutions, two-year institutions, and certificate-granting institutions,"" Itzkowitz said. ""Some offer ROI in a short timeframe, and some offer little to no ROI whatsoever.""

Of the five most popular bachelor's level programs of study -- business administration, psychology, sociology, communication and media studies, and registered nursing -- most enabled graduates to recoup their educational costs between one and five years after completing their degrees.

In fact, none of these bachelor's degree programs -- at any institution across California -- showed their graduates taking longer than 10 years to recoup their costs of earning a degree. However, only registered nursing allowed the majority of its graduates (69%) to earn back their educational costs in less than one year

The most popular associate-level programs of study were: 1) liberal arts and sciences, 2) registered nursing, 3) allied health diagnostic, intervention, and treatment professions, 4) business administration, and 5) allied health and medical assisting services.

Many of these associate's degree programs enable their graduates to recoup their educational costs in less than one year's time. For example, 98% of nursing program graduates hit that threshold; so do 84% of those graduating from business administration programs. The most popular associate's degree program -- l iberal arts and sciences -- shows 95% of its graduates earning back the costs of their degree within five years, and 62% are able to do so in one year.

""Postsecondary attainment must continue to be tied to economic mobility, as it is essential to creating a higher education system that drives a robust, inclusive economy in California,"" said Eloy Ortiz Oakley, College Futures Foundation President and CEO, in a news release. ""Central to this research is showing which institutions and programs make that connection.""

According to Itzkowitz and Oakley, the report should not be considered a ""denouncement of any specific program or desired area of study, but rather an opportunity for further research to understand why and how these institutions produce these outcomes and where there may be policy and practice implications.""

""Learners deserve access to information so they can enter a program with eyes wide open about what they can expect, and institutions need to be transparent with their data and honest about how their programs deliver on the promise of economic mobility,"" Oakley said."
ESOPs And The Growing Movement Toward Purposeful Business,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryjosephs/2024/10/03/esops-and-the-growing-movement-toward-purposeful-business/,2024-10-03T09:20:48Z,"For more than three decades, I have witnessed firsthand how employee ownership can build business owner liquidity and enable succession planning while creating worker wealth. Over time, it has become increasingly clear to me that the transformative power of employee stock ownership plans, or ESOPs, lies in more than just their financial structure. Rather, they're a prime example of how businesses can align purpose, profit, and people in ways that benefit all stakeholders.

Recently, we've seen a groundswell of interest in more conscious and purpose-driven approaches to business. From B-Corps, purpose trusts, and 'conscious capitalism,' to the Tugboat Institute and the Expanding ESOPs Coalition, recognition mounts that the traditional stockholder-only model of capitalism is insufficient for the challenges we face in the 21st century.

These movements share a commitment to a more holistic view of business that recognizes the interdependence of financial success, employee well-being, community impact, and environmental stewardship. It's a multi-stakeholder view that aligns closely with the principles championed in the ESOP community.

Here's a closer look at the key players in this space that embrace the notion that profitability and purpose are mutually reinforcing:

· B-Corps: These for-profit companies are certified to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. They're legally required to consider the impact of their decisions on their workers, customers, suppliers, community, and the environment. B Corps run the gamut from retailer Body Shop and shoemakers Toms and Allbirds to opticians Warby Parker and the Taos ski area in New Mexico. KeHE foods recently became one of the largest ESOP owned B-Corps.

· Purpose Trusts: This innovative legal structure enables a company to be held in trust for the benefit of its stated purpose, rather than for shareholders' financial benefit. It provides a way for mission-driven companies to preserve their values and purpose over the long term. Yvon Chouinard, founder of outdoor apparel company Patagonia, transferred his voting stock to a purpose trust in September 2022.

· Conscious Capitalism: This movement embraces the notion of a business having a conscious culture that values being both ethical and profitable, benefiting society in the process. Its founders were John Mackey, co-founder of Whole Foods Market, and marketing professor and author Raj Sisodia. Take note of their October 24 CEO Summit where over 250 leaders will share ideas on business for good.

· Tugboat Institute: The 11-year-old membership organization supports purpose-driven, privately held businesses committed to the principles of ""Evergreen"" that prioritize long-term value creation over short-term profits.

· The Expanding ESOPs Coalition: This just-formed group, which I'm proud to be part of, advocates for policies that make employee ownership more accessible and educate business owners about its benefits.

ESOPs were ahead of their time in embodying principles of worker involvement and wealth-creating that align with key tenets of purpose-driven business. That's because ESOPs inherently create value for multiple stakeholders, creating opportunities for employees to benefit through ownership stakes and enhanced retirement savings.

A 2023 study from the National Center for Employee Ownership found that ESOP companies often see voluntary quit rates of their employees at roughly one-third the national average, increased productivity and profitability. Moreover, their communities benefit from the presence of stable, locally-rooted businesses committed to local prosperity.

ESOP companies also tend to take a longer-term view, investing in their people and operations rather than chasing quarterly profits. This aligns closely with the Tugboat Institute's ""Evergreen"" principles. Further, by distributing ownership broadly among employees, ESOPs create a more equitable distribution of wealth that addresses a key criticism of traditional capitalism, namely, that it concentrates wealth in too few hands.

Data show that when employees have a stake in the company's success, they tend to be more engaged and innovative. This creates a virtuous cycle of improved performance and increased value creation. ESOPs are less likely to be sold or relocated, providing stability to local communities, which embodies the stakeholder-centric approach of B-Corps and purpose trusts. And ESOPs' shared ownership model naturally fosters a culture of collaboration and shared purpose that mirror key elements of the conscious capitalism movement.

As these movements gain momentum, a new economic paradigm appears to be emerging. It recognizes the interconnectedness of all stakeholders and seeks to create value in ways that are not exclusively for stockholders. While their numbers are still relatively small, at 6,500-plus, ESOPs have decades of experience in operationalizing many of the principles the newer purpose-driven models aspire to. At the same time, ESOPs can learn from and be inspired by the innovations happening in the B-Corp world, the legal creativity of purpose trusts, the focus on conscious leadership, and the long-term orientation of Evergreen companies.

By building coalitions and sharing best practices across these various models, I believe the shift toward a more conscious, purposeful approach to business will accelerate. This isn't just about feel-good rhetoric - it's about creating more resilient, innovative, and successful companies that thrive in an increasingly complex and challenging business environment.

As we look to the future, I've become more convinced that this coalition of purpose-driven business models - with ESOPs as a pivotal example - represents the best path forward for creating sustainable, equitable prosperity in the 21st century. By working together, sharing our experiences, and advocating for supportive policies, we can build an economy that truly works for everyone. I love the momentum, particularly as we launch into Employee Ownership Month."
How Democrats are targeting red seats in blue New York to help win back the House,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5119744/democrats-flip-new-york-house-races,2024-10-03T09:07:01Z,"New York Gov.

Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in 2022 with the help of a mini red wave in the blue state of New York.

Democrats lost five seats in suburban districts, mostly around New York City, as many in the party were caught off guard. This year top Democrats across the state have joined forces to try to win those seats back, potentially netting the four seats they need to win back control of the chamber.

The GOP formula in 2022 was a barrage of ads and attacks on Democrats on crime, immigration and border security. The targeted messaging energized the Republican base and depressed Democratic turnout.

Party leaders responded this year with an effort modeled on more traditional battleground states will help turn things around for them this cycle with both resources and a stepped up ground game.

New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand told NPR she realized the need for the coordinated effort when she asked what candidates were doing in the week heading into the 2022 midterms and got a puzzling answer.

""There were [check] no big rallies. There was no organized canvassing, there was no coordination at all amongst local candidates and House candidates,"" Gillibrand said.

Kathy Hochul, then the Democratic candidate for governor, was being attacked by her GOP opponent Lee Zeldin about rising crime rates and border security. Gillibrand says tens of millions of dollars in negative ads had a big impact on Democratic voters in suburban districts around New York City.

""We had the worst voter turnout in 10 years,"" Gillibrand said. Hochul won, but the wave of House losses caused Gillibrand to reach out to Democrats in Wisconsin -- a perennial battleground state -- to come up with a 2024 strategy.

""So the day after the election I said to my chief of staff: 'We have to do something differently. Let's create the first-ever coordinated campaign for New York.'""

Now, Hochul says the coordinated campaign is allowing Democrats to connect with voters in a way that hasn't been done before.

""We're making unprecedented investments, rebuilding Party infrastructure, and turning out voters to elect Democrats and flip the House majority in November,"" she said in a statement to NPR.

Gillibrand, Hochul, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and state party leaders have opened 40 offices in seven House districts and hired 100 full-time staffers. Republicans have just five similar ""battle station"" offices.

Democrats linked state and local party operations. That effort has allowed them to make over 2 million contacts with voters between knocking on doors and phone calls, according to a spokeswoman for Hochul.

The strategy focuses on a more sophisticated get-out-the-vote effort, but it also includes going on offense on the issues that hurt the party the most two years ago -- crime and immigration.

Gillibrand points to her first ad as an example. She says it lists ""what I've done personally to make New York safer"" -- and touts her work on addressing fentanyl and illegal guns. Her third ad focuses on reproductive rights.

The move to lean in on crime and border issues follows the blueprint Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi used in February, to win a special election of a seat previously held by GOP Rep. George Santos. Suozzi emphasized a bipartisan immigration reform overhaul proposal, and effectively flipped the script on an issue that has traditionally put Democratic candidates on defense. Party strategists say his message is a good model in other districts in the state.

But Republicans say they still have the upper hand when it comes to the issues that got them elected in the first place.

Long Island Republican Nick LaLota is one of the five House freshmen elected in 2022. LaLota says his party will likely be outspent this cycle but says voters trust the GOP on the core issues.

""Suburban New Yorkers want two big things: a secure border and public safety and a better economy and less inflation. While they have a lot of money in campaign dollars and a lot of field offices and volunteers, their deficit is on policy solutions to those two big areas.""

New York isn't a presidential battleground but LaLota says GOP nominee Donald Trump knows New York is crucial in the battle for the House. He had a rally last month. He told NPR Trump knows his campaign needs to keep House Republican seats in suburban New York.

""His presence there demonstrates that he wants a governing Republican majority to give him the policy he needs from Congress when he returns to the White House.""

Marc Molinaro is another freshman GOP lawmaker whose district stretches from the Hudson Valley to the Finger Lakes. He says House Republicans are a check on an otherwise blue state.

""The people I represent want a balanced approach to government. They know that single-party rule in New York has led to the highest taxes of any people in the country, crime and an open border, Molinaro said.

But ultimately, taxes may prove the decisive issue in these New York contests. Trump's 2017 tax bill capped a popular state and local tax break called SALT, effectively levying an increase on many New York homeowners. Republicans were pleased that Trump stressed at his New York rally that he'll revive it.

""I will cut taxes for families, small businesses and workers including restoring the SALT deduction,"" Trump vowed at his Uniondale rally.

LaLota said that public pledge helps make the case to other GOP lawmakers as they craft a possible tax bill when many of the Trump tax provisions expire in 2025. ""Way to put this on the table -- this is what suburban constituents in blue states want,"" LaLota said.

Molinaro says the GOP has to follow through on that promise.

""If we really mean to provide meaningful tax relief to middle-class families, that's got to include reestablishing the SALT deduction.""

Jeffries vows Democrats will bring back the tax break, and calls out Republicans having it both ways on the tax break.

""They were the arsonists who burned down the state and local tax deduction and they have no credibility in trying to pretend right now they will be the firefighters.""

Democrats argue that Trump will be a factor in the race, and that the GOP lawmakers' decision to stand with Trump at his recent rally and vote in mostly lockstep on legislation championed by hardline House Republicans will hurt them with independents and Democrats in New York.

But several GOP strategists familiar with the campaigns in these districts stress that these incumbents have worked to create their own brands, and some have made a point to call out some extreme GOP colleagues in the House.

Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, another Long Island GOP lawmaker Democrats are targeting, faces a challenge with his own personal issues taking front and center in recent weeks. The New York Times reported that he put his mistress and the daughter of fiancee on his office payroll, something not allowed by House ethics rules, and a possible campaign finance violation. D'Esposito argues he didn't do anything improper and that the story was a political attack.

Republicans hope to link their Democratic challengers to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who was recently indicted on bribery and fraud charges. Lawmakers say his high profile case helps the GOP make their case against electing more Democrats to the House, but challengers in many of these House districts have called on Adams to resign.

Gillibrand waves off Adams as a factor in November House races. She says Democrats this year learned their lesson about engaging voters earlier on liabilities -- like crime -- and this new campaign focuses on the message and mechanics to get their supporters out to vote.

"Politico: Vance's beard a sign of 'aggression' to women, Walz's 'saucer' eyes showed his 'passion'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/politico-vances-beard-sign-aggression-women-walzs-saucer-eyes-showed-his-passion,2024-10-03T00:07:43Z,"Fox News contributor Joe Concha joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss why he believes the CBS moderators were biased against JD Vance and his reaction to an ABC anchor comparing Tim Walz's performance to President Biden's.

Female voters who watched the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate on Tuesday may have viewed Ohio Sen. JD Vance's beard as a sign of toxic masculinity, according to one body language expert.

Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, faced off against Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at the Tuesday night debate, sparring for 90 minutes on a wide range of issues including immigration, the economy and abortion.

Former FBI agent and body language expert Joe Navarro analyzed each candidate's body language at the event for Politico Magazine, giving his opinion about how they presented themselves on stage.

The first thing Navarro noticed was Vance's facial hair. He claimed the ""masculine"" trait could turn off female voters.

VANCE OOZED CONFIDENCE COMPARED TO JITTERY WALZ, BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT SAYS: 'CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP'

""As POLITICO Magazine has noted before, Vance is the first White House wannabe to wear facial hair in 80 years. Our appearance is fundamental to our body language, and research indicates that voters see beards as (surprise, surprise) more masculine,"" Navarro wrote. ""That can be positive to some, reading as strength and competence. But to others, especially women, it can be negative, conveying aggression and opposition to feminist ideals.""

Navarro isn't the only media commentator to associate the Republican ticket with negative perceptions of masculinity. Since the Harris-Walz ticket emerged, several journalists, including MSNBC contributor Katty Kay, have argued that Republicans appeal to men with a more ""macho,"" what they consider, outdated version of masculinity.

MSNBC host Jen Psaki and The Washington Post's Catherine Rampell have also made the case that the Democratic ticket appeals to men who are more ""supportive"" of women.

While critiquing Vance's beard, Navarro praised Walz for his bugged-eyed expression throughout the debate, saying it ""showed his passion"" on the issues.

""When Walz felt especially passionate about something, he'd open his eyes wide as saucers. Eye-popping can sometimes be a sign of surprise, but for Walz, it simply revealed his emotional intensity,"" Navarro wrote. ""Early humans would have made such facial gestures to communicate strong emotions, like 'danger is close.' For Walz, it gave extra weight to his feelings and held our gaze.""

The body language expert spoke positively about how Vance used his hands to convey emotion and leadership during the debate, but claimed a ""little frown"" by the Republican at one point showed where his ""weaknesses lie.""

""When Walz brought up Project 2025, Vance exhibited a little tell that carried a big message: a slight squinting of the eyes and a small frown. Clearly, this was a sore subject,"" Navarro wrote.

""We have to guard against such behaviors in high-stakes interchanges like negotiations or, say, vice-presidential debates -- they reveal to your opponent what topics you want to avoid and where your weaknesses lie,"" he wrote.

At the same time, Navarro gave credit to Walz for frowning to show his disapproval while Vance was speaking.

""During a disagreement over democracy, he furrowed his glabella forcefully at what Vance was saying. Then he held his eyebrows like that, in tension, for some time. While Vance had the floor, this was a way for Walz to silently say, 'No way, that's not right, and I am going to challenge you on this,'"" he wrote.

The only negative assessment of Walz was about his finger-wagging at the camera.

""[H]e pointed at the camera with his index finger, like Uncle Sam in those old 'I Want You' posters. It was a bold, almost accusatory gesture -- which made it great for the poster, but can come across as almost hostile. Our brains immediately perceive a point as 'calling us out' -- in other words, as threatening. Walz wanted our attention there, and he certainly got it,"" Navarro wrote.

Both candidates displayed ""Midwestern politeness"" by tilting their heads and turning their bodies toward the other while speaking, the expert said."
Why The Dock Workers' Strike Should Be A Cautionary Tale For Every Manufacturer,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ethankarp/2024/10/02/why-the-dock-workers-strike-should-be-a-cautionary-tale-for-every-manufacturer/,2024-10-02T22:02:54Z,"Dock workers across the East and Gulf coast are on strike and the stakes are frighteningly high. The economy stands to lose an estimated $5 billion a day. A prolonged picket line will wreak havoc on the supply chain. We've seen this movie in varying degrees already, after the Baltimore bridge collapse and, of course, the pandemic. We know all too well the paralyzing effect it will have on manufacturing -- preventing raw materials from getting to factories and products from getting to customers.

Dock workers, by and large, want more money. But, make no mistake, this is also a battle against technology. Look at the picket signs. Many workers believe they're going to be replaced by automation and AI. This is the first technology backlash to take to the streets at scale -- but it won't be the last. And if manufacturing isn't careful, it could be next. Here are four things our industry must do to avoid a tech revolt.

Focus On People First, Machines Second

At the end of the day, manufacturing runs on people, not machines. We can't afford to alienate our most precious resource. We also can't let automation or AI become the enemy. The truth is, American manufacturers simply can't compete with China without Industry 4.0 technologies. Just like at the docks, automation is inevitable. But for it to succeed, employees must be with us on the journey.

Manufacturers need to be crystal-clear about how they plan to invest in technology and what it means to their people. This requires transparent discussions (with workers and unions alike) and plenty of advance notice if it appears jobs could be automated. Change is hard and if you force buy-in -- as in, ""you need to buy the idea I'm selling"" -- you are setting yourself up to fail. If you engage stakeholders in your technology plan and ask them to co-create it for the good of the organization, you stand a much greater chance of finding a way forward that creates opportunity, not chaos.

Bridge The Human-Tech Gap

Fear of obsolescence is at the heart of the dock workers' strike, as automation threatens traditional roles. But technology transformation is not always a zero-sum game. It's not as simple as ""add one robot, take away one human."" It can be ""plus/and."" In fact, technology is already creating many more high-tech roles in manufacturing such as programming, running, and servicing collaborative robots on the production line. In factories, automation and robotics are most often used to take over dark, dirty, dangerous, and repetitive work -- freeing up humans to be retrained and upskilled for better, higher paying jobs.

Plus, in manufacturing, we have one major thing going for us that the ports do not. We've been short workers for decades. So, in most cases where automation has arrived, people have not been replaced. Manufacturing workers need to hear these stories and understand the new opportunities that are coming and how to get ready for them. This will reduce fear and set manufacturing up for a blended human-machine future that benefits everyone.

Cultivate A Change-Ready Culture

Factories aren't just automating. They're becoming total digital ecosystems. It's warp speed -- what took decades is now happening in months. It's not just technology and people who have to change. Our cultures do, too.

Manufacturing leaders should focus on fostering company cultures that are adaptable, resilient, and embrace change. This means not only promoting a vision of change but also supporting employees through that change. This could include technology and innovation programs, change management workshops, levelling up collaboration skills, and promoting a mindset of continuous growth and improvement. Since change is the only constant on the horizon, this will not only help companies navigate technology transformation, but also everything else that comes along, be it supply chain disruption, another pandemic, war, or anything else.

Lead For The Long Game

When anything becomes a battle, both sides lose. The dock workers' strike demonstrates the risks of drawing battle lines and forcing short-term agendas. Technology is changing fast, but it's actually better to start slow and steady: explain the vision, prove the case, engage employees in pilots, demonstrate small, quick wins. Then -- once the vision is understood, the support is strong, and the foundation is solid -- you can scale fast. Lead for the long game with a smart technology plan that balances productivity and workforce well-being, considers profits and people.

No one in manufacturing wants to go the way of the dock workers. Nor do we want to poison the well against the new technologies we desperately need to be globally competitive, keep the jobs we have, and create even more high-tech positions. This strike should be a cautionary tale for every manufacturer. This is what happens when automation is a surprise or a threat. Manufacturers can't afford to drive a stake between technology and the people who make their operations tick. But with transparent communications, a people-first strategy, and a balanced approach, automation can solve problems for manufacturing, not create them."
"Latino-Owned Business Revenues Grow, But Inflation Hurts Earnings",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rohitarora/2024/10/02/latino-owned-business-revenues-grow-but-inflation-hurts-earnings/,2024-10-02T21:47:00Z,"Revenues, credit scores and age-of-business of Latino-owned businesses all increased during the past 12 months, but expenses also rose, due to inflation.

Biz2Credit's annual Latino-Owned Business Study found that while revenues of Latino-owned companies increased (+11.6%), expenses rose more (+ 22.7%), resulting in lower earnings in 2023-24 than in 2022-23 (-$41.1K).

The analysis, released each year during Hispanic Heritage Month (Sept. 15 - Oct. 15) examined the performance of small to midsized companies in the U.S. from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024. It looked at financial indicators including annual revenue, operating expenses, age of business, and credit scores of both Latino-owned and non-Latino-owned companies.

Revenues for small businesses rose overall, largely because of inflation. Earnings were down overall, but the average drop for Latino-owned businesses was not as sharp as for non-Latino-owned businesses. Earnings performance of Latino-owned firms outperformed the others.

1. The average annual revenue of Latino-owned businesses increased by 11.6% from $601,636 in 2022-23 to $671,360 in 2023-24. Meanwhile, the average annual revenue for non-Latino Businesses increased by 11.5% from $667,204 in 2022-23 to $744,027 in 2023-24.

2. Average earnings (Annual Revenue - Operating Expenses) for Latino-owned businesses dropped from $113,268 in 2022-23 to $72,168 in 2023-24, a drop of $41,100. Meanwhile, non-Latino-owned businesses declined from $159,365 to $94,237, a drop of $65,128. Overall, earnings across all businesses decreased by 40% year over year.

3. Operating expenses for Latino-owned firms increased by 22.7% from $488,368 in 2022-23 to $599,192 in 2023-24, resulting in earnings decrease of 36.3% for Latino firms. Meanwhile, operating costs for non-Latino-owned companies increased 28% from $507,849 in 2022-23 to $649,790 in 2023-24, resulting in a 40.9% drop in earnings.

4. The average personal (FICO) credit score* for Latino owned business increased from 641 in 2022-23 to 647 in 2023-24. In comparison, the personal credit score for non-Latino-owned business increased from 648 to 659 during the same timeframe.

7. The percentage of financing applications submitted by Latino-owned businesses, relative to the total number of submitted applications, increased slightly from 14.8% in 2022-23 to 15% in 2023-24. In 2024, financing applications by Latino-owned businesses increased 14.13% (year-over-year) compared to 2023. That surpassed applications by non-Latino owned businesses, which grew 12.78% year-over-year.

8. The funding rate for Latino-owned businesses stands at 32%, slightly higher than the 31% rate for non-Latino-owned businesses. The average funded amounts were $62,371 for Latino-owned businesses and $76,503 for non-Latino-owned firms.

9. Construction accounted for the largest industry category of Latino-owned companies examined in the study, followed by Other Services (except Public Administration), Accommodation and Food Services, Retail Trade, and Transportation and Warehousing.

10. By state, nearly one-quarter (24%) of funding requests from Latino-owned firms came from Florida, followed closely by California (19.4%), and then Texas, New York, and New Jersey.

The numbers prove that inflationary pressures significantly hurt the earnings of all small businesses in the last year, and Latino-owned firms were not immune. Profits for Latino-owned firms seeking business financing were down 36% on average, as a result.

Many factors combined, including increased labor costs, rising fuel prices, and overall inflation. Rents continue to climb dramatically, especially for businesses located in cities. Meanwhile, insurance costs have skyrocketed. Rising costs of labor, rent, and insurance are unavoidable, and there unfortunately does not seem to be an end in teh near future. They are significantly hurting small businesses.

Further, high interest rates also pinched companies that borrowed money for working capital or expansion. The good news is that the growth rate of inflation has been easing a bit, and the Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates, thus bringing down the cost of capital.

Impact of Latino-owned businesses on the U.S. Economy

The U.S. is home to over 63 million Latinos, accounting for roughly 19% of the nation's population. Latinos contribute a staggering $3.2 trillion to the economy and own nearly 5 million businesses that collectively generate more than $800 billion annually, according to the Stanford Graduate School of Business Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative (SLEI).

Further, Latino entrepreneurs are starting businesses at more than twice the rate of the general U.S. population. This increase has led to a higher proportion of new businesses being owned by immigrants overall. In 2023, immigrants were responsible for 36% of new business launches, up from 25% in 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Latino immigrants significantly outpace other groups in business ownership, and they comprise 52% of all Latino-owned businesses. In contrast, only 7% of white-owned employer businesses are immigrant-owned, according to the SLEI. Further, Latino-owned businesses are set to revolutionize the U.S. economy, as Latinos are projected to make up 29% of the population by 2050 and contribute a staggering $1.4 trillion to the U.S. economy, according to JPMorgan Chase.

As the Latino population grows, it becomes more and more of an indicator of the health of the U.S. economy. Business owners are hopeful that with inflation starting to ease, their revenues may again be on the upswing."
"In a climate milestone, the UK - 1st to harness coal power - is among 1st to quit it",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5133426/uk-quits-coal-climate-change,2024-10-02T21:45:52Z,"RATCLIFFE-ON-SOAR, England - When the coal-fired turbines at this sprawling power plant north of London went silent this week, the skies above its eight giant steam stacks finally cleared - and Britain became the world's first major economy to quit coal power.

It's a milestone for the country that was first to harness the dirty fuel, in the 19th century. Coal powered the Industrial Revolution and the expansion of the British Empire. At the height of its reliance on coal, in the 1950s, about 96% of the United Kingdom's electricity came from burning it.

That fell to zero Monday evening, when the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power plant, in the English Midlands, shut off its turbines after 57 years. It was the country's last coal-fired plant.

""This is the first time in 142 years that there's no coal in the U.K. electricity system,"" says Michael Lewis, CEO of Uniper, the German company that runs the plant. ""It's a big, big moment in industrial history. That history can continue with zero carbon.""

It's also a milestone in the effort to tackle climate change. Burning coal releases carbon dioxide, and is a major driver of global warming. A handful of smaller countries have already phased out coal power, but Britain is first among the Group of Seven advanced economies to do so. The entire G7 has pledged to follow suit by 2035.

The U.K. has turned to cheaper and cleaner power sources, including natural gas but also a major expansion of offshore wind and solar farms. Meanwhile, regulations targeting air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions have made burning coal increasingly uneconomical.

In its heyday, Ratcliffe-on-Soar received more than 20 trainloads of coal per day, according to Uniper. That's enough to power two million homes. (Or in British terms, a billion cups of tea a day.)

Decommissioning will take two years; most of the plant's 170 employees are being reallocated. There were a few tears, Lewis said. The longest-serving employee had worked at the plant for nearly 50 years.

""We need to get off coal. We need to address climate change targets,"" Lewis told NPR. ""But at the same time, it's the end of an era.""

The Romans found coal in western England as early as the third century, according to the British Geological Survey. Mining began in earnest in the 1600s across England, Scotland and Wales.

Around the turn of the 17th century, the coal-powered steam engine was invented in Britain, powering industry. In the early 19th century, a British engineer invented the coal-fired locomotive, speeding commerce across the country and its colonies in South Asia and Africa.

Then in 1882, Thomas Edison's company opened Britain's first coal-fired power plant in London.

Since then, British coal plants have burned 5 billion tons of coal, emitting more than 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide. That's according to an analysis by the British publication Carbon Brief, which says the U.K.'s long coal habit produced more carbon emissions than most countries have ever produced from all sources - making it one of the largest historical contributors to climate change.

Those emissions typically stay in the atmosphere for decades or centuries.

By the 1950s, British coal use peaked, and so did pollution. Cities were shrouded in ""pea soup"" - a green toxic haze that included soot and sulfur dioxide from factory furnaces and residential coal fireplaces. The word ""smog"" was coined in London.

In the so-called Great Smog of 1952, at least 4,000 people died in the span of four days. It was so toxic, cows were said to have choked to death in fields.

That health emergency ultimately changed the economics of coal.

""In the 1950s, when the smog was killing thousands of people in London, the clean air laws came in, and then from the 1990s, relatively cleaner and cheaper gas began edging coal out,"" says Sepi Golzari-Munro, a Scotland-based climate and energy analyst. ""Now we see that transition happening again, with renewables.""

In part, Britain got lucky: In the 1960s, it discovered natural gas - a cheaper, relatively cleaner-burning fuel - in the North Sea. Last year, about a third of U.K. electricity came from gas.

In recent decades, the U.K. has also invested in a massive expansion of renewable energy, especially offshore wind. Britain is now the world's second-largest offshore wind market, after China. Last year, offshore wind generated 17% of the nation's electricity, according to the Crown Estate, which manages wind farms on royal land.

""We were able to take the onshore wind industry and move it offshore, where you get much higher wind speeds, and you can put in bigger turbines, and bigger wind farms,"" says Bryony Worthington, an environmental campaigner now in the House of Lords. Worthington helped write the country's Climate Change Act of 2008, which set national targets for the reduction of carbon emissions.

Britain also operates five nuclear power plants. The government plans to quadruple nuclear capacity by 2050.

Unlike the United States, where a number of lawmakers question the scientific consensus that human activity is driving global warming, there's widespread, cross-party consensus in the U.K. in favor of this clean energy transition, and environmental regulation.

""In the early 2000s, we were writing the world's first set of comprehensive laws on climate change that created legally binding carbon budgets,"" Worthington recalls. Those laws limited how much particulate matter coal stations could emit, banned new coal stations from being built, and taxed coal plants for their pollution, she notes.

Looking ahead, the government aims to eliminate natural gas from the U.K. power grid by 2030, and cut carbon emissions entirely by 2050.

Altogether, these laws and taxes mean it's no longer economical to mine British coal, or burn it. In 2015, lawmakers identified the last day of coal power a decade in advance, and then moved it up by a year - a relatively rapid phaseout that could be a model for other countries.

This energy transition has been aided by globalization and deindustrialization. Since the 1970s, the U.K has moved away from manufacturing, to a service economy. This country no longer runs as many big factories.

On Monday night, at a pub not far from the Ratcliffe-on-Soar smoke stacks, former workers raised a pint to the past. But the nostalgia only goes so far.

""It's good it's closing down, because of all the rubbish that was coming out into the atmosphere,"" says 71-year-old Simon Humble. ""When I worked there, even after a shower, you'd sneeze and all the coal dust was coming out of your nose.""

He says he's looking forward to seeing the plant's eight giant cooling towers demolished.

""I imagine they'll dynamite them down to the ground,"" he says. ""Now that'll be something to see."""

Monday's debate between Vance and Walz was largely considered civil and policy-focused. The candidates touched on topics including the economy, the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot, health care, the southern border and abortion rights. Microphones were only cut once in a heated exchange after the moderators fact-checked Vance and he went on a tangent about the process for applying for an asylum appointment online following a discussion about migrants in Springfield, Ohio. An early poll from after the debate showed there was no clear winner: Forty-two percent of respondents to a CBS and YouGov poll said they felt Vance won and 41% felt Walz won, while 17% said it ended in a tie.

2.2. That's how many points Harris is leading Trump by as of Wednesday afternoon, according to RealClearPolitics' national polling average. FiveThirtyEight's national average has Harris leading Trump by 2.8 points.

Shortly after Walz and Vance's debate ended, Trump claimed on social media the Harris campaign ""just put out a request for another Debate"" and suggested the Democrats are seeking a rematch because Walz ""lost so badly tonight."" Trump reiterated in the post he does not plan to debate Harris a second time, adding: ""Votes are already cast - And I'm leading BIG in the Polls."" Harris' team suggested after she first debated Trump she would participate in a second debate, but did not publicly comment on Trump's claim Tuesday night."
"Chinese Communist Party marks 75 years of rule as economic, security threats persist",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/chinese-communist-party-marks-75-years-rule-economic-security-threats-persist,2024-10-02T18:42:08Z,"Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Chinese head of state Xi Jinping on the anniversary, noting that Russia was the first country to recognize the People's Republic of China 75 years ago. Xi said he would continue to expand cooperation between the two nations.

China is marking the 75th year of Communist Party rule as economic challenges and security threats linger over the massive state.

No festivities have been announced for the 75th anniversary on Tuesday, save for a flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square, with an honor guard marching from the entrance of the sprawling palace that in past centuries was the home of Chinese emperors.

The entirely state-controlled media ran constant reports on China's economic progress and social stability, with no mention of challenges ranging from a declining birth rate to the disruption in supply chains that has harmed the largely export-driven economy.

TRUMP-ENDORSED HOUSE CANDIDATE SOUNDS ALARM ON CHINA'S GROWING INFLUENCE IN BATTLEGROUND STATE

Commemorations were also held in the former British colony of Hong Kong and Portugal's former territory of Macao, both of which returned to Chinese sovereignty in the late 1990s in a key indication of Beijing's determination to overcome what it has called a ""Century of Humiliation.""

In recent decades, China has mounted military parades and displays of the country's economic might only at the turn of decades, such as for the 60th and 70th anniversaries.

The world's second largest economy has struggled to regain momentum after the COVID-19 pandemic.

A prolonged property slump led to a spillover effect on other parts of the economy, from construction to sales of home appliances. Last week, China announced a slew of measures to boost the economy, including lower interest rates and smaller down payment requirements for mortgages.

Party leader and head of state Xi Jinping has largely avoided overseas travel since the pandemic, while continuing with his purges at home of top officials considered insufficiently loyal or being suspected of corruption or personal indiscretions.

""The road ahead will not be smooth, there will definitely be difficulties and obstacles, and we may encounter major tests such as high winds and rough seas, or even stormy waves,"" Xi warned during a banquet on the eve of the anniversary.

""We must be vigilant in times of peace, plan ahead, and rely closely on the entire Party, the entire army, and people of all ethnic groups across the country"" he said, ""no difficulties can stop the Chinese people from moving forward.""

The anniversary also comes as China is facing growing frictions with neighbors including Japan, South Korea and the Philippines over territorial claims and their close relationships with Beijing's chief rival, the United States.

The Communists under Mao Zedong seized power in 1949 amid a civil war with the Nationalists, also known as the KMT, led by Chiang Kai-shek, who shifted their political, economic and military power to the now self-governing island democracy of Taiwan.

Beijing continues to insist Taiwan must be annexed under Communist Party rule, by force if necessary, while the U.S. has provided arms to ensure its defense.

China, meanwhile, has involved itself in disputes over its claims to most of the South China Sea and uninhabited islands held by Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and other neighboring nations.

China's military buildup and its recent launch of a nuclear capable ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean have raised concerns about a possible conflict.

At home, Xi has made himself effectively leader for life by ending term limits and extending his power over key government and party bodies. China allows no competitive elections and the party retains near total control over the media that informs its 1.4 billion people.

Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Xi on the anniversary and the subsequent establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties, noting that Russia was the first country to recognize the People's Republic of China 75 years ago, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

Xi reaffirmed their close ties, saying China would continue to expand ""all-round pragmatic cooperation"" between the two nations."
Dubai Has A Plan To Double Tourism -- Here's Why It Might Succeed,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferleighparker/2024/10/02/dubai-has-a-plan-to-double-tourism---heres-why-it-might-succeed/,2024-10-02T18:29:58Z,"The desert city plans to become the world's most visited global hub. Issam Kazim, CEO of Dubai Tourism, shares the strategy.

A few short decades ago, Dubai was 'a dot in the desert.' Now a city of more than three million people, most of whom are expatriates, its growth trajectory is staggering. As is the spending.

Currently underway is the $35 billion renovation of the new passenger terminal at Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC), approved by Dubai's leadership in April. The futuristic structure, designed by Leslie Jones Architecture, will replace Dubai International Airport (DXB), already the world's second-busiest international hub, after Atlanta, Georgia's Hartsfield-Jackson airport. But the UAE is aiming higher. If it opens as planned within the next 10 years, DWC expects to become the largest (and most expensive) airport in the world.

Meanwhile, hoteliers are placing their bets, particularly in the luxury category. By the end of 2024, Dubai will welcome a new Delano Dubai (owned by Accor), a Jumeirah Marsa Al Arab, and a Six Senses The Palm, Dubai (IHG), while Ennismore's partner brands Rikas Group and Paris Society add five new beach clubs and restaurants to the region. By 2025, the city will unveil a new Gran Melia beach resort, just as SHA Wellness Clinic (famed for its sister resorts in Spain and Mexico) prepares for its 2026 Emirates debut.

If you're thinking 'Las Vegas on steroids,' just wait. MGM Resorts is building its own ""Dubai Sphere,"" a smaller version of the immersive Las Vegas Sphere, as part of a new $2 billion complex. Though no opening date has been announced, the construction contract has been awarded for the development of three new resorts: an MGM, Bellagio and an Aria, with a sphere in the middle.

Projects like these seem to solidify Dubai's reputation as an ostentatious, artificial desert oasis. But during his recent media blitz in New York, including a speech delivered at the Skift Global Forum travel conference, Issam Kazim, CEO of Dubai Corporation for Tourism and Commerce Marketing, insisted there's way more to his hometown than that. And he's launching a new campaign to convince U.S. travelers to take another look. Here, an excerpt from our conversation:

Dubai feels more accessible, in a way it wasn't 10 years ago.

Depending on the list, today we are the 3rd or 4th internationally most visited city in the world. When we started in 2014, we were number seven -- so we mapped out a complete strategy. [Dubai welcomed 9.31 million international overnight visitors from January to June 2024, a 9% increase over the 8.55 million tourist arrivals in the first half of 2023, according to the Department of Economy and Tourism].

We interviewed people in cities we were interested in targeting. There are 6-7 traditional strong markets. What are potential new markets we can open up? How can we match their needs? We quickly realized that the people visiting Dubai expected great beaches and hotels, and that's all they assumed was there. A lot of people didn't associate culture or heritage with Dubai.

It's an outlier in the United Arab Emirates, in that it was oil poor. It had to find other ways to attract wealth: mainly tourism and finance. Is that right?

Absolutely. It was a trading hub. There was an industry that relied on fishing and pearl diving. It was all built around the creek where traders came in. The first mega project was the dredging of that creek to allow ships to come and go. It started to open up a lot more business communities to come in. Today, you have close to 200 nationalities that have chosen Dubai to be home; they make up about 90% of the population, from all walks of life. We were blessed by not having natural resources; we were forced to look elsewhere to take tourism and trade to the next level.

From trade comes commerce, and from commerce comes banking...

Dubai thinks and acts like a company. We joke, we call ourselves Dubai Inc. Because the private and public sector work together hand-in-hand. If rules need to change because it's more conducive to business, we make those changes. It's that dynamic; it's that agile.

I'll give you an example: We have a good number of 3-4 star hotels; but maybe not enough to open up more markets. Luxury, we've got it covered. But we also need more affordable luxury. So, we created an incentive. We had a pipeline of investors coming in to build more hotels because there is demand. We told them: Anybody who develops new 3-4 star hotels, we will waive off the 10% municipality fees for five years. So developers shifted down from 5 stars, because everybody has a quicker ROI [return on investment] on 3 and 4 stars.

When we launched our strategy in 2014, we had 67,000 hotel rooms. Today we have over 150,000 hotel rooms. So, more than double in about eight years. On average, they are just shy of 80% occupancy. [Compared to the end of 2019, hotels across all categories are up 11.3%, with room inventory up 20.1% -- bringing the current total to over 820 establishments and 150,000 rooms, according to the Department of Economy and Tourism].

Are you open to travel-tech companies like Airbnb and Uber?

Yes, we're open and connected with the world. With Airbnb, we understand the challenges they face in New York. But at the end of the day, it's not about Airbnb, it's about Airbnb's customers. If that's the way they travel, we can't ignore them completely. We want to accommodate them as well.

The misconception that people have is that Dubai is too expensive. But that's not true. [In addition to Hotel Indigo Dubai Downtown, Rove Hotels', Avani+ Palm View and Al Seef Heritage Hotel, Mama Shelter hotels will add another mid-priced option to Dubai this year].

Where is future growth going to come from?

Palm Jumeirah island is a massively successful destination. We're bringing in properties and hotels within that space. There's a lot more coming up. Right next door is where the Al Maktoum Airport is going to be. Dubai International Airport (DXB) has reached its maximum capacity. So we soft launched Al Maktoum a few years ago to get people used to that area. That's where the new developers of Dubai are going.

When will it open?

Within 10 years. It will be done in phases, because that's where the future of growth is going to be for us. When it reaches full capacity, it can accommodate up to 260 million passengers annually. [By comparison, Dubai International has upped its forecast to 91.8 million guests for 2024, above the all-time high of 89.1 million recorded in 2018].

Plus, it's right next to the one of the largest port operators, DP world. Our hub is about connecting not just people but also goods. We're working to better serve business needs.

By allowing foreign companies to have full ownership?

Yes, the law changed in 2020. [Foreigners are allowed to establish companies with 100 percent full ownership, based on the provisions of Federal Decree-Law No. 26 of 2020 amending the provisions of Federal Law No. 2 of 2015 on Commercial Companies].

Businesses are setting up their global HQs in Dubai, because it gives them access to the rest of the world. Setting them up is part of our remit since we merged the department of tourism with the department of economy in 2022. Now, we're talking about becoming the number one city to live in, and the number one city to work in. In many ways, we're an incubator for what cities look like in the future.

What else are you doing to meet your goals?

When we started, we had 160-odd projects, but we simplified it with four key targets: We want to become one of the most visited cities in the world, increase the number of visitors every year, increase length of stay, increase spend within the city; we want them to explore everything Dubai has to offer and to increase repeat visitation.

Today, we've ticked all those boxes. Now, 25% of the visitors that come to Dubai will repeat their visit within 12 months. Within an 8-hour radius, two-thirds of the world's population is right there. So, we've made it easier to get a Visa, and we've made it easier for people to access Dubai by opening up more routes with our partners. Six months after we launched, we added 16 countries into a 'Visa on arrival' program. That's how quickly we move. Now, with Emirates you've got a lot of gateways in and out of the US. They created a co-chair with United Airlines. [United Airlines is currently the only U.S. carrier offering a nonstop flight to Dubai].

Says Kazim, ""In many ways, we're an incubator for what cities look like in the future.""

What are you doing to welcome female travelers?

We're very focused on changing perceptions about women in Dubai. The first thing that I'm always being asked is: Do I have to cover up when I go to Dubai? No, it's not like that. You have people from all walks of life. Everyone, as long as they are respectful of the other, they can live in Dubai the way they want to live.

Let's talk about food. Have things changed since the Michelin Guide arrived in Dubai in 2022?

Five years ago, I worked on a project to try and get Michelin to even consider Dubai; we were not on their radar. They weren't interested. Then, one day I get a call: ""Our team member flew with Emirates to Dubai. We asked them to survey the area. We were pleasantly surprised; Dubai is far more ready than we had assumed."" Now in its 3rd year, we have 106 restaurants listed in the 2024 Michelin Guide.

For me, the magic of Michelin is marketing. Pure and simple. Knowing that Michelin is talking about Dubai, I have another massive channel pushing the destination out there. When Michelin was announced, I saw with my own eyes when the restaurateurs and chefs of Dubai went up onstage, they were crying. They never imagined that Dubai would have that opportunity. Then, I felt the importance of it.

What's on your wishlist?

That people know Dubai as if they are living and breathing it on the ground. If I can make that knowledge available to them before they choose a destination, that would be the holy grail. When people come with an open mind, they not only end up coming back, they start asking, how can I live here? I want to get people to understand what Dubai is about."
Harris dodges answering whether athletes should stand during national anthem in unearthed interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-dodges-answering-whether-athletes-should-stand-during-national-anthem-unearthed-interview,2024-10-02T18:10:54Z,"FOX News contributor Joe Concha responds to a Harvard board's unanimous vote to keep President Claudine Gay following her antisemitism testimony and controversy over LeBron James sitting during the national anthem to avoid being a 'distraction.'

Vice President Kamala Harris sidestepped answering directly whether she believes athletes should stand for the national anthem during an unearthed 2016 interview, instead delivering a rambling response that is currently receiving backlash on social media ahead of the general election.

While serving as attorney general of California, Harris joined PBS reporter David Nazar to discuss her Senate run and campaign platforms on issues such as criminal justice reform, the Black Lives Matter movement and the economy in California. During the discussion, Nazar pressed Harris if she believes athletes should stand for the national anthem.

""Should folks stand for the national anthem?"" Nazar asked in the interview, which was published in October 2016.

Harris' response focused on Americans' rights protected in the Constitution, and did not include a direct answer on whether athletes should stand for ""The Star-Spangled Banner.""

""We are all, and should be, treated as equals. We articulated those principles in our Constitution. And part of what we decided is what makes a fair and just and noble society in a democracy, a true democracy, is freedom of religion, freedom, right, of association, freedom to organize, First Amendment,"" she responded.

""So, that is part of who we are as a country, and I will defend it to the core, which is that we give people, certain choices in this country.""

PRO ATHLETES WHO STOOD FOR NATIONAL ANTHEM AMID FEVER PITCH TO SUPPORT SOCIAL JUSTICE INITIATIVES

In 2016, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick became the first NFL player to kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism. The form of protest, which began in Harris' backyard of San Francisco, soon spread to other sports leagues and athletes.

Athletes such as Megan Rapinoe knelt for the anthem ahead of soccer games in 2016, while Bruce Maxwell became the first Major League Baseball athlete to kneel during the national anthem in 2017.

TRUMP TAKES NFL, NBA TO TASK ABOUT KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM

The form of protest hit a fever pitch in 2020 following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis during an interaction with police. Scores of athletes knelt ahead of games that year during the anthem, while the NBA unveiled a court painted with ""Black Lives Matter"" amid social justice protests that year, and some Olympians took a knee during the Tokyo Games.

The protests were slammed by conservatives in the U.S., including former President Trump, who ripped the athletes for politicizing games.

TRUMP GIVES TWO-WORD RESPONSE IN REACTION TO NFL PLAYERS KNEELING BEFORE THANKSGIVING DAY GAME

""I think it's been horrible for basketball. Look at the basketball ratings. They're down to very low numbers. People are angry about it. They don't realize.... They have enough politics with guys like me. They don't need more as they're driving down... going up for the shot. They don't need it. There's a nastiness about the NBA about the way it was done too. So I think the NBA is in trouble. It's in big trouble. Bigger trouble than they understand,"" Trump said in 2020.

Trump also posted to X, then Twitter, that kneeling for the national anthem is ""a sign of great disrespect for our Country and our Flag,"" saying the ""game is over"" for him when he spots an athlete kneeling.

Harris' unearthed interview was criticized on social media this week, with OutKick founder Clay Travis saying Harris delivered a ""long jumble of nothingness.""

COLIN KAEPERNICK PROTEST FALLOUT SHOWED 'REALLY HOW A LOT OF THE WHITE PEOPLE SEE US,' NFL LEGEND SAYS

Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment on the 2016 interview, but did not immediately receive a response.

Harris defended athletes who knelt during the anthem in 2017, after she was elected senator, saying they should not be ""threatened or bullied"" for the protest.

""Let's speak the truth that when Americans demand recognition that their lives matter, or kneel to call attention to injustice, that that is an expression of free speech, protected by our Constitution, and they should not be threatened or bullied,"" Harris said during an event in Atlanta, the Hill reported at the time.

""When we sing 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' we rightly think about the brave men and women from all backgrounds who proudly defend the freedom of those they may never meet and people who will never know their names. When we sing 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' we also think about those marching in the streets who demand that the ideals of that flag represent them too,"" she added."
National Disability Employment Awareness Month Promotes Access To Good Jobs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianewiniarski/2024/10/02/national-disability-employment-awareness-month-promotes-access-to-good-jobs/,2024-10-02T18:01:23Z,"National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM), an annual October event sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor, acknowledges that individuals with disabilities add value to workplaces across the country and to the economy. This year's theme, ""Access to Good Jobs for All,"" speaks to every American worker, but especially to those who are returning to work through Social Security's Ticket to Work (TTW) Program.

This year's theme also addresses the department's pledge to increase the quality and number of employment opportunities for people with disabilities. After a lengthy medical leave, many are searching for meaningful jobs, and NDEAM supports their efforts. ""Workers, including those with disabilities, have a right to pursue high-quality, well-paying jobs and be successful in those jobs,"" the department said. NDEAM's pledge complements the goal of the TTW Program - to empower individuals to return to work and move them toward financial self-sufficiency through meaningful employment.

Jobs Bring TTW Participants Self-Worth And Greater Income

With the combined benefit of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and TTW, former workers with disabilities have the opportunity to pursue employment without fear of losing their disability income or Medicare benefits for a period of time. While job searches and interviews can be stressful, TTW offers valuable support and work incentives that make attempting a return to work less daunting.

One of the most impactful TTW benefits is free assistance from Social Security-authorized Employment Networks (EN) and state Vocational Rehabilitation agencies (VR). These firms support TTW participants in returning to work. Experienced professionals explain the program details and help you identify your skills, interests and potential job opportunities. They offer guidance and resources so you can approach the job search and interview process with confidence. They will also guide you in requesting reasonable accommodations from your employer, if needed.

The support from ENs or VRs that helps TTW ticket holders find and obtain the right jobs is invaluable. Ticket to Work participants, employed by companies where they feel valued, report improved self-worth and a renewed sense of purpose, recognizing they have a lot to contribute. The program supports participants in moving toward financial self-sufficiency by enabling them to earn more than they can on disability benefits alone, which is the core goal of TTW. Beneficiaries say they feel a sense of accomplishment and, at the same time, are contributing to the organization.

A TTW participant explains, ""It was a difficult decision to return to work. But working helps me socialize with others. Staying at home can cause me to spiral downward. I needed some parameters and a controlled setting to get me back to work. My Employment Network provided that for me. I'm a huge success story for them.""

Another SSDI beneficiary says, ""The Ticket to Work Program provided the safety net I needed. It allowed me to earn more and get used to working again, at my pace.""

National Disability Employment Awareness Month is a reminder this October and every month that all workers, including those with disabilities, will benefit from more access to quality jobs. The TTW Program makes this possible for SSDI beneficiaries who choose to reenter the workforce. Employment Networks and VRs help workers with disabilities increase their income and gain greater self-worth as they find and thrive in good jobs. Ticket to Work supports NDEAM's mission by making these opportunities available all year long."
MSNBC guest says JD Vance 'not the kind of despicable character we have seen' in clips,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-guest-says-jd-vance-not-kind-despicable-character-we-have-seen-clips,2024-10-02T17:04:24Z,"Ex-MSNBC host Donny Deutsch appeared on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Wednesday morning, where he admitted that vice presidential candidate JD Vance was ""good"" in the debate.

""He was good,"" he said. ""I mean, he was too slick, maybe, but... he certainly was not the kind of despicable character that we've kind of seen clips of."" Deutsch described the debate as a ""draw"" up until the discussion of the 2020 election and Trump's refusal to concede defeat: ""I think that that was disqualifying,""

""I think that's disqualifying in the election, if you can't say that,"" he continued. ""I mean, I think that that's -- the issue, that whenever I get into debates with anybody, I go, well, democracy, duh, kind of on the docket.""

EX-MSNBC HOST: 'THE REAL PROBLEM' IS 'HALF THE COUNTRY' SUPPORTS TRUMP AND THE GOP: 'IT'S THE VOTERS'

The frequent MSNBC guest also weighed in on criticisms that the debate was boring, which he said will be a ""referendum"" on what people want going forward.

""I think the big theme of this thing was that it was very congenial, and it was not a blood sport,"" he said. ""It was not UFC. It was more like boxing. And if the American public -- your intuition says, well, the American public is ready for that, they want that, but then I kind of said to myself, is there this sick, twisted thing that people are addicted to the sick entertainment value of Donald Trump, and that they were kind of disappointed?""

""I was enjoying it, but they were disappointed: 'No, that's no fun. Are we going to go back to that?' Now, my better angels in me say, no, people are ready for that. But it's an interesting question,"" he added.

DONNY DEUTSCH: DEMOCRATS LOSING ON ECONOMY, SO WE NEED TO 'SCARE' VOTERS AGAINST 'RACIST' GOP

Deutsch concluded, arguing Vance's good performance is going to ""bother"" Trump, as he showed Americans he was the ""better"" candidate.

""Donald Trump, you're going to see, he's going to be very dismissive of JD Vance in the coming weeks, but Donald Trump is not happy this morning because JD Vance showed himself to be a superior candidate,"" he said."
"WATCH: Voters react in real time to key Vance-Walz debate moments on immigration, democracy, abortion",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/watch-voters-react-real-time-key-vance-walz-debate-moments-immigration-democracy-abortion,2024-10-02T16:27:52Z,"Fox News Digital ranks the top five memorable moments from the 2024 Vice Presidential Debate between Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz.

A Fox News Digital focus group of Republicans, Democrats and independents reacted to key moments from the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate between Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night, offering real-time responses to the candidates' statements.

In a focus group hosted by Lee Carter, participants across the political spectrum used dials showing their favorable, unfavorable or neutral responses to Vance and Walz. Their reactions gave insights into how the voters who will help decide the election felt about the demeanor, character and policies of the two men, one of whom will be the next vice president.

Here are some of the most significant voter reactions from Tuesday night's focus group.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

Vance's argument that the U.S. needed to ""stop the bleeding"" at the border during Tuesday's debate elicited a mixed response from voters.

Vance received mixed responses when he said, ""Before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding... we have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.""

While Republican views of Vance's answers had an immediate positive response, Democratic viewers of the debate went in an opposite direction, the dials showed. Independents, meanwhile, hovered around a neutral response to Vance's answer.

Voters began to see Vance's response in a more positive light when he touched on former President Trump's border policies, arguing that the next administration should return to handling the border similar to how Trump did during his four years in office.

Democrats and independents reacted moderately-to-highly favorable to Walz's rejoinder on the migrant crisis and his criticism of the Trump administration.

Walz touted the bipartisan immigration bill that Trump pushed to kill earlier this year and defended Kamala Harris' record in California on the issue. Republicans were unfavorable to Walz but independents and Democrats gave him high marks throughout his answer.

""Pass the bill, she'll sign it,"" Walz said.

Republican, Democrat and independent voters reacted differently when Vance stated that he and Trump support ""clean air, clean water"" when climate change was brought up at the debate.

""Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say, Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer,"" Vance said.

The Fox News Debate Dial showed support among independents and Democrats dipping downward when Vance made that statement. Support among Republicans remained fairly consistent.

But support among independent viewers began to rise again when Vance referenced how Democrats bring up carbon emissions when discussing climate change.

""This idea that carbon emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true,"" Vance said. ""Well, if you believe that, what would you -- would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to restore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.""

One of Walz's most difficult moments at the debate received poor to middling reviews across the board from the focus group.

Moderators confronted Walz on his prior claim that he was present at the Tiananmen Square protests in Hong Kong in 1989, when he didn't travel to Asia until later that year. Walz gave a meandering answer that showed sub-par responses from Democrats, Republicans and independents almost throughout his entire comment, which didn't directly address the discrepancy.

At one point, he admitted he could be a ""knucklehead."" He eventually admitted he'd misspoke.

Walz's support among Republicans dipped to its lowest point - under 10% - when he said former President Donald Trump would have benefited from participating in one of his China trips, arguing Trump would never have befriended Chinese President Xi Jinping.

DISGRACED EX-CBS NEW ANCHOR DAN RATHER SAYS OLD NETWORK LOOKING TO AVOID 'BLOWBACK' ABC RECEIVED

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming public resources in Springfield, Ohio.

Independent and Republican voters disapproved of the interjection, but independent voters dipped significantly when Vance began explaining his stance.

Independents were mixed, while Republicans were highly favorable of Vance saying he was ""wrong"" about Trump in the past when confronted about his past criticism of his running mate.

""Sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the president, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record,"" Vance said.

When Walz was asked whether he supports abortion up until the ninth month as Minnesota is one of the least restrictive states for abortion, he responded, ""That's not what the bill says.""

While Republican voters dipped significantly as Walz spoke, independent and Democratic voters stayed mostly in the approval zone.

""What we did is restore Roe v. Wade, we made sure that we put women in charge of their health care,"" Walz said.

Independents dipped slightly in approval while Democratic voters shot up during his statement. The two eventually evened out and stayed in the approval zone.

""This is a basic human right,"" he later said.

The independent voters stayed slightly under the Democratic approval line, as Republicans significantly disapproved.

Vance received a positive reaction across the board from Democrats, Republicans and Independents when he told Walz he was sorry his son was once a witness to a shooting.

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that,"" the senator told Walz.

Independents gave Vance an immediate low rating when he said he was focused on the future after Walz asked him if Trump lost the 2020 election.

Republicans on the Fox News Debate Dial had been unimpressed with Walz's line of questioning and the dial went down, with the approval staying generally the same with Vance's answers, but the dials for independents and Democrats took a sharp dive as Vance brushed off the question. It dove the sharpest among independents.

Liberal media pundits repeatedly played and discussed the clip in the debate's aftermath, saying it was one of Walz's strongest moments in a night that Vance otherwise controlled.

Is Quantum Computing An Unlikely Answer To AI's Looming Energy Crisis?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2024/10/02/is-quantum-computing-an-unlikely-answer-to-ais-looming-energy-crisis/,2024-10-02T16:12:27Z,"AI uses a ton of electricity. Just ask Elon Musk. He's investing billions in building out some of the largest supercomputers in the world to train his AI models to fuel future Tesla EVs, robotaxis, Optimus humanoid robots and Grok which is the large language model in beta test on X -- formerly known as Twitter.

And thanks to the seemingly ever-expanding iteration of AI services offered from Google, OpenAI, Amazon, Microsoft and others we can expect those power demands to continue to grow.

It's estimated that after decades of nearly zero growth in new demand for electricity within the US data centers, AI will double current data center usage by 2030 -- according to recent research from Barclays, co-authored by Will Thompson, senior thematic research analyst focusing on energy and industrial sectors.

""The proliferation of AI, coupled with manufacturing reshoring, electrification (e.g. EVs, heat pumps) and cryptocurrencies, have raised US electricity demand expectations. In our view, this presents risks to our AI and net zero ambitions. While there have been various top-down forecasts for AI and data center energy demand, they lack underlying assumptions, leading to more questions than answers,"" he wrote in an email exchange.

""Our analysis indicates a lot of imminent AI energy needs with data centers potentially exceeding 9% of US current electricity demand by 2030 versus only about 3.5% today,"" Thompson added.

Thompson explained that this is a problem because current infrastructure isn't built to sustain that level of data center energy production.

He further noted that both Republicans and Democrats want to ensure the US maintains a leadership position within the AI space for the sake of the economy, national security, as well as future safety and governance of the tech. But there isn't agreement on how to power the future of AI.

""Despite bipartisan support for infrastructure permit reform and investment, plus growing support for nuclear power, the parties remain divided on the future roles for renewables and fossil fuels, electrification policies, and what impact all this will have on climate change, economic growth, and energy affordability and reliability,"" he wrote.

Additional challenges he cited include AI's need for 24/7/365 uptime; the intermittency of renewable energy such as wind and solar; current geographic concentration of data centers as well as computing demands from AI outpacing energy-efficiency gains from available GPU tech.

However, there have been reports and studies that suggest -- in specific instances -- the use of quantum computing could be as much as 100 times more energy efficient than a typical supercomputer.

In fact, a recent article comparing the energy consumption spanning 20 years by the top 500 supercomputers in the world found that a publicly available quantum computer with the same compute power as the top-energy glutton on the list, consumed less than 0.05% of the electricity.

To understand how quantum computing works, we need to start with how a regular computer works. Bits are the smallest amount of computer information. Think of the bits on your laptop as nothing more than a series of tiny light switches that can be either ""off"" or ""on"" -- each position signified by a 0 or a 1 in computer speak. Everything a computer does is based on those bits flipping between being on and off.

In quantum computing, those systems operate on quantum bits, or qubits. A qubit is like a spooky, magical switch that can be both off and on at the same time - here's how. Imagine a spinning coin on a table. While it's spinning around, it's not just heads or tails - it's actually kind of both until it lands.

Similarly, a qubit can be in a state where it's both 0 and 1 at the same time - this is called superposition. The unique state that allows qubits to be both 0 and 1 at the same time, enables them to handle multiple possibilities all at once. That means quantum computers can solve certain problems - such as AI's linear algebraic equations - much faster than regular computers.

One more interesting tidbit about qubits is that they can be linked together in a special way called entanglement. So once a pair of qubits are entangled -- the state of one qubit depends on the state of another -- even if they're far apart. This allows quantum computers to linkup and process an even larger amount of information quickly.

IonQ is a leader in the quantum computing space offering a suite of solutions that span cloud-based quantum access, consulting applications, quant networking and hardware. In a Zoom call with IonQ President and CEO, Peter Campbell, he said quantum computing processors are uniquely designed to meet the computing challenges of artificial intelligence.

""Large language models operate on linear algebra, and that's one of the things quantum is good at, and we are busily working on looking at creating a hybrid version of a large language model where we move the linear algebra off of GPUs and CPUs and onto a quantum processor. That migration would then reduce the energy requirements,"" Campbell explained.

He said the company is likely six to nine months away from having prototypes of the hybrid quantum chip specifically for AI, noting that they have had hybrid quant processors in the field for years for other use cases like the transportation industry.

But he reiterated that quantum is the best technology available -- not just for AI's computational needs but its energy demands as well.

""For the things that quantum computing is good at -- such as AI processing -- there's no way for any GPU to compete against us. Those workloads are ultimately going to go to quantum and current technology just literally can't compete,"" Campbell said.

""Quantum computing -- our next generation chip -- to simulate what it's doing, you would need something like two and a half billion GPUs and it runs off a two standard wall sockets,"" he added.

He explained that his teams have been working to make quantum computers hardier and able to colocate within existing data centers without exotic absolute zero temperatures or customized shock-absorbing server racks. Campbell says their manufacturing capacity will be at scale within the next 24 months.

""We have been scaling up our manufacturing capability, but also just to make sure that these things are compatible with standard data centers. We don't want clients to have to put up a special building to install one of our quantum computers into it. So we've been working on putting them into standard racks. Working with the environmental specifications of the buildings and the power requirements so they're ready to go,"" said Campbell.

Despite the potential of quantum computing, Barclays' Thompson noted that solving AI's power puzzle will require more.

""In our view, there are no silver bullet solutions. It will require an above-all-approach of expanding and modernizing electric grid infrastructure, integrating renewables with utility-scale storage, utilizing our existing nuclear capacity, and scaling new forms of carbon-free energy. That will include geothermal, advances nuclear small modular reactors (SMRs) and fusion technology,"" he wrote."
Cold Frittatas: JetBlue Drops Hot Food On Transatlantic Flights In Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerdooley/2024/10/02/cold-frittatas-jetblue-drops-hot-food-on-transatlantic-flights-in-economy/,2024-10-02T16:01:53Z,"JetBlue is rolling out new menus for transatlantic flights, and there's one surprising feature on them: there will be no hot meals for flyers in economy class.

On just about all airlines, even passengers in the cheap seats on an ocean crossing could count on at least one hot meal, albeit one with sometimes questionable appeal. Now, JetBlue economy menus come with this chilling note: ""All items served chilled.""

A frittata with roasted zucchini and tomatoes sounds tasty for breakfast, but do you really want a cold frittata? A lunch/dinner menu offers a choice of Chicken Grain Bowl (cold) or Ginger Garlic Tofu (cold). Another lets flyers choose between Pesto Pasta Salad (cold) and Mushrooms & Lentils (cold). Sounds delicious, right?

I've predicted that, based on moves by various airlines, that customer experience might be how airlines seek a competitive edge. United Airlines, for example, just announced that it would upgrade WiFi on all of its planes to Starlink service, and offer it at no charge to all customers. In a recent interview, Customer Management Practice president Mario Matulich called CX an ""interesting competitive battleground.""

While nobody expects gourmet meals in economy, flyers do expect sustenance on a flight that lasts eight or nine hours. Some of JetBlue's chilled choices seem truly unpalatable, and I expect some flyers will feel the need to bring their own food on board.

Passengers bringing food onto airplanes creates customer experience problems beyond the mere inconvenience of purchasing and carrying potentially messy bags or boxes. One survey of 3,000 travelers found their third biggest annoyance was other passengers bringing smelly food onto airplanes. That's bad enough on a short flight, but would be even worse on flights that might stretch to ten hours.

For an airline that used to pride itself on service, JetBlue's cold food seems out of step with its heritage and with the industry as a whole.

For many flyers, ticket price is the most important variable. The survival of low-cost airlines that offer objectively terrible service proves this to be true. If JetBlue's prices for crossing the Atlantic in economy are low enough, no doubt many passengers will complain about the food but choose JetBlue anyway."
Majority of NY Times columnists agree JD Vance won debate: 'Much more forceful speaker',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/majority-ny-times-columnists-agree-jd-vance-won-debate-forceful-speaker,2024-10-02T14:38:02Z,"GOP, Democrat, and Independent voters react in real-time to Ohio Senator JD Vance's claims that he and former President Trump care about the environment during Tuesday night's CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Credit: CBS)

A majority of the 13 columnists and contributors polled by The New York Times agreed that JD Vance won the debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night.

Multiple New York Times columnists, including Binyamin Appelbaum, said that Vance was overall effective in his presentation on the debate stage. Seven of the columnists and contributors said that Vance defeated Walz in the debate, with two saying that the face-off was a draw and three writers concluding that Walz won.

""He made Trumpism sound polite, calm and coherent,"" Appelbaum said of Vance.

GOP LAWMAKERS, LEADERS REACT TO VANCE, WALZ DEBATE: 'SPITTING COLD, HARD TRUTH'

""Vance was far nimbler than the nervous Tim Walz, especially in the first half of the debate. But as the debate went on, Vance stumbled on two issues -- abortion and the 2020 election -- where his rhetorical skill could not salvage the very unappealing material he was working with,"" Josh Barro, author of the newsletter Very Serious, wrote.

""Walz won,"" Times columnist Charles M. Blow wrote. ""You could tell that he was a teacher, because he clearly did his homework. Anyone afraid that Vance would roll over him could breathe easily.""

Newsletter writer Matt Labash said that ""Nobody truly dominated.""

""But I'm giving the slight edge to Walz, since Vance embarrassingly soft-pedaled Jan. 6 and Trump posted this to Truth Social during the debate: 'More Notes! Why Can't Walz just remember what he has to say? Low IQ!' Reminding us that Vance's boss should watch more Hallmark Channel, less Newsmax.""

VANCE, WALZ FACE OFF ON BORDER, CLIMATE CHANGE AND ABORTION DURING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Other writers said that the debate outcome was more even.

Contributing Times Opinion writer Jane Coaston wrote that ""Vance seemed smoother and more practiced, but 'won' is a very strong term here.""

Times columnist Gail Collins said that the debate was a ""draw"" because ""Walz was so bad in much of his delivery. Vance was a much more forceful speaker while spewing lies on everything from abortion to Biden's foreign policy.""

Contributing Times opinion writer Peter Wehner said that Vance proved he was ""sharp and in command and ... an excellent debater.""

""At times he tried too hard to appear likable; I came away more convinced that he's a hollow man, radioactive and incendiary one day, conciliatory and agreeable the next,"" Wehner said. ""But the 'good Vance' did a lot to repair his tattered image.""

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital, ""Senator JD Vance completely dominated the debate and showed why we need to return President Trump to the White House."" He added that Trump's vice presidential nominee ""gave clear answers how the Trump-Vance ticket will turn around our economy, secure our southern border, make our streets safe once again, and restore peace in the Middle East.""

Cheung continued by saying that Vance ""exposed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for being failed, radical leftists who are all slogans with zero substance.""

""He called out Kamala Harris for destroying our southern border. He called out Harris for creating the record inflation making life unaffordable for millions of Americans. And he called out Harris for enabling Iran, leading to the current attacks on Israel,"" the spokesman added.

Don't Repeat History: Now Is The Time To Invest In AI Literacy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariaflynn/2024/10/02/dont-repeat-history-now-is-the-time-to-invest-in-ai-literacy/,2024-10-02T14:04:59Z,"Over the past decade, a wave of digital transformation fundamentally changed the skills needed for nearly every occupation, from home health aides to architects. And in many cases, workers and employers weren't ready. The rapid rise of digital tools in the workplace led to a ""digital blindspot"" where employers underestimated the technological impact and overlooked the importance of developing basic digital literacy skills. As a result, workers were left ill-prepared to benefit from the fruits of a digital economy, and businesses and economies missed out on the potential productivity gains that should have been realized. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence mean the country is now at risk of falling into a similar trap.

This transformation won't be limited to the tech sector; 88 percent of workers using generative AI are in non-technical roles such as cashiers and retail associates. Just as digital literacy is now table stakes for success in a digital economy, it's clear that the bar for AI skills and knowledge -- as well as durable human skills that can be augmented by AI -- will soon be raised for everyone.

Against this backdrop, it's crucial that business leaders, policymakers, and training providers work to proactively ensure that all employees, regardless of age or career stage, are equipped with basic AI literacy. Employers, in particular, will need to lead the way in creating a workforce that can thrive in an environment being continually reshaped by this technology.

While many workers are independently exploring and mastering generative AI tools like ChatGPT, self-driven experimentation is not going to solve the AI literacy challenge. Studies show that AI use is already divided by historic indicators of marginalization, like income and college attainment. When individuals are tasked with finding the time and money to invest in upskilling or reskilling, too many are left behind.

Despite the clear need, AI upskilling remains relatively uncommon. While we are seeing some progress in foundational and career-focused AI literacy training in K-12 schools and colleges, there remains a substantial gap among working adults, especially those disconnected from traditional educational systems. According to research from Multiverse, nearly half of workers say they have had no access to technical training in the last five years, let alone training specifically related to AI.

Euan Blair, Multiverse's CEO, recently shared with me their decision to offer all apprentices -- regardless of which field they're studying -- a course designed to build a working knowledge of AI: ""Every worker, in every line of work, will need a working knowledge of what AI is and how to use AI-enabled tools effectively. Employers and training providers have a responsibility to ensure all workers have the skills to extract value from these powerful tools, if we want to empower both businesses and individuals in the future of work.""

For employers, this training gap represents not only an opportunity to invest in their workers' growth but also a strategy to maintain their company's competitiveness in an AI world. Business leaders recognize the potential of AI to increase productivity, efficiency, and customer service, but they are often playing catch-up when it comes to implementation.

At the heart of the challenge is a shortfall of skilled workers. Demand is far outstripping supply, with the share of job descriptions mentioning AI fluency on the job platform Handshake more than tripling this year. If employers hope to cultivate an AI-proficient workforce, they must invest in AI literacy training that helps their workers better understand the technology's purpose, inner workings, and limitations.

Companies will need to allocate the necessary paid time and opportunity for employees to engage in AI training programs. Such efforts should go beyond tool-specific training and be embedded into existing processes and on-the-job learning initiatives, such as new employee onboarding. Training should also focus on AI fluency, empowering workers to use AI in their specific roles and responsibilities. These learning opportunities should be provided to all employees -- particularly low-wage hourly workers, who are often at higher risk of automation but remain shut out of many upskilling programs.

But as vital as employers are, they can't be the only leg of the stool.

Initiatives like Google.org's AI Opportunity Fund and AI Essentials course, Kapor Foundation's support for ethical and responsible AI, and Microsoft's AI literacy investments in Wisconsin all engage with community-based organizations to expand access to AI education and skill development. Intel, meanwhile has partnered with community colleges in dozens of states as part of its AI for Workforce programs. Philanthropies can further contribute by investing in the tools and computing power needed for AI training, as well as in the development of inclusive AI literacy content that is reflective of and accessible to all learners and workers.

Similarly, federal and state policymakers can help expand access to AI literacy by following the lead of President Biden's recent executive order and AI safety guidelines, which note that employers ""should support or upskill workers during job transitions related to AI."" They should consider supporting legislation such as the bipartisan AI Literacy Act, which would codify AI literacy as a key component of digital literacy and integrate it into existing government technology initiatives. Critically, policymakers must enhance support for incumbent training funding both for workers to acquire new skills well before their jobs change and for those who have already experienced job loss.

AI is poised to dramatically alter not only the future of work but its present. By ensuring universal AI literacy, we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and guarantee that every worker has an equitable opportunity to succeed in this swiftly changing landscape. This will require a concerted effort from all sectors, but the rewards -- a more inclusive, productive, and resilient workforce -- will undoubtedly justify the investment."
Preempting Bad Local Housing Policies: Indiana Shows How,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogervaldez/2024/10/02/preempting-bad-local-housing-policies-indiana-shows-how/,2024-10-02T13:38:26Z,"It is a thing of beauty, and so much so, that I am just going to quote it in full, right up front, Indiana Code 32-31-1-20 Local units prohibited from regulating rental rates and landlord-tenant relationship.

Sec. 20. (a) Subject to IC 36-1-3-8.5, this section does not apply to privately owned real property for which government funds or benefits have been allocated from the United States government, the state, or a political subdivision for the express purpose of providing reduced rents to low or moderate income tenants.

(b) A unit . . . may not regulate rental rates for privately owned real property, through a zoning ordinance or otherwise, unless the regulation is authorized by an act of the general assembly.

(c) A unit . . . may not regulate, through an ordinance or otherwise, any of the following aspects of a landlord-tenant relationship with respect to privately owned real property located in the unit unless the regulation is authorized by an act of the general assembly:

(1) The screening process used by a landlord in approving tenants to lease privately owned real property.

Any ordinance or regulation that violates this subsection is void and unenforceable.

What's happening here is that Indiana's legislature has taken tenant landlord law away from local governments. Over the last decade, something called the Eviction Lab based at Princeton University has been charging huge fees to have its director, Matthew Desmond, deliver speeches about the ""eviction crisis"" in the United States. What happens is that Desmond blows into town, declares the local jurisdiction to be among one of the cities with one of the highest eviction rates in the United States. Anecdotes follow. Then local City Councils and Mayors set about to ""fix"" the problem with really bad policies affecting the contracts between tenants and landlords. If you want to dig into that story, you can read an older post on this here.

The policies include bans on background checks, limits on deposits, sealing of eviction records, and disallowing the use of credit scores to determine eligibility for tenancy. Over time, there are an accretion of these measures, all of which serve only to raise the risk of renting to people with less money struggling to find an apartment. I took a closer look at the failed logic behind banning credit checks. This is from a post back in December 2020. I quote a Washington Post article that argues credit scores are supposed to be race neutral but aren't because most people of color have poor credit scores.

The logical failure here should be obvious. Population X has low credit scores. Population Y has average or above average credit scores. Credit checks reveal this, meaning members of population X often can't find a place to rent when credit scores are used. Therefore, we should ban credit scores.

If it is true that people of color have lower credit scores than whites, the question is, ""Why?"" and how can we address that through policy or other measures. Credit scores, reporting, and use to evaluate risk are not the problem, it's the underlying problems in the economy that result in a disproportionate number of people of color having poor credit scores. The argument is that, essentially, since the results favor whites, the credit score is racist and should be banned. The implication is, too, that anyone who uses a credit score to measure the risk of renting to someone is racist as well. This is logically absurd but understandable. Banning credit checks or other data to evaluate tenants is the equivalent of turning up your radio when your car starts making a terrible noise.

Yet politicians, especially local city elected officials grasping for the golden ring of higher office, absolutely love policies that bash landlords, seem to favor tenants, and cost no money and come with zero evaluation; do these measures even work? Of course, they don't. Take efforts to ban ""source of income discrimination,"" an effort to force housing providers to take vouchers. The truth is most housing providers would be happy to take vouchers if they weren't so hard to use, requiring too much red tape and inspections that are often arbitrary. If you look at any jurisdiction that has source of income rules, you'll find a jurisdiction with hundreds if not thousands of unused vouchers. These measures don't help the real problems but make things worse by making rental housing riskier; the only way to offset risk with no tools to measure it is to raise rents.

Enter Lynne Petersen, President of the Indiana Apartment Association and Brian Spaulding incoming President of the association. Back in 2020, they worked on a proposal to preempt cities like Indianapolis from setting the terms of tenant landlord contracts like leases and deposits. Spaulding explained that ""our language originally passed the House . . . and was then vetoed by the Governor. In 2021, SEA 148 (passed the House and Senate in 2020) was considered again to override the Governor's veto. It was successful.""

Some readers might remember back to a series I wrote on preemption, one that a friendly critic found to be too long even for policy wonks (you can read them here, in order, Preemption And Housing: Cooley's Rule And Rights Of Local Governments, Preemption And Housing: Local Governments Have An Important Role, Preemption And Housing: The Deep Roots Of The Dillon Rule, Preemption And Housing: Towards A Vertical Balance Of Power).

In that series I did an exhaustive review of why preemption is not like the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and how it could be wielded by legislatures to reign in local governments and politicians eager to score political points rather than address the single most important problems in rental housing, lack of supply and lack of fast cash subsidies to pay for rent when there is trouble. I did this because many legislatures think that the Tenth Amendment's prohibition of the federal government exercising anything but its enumerated powers is a bulwark for local control; this is a conceptual problem Petersen, Spaulding, and a veto proof majority of the Indiana State Legislature didn't have. And the Dillon rule means it isn't true. So, they did it! I only wish I could claim credit from them having read my boring preemption posts. Spaulding charitably said of my posts, ""Thanks Roger! This was a great read. We wish we had a few of your arguments when we were working on our testimony!"" They didn't need them. One down, 49 to go. Next up, preempting local eviction laws."
Netflix Stock: Will The Momentum Slow?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/02/netflix-stock-will-the-momentum-slow/,2024-10-02T13:01:44Z,"Netflix stock has had a pretty good year, rising by almost 45% year-to-date as the company successfully navigated a brief subscriber decline post-Covid-19. This compares to rival Disney, which has gained about 7% over the same time frame. Netflix is poised to report its Q3 FY'24 results on October 17, reporting on a quarter that is likely to see the company continue to expand its business led by its ad-supported plans and crack down on password sharing. We expect earnings to come in at about $5.10 per share, roughly in line with consensus estimates, and up by 37% compared to the last year. Revenues are likely to come in at about $9.85 billion, slightly ahead of consensus estimates, rising 14.5% compared to the last year. So what are some of the trends that could drive Netflix results?

Netflix is expected to see its paid net additions for the quarter lower on a year-over-year basis as the company sees a tough comparison with Q3 2023, which had the first full quarter impact from paid sharing. The password-sharing crackdown essentially forced customers to pay for users outside their households or sign up for a new account. However, the company should continue to benefit from its ad-supported tier which is enabling it to attract more price-sensitive customers with a price of just $7 per month in the U.S. The total subscribers on this tier grew by about 34% compared to the year-ago period. Moreover, the ad-supported plan is expected to generate more revenue per user than some of Netflix's ad-free plans as incremental ad revenue more than offsets the discount offered on the ad tier. Over the last quarter, Netflix said that it was discontinuing its Basic ad-free plan while migrating users to its entry-level ad-supported plan, which offers better video quality and has a lower price point. That said, Netflix forecasts that its global average revenue per member will be roughly flat year over year in Q3 due to currency-related headwinds and potentially higher net adds in international markets where monthly pricing is lower than the U.S.

Netflix has been increasingly focusing on boosting its margins. For Q3, operating margins are guided at 28.1%%, marking an increase from about 22% in the year-ago quarter. The margin expansion is driven by revenue growth that outpaces operating costs due to economies of scale and also due to potentially lower content spending growth. Netflix's continued price increases are also likely helping profitability. Margins are also likely to trend higher on a sequential basis.

The increase in NFLX stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -51% in 2022, and 65% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NFLX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

Although we think that Netflix stock could move slightly higher if it beats earnings, we believe the stock is overvalued. At the current market price of about $707 per share, Netflix trades at almost 37x forward earnings, which is a bit pricey in our view. While Netflix's recent performance has been strong, consumer spending growth appears to be slowing down Moreover, things also remain mixed in the labor market, with the U.S. economy creating slightly fewer jobs than expected during August. These trends could weigh on players such as Netflix who are dependent on strong consumer confidence. Netflix could also see subscriber growth cool, as the impact of its accelerated subscriber adds coming from the twin impact of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers continue to normalize, reducing momentum for the stock. We have a $572 price estimate for Netflix, which is about 20% below the market price. See our analysis Netflix Valuation: Expensive or Cheap for more details on what's driving our price estimate for Netflix. Also, check out the analysis of Netflix Revenue for more details on how Netflix revenues are trending.

While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy following the recent rate cuts, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

Vance addresses previous criticism of Trump: 'I was wrong about Donald Trump',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vance-addresses-previous-criticism-trump-i-wrong-about-donald-trump,2024-10-02T13:00:05Z,"GOP, Democrat, and Independent voters react in real-time to Ohio Senator JD Vance's explanation for why he now agrees with many of former President Trump's policies during Tuesday night's CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Credit: CBS)

One of Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance's biggest debate moments was when he explained his complete reversal of feelings about his running mate.

Vance was asked at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate on Tuesday how he went from calling Trump potentially ""America's Hitler"" and an ""idiot"" to joining the former president's 2024 ticket.

""Sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the president, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record,"" Vance said Tuesday night.

He continued, ""But most importantly, Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take-home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans, a secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on.""

Fox News' Debate Dial audience feedback system showed viewers' approval rates shooting in different directions during Vance's explanation of how he came to be a Trump supporter.

Republican audience approval surged past 80% and at one point even over 90%, maintaining solid support throughout Vance's statement.

Meanwhile, Democratic viewers expressed discontent - ratings from Democrats fell below 40% and at one point bottomed out near 20%.

Vance emphasized that there were mistakes made in the first Trump administration that he wishes could have been handled better, but placed a significant portion of blame on Congress.

""There were a lot of things on the border, on tariffs, for example, where I think that we could have done so much more if the Republican Congress and the Democrats in Congress had been a little bit better about how they govern the country. They were so obsessed with impeaching Donald Trump, they couldn't actually govern,"" Vance said.

JD Vance of Ohio, stated that he and former President Trump support ""clean air, clean water"" while responding to a question on the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate stage about climate change, the Fox News Debate Dial showed.

""Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say, Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer,"" Vance said.

The Fox News Debate Dial showed support among independents and Democrats dipping downward when Vance made that statement. Support among Republicans remained fairly consistent.

But support among independent viewers began to rise again when Vance referenced how Democrats bring up carbon emissions when discussing climate change.

""This idea that carbon emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true,"" Vance said. ""Well, if you believe that, what would you -- would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.""

TIM WALZ: THE SOLUTION IS TO 'MOVE FORWARD' WITH IDEA THAT 'CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL'

The dial for independents remained flat as Vance moved into criticizing Kamala Harris on energy policy. Support among Democrats took a dive by contrast.

""What have Kamala Harris policies actually lead to more energy production in China, more manufacturing overseas, more doing business in some of the dirtiest parts of the entire world,"" Vance said. ""When I say that, I mean the amount of carbon emissions they're doing per unit of economic output. So, if we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water, the best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people. And unfortunately, Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite.""

CBS News host Nora O'Donnell began her question by noting how more than 160 were dead and hundreds more were missing in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.

""Scientists say climate change makes these hurricanes larger, stronger and more deadly because of the historic rainfall,"" she said. ""Senator Vance, according to CBS news polling, 7 in 10 Americans and more than 60% of Republicans under the age of 45 favor the U.S. taking steps to try and reduce climate change. Senator, what responsibility would the Trump administration have to try and reduce the impact of climate change?""

Vance began his response by recognizing the hurricane as ""an unbelievable, unspeakable human tragedy"" and recalling a photograph of grandparents and a six-year-old child on a roof that later collapsed, causing those people to lose their lives. ""I'm sure Governor Waltz joins me and saying, our hearts go out to those innocent people, our prayers go out to them,"" Vance said. ""And we want as robust and aggressive as a federal response as we can get to save as many lives as possible. And then, of course, afterwards to help the people in those communities rebuild.""

When the Republican vice presidential nominee referenced Appalachia and said he knew impacted people personally across the Southeast who ""need their government to do their job,"" the Fox News Debate Dial showed support spiked drastically among Republican viewers, and also rose for independents.

Employees forced to work at a Tennessee plastics factory are recounting the day historic flooding took over their parking lot and caused the power to go out. Once the plant shut down, and they were sent home, several of the workers did not make it.

Floodwaters swept 11 people away, and only five were rescued. Two of them are confirmed dead and part of the death toll across the affected states that passed 150 Tuesday, The Associated Press reported.

""We were all talking to the supervisors and telling everybody, 'Look, we don't need to be here,'"" Impact Plastic employee Zinna Adkins told WJHL. ""Our phone alerts were saying we need to flee the areas. And they never said anything about it. And supervisors didn't tell us that we could go.""

Management of the company founded in 1987 and the factory located in Erwin sent out a statement to local media on Monday that ""expressed sympathy for the missing and deceased employees and one contractor.""

""At no time were employees told that they would be fired if they left the facility,"" the statement continued.

Impact Plastics says while most employees left immediately following dismissal, ""some remained on or near the premises for unknown reasons.""

Jacob Ingram, a mold changer at the plastics factory, filmed himself and four others waiting for rescue as bobbing vehicles floated by. He later posted the videos on on Facebook with the caption, ""Just wanna say im lucky to be alive."" Videos of the helicopter rescue were posted on social media later on Saturday.

""They should've evacuated when we got the flash flood warnings, and when they saw the parking lot,"" Ingram said to the Knoxville News Sentinel. ""We asked them if we should evacuate, and they told us not yet, it wasn't bad enough.""

The two confirmed dead at the Tennessee plastics factory are Mexican citizens, Lisa Sherman-Nikolaus, executive director at Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition told the AP. She said many of the victims' families have started online fundraisers to cover funeral costs and other expenses.

Yellen Is Wrong About Financial Regulation,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/norbertmichel/2024/10/02/yellen-is-wrong-about-financial-regulation/,2024-10-02T12:48:52Z,"One of the best ways to kill the vibe at any party is to bring up financial market regulation. Few people want to discuss the theory behind it, much less the details of our regulatory framework, and who can blame them?

On the other hand, most policymakers inside the beltway view this regulatory framework as sacred. They're happy to talk about it, but only if you want to expand it.

I'm positive, though, that only a select few members of Congress know many of the details. And if the rest did spend the time to dig in, they would recognize three things: There was no substantive deregulation of financial markets in the last century; regulating to safeguard financial stability was not invented after the 2008 financial crisis; and much of the theory behind the post-2008 regime is little more than wishful thinking.

For those interested, there is a great debate here.

On the establishment side, we have folks like Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Even though she claims to have ""focused on financial stability"" throughout her career, she believes it was productive to enact ""new macroprudential policies focused on mitigating systemic risk"" in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

She argues that these regulations have ""strengthened the financial system,"" but she offers no direct evidence. (Yes, many banks have higher capital now versus 2007, but that could have been achieved without passing any new laws, much less the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.) And if those new regulations worked so well, it stands to reason Yellen should not have had to bail out uninsured depositors in three banks that failed in 2023. If that bailout was necessary to save the world from financial catastrophe, those regulations could not have work as advertised.

Yellen also believes in Dodd-Frank's Financial Stability Oversight Council.

For those lucky enough to be unaware, the FSOC is the multi-regulator council that is supposed to reduce future government bailouts by, among other things, identifying threats to financial stability. As hard as it is to believe, Congress decided that even though the United States already had more than 10 financial regulators who failed to even see a financial crisis coming, a good solution was to give those regulators even more responsibility.

Yellen recently argued that the FSOC was necessary to give regulators ""a more holistic view of and approach to risks."" Again, the idea that nobody was regulating systemic risk prior to the creation of FSOC, in a holistic way or any other way, is undeniably false.

Regardless, here's the kind of riveting risk analysis the FSOC produces. It's 2019 annual report stated that ""Firms with high levels of debt may be vulnerable to unexpected financial or economic events that may negatively affect their repayment and refinancing capacity."" Who knew?

And in 2022, with Yellen as Treasury Secretary, the FSOC warned that the commercial real estate market ""faces a more uncertain outlook given elevated inflation, rising interest rates, a slowing economy, and the potential for structural changes in behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.""

If it really is too much to expect the folks at the Fed and the FDIC to know about this uncertain outlook, Congress has all the evidence it needs to restructure the regulatory framework.

I'm much more aligned with my colleague, Mark Calabria, former director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and former FSOC member. In his retrospective 2023 book, Calabria wrote ""This may be the FSOC's real strength, pointing out problems in our financial system for which none of its members bear any authority or responsibility.""

Although I do think the FSOC has been rather useless, I am still highly critical of the theory behind its creation. The last way to prevent large bailouts, for instance, is to have federal regulators pre-identify those firms they believe pose excessive systemic risk.

But that's what the FSOC is supposed to do.

The theory behind the FSOC is that regulators can impose regulations to prevent financial crises. But we already know that premise is false. Worse, we know that government policies tend to be a main contributing factor in virtually all such events throughout history.

That's all bad enough, but if we accept the theory behind the FSOC arrangement, we cannot possibly accept the theory behind the superiority of the free enterprise system.

It may not be so obvious, but the truth is that, if a massive bank were to fail, it would present no greater danger to people's ability to earn a living than the failure of a company like Walmart, Ford, or Home Depot. In each case, we're talking about millions of people's money and their ability to earn more of it.

If we accept the notion that financial firms cannot exist without heavy-handed regulation to prevent calamity, then we must also accept the same for nonfinancial companies.

More broadly, federal regulators should not be empowered to stop people from engaging in financial or economic activities the regulators believe are too risky. As I've argued for years, the mere existence of the FSOC is wholly incompatible with the functioning of a dynamic private capital market. Congress should eliminate it, reduce invasive federal regulation, and stop giving bureaucrats the power to micromanage financial risks."
6.5 Trillion Reasons Why This 6% Dividend Will Soar,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/10/02/65-trillion-reasons-why-this-6-dividend-will-soar/,2024-10-02T12:48:38Z,"Right now, there's $6.5 trillion in cash sitting on the sidelines -- and a big slice of it is about to drop straight into a select group of dividend stocks.

We're going to ""front run"" that cash wave today -- and set ourselves up for income (I'm talking 6%+ yields here) and gains as this cash wave starts to build.

In a sec, I'll name two dividend-payers sitting right in the path of this freed-up cash. One is a true ""dividend unicorn,"" shelling out an outsized 6% payout that grows. The other has doubled its dividend in just the last five years.

Let's start by breaking down that $6.5 trillion figure: It's the amount of cash in parked money-market funds today.

Here's why a big chunk of it is likely to shake loose: Rates on money-market funds float, and the Fed Funds rate -- which Jay Powell, of course, just started slashing -- has a strong pull on them.

As yields on money-market funds (and savings accounts and the like) fall, more ""new money"" will bypass them and go into dividend stocks instead. Meantime, today's money-market investors will ""stretch"" for higher yields and payout growth. Here again, dividend stocks will be the beneficiaries.

It's already happening:

Above you can see the rapid growth in money-market holdings since the Fed started raising rates in early 2022. Since the second quarter of that year -- or about two years ago -- the total has jumped a staggering 30%, to just over $6.5 trillion.

You can also see (at the top right), that the inflow has slowed. It's no coincidence that's happened as yields on money-market funds like the popular Vanguard Federal Money Market Investor Fund (VMFXX) flatline:

You can see the fund's yield stair-step higher as the Fed hiked rates to 5.25% to 5.5%, then go flat as the Fed held rates from mid-2023 till this month's 50-point cut.

Let me be clear: I'm not saying the entire $6.5 trillion is going to go into stocks.

Plenty of folks will always be drawn by the promise of a guaranteed principal. But even if money-market holdings simply drop back to where they were two years ago, we're talking about $1.5-trillion making a move here.

And that doesn't include new money that bypasses these lower-paying money-market funds. Or any freed-up cash in savings accounts and CDs as they mature.

In fact, this transition is already happening, and in a surprising place, too: riskier high-yield, or ""junk,"" bonds.

Check out these big gains from the corporate-bond closed-end funds (CEFs) we held in my Contrarian Income Report service from November 2023 to now:

These are big moves for bond funds, especially for our two municipal-bond funds, NEA and NAD. These gains happened in lockstep with the slowing flow into money-market funds, and this trade is still working in our favor -- though after these funds' strong runs, I do rate them as ""holds"" today.

While we wait, though, let's dive into those two dividend payers I mentioned earlier.

Our first stock, payment processor Mastercard (MA) is in the pole position not only as more cash moves into stocks but from another shift few people are talking about.

I'm talking about the rising odds we'll not get a soft or hard landing in the economy -- but no landing at all. In that setup, the economy ticks along and inflation comes back.

Not great, I know, and we discussed it in detail last Tuesday. The upshot is that government spending is out of control, outrunning tax receipts by almost $2 trillion.

Give me an extra $2 trillion and I'll show you a strong economy! But the resulting monetary inflation could flow back into consumer price inflation -- and overwhelm Jay Powell.

This is one reason why those bond funds I mentioned earlier are holds for now. As I said, the trade is still going our way, but we're watching it closely, as any move toward higher rates would hurt bond prices (as rates and bond prices move inversely).

But the other part of this story -- a humming economy -- is great for Mastercard (MA), which takes a slice of each payment that rolls down its network.

And talk about pricing power: The credit-card market is basically controlled by four companies: Visa (V), with a 53% share, Mastercard (MA), at 24%, American Express (AXP), at 20% and Discover Financial Services (DFS).

Mastercard doesn't win many income fans with its tiny 0.5% yield, but payout growth is the story here: This dividend has doubled in the last five years, pulling up the share price with it:

If you've followed me for a while, you know I talk a lot about the ""Dividend Magnet"" -- a stock's tendency to track its payout higher.

You can see it in action here. The current gap between the two is a snapshot of the stock's upside as it ""snaps back"" to the payout. The low payout ratio (Mastercard pays just 21% of free cash flow as dividends) virtually locks in further growth, even if I'm wrong and the economy does slow from here.

Mastercard is a great stock, but let's be honest, it'll take years for its payout growth to inflate the yield on a buy made today. That's where casino landlord Gaming and Leisure Properties (GLPI) comes in.

Before you say it, yes, I know a casino stock might sound like an odd pick to attract money-market-fund investors. But I'm pretty sure a growing 6% dividend won't take long to convince them! And hey, if folks really are migrating to junk bonds from money-market funds, why not a stock like GLPI?

Plus, the stock has lots of strengths that make it far from a gamble (sorry, couldn't resist).

For one, it's diversified across the country, with 65 casinos in 20 states. That's key, because if the job market continues to slow, concerned workers might cancel their Vegas trip, but they'll likely still hit up their local casino.

Second GLPI's tenants are signed under ""triple-net"" leases that provide a stable, predictable income stream.

Moreover, under these leases, the tenant pays the full cost of running and maintaining the company's properties. Which is great news -- can you imagine what this electricity bill looks like?

But the real standout for us income-seekers is that as a real estate investment trust (REIT), GLPI is exempt from corporate taxes so long as it pays out 90% of its profits as dividends. The savings help fund that high payout.

And as mentioned, GLPI has been quick to share its rising cash flow through payout growth -- including special dividends (the spikes and dips in the chart below):

The REIT's regular dividend was cut in the 2020 lockdowns, but that's understandable and the cut was modest: just 14%.

And GLPI quickly got back to its winning ways, boosting the payout since. And as with Mastercard, we've got a powerful Dividend Magnet working for us here, too.

More payout hikes are likely. GLPI's revenue rose 6.7% in the latest quarter, and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO, the key REIT profitability metric) rose 5.6%. The company also pays an estimated 81% of the midpoint of its forecast 2024 AFFO as dividends, a reasonable amount for a REIT."
Wars And Strikes Put Market On Edge,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/02/wars-and-strikes-put-market-on-edge/,2024-10-02T12:40:53Z,"Jerome Powell Hints At Smaller Rate Cuts Amid Rising Uncertainty

Stocks got off to an auspicious start for October as tensions in the Middle East ratcheted higher and a dockworkers' strike injected and extra dose of volatility. The S&P 500 fell 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.5%. Small cap stocks were also hit with the Russell 2000 dropping 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the best performing industry, but it too was down 0.4%.

Tuesday morning began with a mixture of economic news that showed prices moderating further but a higher than forecast number of job openings in the most recent JOLTs report. However, markets barely had time to digest that data before escalating hostilities in the Middle East took center stage when Iran launched a barrage of missiles aimed at Israel. While damage was limited, the increasing hostilities sent November crude oil futures higher by as much as 5% before settling down some and closing up nearly 4%. Israel has vowed retaliation against Iran and the question now becomes, just how bad the situation will become. In premarket, oil is trading higher by more than 3%.

At the same time, back here at homes, workers from the International Longshoremen Association (ILA) went on strike shutting down ports along the East and Gulf Coasts. According to The Wall Street Journal the ILA unloads around 60%, or $588 billion, of all containerized trade that comes through those coastal ports. Ports will often shut down for things such as hurricanes and therefore, a day or two of closures would have a nominal impact on the economy. However, as the strike lingers, estimates range widely for just what an extended work stoppage would mean.

For markets, I think the most concerning aspect of an extended strike and conflict in the Middle East is the potential for it to reintroduce inflation at a time where it seems like the Fed may have actually achieved a soft landing. In his remarks Monday, Jerome Powell talked about further rate cuts but suggested they may not be as aggressive as September's half-point cut. Currently, the CME Fed Watch Tool is assigning a 63% probability of a quarter-point cut in November and 37% chance of a half-point. This is something I'm keeping my eye on.

Some individual stocks I'm watching include Humana. That stock is down in premarket trading by 24% as membership in high-rating Medicare plans is expected to fall. Apple is lower by 0.5% after analyst downgrades. Meantime, Home Depot is higher following an increased price target of $455 from Piper Sandler. That is up from $387. The narrative here is that with interest rates lower, homeowners will look at making repairs prior to putting their homes on the market. If that does turn out to be the case, I'll be interested to see if other companies such as Lowe's also see upgrades. Finally, shares of Nike are down 7% in premarket following their earnings. Revenues fell 10% and profits were down 28% year-over-year. The company also was unwilling to offer a full year forecast after recently replacing their CEO.

For today, markets will likely be preoccupied with the situation in the Middle East, and the slightly stronger than expected ADP payroll number. The conflict between Israel and Iran is very much in danger of becoming more widespread as we await the next move. Between China's slowing economy and resultant stimulus measures, a strike that could reignite inflation, the upcoming U.S. election, wars on multiple fronts, earnings season just over a week away and wide-ranging speculation as to the state of our own economy, it should come as no surprise that volatility is increasing. The VIX is trading near 19.5 in premarket and with Friday's employment report looming, I would not be surprised to see it hold here or potentially even increase. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."
Oil Facilities In Iran That Could Be In Israel's Sights,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gauravsharma/2024/10/02/oil-facilities-in-iran-that-could-be-in-israels-sights/,2024-10-02T12:40:40Z,"After Iran attacked Israel with nearly 200 missiles late on Tuesday and the latter vowed to retaliate, oil prices surged upwards from their recent lows on heightened tension in the Middle East.

At 7:50am EDT on Wednesday, the Brent front-month futures contract was trading at $75.63 per barrel up $2.07 or 2.80% while the West Texas Intermediate was up $2.21 or 3.16% to $72.04 per barrel.

Iran said it had attacked Israel in response to its ""aggressive acts"", including the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had ""made a big mistake and will pay for it"".

This may be a coded warning that Israel will go after in Iran's oil facilities. According to industry data aggregator and research firm Kpler, Iran exported 1.194 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and gas condensate in spring 2023, a figure that rose to a five-year high of 1.65 million bpd in the first five months of 2024.

So, the industry is an obvious target for Israel should it choose to, and the extent of the market impact depends on chosen targets and the scale of the response. In this respect, four sites of strategic importance come to mind.

The first of these is the Kharg Oil Terminal, situated on Kharg Island, 15 miles off Iran's Northern Coast. It handles over 90% of the country's global crude oil exports.

The second could be a number of oil terminals in the Southern province of Hormozgan. It also has two free trade zones on Kish and Qeshm Islands. Kish is also home of the Iranian oil bourse - the only exchange of its kind that does not trade oil and derivatives in U.S. dollars.

The third, and more domestically focused site, is the Abadan Refinery located across Shatt Al-Arab River on the border between Iraq and Iran. Reliable up-to-date data on the refinery's production capacity is hard to find. But estimates and local sources suggest it could be producing around 400,000 bpd. As Iran's oldest processing facility, originally built in 1909 by Anglo-Persian oil (which later became BP), it services around 25% of Iran's domestic fuel demand.

Mahshahr Oil Terminal, an oil port located on the Khor Musa Channel, is the fourth site. It stores and shifts products from the Abadan Refinery, and serves as an engineering and jetty construction hub for Iran.

All these sites were targeted by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war and severely crippled the Iranian economy. It makes them obvious potential target for Israel and will likely have an impact on the global oil market to varying degrees.

The most devastating Israeli strike carrying global implications would be an attack on Kharg Oil Terminal. Such an attack will likely result in a short-term crude price spike of around 5% as it carries the potential for international disruption, primarily to Iran's exports to China - the world's largest importer of oil.

On the other hand, an attack on Hormozgan oil facilities will likely be more about symbolism given that many of the province's terminals are largely unused due to sanctions, creaking infrastructure and years of Western sanctions on Iranian oil. Israel may attack these to send a message.

Should Abadan Refinery be targeted, it will largely break Iran's domestic fuel supply chain but perhaps does not carry any significant international implications. However, should the nearby Mahshahr Oil Terminal be subject to an Israeli strike, again both crude and product supply chain issues will likely arise.

If these real-time geopolitical developments were clouding the market a decade ago, most observers would factor in a double-digit near-term uptick in oil prices. However, despite all what the current year has thrown at the oil market, prices - using Brent as a benchmark - are still nearly $10 lower than October last year, and at one point hit lows last seen in 2021 earlier this month.

That's because unlike a decade ago, oil production outside the Middle East has steadily risen. The U.S. is currently the world's largest crude oil producer. Production in Brazil, Canada, Guyana and Norway is also at record levels. Furthermore, the Saudis are holding back substantial spare capacity.

All of this is occurring at a time of uncertain oil demand and global macroeconomic challenges. Even the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) - considered to be among the more bullish demand forecasters out in the market - now expects lower demand growth both in 2024 and 2025.

As does the International Energy Agency (IEA), though both continue to offer vastly divergent oil demand growth forecasts for 2024 of less than 1 million bpd in the agency's case, and just over 2 million bpd in OPEC's case.

So while geopolitical tension in the Middle East may not be new, today's oil market doesn't even remotely resemble that of the last decade. Always remember that when oil futures reflect a geopolitical ""risk premium"", it is based on fears of a potentially imminent loss of supply as is the case at the moment.

Once the loss does happen - say following a potential Israeli attack - it morphs from being a risk to market reality and corrective mechanisms kick in both on the supply as well as pricing side. That's unless there is further loss of supply which is the unknown variable for the market.

Ultimately, elevated tension between Iran and Israel and the wider conflict in Gaza and Lebanon is something the oil market could well do without, but is one that it currently appears capable of handling with all eyes now on what Israel will do next."

Iran fired rockets at Israel Tuesday, the Israeli military said, potentially escalating the war in the Middle East as Iran took responsibility for the attack and warned it is only a ""first wave."" In a statement read on state television, Iran said the attack was retaliation for the killings of multiple Hezbollah leaders, according to the Associated Press.

Aerospace and defense stocks reached all-time highs, a grim market reaction to the latest escalation of tensions in the Middle East, as the Israeli military reported missile strikes from Iran a day after Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon. Defense stocks typically see gains during times of heightened conflict as the companies' revenues rely heavily on U.S. government contracts.

The strike could cost the U.S. economy between $3 billion and $4.5 billion daily, according to estimates from Jefferies and JPMorgan, but significant fallout would only occur if the strike lasts more than the ""base case"" of a ""few days,"" Bank of America analysts led by Nathan Gee noted.

TOPLINE Palantir, which builds software to help other businesses gather, manage and analyze their data, at first with secretive government agencies like the CIA and now also with commercial customers, had a banner year.

Palantir took off, with annual revenue increasing more than 20% over the last year to $2.5 billion, and it flipped the switch on profitability -- going from a net loss of $50 million in June 2023 to net income of $400 million a year later. The record year was capped by its addition to the S&P 500 in September.

The company's growth is in part because many of its data software products meshed with the wave of AI hype.

No surprise then that shares are up 134% over the past year, making Palantir the most expensive stock in the S&P in terms of revenue multiples -- more so even than chip design darling Nvidia. Palantir's meteoric rise has earned CEO Alex Karp a spot on The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans for the first time, worth an estimated $3.6 billion, thanks to his Palantir stake and $1 billion or so in cash from stock sales as of September 1, the day we finalized net worths for our list.

But should it be that expensive, trading at a market valuation that's 36 times its annual revenue? Analysts aren't sure: only five of the 20 that cover Palantir give the company a ""buy"" rating, with the remainder split between hold and sell ratings.

D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria drew a parallel between the company and Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, when the EV company was trading at all-time highs in 2021. ""Tesla for a very long period of time traded well above any valuation or comparable metric that you could point to. The reason was people were really excited about the mission and about the prospects.""

WHY IT MATTERS ""The Forbes 400, the definitive ranking of America's richest people, is important because enormous wealth comes with immense power, and the public should know who is doing what with their power,"" says Forbes reporter Phoebe Liu.

""As such, Karp's addition to The Forbes 400 and Palantir's too-high valuation show that what he and his company stand for -- Western values, American defense and artificial intelligence -- are especially relevant in today's economic, cultural and geopolitical landscape. It's worth watching what happens with the ever-controversial, ever-secretive (despite being publicly traded!) firm in the coming months and years.""

Will Ford's Stock Recover,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/02/will-fords-stock-recover/,2024-10-02T12:07:48Z,"Ford stock has declined by about 10% year-to-date, compared to fellow U.S. auto giant GM which has gained close to 29% over the same period. The underperformance of Ford comes despite a reasonably healthy financial performance in recent years, with revenues and cash flows expanding. Ford's valuation is very attractive, with the stock trading at a mere 6x 2024 consensus earnings.

While Ford stock has actually risen in the last 3-years, the increase has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 137% in 2021, -42% in 2022, and 16% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could F face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

We value Ford stock at about $14 per share, which is around 30% ahead of the current market price. See our analysis on Ford Valuation: Expensive Or Cheap for more details on what's driving our price estimate for Ford. For more information on Ford's business model and revenue trends, check out our dashboard on Ford Revenue: How Ford Makes Money. So why exactly is Ford stock underperforming and what are some of the trends that could drive a recovery?

Higher Warranty Costs

Ford recently posted a weaker-than-expected set of Q2 2024 results. Adjusted profit for the quarter came in at $0.47 per share, below consensus estimates and a 35% decline from the $0.72 the company reported in Q2 2023. This is in contrast with GM which beat expectations. Although Ford saw revenues grow by about 6% over the last quarter, its earnings were hit by an increase in warranty repair costs amid issues with cars built in 2021 or earlier. Ford has faced multiple quality issues with its vehicles in the past years driving up the warranty costs. Moreover, these costs are sometimes recognized suddenly, without warning, leading to weaker-than-expected results. For Q2 for example, earnings fell almost 30% short of estimates as Ford's $800 million spike in costs caught investors by surprise. Now Ford is working on improving the quality of its vehicles, with the company noting that it was now testing vehicles to failure in order to discover quality problems. However, the process could take over a year to reflect on warranty cost improvements.

Rocky EV Transition, Mixed Economic Outlook

Separately, there have also been concerns about the demand environment. Ford saw its overall volumes for Q2 rise by just about 1% year-over-year amid high interest rates which have made vehicle financing expensive. Consumer spending has also been easing in the U.S. The average price paid for new vehicles declined by 3% for the first six months of this year, compared to last year, per research firm J.D. Power meaning that the pricing power that automakers saw post the Covid-19 pandemic is easing. Separately, Ford's plans of transitioning to EVs have hardly been smooth. Ford's Model E division, which sells electric vehicles, lost $1.3 billion at an operating level, compared to the traditional auto segments that earned a combined total of $3.9 billion. Ford has also pivoted its EV plans, moving away from larger vehicles and instead focusing on a smaller next-generation EV platform. These larger SUVs will now have hybrid powertrains instead. This led to Ford taking a non-cash charge to the tune of $400 million relating to the sunk costs.

Catalysts For A Recovery

However, we think there is an upside for Ford stock. One primary driver is the continued strong performance of its truck division, especially the flagship F-150 series. Sales of the F-Series trucks reached 199,463 vehicles in Q2 2024, marking a 30% sequential increase. Hybrid F-150 sales also saw a 38% year-over-year growth, with 33,674 units sold, reflecting consumer demand for a broader powertrain lineup. Trucks, with their higher margins, remain Ford's most lucrative segment, and sustained strength here could support profitability in the coming quarters.

Ford's potential to boost its capital return program could also add further to shareholder value The company's cash flows have been strong, with free cash flow generation for 2023 reaching approximately $6.8 billion, significantly surpassing initial projections. Ford has been paying dividends of about $0.15 per quarter, along with a special dividend of $0.18 in March. Given the robust cash flows, there is potential for additional special dividends. At present, Ford plans to distribute 40% to 50% of its annual free cash flow to shareholders. This year, the company has raised its adjusted free cash flow guidance to a range of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, up from the initial outlook of $6 billion to $7 billion.

Additionally, Ford's pivot in its EV strategy, which now focuses on a balanced mix of gas, hybrid, and electric vehicles could allow it to cash in on evolving consumer preferences without overspending on costly EV development. Slower industry-wide EV growth could also give Ford a chance to improve its profitability in the traditional segments as it invests in refining its electric vehicle offerings. Additionally, the market for hybrid vehicles is picking up, with Ford seeing its hybrid sales expand considerably, rising 56% year-over-year to a new quarterly record of 53,822 units in the U.S. for Q2. This should bode well for the company's profitability in the interim.

The recent monetary easing in the U.S. could also bode well for automakers like Ford. The Fed's 50 basis point rate cut earlier this month marked the first interest rate cut in close to four years.

"Mortgage Rates Today: October 2, 2024 -- Rates Remain Fairly Steady",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-10-02-24/,2024-10-02T11:59:00Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

Today, the mortgage interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.70%, according to Curinos, while the average rate on a 15-year mortgage is 5.74%. On a 30-year jumbo mortgage, the average rate is 6.73%.

Today's average rate on a 30-year mortgage (fixed-rate) inched up to 6.70% from 6.65% yesterday. One week ago, the 30-year fixed was 6.68%.

The APR on a 30-year fixed is 6.71%. This time last week, it was 6.67%. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

At today's interest rate of 6.70%, borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $100,000 will pay $645 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included), the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. In total interest, you'd pay $132,181 over the life of the loan.

Today's 15-year mortgage (fixed-rate) is 5.74%, up 0.03 percentage point from the previous week. The same time last week, the 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage was at 5.71%.

The APR on a 15-year fixed is 5.77%. It was 5.72% a week earlier.

A 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage with today's interest rate of 5.74% will cost $830 per month in principal and interest on a $100,000 mortgage (not including taxes and insurance). In this scenario, borrowers would pay approximately $49,368 in total interest.

On a 30-year jumbo, the average interest rate is 6.73%, lower than it was at this time last week. The average rate was 6.74% at this time last week.

Borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage with today's interest rate of 6.73% will pay $647 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. That means that on a $750,000 loan, the monthly principal and interest payment would be around $4,855 and you'd pay around $997,627 in total interest over the life of the loan.

The Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy -- including its interest rate hikes, which it's using to restrain inflation -- is the primary factor that's pushing long-term mortgage rates higher. The state of the economy and housing market also affects mortgage rates. As for what interest rate the lender might offer you, this depends on your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and credit score, both of which indicate your risk as a borrower.

Shop around and talk to various lenders to get a sense of each company's mortgage loan offerings and services. Don't go with the first lender quote you receive; instead, compare the best mortgage rate quotes to get a deal. In particular, consider what fees they charge, what fees they're willing to waive and what closing assistance they might provide. Make sure any special offers or discounts don't come at the cost of a higher mortgage rate.

Be sure to apply with each lender within a 45-day window. During this window, you can have multiple lenders pull your credit history without additional impact on your credit score.

Mortgage rates remain elevated, and the nation's housing supply remains limited. The low inventory is preventing house prices from dropping. Meanwhile, the combination of high mortgage rates and appreciated home values will continue to present an obstacle for many prospective homebuyers seeking affordable housing.

Multiple factors affect the interest rate for a mortgage, including the economy's overall health, benchmark interest rates and borrower-specific factors.

The Federal Reserve's rate decisions and inflation can influence rates to move higher or lower. Although the Fed raising rates doesn't directly cause mortgage rates to rise, an increase to its benchmark interest rate makes it more expensive for banks to lend money to consumers. Conversely, rates tend to decrease during periods of rate cuts and cooling inflation.

Home buyers can make several moves to improve their finances and qualify for competitive rates. One is having a good or excellent credit score, which ranges from 670 to 850. Another is maintaining a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio below 43%, which implies less risk of being unable to afford the monthly mortgage payment.

Further, making a minimum 20% down payment can help you avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI) on conventional home loans. If you can afford the larger monthly payment, 15-year home loans have lower rates than a 30-year term."
"Opinion | Who will win? Election forecasters think it's Harris, but they've been wrong before",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-election-forecasts-predictions-rcna173277,2024-10-02T10:48:06Z,"Models looking at everything from polls to economic conditions show a narrow Harris win.

Can science predict the future? The great science fiction author Isaac Asimov wrote a series of books in which a scientist figures out a way to do just that.

""It was the science of human behavior reduced to mathematical equations,"" Asimov wrote in one of the books in his Foundation series. ""The individual human being is unpredictable, but the reactions of human mobs ... could be treated statistically.""

It's a great concept for a book series -- and a well-reviewed streaming TV show -- but in the real world, it falls flat.

The subject has come up again as we are now just a month out from a hotly contested election that could determine everything from the future of abortion rights to the strength of American democratic institutions. It would be comforting to hear from an expert who can read the tea leaves and tell us who will win.

Demand is so high that multiple models are competing for dominance, and two of the biggest forecasters -- historian Allan Lichtman and close poll reader Nate Silver -- got into an online feud over the weekend over how to read the ""13 keys"" that Lichtman uses to make his predictions. (Lichtman says they predict a Kamala Harris win, but Silver argues they actually favor Donald Trump.)

""Allan let's just say the little tricks you've played with the Keys in the past will come back to haunt you! The Keys shall be respected,"" posted Silver, in what sounded like something the villain in a children's movie shouts shortly before an army of elves overtakes the castle.

If you're not sure about the 13 keys, you could look instead at the Misery Index, a crude measure developed by an adviser to President Lyndon Johnson that combines the unemployment rate and the inflation rate, which will tell you the numbers are looking good for Harris. Or you can check out the more sophisticated Time for Change model, which zeroes in on the popularity of the current president, the state of the economy and the number of terms the incumbent party has been in the White House. That also predicts a narrow Harris win.

Or maybe, like Silver, you favor polls. In that case, you can look at 538's proprietary mix of polls, economic and demographic data to see that Harris is projected to win 57 out of 100 times (Silver is no longer with 538). If you're willing to pay, you can see Silver's own forecast, which is based on his new model. Or you can just look at the state-by-state polls yourself and obsessively play with the maps on 270 to Win while muttering about crucial Waukesha County.

Or perhaps you like the newfangled prediction markets, which ask bettors to put their money where their mouth is. PredictIt has a bet on a Harris win at 56 cents, with Trump as the underdog at 47 cents, while VirtualTout blends PredictIt data with some fancy math to come up with a forecast for a ""strong Democratic victory.""

The good news for these forecasters is that if Harris wins, they'll all get to claim that their models were accurate. And if Trump wins, they can say that, after all, their models showed only a high probability of a Harris win, or they'll switch to talking about the popular vote.

The problem with all of these models, however, is that they attempt to make iron laws out of the scrap metal of past elections. We've had only 59 presidential elections since the Constitution went into effect -- even fewer if you consider only those since the expansion of voting rights, the advent of TV news and the development of sophisticated voter targeting in the 20th century. Statistically speaking, that's just not a lot of data.

More recently, you can throw in the complications the Electoral College has caused since 2000 by diverging twice from the national popular vote, the increasingly intense partisanship and the closely divided elections, and it's basically impossible to make definitive predictions. Would your favored political model have predicted an Al Gore or George W. Bush win in 2000? Did it predict Trump or Joe Biden winning by tens of thousands of votes in a handful of swing states?

If your model assumes how voters will respond to a president running for re-election, how does it factor in the president's dropping out and endorsing his vice president just months before the election? Or a former president's running for a nonconsecutive second term? What about a candidate who was impeached for trying to overturn the results of the last election?

Most models can be useful to a point. They can give us the general sense of the political landscape or enough information to start make contingency plans for after the election. If Harris wins, maybe the models will make at least some voters less open to bogus arguments that the election was stolen. (I'm not holding my breath on that one.) And some can tell us how well a generic Democratic or Republican candidate might have done in a particular environment, which can help the parties review their strategies.

But ultimately, we aren't voting for a generic candidate. We have to choose between two specific people, with their own strengths and weaknesses. And sometimes the polls, the economic models and the betting markets can't measure that.

In Asimov's series, the scientist's predictions of the future are accurate for centuries until, through random chance, a man is born with a mutation that allows him to psychically manipulate other people's emotions, creating fear and devotion in order to rise to power. That proposition -- that predictions of the future ultimately cannot account for the unknown or the unexpected -- is worth keeping in mind as we head into the November election, especially given that we have a candidate on the ballot who's adept at creating fear and devotion.

In the end, election forecasts are not bad at telling us how the future will look, as long as it continues to look like the past."
Project 2025 Offers A False Choice: Climate Action Vs. Economic Growth,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/margooge/2024/10/02/project-2025-offers-a-false-choice-climate-action-vs-economic-growth/,2024-10-02T10:14:04Z,"When Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for a future Trump administration, came up in the presidential debate, Donald Trump equivocated, calling some of the ideas ""good"" and others ""bad.""

It's impossible to say exactly what policies a second Trump administration would pursue, but Trump embraced The Heritage Foundation's ""A Mandate for Leadership"" proposal in his first year in office. And in April 2022 he said Heritage was ""going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do.""

One of Project 2025's most alarming proposals targets public health as it would strip the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of its authority to set and enforce environmental standards. Before EPA was created, our country suffered pollution so bad that rivers caught on fire and our cities were choked by smog. EPA protections have cleaned up our air and water for 50 years and saved countless lives - the Clean Air Act alone prevented an estimated 230,000premature deaths in 2020.

These environmental protections are particularly important for low-income and marginalized communities that have historically borne the brunt of pollution and environmental degradation. Biden's EPA climate policies focus on public health and environmental justice by strengthening emissions standards and regulating air pollution, and are on track to save 200,000 lives by 2050.

Rolling back these protections, as Project 2025 proposes, would reverse these gains and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable Americans, causing 2,100 early deaths by 2030 by increasing air pollution - nearly as much as the total U.S. military deaths in the Afghanistan war.

Project 2025 targets climate initiatives implemented under the Biden administration. The authors falsely claim that EPA regulations are ""burdensome"" and stifle economic growth, particularly in transportation and energy. But that's not true. EPA policies drive innovation and growth.

In reality, the very rules Project 2025 seeks to dismantle have catalyzed unprecedented economic growth across America. EPA's climate policies -- combined with incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act -- have sparked unprecedented investment, particularly in clean energy and transportation. As of 2024, annual investment in new manufacturing hit $225 billion, a record high even after adjusting for inflation.

The electric vehicle market is a prime example. EPA vehicle tailpipe emissions standards, along with IRA incentives, have spurred $312 billion in EV and battery manufacturing, making the United States a global leader in clean transportation investments. Fueled by the incentives, the U.S. EV market grew 40% in 2023, to 1.4 million units.

These investments have tangible economic impacts, making the shift to clean technologies an engine of job creation and economic revitalization. EV and battery manufacturing has created 195,000 high-paying jobs from factories in Michigan and Ohio to tech development in California, directly boosting local economies in areas hit hardest by the decline of traditional manufacturing.

The IRA's economic benefits are so obvious that in July, 18 Republican Members of Congress wrote the Speaker of the House urging him not to repeal IRA provisions, saying ""energy tax credits have spurred innovation, incentivized investment, and created good jobs in many parts of the country.""

Biden administration policies have also supercharged job growth in the renewable energy sector, cutting fossil fuel dependence and reshaping the energy landscape to benefit our environment and economy. The solar industry added nearly 16,000 jobs in 2023 to hit 280,000 total jobs, the highest level in history, and wind turbine service technician is the fastest-growing occupation in America. Meanwhile utility-scale solar and onshore wind are the cheapest forms of electricity generation in the U.S., at $27-$29 per megawatt-hour. Compare that to oil and coal products, which along with oil and gas extraction have the highest indirect impact on inflation of any commodity in the U.S. economy

By 2023, renewables accounted for 21% of U.S. electricity generation, outpacing coal, which dropped to 16%. The Biden administration's policies, which include federal tax credits for solar and wind projects, are ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in the global clean energy transition.

Clean energy is the future: It's cheaper and cleaner than fossil fuels, providing long-term economic benefits that far outweigh the short-term profits of oil, gas, and coal. Failing to recognize this will drive our economy into economic stagnation - Moody's Analytics forecasts Project 2025 would trigger a recession in less than a year. That's not even considering Project 2025's climate change impacts, which would add 4.9 million metric tons of annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, about the same as Germany emits every year.

Today, the United States' global economic competitiveness is at stake, more than ever. Following Project 2025's prescription risks the future of EVs, renewable energy, and green jobs. That would cede America's progress on national climate goals and hand over the global energy economy to China and Europe.

Clean energy accounted for 10% of global GDP growth in 2023, and global clean energy investment hit $1.8 trillion last year. America can tap this potential -- unless we let Project 2025 derail our progress.

China is already the world's biggest EV producer with about 60% of global sales and is also the largest EV exporter, accounting for 19% of EU sales. In clean energy, China invested $890 billion in clean energy in 2023, almost as much as total global fossil fuel investment. Falling behind in the clean economic race means losing out on trillions of dollars in future market opportunities and millions of lost jobs in booming industries.

The core environmental argument of Project 2025 -- that we must choose between climate action and economic growth -- is a false choice. It simply doesn't hold up.

Between 1970 and 2019, the Clean Air Act reduced air pollution from vehicles, factories, and other sources by 77%. If Project 2025's authors were correct, those historic environmental gains should have cost grave economic contraction. Instead, during that same time, U.S. GDP grew 285% and job growth rose 223%. By comparison, implementing Project 2025's energy provisions would cost 1.7 million lost jobs by 2030 while imposing $32 billion in new energy costs on American households.

Biden's climate policies are not a burden -- they are the foundation of America's - and the world's - green future. These policies have driven innovation, created jobs, improved public health, and ensured America remains at the forefront of the global clean energy transition.

Project 2025's attempt to dismantle these critical protections and reverse decades of progress is wrong - we cannot afford to turn back the clock on climate action. The economic stakes are too high, the environmental risks too great, and the opportunities for growth and prosperity too vast to ignore. The future belongs to those who invest in clean energy, transportation and manufacturing, innovation, and sustainability.

Biden's climate policies have laid the foundation for that future, and we must embrace it, not scrap it."
Where America's Richest People Live: Forbes 400 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicahunter-hart/2024/10/02/where-americas-richest-people-live-forbes-400-2024/,2024-10-02T10:14:02Z,"Almost a quarter of all the wealth on The Forbes 400 is held by residents of one state. Two others tie for second for the first time ever.

alifornia is a symbol of wealth, famous for the luxuries of Hollywood and the riches of Silicon Valley. So it's perhaps no surprise that the world's fifth-largest economy is home to more of the 400 wealthiest people in the U.S. than any other state by far -- and has been for 34 years, since overtaking New York in 1991.

The Golden State is home to 83 members of this year's Forbes 400 list, four fewer than last year and nine fewer than a decade ago, but the state is still home to more than one out of five 400 members. As a group, these Californians are worth around triple the $489 billion the state's 92 members were worth a decade ago. But it's not the only hub for the three-comma club. Ranking behind California are New York and Florida, with 54 list members each, followed by Texas, with 43. Those four states are the most populous in the country, holding a third of all Americans -- but nearly 60% of the richest ones. The combined fortune of their 234 billionaires totals $3.3 trillion.

California's days at the top may be numbered. Florida's rise continues; the Sunshine State has eight more Forbes 400 members this year -- enough to tie the Empire State for the first time. Some of the recent gains are due to folks leaving their higher-tax hometowns for Florida's lower rates, like former Seattle resident Jeff Bezos and onetime Chicagoan Ken Griffin. Five New Yorkers have moved to Florida in the past decade. Those transplants include the state's most famous resident, Donald Trump, who returns to the 400 list this year thanks to Trump Media & Technology Group, the social media company he took public in March. New York, meanwhile, has eight fewer 400 members than last year as the state's richest couldn't keep up. Among the drop-offs: Wesley Edens and Richard LeFrak.

A handful of states have only one Forbes 400 member, including Maine (Susan Alfond), Oregon (Phil Knight) and Kentucky (Tamara Gustavson). Ten states aren't represented at all on the 400, including Alabama, Minnesota and Vermont. It was harder than ever to make the list this year due to a record-high cutoff of $3.3 billion, up from last year's $2.9 billion and eons away from the median American family's net worth of $192,900, per the U.S. Federal Reserve. That was enough to bump Mississippi off the map as its richest residents, James and Thomas Duff, though richer than last year, barely missed the cut with net worths of roughly $3.25 billion each.

Net worths are as of September 1, 2024

Ernest Garcia II, the largest shareholder of online used car sales platform Carvana and Arizona's richest resident, wasn't born in the Grand Canyon State, but his ties there stretch back decades. He attended the University of Arizona and developed real estate in Phoenix in the 1980s (a job that later brought him a criminal fraud conviction, thanks to his small role in the scandal surrounding the collapse of one of his lenders, Lincoln Savings & Loan). Other prominent Arizona listees include U-Haul heir Mark Shoen ($5.2 billion) and Arturo Moreno ($5 billion), who owns the L.A. Angels baseball team in neighboring California.

Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual fund behemoth, is responsible for three members of The Forbes 400: CEO Abigail Johnson, the state's wealthiest resident and America's sixth-richest woman, and her siblings Edward and Elizabeth Johnson. Their family frequently donates to Boston-area charities and to Harvard, where Johnson got an MBA. Other prominent Bay State listees include telecom billionaire and Massachusetts philanthropist Robert Hale Jr. ($5.8 billion) and Robert Kraft ($11.8 billion), who found fortune in paper and packaging, and fame as the owner of the NFL's New England Patriots.

S. Truett Cathy (d. 2014) founded Chick-fil-A in an Atlanta area mall in 1967; it's now spread to 48 states and his three children are Georgia's richest residents. The Peach State is also home to Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank ($8.9 billion), private equity mogul and 400 newcomer Neal Aronson ($4.1 billion) and two more notable heirs: Gary Rollins ($6.8 billion), who chairs the pest control company his family founded in 1948, Rollins, Inc.; and Jim Kennedy ($6.6 billion), who chairs the media and automotive conglomerate his grandfather founded in 1898, Cox Enterprises.

The Silver State's highest roller hails, fittingly, from the Las Vegas Strip: Miriam Adelson, whose fortune comes from the Las Vegas Sands casino company that her late husband founded in 1988. Two other Nevada listees who hail from the gaming industry are brothers Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta, the UFC cofounders who also inherited their father's casino business Red Rock Resorts in 1993 and took it public in 2016. The state also boasts fortunes in sectors like aerospace-defense (Sierra Nevada Corp.'s Eren and Fatih Ozmen, $4 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively) and fast food (Panda Express' Andrew and Peggy Cherng, $3.7 billion each).

The richest Pennsylvanians are together worth $126 billion, roughly equal to the Keystone State's total annual government spending. Wealthiest resident Jeff Yass cofounded trading firm Susquehanna International Group, headquartered on the Main Line. It owns an estimated 15% of TikTok parent company ByteDance. Yass is a Republican megadonor who often opens his wallet for state and local elections, everything from county judicial races to Philly's city council election. His Susquehanna cofounder Arthur Dantchik ($12.3 billion) is also a Pennsylvania resident on The Forbes 400 list, as is Victoria Mars ($11.9 billion), heir to the Mars candy and pet food empire, and Jeffrey Lurie ($5.3 billion), owner of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles.

Chicago is home to the youngest member of The Forbes 400, Lukas Walton, who is one of the eight grandchildren of Walmart cofounder Sam Walton. Aged 38, he's one of two listees under 40 (the other being New York-based venture capitalist Josh Kushner). Several list members from the Hyatt hotel brand's Pritzker family are also breezing around the Windy City, including J.B. Pritzker ($3.7 billion), the state's billionaire governor. Others in Illinois made their riches through industries like meat processing (Steve Lavin, $5.4 billion, and Joseph Grendys, $4.2 billion) and finance (Byron Trott, $3.7 billion, and Mark Walter, $6 billion).

Musk -- the richest person in the U.S. for the third year in a row -- is all-in on the Lone Star State, announcing this year that he's moving his companies SpaceX and X there from California. Texas is increasingly seen as a swing state, but Musk made his own political allegiances clear in July when he endorsed Donald Trump for president in a post on X. Texas produces more oil and natural gas than any other state, so perhaps unsurprisingly, nearly a third of its listees made their fortunes in energy, including Randa Duncan Williams ($8.6 billion; Enterprise Products Partners) and Kelcy Warren ($6.7 billion; Energy Transfer).

The Sunshine State keeps attracting big wealth. When Bezos recently relocated from Washington state, he spent $234 million on three homes on Indian Creek, the gated man-made island in Miami Beach dubbed the ""Billionaire Bunker."" Nearly 30% of Florida's listees made their fortunes in finance and investments, including the second-richest Floridian, Ken Griffin ($43 billion), who made headlines in 2022 for moving his family and the headquarters of his hedge fund Citadel there from Chicago. The second-most common industry that enriched the wealthiest Floridians is food and beverage, from which hails Subway's Elisabeth DeLuca ($8.6 billion) and LaCroix sparkling water's Nick Caporella ($4.1 billion).

The world's financial capital is still a finance billionaire hub. Nearly two-thirds of the Empire State's listees made their fortunes in the sector, including Michael Bloomberg, the former NYC mayor who started his career on Wall Street in 1966 at the investment bank Salomon Brothers, then made billions through financial information and media company Bloomberg LP. The state's second-richest resident, Julia Koch ($74.2 billion), is originally from Iowa and owes her fortune to Kansas-based conglomerate Koch, Inc., but has lived in the Big Apple for four decades. In June, she and her children bought a 15% stake in the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and WNBA's New York Liberty for nearly $700 million. Other notable New Yorkers on The Forbes 400 include George Soros ($7.2 billion), Ralph Lauren ($9.4 billion) and Bill Ackman ($9.1 billion).

Hollywood and Silicon Valley have made many Californians rich, but none more than Mark Zuckerberg, who officially resides in Palo Alto, though these days spends plenty of time at his 1,450-acre compound in Kauai, Hawaii. Nearly half of California's Forbes 400 wealth stems from tech moguls like Zuckerberg, including Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin ($136 billion and $130 billion, respectively), Nvidia's Jensen Huang ($104 billion) and Broadcom's Henry Samueli ($16.9 billion). But entertainment moguls like David Geffen ($8.5 billion) and Steven Spielberg ($5.3 billion) also call the Golden State home, as do real estate barons such as Donald Bren ($18.9 billion) and Edward Roski Jr ($7.8 billion), and private equity moguls like KKR cofounder George Roberts ($15.5 billion) and Jim Coulter ($4.9 billion)."
Beware Kamala's 'fair share' lie on taxes,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/beware-kamalas-fair-share-lie-taxes,2024-10-02T09:14:13Z,"As Vice President Kamala Harris tries to articulate her economic plans, it is clear that she intends to continue to spend more money, and in doing so, also wants to raise taxes, at least for some Americans.

Her attempt at an explanation includes one tired refrain, a carry-over from the Biden-Harris agenda: the wealthy aren't paying their fair share and we need to get them to pay more.

What the wealthy pay in taxes cannot be characterized as fair, but not in the way that Harris explains.

According to Treasury data, federal income taxes account for about half of government revenue. Of those federal income taxes, per the Tax Foundation, about half of taxpayers paid around 98% of that total.

IRS MIGHT TAKE MORE OF YOUR MONEY UNDER KAMALA HARRIS

As you dig into the numbers, they become even more ""unfair.""

The National Taxpayers Union Foundation's data from 2021 showed that the top 1% of earners made 26.3% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), yet they paid 45.8% of federal income taxes. One percent of the people paying almost 46% of taxes is definitely not fair, but Harris wants more.

When the data is expanded, the top 10% of earners had 52.6% of AGI, but paid 75.8% of federal income taxes.

The bottom 50% of earners had 10.4% of AGI, but only paid just more than 2.3% of federal income taxes.

HERE'S WHAT KAMALA HARRIS' TAX ARMAGEDDON WILL COST YOU AND THE US ECONOMY

And, somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% of U.S. households pay no federal income taxes at all.

Those who pay abundantly for the federal government and its ""services"" are berated by Harris and friends that they aren't paying enough, which is then voted into being by the people who carry little to none of the federal income tax burden. That sounds... unfair.

What is also unfair is the creep of tax collections and overspending.

For FY 2024, the U.S. government is expected to take in, primarily from taxes, almost $5.1 trillion. That's an increase of around 47% from five years ago. It's a staggering amount, larger than the GDP of every country in the world, other than the U.S. and China. Yet, it's still not enough and the government plans to run a more than $2 trillion deficit on top of that. That's... unfair.

And, while we are talking about unfair taxes, let's not forget that the massive inflation that the Biden-Harris agenda unleashed upon all Americans, stealing their purchasing power, making the cost of everyday living a struggle, and putting the ability to invest and get ahead out of reach. As famed economist Milton Friedman once said, ""Inflation is the one form of taxation that can be imposed without legislation."" That sounds... unfair.

The government spends too much, and it takes too much, particularly from those who have been successful, painting achievement and success as a punishable offense and government dependence as a virtue. That doesn't sound American, that sounds socialist at best.

Yet, Harris will say that those who have done well need to be further penalized, while continuing to overspend and devalue the earnings of all Americans. And that's before layering on any of her ultra-destructive proposals on top of raising income taxes, which include higher capital gains taxes, unrealized gains taxes, and other economically illiterate and ruinous policies.

When it comes to the government, what is unfair is how much they are taxing productive Americans, how many Americans have no skin in the game, and how much government spending is creating a fiscal train wreck.

Calling out that unfairness needs to be done over and over again."
Who is the real JD Vance? And 4 other takeaways from the vice-presidential debate,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/g-s1-25869/vp-debate-tim-walz-jd-vance-takeaways,2024-10-02T09:03:51Z,"Republican vice presidential candidate, Sen. JD Vance, and Democratic vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, participate in a debate at the CBS Broadcast Center on Oct. 1, 2024 in New York City. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption

Partisans on both sides will have arguments for why their guy did well at certain times and not as well at others in the first and only vice-presidential debate Tuesday night between Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz.

This debate likely will not move the needle at all in this presidential campaign, because -- first and foremost -- no one votes for the vice-presidential pick. After all, the most important rule of being a running mate is, ""First, do no harm.""

Short of a major mistake, VPs are unlikely to make a fundamental difference in the race. And there wasn't one of those Tuesday night.

But there were five takeaways from an interesting night:

On style, Vance was clearly more polished than Walz, and he likely accomplished what he sought out to do -- appear more rational and agreeable than Trump and, frankly, himself. But there's a real question about who the real Vance is. He was once a Trump critic, who became one of Trump's biggest cheerleaders. Since that transformation, he's gotten a reputation as a hard-charging MAGA partisan willing to take on all comers, known for making controversial statements, whether about ""childless cat ladies,"" not caring what happens to Ukraine ""one way or another"" or propagating false claims about immigrants eating pets.

But with his popularity lower than any vice-presidential running mate in modern history, another Vance showed up Tuesday night -- one largely respectful of his opponent. Vance even thanked the ""folks at CBS,"" a far cry from the booing that takes place on the campaign trail at his rallies when a reporter asks a question.

Vance also did a lot of laundering of Trump's positions, especially on health care, child care and Jan. 6. Because Republicans have an inherent advantage on the cost of living in this election, his strongest moments were when he questioned why Harris hasn't brought down prices already as part of the administration and implemented some of the things she's promising to do if elected president.

Some will see Vance's performance Tuesday night as a more focused version of Trump. Others will see him as something of a chameleon.

Walz got off to a shaky start. He was asked at the beginning about foreign policy, which is clearly not his strong suit. He had some awkward pauses and misspoke (saying he's ""friends with school shooters,"" for example, when he appeared to mean families of victims of school shootings).

Walz seemed to find his footing, though, on domestic issues, like dealing with hurricanes, climate change, abortion rights and, somewhat surprisingly, in an exchange on immigration, which is generally one of the weaker areas for Democrats. Walz effectively painted Trump as uninterested in solving the problem of immigration because he blocked a bipartisan border security bill. Walz also aimed to isolate Trump as the problem -- even saying he thinks Vance wants to find a solution to the issue. Vance's comeback was to say that Harris is inauthentic and a newcomer to a harder line on immigration. Both campaigns will be happy with those lines of attack.

In addition to foreign policy, Walz was weakest in his response to questions about his time in China. Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests, which took place in the spring of 1989. Minnesota Public Radio and others have reported that he didn't actually travel there until later in the summer.

Instead of directly saying he misspoke, Walz gave a meandering answer that included him saying, ""I will talk a lot,"" which could imply you can't believe everything he says.

Walz's best moments of the night came when talking about Jan. 6 and the 2020 presidential election. At one point, Walz asked Vance if Trump had lost the 2020 election. Vance deflected and claimed instead that the real threat to democracy was ""censorship.""

""That's a damning non-answer,"" Walz retorted.

It was something of a stunning admission: Vance dismissed the idea that experts should be trusted.

That posture mirrors how the right more broadly in the last decade of American politics has moved away from believing experts. Democrats have had their own issues with being perceived as elitist and talking down to working-class voters. Republicans, like Trump, have exploited that.

In place of trusting traditional sources of knowledge, Trump has played to cultural grievance, telling people there are simple solutions to complex problems -- like suggesting tariffs will pay for child care, which they will not. Vance embraces this line of thinking and says voters should trust Trump over others. Giving the example of conventional wisdom about the global economy, Vance said, ""For the first time in a generation, Donald Trump had the wisdom and the courage to say to that bipartisan consensus, 'We're not doing it anymore.' ""

That exposes one of the biggest issues in America: People don't agree on a shared set of facts. People have their own ideologies and are finding others who affirm what they believe -- whether Trump or posts on social media -- rather than having their minds changed by contrary evidence.

Sowing distrust in experts lends more credence to conspiracy and makes it harder to bridge divides.

Moderators can only fit so much into a debate, but there were some things that have gotten attention in this campaign that weren't brought up -- some of which involve the vice presidential candidates directly.

Vance wasn't asked, for example, about his 2021 comments about ""childless cat ladies"" that have drawn so much controversy.

Walz didn't have to account for his military record timeline or his misstatements on carrying weapons of war. Vance wasn't asked about his ""stolen valor"" accusations about Walz's service, either.

Neither candidate was asked about Ukraine, where these two campaigns have fundamentally different views, and Vance, in particular, has been a vocal critic of U.S. aid for Ukraine.

Strikingly, there has been no substantive discussion -- in this debate or the two presidential debates -- about Trump's handling of the COVID pandemic.

With the praise from the right of Vance's performance, it makes you wonder if Trump might be reconsidering another debate with Harris.

Does Trump want to let Vance have the last word? Does he want people questioning if Vance is actually a better debater and a more focused candidate?

How the debate plays in conservative circles -- and how much praise Vance gets -- might make the decision for Trump in the end."
Top 5 clashes between Vance and Walz during debate showdown: 'Your mics are cut',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-5-clashes-between-vance-walz-during-debate-showdown-your-mics-cut,2024-10-02T08:11:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance took the same stage for their first and only vice presidential debate this election cycle on Tuesday evening, when the pair had a handful of fiery clashes over top voter concerns.

The CBS News Vice Presidential Debate showcased the two vice presidential candidates' platforms on issues such as the ongoing war raging in the Middle East, abortion laws and their respective tickets' economic records. Amid the 90-minute debate, Vance and Walz had a handful of clashes, including moderators turning off Vance's microphone.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

The CBS debate's rules included leaving microphones on for both candidates no matter who was speaking, breaking from the two presidential debates this cycle that muted microphones when a candidate was not speaking. The outlet, however, reserved the right to turn the microphones off if they felt it was warranted.

Moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell did mute the pair Tuesday when Vance spoke up to complain that the moderators were trying to fact-check him on his remarks regarding illegal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace,"" Vance said referring to about immigration issues in a city in his home state.

After Vance and Walz both delivered responses regarding immigration, Brennan told viewers that Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

Vance took issues with the on-air ""fact-check"" before he was muted.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS ADMITS FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP WAS BECAUSE CNN LET HIS STATEMENTS 'HANG' AT FIRST DEBATE

""The rules were that you were not going to fact-check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said. ""So there's an application called the CBP. One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in. Applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.""

Moderators tried to quiet Vance before cutting his and Walz's mics.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Margaret Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get to.""

Walz was forced to answer questions regarding his travel to China during Tuesday night's debate.

Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets, however, are now reporting that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""Look, I grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service,"" a visibly shaky Walz said. ""I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.""

""I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams. We would take baseball teams. We would take dancers. And we would go back and forth to China,"" Walz said, noting the trips were ""to try and learn.""

""Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, and I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect,"" Walz continued.

""And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Brennan pushed back, reminding Walz of the question and again asking him to explain the discrepancy.

""All I said on this was, as I got there that summer and misspoke on this,"" Walz said. ""So, I will just -- that's what I've said. So, I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests, went in and, from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance.""

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz claimed during the debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws after Roe v. Wade was overturned, sparking a clash with Vance.

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade,"" he said.

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Vance shot back that a Minnesota abortion law does not require doctors to save a baby who survives an abortion.

""First of all, governor, I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive, and there are a lot of people who should still be alive. And I certainly wish that she was. And maybe you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me. But as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion,"" he said.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""That's not true,"" Walz said.

""Choice or not option that is fundamentally barbaric,"" Vance continued.

The pair also sparred over immigration a handful of times throughout the debate, including Vance slamming Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of immigration.

""First of all, the gross majority of what we need to do to the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job,"" Vance said during a discussion on the Haitian migrant surge in Springfield, Ohio, and immigration overall.

""I've been to the southern border more than our 'border czar' Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.""

Vance continued by saying that, ""of course, additional resources would help,"" but that the issue is mostly about the Biden administration not empowering law enforcement to say ""if you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico"" and ""go back through proper channels.""

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION

""Now, Gov. Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield,"" Vance said. ""Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.

Walz repeatedly argued Trump shut down a Senate immigration bill earlier this year that he believes would have made strengthened border security.

""It is law enforcement that asked for the bill,"" Walz said. ""They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.

""On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.""

""This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then, you start to make a difference in this, and you start to adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.""

The pair of vice presidential candidates also sparred over the threat of censorship on Tuesday, as Walz pressed Vance on the 2020 election and Jan. 6, 2021.

""It's really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 years in this country. We are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election,"" Vance said after Walz cited Jan. 6, when Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol.

""We have to remember that for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections. Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board. But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor,"" Vance continued.

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

Walz countered that ""Jan. 6 was not Facebook ads.""

""This idea that there's censorship to stop people from doing, threatening to kill someone, threatening to do something, that's not that's not censorship. Censorship is book banning. We've seen that. We've seen that brought up,"" he continued.

Walz continued that Trump has repeatedly claimed he won the 2020 presidential election.

""Did he lose the 2020 election?"" Walz asked Vance of Trump during the last election cycle.

""Tim, I'm focused on the future,"" Vance replied. ""Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?""

""That is a damning non-answer,"" Walz said. ""I'm pretty shocked by this. He lost the election. This is not a debate, it's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world.""

""It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship,"" Vance shot back.

Conservative social media reactions pour in declaring winner of VP debate: 'This was a massacre',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/conservative-social-media-reactions-pour-in-declaring-winner-vp-debate-massacre,2024-10-02T08:11:16Z,"A panel of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents give a show of hands in support of either JD Vance or Tim Walz after Tuesday nights Vice Presidential Debate.

Reactions from conservatives on social media poured in during and following the first and only vice presidential debate on Tuesday night with the majority praising JD Vance for his performance.

""This was a massacre,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis posted on X. ""JD Vance absolutely destroyed Tim Walz.""

""JD Vance just won big,"" conservative commentator Charlie Kirk posted on X along with a video montage of facial reactions by the two candidates. ""And it wasn't even close.""

""Tonight's debate underscored that the Harris-Walz ticket is the most radical in our nation's history,"" Jessica Anderson, President of Sentinel Action Fund, said in a statement.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

""As Governor, Walz implemented his far-left agenda in Minnesota, with soft-on-crime policies, authoritarian COVID lockdowns, and support for limitless abortion. As Vice President, he will expand his extremism beyond Minnesota as the unapologetic wingman for Kamala Harris.""

""Vance absolutely crushed it tonight and secured a very bright future in the GOP,"" American Principles Project President Terry Schilling posted on X.

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION'

""Very proud of JD for a stellar performance tonight,"" former presidential candidate Vivek Ramasawmy posted on X. ""And my condolences to Tim Walz - it was unkind for them to put him in this position.""

""JD Vance won big and demonstrated why he was a fantastic pick by President Trump,"" Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton posted on X. ""He skillfully contrasted Trump's record of peace and prosperity with Kamala's record of disaster.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

The Harris campaign released a statement following the debate expressing why it believes that Walz, not Vance, had the strongest night.

""Tonight, Governor Walz showed exactly why Vice President Harris picked him: he is a leader who cares about the issues that matter most to the American people,"" Harris-Walz Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement. ""In the debate, Americans got to see a real contrast: a straight talker focused on sharing real solutions, and a slick politician who spent the whole night defending Donald Trump's division and failures.""

""On every single issue - the economy, health care, foreign policy, reproductive freedom, gun violence - Governor Walz won. He spoke passionately about the Vice President's vision for a new way forward for the country. And in what was the most critical moment of the entire debate, which came in its final exchange, he stood up for our Constitution, while JD Vance admitted he'd put Trump ahead of the country.""

O'Malley Dillon continued, ""The choice facing the American people in November was on full display tonight: between charting a new way forward, or going backwards. Vice President Harris believes that the American people deserve to see her and Trump on the debate stage one more time. She will be in Atlanta on October 23 - Donald Trump should step up and face the voters.""

The Trump campaign said in a statement that Vance ""unequivocally won tonight's debate in dominating fashion"" in what was ""the best debate performance from any Vice-Presidential candidate in history.""

""Senator Vance spoke the truth, eloquently prosecuted the case against Kamala Harris' failed record, and effectively held Governor Tim Walz accountable for his lies on behalf of the Harris-Biden Administration,"" Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said. ""Senator Vance also perfectly articulated the Trump-Vance vision to make America safe again with their plan to launch the largest mass deportation operation in history; to make America strong again with a peace through strength foreign policy agenda; and to make America wealthy again by cutting taxes, unleashing American energy dominance, and ending inflation.""

""Tonight, Senator Vance proved why President Trump chose him as his running mate. Together, they make the strongest and most dynamic presidential ticket ever, and they are going to win on November 5th."""

This story first appeared in the NPR Network's live blog of the 2024 vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz. For the latest on the campaign, head to NPR's Elections page.

Vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz faced off onstage in New York Tuesday for what is the last scheduled debate of election season.

The tone was largely collegial -- in contrast to much of the campaign so far -- as the two Midwestern men tackled issues like the economy, immigration and health care.

NPR reporters fact-checked the candidates' claims in real time. Here's what they found:

VANCE: ""If you believe [that carbon emissions drive climate change], what would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America ... Unfortunately, Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite.

Under the Biden-Harris administration, the U.S. produced a record amount of oil last year -- averaging 12.9 million barrels per day. That eclipsed the previous record of 12.3 million barrels per day, set under former President Donald Trump in 2019.

Last year was also a record year for domestic production of natural gas. Much of the domestic boom in oil and gas production is the result of hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking"" techniques. While campaigning for president in 2019, Kamala Harris said she would ban fracking, but she changed course when she joined the Biden administration.

In addition to record oil and gas production, the Biden-Harris administration has also coincided with rapid growth of solar and wind power. Meanwhile, coal has declined as a source of electricity.

-- NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley

MODERATOR: ""[Gov. Walz] mentioned that President Trump has called climate change a hoax. Do you agree? ""

VANCE: ""Look, what the president has said is that if the Democrats, in particular Kamala Harris and her leadership, if they really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America, and that's not what they're doing.""

VANCE: ""I've noticed some of our Democratic friends talking a lot about ... this idea that carbon emissions drives all the climate change. Let's just say that's true, just for the sake of argument.""

Former President Trump has, in fact, repeatedly called climate change a hoax and made light of its effects.

His rhetoric on climate change has shifted over the years, with the former president at times saying he believed the issue was real but did not know if it was driven by human activity.

Scientists agree that the climate is changing, and that change is being driven by human activity, specifically burning fossil fuels which increases carbon emissions.

-- NPR producer Lexie Schapitl

VANCE: ""And then I think you make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers. A lot of people will go home if they can't work for less than minimum wage in our own country, and by the way, that will be really good for our workers who just want to earn a fair wage for doing a good day's work.""

As the vice presidential candidates discuss how to address concerns over immigration, increased migration -- both legal and illegal -- has helped to grow the labor force in recent years, allowing employers to keep adding jobs at a rapid clip without putting much upward pressure on prices.

Over the last 12 months, for example, the foreign-born workforce has grown by nearly 1.5 million people while the native-born workforce has shrunk by 768,000 people -- mostly due to retirements, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Were it not for the influx of immigrant workers, the U.S. economy would likely be shrinking.

They do not appear to be displacing native-born workers.

The share of working-age men who were in the workforce in August was 89.5% -- higher than all but one month during the Trump administration. The share of working-age women who were in the workforce last month was the highest ever -- 78.4%.

-- NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley

VANCE: ""A lot of fentanyl is coming into our country ... Kamala Harris let fentanyl into our communities at record levels.""

Once again we heard that undocumented immigrants are bringing fentanyl into the country -- a myth which has been debunked.

In reality, close to 90% of illicit fentanyl is seized at official border crossings. Immigration authorities say nearly all of that is smuggled by people who are legally authorized to cross the border, and more than half by U.S. citizens. Virtually none is seized from migrants seeking asylum.

Also, NPR has reported that the U.S. is currently seeing significantly less fentanyl in circulation and fewer overdoses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that fentanyl-related deaths dropped by roughly 10% last year.

-- NPR immigration correspondent Jasmine Garsd

VANCE: ""If you look at what was so different about Donald Trump's tax cuts, even from previous Republican tax cut plans, is that a lot of those resources went to giving more take-home pay to middle class and working class Americans. It was passed in 2017 and you saw an American economic boom unlike we've seen in a generation this country.""

Despite Trump's frequent claims to the contrary, the 2017 tax cut was not the largest in U.S. history. However, it was big enough to blow a large hole in the federal budget. Tax revenues as a share of GDP dropped to 16.3% in the year after the tax cut was passed, down from 17.1% the year before and an average of 17.7% over the past 40 years. Even though federal spending also declined as a share of GDP in 2018, the deficit topped $785 billion that year, and approached a trillion dollars in 2019 -- the year before the pandemic.

According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, more than half the savings from the 2017 tax cut went to the top 10% of earners, and more than a quarter went to the top 1%.

Large parts of the 2017 tax cut are due to expire next year. Trump has proposed extending all of them, while also calling for an additional cut in the corporate tax rate. Harris has proposed extending the tax cuts for everyone making less than $400,000 a year (97% of the population) while raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy.

While Harris' tax proposals are similar to those made by President Biden, her plan differs from the president's in some respects. For example, she called for a 28% tax on millionaires' investment income -- which is lower than the 39.6% rate Biden has proposed.

Under the Biden-Harris administration, the IRS has also beefed up tax enforcement to ensure that wealthier people and businesses pay what they owe. GOP lawmakers have criticized that effort, and it could be reversed in a second Trump administration.

-- NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley

VANCE: ""I think you can make a really good argument that [Trump] salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came about. ... Donald Trump could have destroyed the program -- instead, he worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that Americans had access to affordable care.""

During his presidency, Trump undermined the Affordable Care Act in many ways -- for instance, by slashing funding for advertising and free ""navigators"" who help people sign up for a health insurance plan on HealthCare.gov. And rather than deciding to ""save"" the ACA, he tried hard to get Congress to repeal it, and failed.

The Biden administration has reversed course from Trump's management of the Affordable Care Act. Increased subsidies have made premiums more affordable in the marketplaces, and enrollment has surged. The uninsurance rate has dropped to its lowest point ever during the Biden administration.

The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010 and is entrenched in the health care system. Republicans successfully ran against Obamacare for about a decade, but it has faded as a campaign issue this year.

-- NPR health policy correspondent Selena Simmons-Duffin

MODERATOR: ""Senator, you have not yet explained how you would protect people with preexisting conditions or laid out that plan.""

JD VANCE: ""Look, we currently have laws and regulations in place right now that protect people with preexisting conditions. We want to keep those regulations in place, but we also want to make the health insurance marketplace function a little bit better.""

Vance was asked about comments he's made recently, trying to fill in the details of Trump's comments during the presidential debate that he had the ""concepts of a plan"" when it comes to replacing the Affordable Care Act. (The Harris-Walz campaign needled the Republican ticket ahead of the debate about not having anything clearer to say on health policy.)

But when Vance refers to ""laws and regulations in place"" protecting people with preexisting conditions, those laws and regulations are the Affordable Care Act.

For context: Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies could deny coverage or charge higher premiums when people had ""preexisting conditions,"" which could be anything from diabetes or cancer to acne or back problems. The ACA made that illegal, and now everyone has to be covered and their premiums are based on their income, not how healthy they are.

Risk pools previously could essentially sort people into a ""healthy"" bucket, where you pay less for a health plan, and ""sick"" bucket, where you pay more or can't get coverage at all. The ACA requires insurance companies to take all people into the risk pool.

Health policy experts across the political spectrum say it's a terrible idea to go back to pre-ACA policies.

Of Vance's idea, conservative health policy expert Joe Antos told Roll Call last week, it ""doesn't make any sense,"" adding, ""you need some healthy people in there with some sick people, otherwise you're going to have a financially unsustainable system.""

Cynthia Cox of KFF, a nonpartisan research group, tweeted a thread enumerating how perilous things were when insurance companies could consider your ""preexisting conditions"" when deciding what coverage to offer you, if any.

""Cops, firefighters, miners, offshore drillers and pro athletes were denied plans,"" she wrote, because their jobs made some insurers think they were too risky to cover. And if your kid had more than three ear infections in the previous year, that could be grounds for denial, too.

-- NPR health policy correspondent Selena Simmons-Duffin

VANCE: ""Thanks to Kamala Harris's open border, we've seen a massive influx in the number of illegal guns run by the Mexican drug cartel.""

Actually, there is long standing evidence showing the gun smuggling route is going in the opposite direction.

Most recently, the Mexican Attorney General of the Republic and the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) made an effort to trace the origin and number of firearms in Mexico coming from or through the United States. Mexico's Secretariat of Foreign Relations found that 70-90% of traced firearms originated from and passed through the U.S. The ATF and U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated a lower rate of 68%.

-- NPR immigration correspondent Jasmine Garsd

VANCE: ""Another driver of the gun violence epidemic ... is the terrible gun violence problem in a lot of our big cities, and this is why we have to empower law enforcement to arrest the bad guys, put them away, and take gun offenders off the streets.""

Of course, crime rates vary by city, but overall across the country, violent crime dropped nationwide in 2023, with murder falling by around 10% from the year before, according to data released just last week from the FBI. More than 16,000 law enforcement agencies sent their crime data to the FBI, covering around 94% of the country's population.

This year-end data, released each fall by the FBI, is the most complete look at national crime rates we have, but it is a little dated. Still, according to preliminary FBI data, violent crime has continued to drop nationwide in the first half of 2024 compared to the first half of 2023.

MODERATOR: ""Governor, you said you were in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests 1989, but Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are reporting that you actually didn't travel to Asia until August of that year. Can you explain that discrepancy?""

WALZ: ""I've not been perfect, and I'm a knucklehead at times ... I got there that summer and misspoke on this.""

Walz has a long relationship with China and claimed he'd been there ""about 30"" or ""dozens"" of times, but after APM Reports questioned how that was possible, his campaign acknowledged the real number of trips from the U.S. to China was ""closer to 15.""

Walz lived in China for about a year, teaching in the southern city of Foshan. His stint with the nonprofit organization WorldTeach started in the summer of 1989, just two months after the Tiananmen Square massacre.

Starting in 1993, he led annual summer trips to China for students in the Nebraska and Minnesota high schools where he taught.

Walz also once described being in Hong Kong in May 1989, during the student uprising that culminated in the Tiananmen Square massacre, the reporting from APM Reports notes -- an assertion that is belied by newspaper accounts at the time."
The Future Of Work: New Skills For Thriving In The AI-Driven Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyrubin/2024/10/02/the-future-of-work-new-skills-for-thriving-in-the-ai-driven-economy/,2024-10-02T04:16:38Z,"With insights from Shea Gopaul, John Frankel, Matt Greenfield, Kamal Mistry, Reza Safai, and Nick Bostrom

The IMF predicts that AI will affect 40% of global jobs, either through replacement or complementing human roles. Despite the potential disruption, AI is opening doors to new opportunities in STEM, healthcare, finance, entertainment, manufacturing and energy. The key challenge now is how governments, businesses, and educational institutions can collaborate to ensure that workers are prepared for this fast-evolving landscape.

Addressing the Global Skills Crisis

AI's global impact presents both opportunities and challenges, particularly in developing regions. Shea Gopaul, IOE Permanent Representative to the UN, highlights the global ""skills crisis,"" compounded by 2.6 billion people lacking internet connectivity, which exacerbates the digital divide.

Gopaul stresses that ""more action is needed."" The private sector must play a pivotal role in advancing internet connectivity, governance, and digital literacy. ""We need to foster trust and adopt a human-centric approach,"" she asserts.

Public-Private Partnerships as a Solution

Gopaul highlights the power of partnerships in addressing the skills gap. ""Apprenticeships, one of the oldest forms of collaboration, align education with current labor market needs,"" she says. Through initiatives like the Global Apprenticeship Network (GAN), businesses, governments, and institutions can reskill and upskill workers to meet evolving industry demands. ""Collaboration between the public and private sectors has never been more crucial.""

Future-Ready Skills for AI-Driven Industries

Gopaul underscores the role of multinational corporations in preparing workers for AI-driven industries through training in Generative AI and enhancing human skills like adaptability and collaboration. ""It won't be AI taking jobs; it will be people with AI skills,"" she explains. Job creation and AI skills development are paramount if we are to eliminate poverty.

Ensuring Compliance and Governance in AI-Powered Industries

AI is helping streamline tasks in industries like finance, such as risk monitoring and compliance reporting. While automation increases efficiency, human oversight remains crucial to ensure regulatory standards are upheld. Businesses must balance automation and human judgment to innovate responsibly and navigate legal and ethical challenges.

Opportunities in AI-Driven Sectors

John Frankel, founder of ff Venture Capital, highlights a shift in focus: ""The conversation has moved from being an AI startup to how any startup integrates AI processes to reduce costs and scale efficiently. The challenge for existing businesses is that new ones automatically start with AI processes -- such as ad generation, sales automation, code development, and quality assurance.""

On job loss, Frankel notes: ""The Luddite perspective that technology destroys jobs is very seductive, as the jobs lost are easier to grasp than those gained. But look where we are: tight unemployment in a deeply technological society."" He adds, ""Robotics and advanced AI applications will create jobs in areas that are harder to see, but the technology should be embraced, not rejected.""

Looking ahead, Frankel foresees major developments: ""There will be a huge increase in the deployment of technology into US manufacturing and energy sectors, creating massive efficiencies and many new jobs. The economy will be better for this.""

Innovating with AI in Immersive Storytelling

AI's impact on the entertainment industry is a clear example of how it is reshaping jobs and required skills. Volumetric video, which captures performances in 3D, is being transformed by AI to expand its applications and lower production costs. According to Kamal Mistry, ""AI enables us to capture volumetric video in more varied environments, opening up entire genres such as concerts, sports, and even training scenarios."" This shift is creating new career opportunities in content creation and interactive media.

AI-Driven Innovation: Merging Creativity with Technology

Reza Safai, filmmaker, actor, and founder of MASSIVE, highlights that creativity will remain indispensable in an AI-driven future. While AI can assist in the creative process, Safai emphasizes that pushing boundaries will still depend on human insight and innovation. ""The skills that will keep you relevant in the future aren't purely technical,"" he explains. ""It's about learning to think differently, to see possibilities where others see limitations.""

Educating Tomorrow's Workforce for AI-Driven Industries

As industries like entertainment continue to evolve with AI, preparing the workforce must start with education. Matt Greenfield, managing partner of an education-focused venture capital firm, stresses the need for educational systems to adapt. ""Schools need to figure out how to help students productively use AI in group projects. In our jobs, we will all be refining our work in iterative processes incorporating insights from multiple AI models and multiple humans.""

Greenfield emphasizes that the most critical skills for tomorrow's workforce won't just be technical but human-centered. ""The most important skills for most workers will be non-technical: the ability to ask catalytic questions, empathize, lead, solve multidisciplinary problems, and unlearn when they have been wrong.""

Next Steps: Preparing for the AI-Driven Workforce

To ensure a smooth transition into the AI-driven future of work, all stakeholders must take active roles in shaping how industries adapt and evolve. Here are actionable steps to consider:

The path to the future of work lies not just in mastering the technologies that will shape industries but in fostering the human-centered skills that will enable workers to thrive alongside AI. Creativity, empathy, critical thinking, and ethical decision-making are the qualities that will set professionals apart in the AI-augmented workforce.

As Nick Bostrom puts it, ""The future is big enough for both humans and digital minds to flourish, but we must work hard to ensure that relations between them remain friendly."" By embracing AI's advances while maintaining ethical oversight and fostering human-centered skills, we ensure that AI serves as a tool for empowerment, not disruption."
Vance vs. Walz debate leaves Americans with this big takeaway,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/vance-vs-walz-debate-leaves-americans-big-takeaway,2024-10-02T04:14:19Z,"'Democracy 2024' panelists evaluate Sen. JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz's performances at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

The largely civil and arguably quite informative debate between Democratic nominee Gov. Tim Walz and Republican nominee Sen. JD Vance on Tuesday night has underscored one thing. We need another presidential debate.

Both Walz and Vance stuck to familiar positions on the issues on the debate stage, whether it was on the economy, health care, energy or immigration. No new ground was broken, no dramatic changes in policy were unveiled.

Still, the debate, in my estimation, was very important for a fundamental reason: it was civil, it was informative, and it included a surprisingly high degree of bipartisanship that has been noticeably absent from the 2024 presidential race.

It is certain that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump watched the debate. And both, I am sure, concluded that their respective running mates did an excellent job in both underscoring their core positions as well as attacking their rivals.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

But most importantly, on Tuesday night there was a comment that I think both candidates underscored in their own way: That we can do better as Americans, we can solve our problems and provide leadership as people who disagree, and sometimes vigorously, but have a broader purpose beyond our narrow partisan concerns.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

This is not simply a homily. It's much more. It is a large-scale call for a different kind of politics, even if implicitly made by both candidates, it is a recognition of the extraordinary challenges we face, both domestically and internationally, in the wake of Iran's attack on Israel. And most of all, it underscores to me why both presidential candidates need to quickly accept the invitation of various news networks for another debate or more debates in the final 35 days of this campaign.

It's virtually certain that no minds were changed on Tuesday night.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

To be sure, the pundits will be vetting what the candidates said or didn't say about immigration and abortion. Two topics on which they disagree vehemently. But the two vice presidential candidates were largely repeating and underscoring what their respective nominees have said and believe.

The key now is for the media to focus on what the American people want and require as this extraordinary race comes down to the finish line. The two presidential campaigns need to face off, at least once, if not more times, to discuss and debate their positions on the issues with a greater degree of specificity and precision than they have done previously.

The 2024 presidential race is now an effective statistical tie. This is especially true when one looks at the seven key swing states in this election. There is a degree of uncertainty about precisely where the candidates stand on the important issues facing our country after a raucous presidential debate last month that was more personally divisive than it was informative.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

For us to make an informed choice as Americans, we need to replicate what happened on Tuesday night with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The two presidential candidates need to tell us, in programmatic terms, what they will do on the economy, immigration, crime, health care, energy and, of course, on foreign affairs, a critical topic which did not get anywhere near the attention it deserved and required.

The level of dissatisfaction of the American electorate with the candidates and with the political process cannot be overestimated. We saw what the American people deserve but have not received until now in this presidential election.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

Both vice presidential candidates were likable on Tuesday night. Vance had heretofore not been seen that way. On the debate stage, it was hard not to empathize with him, even if you disagreed with him. Likewise, Walz delivered as a likable everyman figure.

I came away from the presidential debate last month not wanting to have dinner with either Trump or Harris. After the V.P. debate, I wanted to get to know both candidates better.

My takeaway from Tuesday night is that, for virtually the first time in this election cycle, Vance and Walz quietly acknowledged that the electorate requires something more before Election Day. It's up to Trump and Harris to give it to them--in person--at least one more time, if not more."

JD Vance addresses the Iran Nuclear Deal during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democrat vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced off Tuesday night in their first -- and only -- debate, sparring over issues from foreign policy to border security; abortion to climate change; and introducing themselves and their records to the American people with just five weeks to Election Day.

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5th, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs, on a day that began with nearly 50,000 unionized dock workers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a tough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

As for a preemptive strike, Vance said ""it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe.""

""And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys,"" Vance said.

Walz fired back, slamming the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" while saying Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

But Vance fired back.

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years? And the answer is, your running mate -- not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, said he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves ""when was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border -- a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no. told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking; some of them, hopefully are at homes with their families; some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules,"" Vance said. ""The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris's wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, you know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies. I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

Walz pushed back, saying children have not been used as ""drug mules,"" and defending Harris, saying she was attorney general in California and ""prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drugs.""

Walz also hit Vance over claims he had made about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, saying he had demonized them.

""Look in Springfield Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans,"" Vance said.

At that point, moderators tried to correct Vance--but the GOP vice presidential nominee pushed back, reminding that the moderators said they would not fact-check the candidates.

The moderators said that many Haitian residents in Springfield, Ohio have legal temporary status. Vance jumped in to ""say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process and tying it to a Harris-backed process, the moderators spoke over him, sarcastically thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

""We have so much we have to get to, thank you so much for explaining the legal process,"" Margaret Brennan said before asking her co-moderator to ask the next question.

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American People's Trust back on this issue, where they frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options right now.""

Vance echoed Trump's view of abortion--supporting the Supreme Court's decision to return the issue of abortion back to the states, while supporting exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON 2 TOP ISSUES AHEAD OF VP DEBATE

""The proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions,"" Vance said. ""Let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big a very diverse. And let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.""

Meanwhile, the moderators switched to questions of leadership -- with the moderators pressing Walz on whether he was actually in China for the Tiananmen Square protests, like he claimed.

A visibly nervous Walz attempted to explain the discrepancy, ultimately saying he ""misspoke"" and was not there until later that year.

And the question for Vance was about his past criticisms of Trump.

Vance said, at the time, he disliked Trump because he ""believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record.""

""Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take-home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans, a secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on. And yeah, when you screw up, when you misspeak, when you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people about it,"" Vance said.

Meanwhile, Vance offered his sympathies to Walz during the section of the debate focused on gun violence, when he learned that Walz's son had witnessed a shooting.

Walz said his 17-year-old son ""witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball.""

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting. I'm sorry about that -- Christ, have mercy,"" Vance said.

The two spoke about school shootings and their plans to solve gun violence.

""We have to make the doors locked better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger, and of course, we've got to increase school resource officers. Because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience,"" Vance said.

Walz said the conversation was a good start but had to go further.

""Even though they have a high gun ownership rate in the country, there are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment. And the idea to have some of these weapons out there, it just doesn't make any sense,"" he said.

And on another top issue this cycle: democracy.

Vance was pushed on his past comments, in which he said he would not have voted to certify the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021.

Vance fired back at the assertion that Trump could pose a ""threat to democracy,"" saying that he believes ""we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country.""

""But unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about. It is the threat of censorship. It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics. It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens,"" Vance said.

Walz redirected the discussion back to Jan. 6, 2021, blasting Trump and Republicans for allegedly denying the events of that day.

""I will tell you this, that when this is over, we need to shake hands this election and the winner needs to be the winner. This has got to stop. It's tearing our country apart,"" Walz said.

But Vance replied, saying it is ""really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th.""

""As we have done for 250 years in this country, we are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election. And of course, I hope that we win, and I think we're going to win,"" Vance said. ""But if Tim Walz is the next vice president, he'll have my prayers. He'll have my best wishes and he'll have my help whenever he wants it.""

But Vance reminded Americans that ""for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections.""

""Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board,"" Vance said. ""But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor.""

As the debate came to a close, Vance and Walz both promised voters a new direction for the United States.

""Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward,"" Walz said. ""She's bringing us a politics of joy. She's bringing real solutions for the middle class. And she's centering you at the heart of that, all the while asking everyone, join this movement. Make your voices heard.""

Vance also gave a message of change to the voters.

""We need change. We need a new direction. We need a president who has already done this once before and did it well. Please vote for Donald Trump,"" Vance said. ""And whether you vote for me or vote for Tim Walz, I just want to say I'm so proud to be doing this and I'm rooting for you.

Walz came into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating. Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable.

Heading into the debate, Vance had been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Both running mates get right back on the campaign trail on Wednesday in two of the key seven battleground states that will likely determine whether Harris or Trump succeed President Biden in the White House.

Vance holds campaign events in Auburn Hills and Marne, Michigan. And Walz takes part in a campaign bus tour swing through parts of central Pennsylvania which kicks off at the airport in Harrisburg, the state capital."

Walz repeats Georgia abortion death falsehood decried by doctors as 'fearmongering',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-repeats-georgia-abortion-death-falsehood-decried-doctors-fearmongering,2024-10-02T03:19:45Z,"Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., discusses abortion access during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz claimed during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws following the overturning of Roe, despite doctors previously denouncing such a narrative as ""fearmongering.""

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe versus Wade,"" he said.

Walz joined Ohio Sen. JD Vance in New York City on Tuesday evening where the pair squared off on key voter issues this election cycle, including the economy, immigration and abortion.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022. Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Members of the Democratic Party, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have cited their deaths as evidence for the need to expand abortion access following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""Good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy is about saying a healthcare provider will only start providing that care when you're about to die?"" Harris said during an Atlanta campaign event last month, while citing Thurman's death.

OB-GYNs have since criticized the narrative as a misleading story that is being pushed by the media and Democrats.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton have also come out to say they don't believe Georgia laws had anything to do with Thurman's death, but was instead caused by alleged complications from abortion pills, as doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

HARRIS CALLS FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 'ROE' ABORTION BILL INTO FEDERAL LAW

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

As Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced off in the Vice Presidential debate in New York City Tuesday, both parties took to social media to express support for their candidate, with Democrats fact checking Vance on every point.

Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg claimed Walz was ""laying down facts"" and that Vance was ""unaware"" that the U.S. energy production was up.

""Remarkable to see JD Vance pretend to be unaware that US energy production is up and US manufacturing is up dramatically right now, much higher than under Trump. Glad Tim Walz is laying down the facts here,"" Buttigieg wrote on X.

""Vance says Trump ""restored deterrence"" in the Middle East. Totally false. Iran and its proxies weren't shooting at U.S. troops UNTIL Trump became President,"" Murphy wrote.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer applauded Walz for ""standing up for American workers.""

""Michigan remembers what happened under Donald Trump. Hundreds of thousands of jobs were lost across all industries, including manufacturing. The Biden-Harris administration was critical to bringing jobs back to Michigan.""

Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., alleged that Trump and Vance's ""Project 2025 agenda will raise costs on Arizona families while giving more tax breaks and power to big corporations.""

""@KamalaHarris and @Tim_Walz will lower costs and build an economy that works for all Americans.""

Project 2025 refers to a set of conservative policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation and has turned into a right-wing-'boogeyman' style Democratic talking point and fodder for Trump critics.

TRUMP BLAMES BIDEN, HARRIS FOR IRAN'S ATTACK ON ISRAEL: 'VERY CLOSE TO GLOBAL CATASTROPHE'

Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker wrote on X that ""housing and homeownership will be the most accessible under a Harris-Walz administration.""

""They want to equip the next generation of homeowners with the support they need to achieve the American dream.""

Ex-Obama adviser David Axelrod wrote on X that Vance was ""doing well"" in the debate, but then ran ""like a bat out of hell"" when asked ""a direct question about the 2020 election.""

Brian Fallon, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, also took aim at Vance's response to questions about the 2020 election.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance ripped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for the Democratic Party's economic record, remarking Walz has a ""tough job"" simultaneously defending Vice President Kamala Harris' ""atrocious economic record"" while attacking former President Donald Trump on the economy.

""Honestly, Tim, I think he's got a tough job here because you've got to play Whac-A-Mole. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take home pay, which of course he did. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation, which of course he did,"" Vance said Tuesday evening during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate in New York City.

Vance was responding after Walz slammed the GOP ticket as one that protects billionaires with tax cuts and pledging that he's a ""union guy"" who wants to keep jobs in the U.S.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON 2 TOP ISSUES AHEAD OF VP DEBATE

Vance continued by saying Walz has to juggle defending Vice President Kamala Harris' economic record while slamming Trump.

""And then you simultaneously got to defend Kamala Harris's atrocious economic record, which has made gas, groceries and housing unaffordable for American citizens,"" Vance continued.

The economy is a top voter concern this election cycle, ranking alongside issues such as the immigration crisis, abortion and national security.

""I hope we have a conversation on health care then, senator,"" Walz said as Vance wrapped up his points on the economy.

""Please,"" Vance responded.

Byron Donalds spars with 'Breakfast Club' hosts over Harris' economic record: 'You sure you want to go there?',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/byron-donalds-spars-breakfast-club-hosts-over-harris-economic-record-you-sure-you-want-go-there,2024-10-01T23:15:48Z,"'The Five' co-hosts discuss Vice President Kamala Harris' trip to the border and her insistence that she will fix the immigration crisis as president.

Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., accused Vice President Kamala Harris of breaking the economy during a heated exchange on ""The Breakfast Club,"" where he sparred with hosts over her role in handling the current inflation plaguing the U.S.

A discussion on Tuesday's episode of the show devolved into a fiery exchange between the lawmaker and the hosts after he blamed Harris for the failed economic policies of the Biden administration.

""I would argue we're not really thriving right now. This inflation, which by the way was brought to us by Kamala Harris, has really slowed people down from being able to excel,"" Donalds said.

VP HARRIS' TIE-BREAKER VOTES IN THE SENATE WERE KEY TO INFLATION-BOOSTING BIDEN POLICIES: EXPERT

""By Kamala?"" host Charlamagne Tha God replied. ""She's vice president. There's still a president.""

""Oh Charlamagne,"" Byron said, reminding listeners that Harris cast the tie-breaking vote on the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act in 2021.

""She broke the tie that started this inflation that has hurt so many people in our country,"" Donalds said.

Guest-host Angela Rye dismissed Byron's argument as ""not true.""

""You sure you want to go there?"" the Florida Republican shot back, pulling out a pamphlet of ""facts"" from his suit jacket to back up his claim as Rye tried to speak over him.

Donalds argued that experts anticipated ""massive inflation"" if the American Rescue Plan was passed.

""That's what happened,"" he said.

""The problem we have in our economy today is that prices have gone up massively, wages adjusted for inflation is down, people's pocketbooks are hurting,"" he continued.

Donalds asked co-host DJ Envy, whether he would hire someone who broke a house to fix more houses.

When Rye wondered how his question was pertinent to the topic at hand, Donalds shot back, ""Chill, Angela.""

CRITICS BLAST HARRIS' GRASP OF INFLATION, ATTACK ON BUSINESS AHEAD OF POLICY SPEECH: 'LUNATIC BEHAVIOR'

""Because I'm bringing facts...so now you don't want to do it anymore? C'mon Angela, that's not right. I want to have a fact-based conversation,"" Donalds said.

Donalds posted a clip of the exchange on X later Tuesday, writing ""Democrat economists warned her it would cause inflation. And it did...It caused 20+% inflation. It created a cost-of-living crisis. It crushed hardworking Americans. Kamala broke our economy.""

The Harris campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Biden in the past has called assertions that the American Rescue Plan's substantial spending might have been a cause of the skyrocketing inflation ""bizarre,"" waving away the accusation.

Opinion | This is the rare vice presidential debate that actually matters,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-tim-walz-vp-debate-vice-presidential-rcna172750,2024-10-01T23:15:15Z,"""Ain't nobody coming to see you, Otis"" is an iconic line from ""The Temptations,"" a 1998 NBC miniseries. Delivered by the actor playing David Ruffin, it's a boast that the audience was not paying to see anyone else in the group, just Ruffin. Conventional wisdom says one could apply this logic to Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.

In a ""normal election,"" a debate between the No. 2s on the ticket would be interesting but not statistically significant. The rule for a vice presidential debate is generally the same election to election: Stick to the top of the ticket's message, draw a contrast with the challenger anchored in that message and, crucially, do no harm. Conventional wisdom says people do not cast ballots because of whom the Democratic or Republican nominee chose as an eventual governing partner. It's the name on the top of the ticket that matters.

However, this is not a normal election, and I disagree with the conventional wisdom. Running mates matter, and tonight's debate is quite significant!

If the nominees' choice for potential governing partner did not matter, then there would no reason to put them on the stage together before the election. Choosing a running mate is the first presidential-level decision a major party nominee makes. It is a statement about who they are and what their agenda and legacy will be if elected president. In selecting the millennial Vance, former President Donald Trump tripled down on Trumpism, cementing it as a key pillar of the Republican Party apparatus and the bedrock of the GOP's next generation.

In selecting Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris signaled that the Democratic tent is big and that she is serious about making her bold plans on child care, reproductive freedom and the economy a reality. Just look at what her running mate has done in Minnesota when it comes to those issues.

Tonight's debate could be the last time voters hear from the campaigns in a forum at which they are mandated to stand next to each other and defend their plans. A literal split screen where the comments of both participants will take center stage. That alone raises the stakes.

Vance will have to answer for his treasure trove of soundbites on everything from likening Trump to Hitler and the racist conspiratorial lies about Haitian people in his home state, to name just two. Walz will be asked to defend his record in Minnesota (because apparently feeding children is too progressive) and his military service record. Regardless of what the moderators ask, a candidate who is well prepared will answer the question then quickly pivot out of the conversation about themselves and back to the issues and their No. 1. This is not always easy to do, but it is critical.

When we first sat down for debate prep in 2020 with then-Sen. Harris, we initially focused on ensuring she knew what then-candidate Joe Biden had said publicly about each issue. It was important she was well versed in his thoughts, so she knew the contours of where and how far to go in discussing any particular topic.

The last thing a campaign wants is the running mate making unauthorized news.

When Vance sat down with my colleague Kristen Welker on ""Meet the Press,"" he emphatically stated Trump would not sign a national abortion ban into law. And yet, during Trump's second debate this cycle, he walked back Vance's answer on national television. Vance will want to avoid making the same mistake tonight, but a large part of being vice president is speaking for the president. If Vance cannot do that in a debate, why would he be able to do it at the White House?

For Walz, he will have to walk the tightrope of part attack dog and part explainer. This is an area where many voters still say they want to know more about Harris' plans, so Walz will have to use his time wisely, find moments to speak directly to the people at home and explain how a prospective Harris-Walz administration would make a difference for families across the country. Much has been said about Walz not being a seasoned debater, but remember he was a high school teacher and a football coach! One could say he honed his oratory skills in the lion's den.

In 2020, during Harris' debate prep, we had many internal discussions about how to handle the question of age if it came up. Tonight, Walz won't have that problem. Harris will turn 60 this month; however, Vance will have to speak to why Americans should trust 78-year-old Donald Trump to sit behind the resolute desk again and if he himself -- a freshman senator with no legislative accomplishments and no other political or government experience -- would actually be ready to lead the country if duty called.

Tonight, while no one will be looking for Otis, all political eyes will be on Tim Walz and JD Vance."
Educating for Europe's Unique Style Of Economic Growth,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanpenprase/2024/10/01/educating-for-europes-unique-style-of-economic-growth/,2024-10-01T22:59:44Z,"Europe's troubling lack of economic growth has been a subject of concern in widely read articles and an influential European Commission report headed by Mario Draghi, former president of the European Central Bank. The slow economic growth, only 0.5% in 2023 across Europe, compared to 2.5% in the US, and low investment in new technologies, has created an ""existential"" threat to Europe, and threatens its ""reason for being,"" according to Draghi. GDP growth has lagged behind the US in 7 of the past 10 years, and overall productivity in Europe is only 75% of US productivity. Many companies within Europe are beginning to relocate to the US to enable faster growth. A recent McKinsey report reports how US companies are outcompeting European corporations, with 1.8 times more R&D spending, 1.6 times more investment and 2.5 times more market capitalization in the US compared to Europe in 2022.

Europe's lagging behind the US and other dynamic economies arises from a slow recovery from the pandemic, lower emphasis on digital technologies, and a lack of investment in transformative technologies such as AI, according to a report by the European Central Bank. Europe's industrial policy strategy stresses radical expansion of R&D expenditures, more expansive investment in new technologies, and regulatory reform. The new Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) is intended to boost research and manufacturing in key areas such as digital technologies, AI, clean energy technologies, and biotechnology.

Europe's approaches to technological advances differ substantially from those in the US. For example, AI development in Europe is regulated by the 2024 EU Artifical Intelligence Act, which includes an Intelligence Board, regulatory sandboxes, and AI monitoring to detect and reduce how AI might alter the behavior of people, exploit vulnerable populations, and cause other forms of harm. The EU Digital strategy for future development of AI is creating ""AI Factories"" within the EU, shared datasets to promote new startup companies, and a dedicated AI office for enforcement of EU policies. This approach is one that appears to balance growth with a concern for social impacts of new technologies.

While the statistics show Europe's economy as lagging in some measures, it is also leading in others that track sustainability and inclusion. Europe emits less than half of the CO emissions per capita as the US, has a much lower rate of income inequality and a smaller population below the poverty line, and a higher life expectancy than the US. Income inequality in Europe, as measured by the Gini index is only 29.6, compared to 41.2 for the United States and 35.7 for China. The per capita GDP in Europe was indeed 27 percent less than in the US in 2022, but half of the gap reflects a difference in productivity and another half due to individual choices to work fewer hours in a lifetime than in the US. In the EU, only 36% of national income goes to the top 10%, compared to 49% in the US in 2022, according to the World Inequality Database. The Draghi report acknowledges the need to account for Europe's unique social fabric, and suggests avoiding ""hyperglobalization"" that can shift the balance of power between labor and employers.

Europe's unique educational system also arises from planning and policy to promote larger societal goals. The EU has developed numerous exchange programs between universities and industry, building on the 1987 COMETT program, which builds cooperative programs between universities and companies for developing and applying new technologies, and the 1987 ERASMUS program for inter-university cooperation. The 2021 ERASMUS+ program further expanded student mobility, reaching nearly 16 million students in 2024. Additional strategic education policies are being developed to streamline differences between countries, increase graduation rates across the continent and build additional programs for employment within the EU. Despite these measures, job vacancy rates in the eurozone are at an all-time high of 3% in 2023, Europe produces 20 percent fewer STEM graduates per thousand than in the US, and faces a declining working age population. To develop new talent in emerging technologies and increase Europe's shrinking workforce, new approaches will be needed.

Spain provides a specific case that illustrates the tensions between economic growth and traditional approaches in education and business. Spain's growth rate of 2.1 percent in 2023 is much higher than the 0.7 percent rate in the Eurozone, and the country has added over a million jobs per year in 2023 and 2024. The Spanish entrepreneurial ecosystem has increased by a factor of 20 in the past decade, and is now valued at over 83 billion Euros, and a recent report by the Spanish group GEM cites that 13.5% of adults in Spain are involved in an entrepreneurial initiative. Spain features over 11,000 startups employing over 140,000 people, and is fourth-placed in Europe in terms of startups. Despite these promising statistics, difficulties in starting a business from regulatory barriers persists, and a new 2022 Startup Law within Spain is seeking to ease business creation by reducing regulations and taxes, easing access to finance. A recent report from the Spanish business school Esade notes that productivity is still low in Spain compared to the EU, as is private investment, and high public debt could limit future growth.

Ivan Bofarull, Chief Innovation Officer of Esade, described Spain's ""very unique entrepreneurial culture"" as a ""legacy"" worth preserving in a recent interview. Bofarull distinguished between a negative legacy ""mindset that makes you stick in the past"" and a ""positive legacy that a business can leave for the next generation."" Developing a positive legacy requires innovation that is ""strategic with a long-term perspective."" Bofarull described the Esade education as one training students to ""understand how things work, but also to understand the people."" Bofarull prefers disruptive innovation that ""emerges from a synthesis"" and that provides ""continuity rooted in how humans behave"" and knowledge beyond ""hype and conventional wisdom.""

Bofarull also notes that Europe's style of business and education is a ""legacy that emerges from the Second World War"" that ""hedges ourselves against potential terrible downsides."" This approach differs dramatically from the typical US venture capitalist, which Bofarull describes as ""assuming a risk to reach an unlimited upside."" Growth within Europe should arise from what Bofarull describes as ""capabilities and capacities from your legacy that can be transformed into a force for the future."" It is hoped that as Spain and Europe build up their education system and economy, their growth will be rooted in a cultural legacy that will be a force for the future."
VP debate: JD Vance and Tim Walz face off tonight. Here's how to watch and when,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/live-updates/jd-vance-tim-walz-debate-2024,2024-10-01T21:58:31Z,"One question likely on the minds of many people watching tonight's faceoff: Who is this for?

National polls show a tight race between Trump and Harris, suggesting the race will come down to voters in a handful of swing states -- depending on who they vote for or whether they vote at all.

And as NPR's Domenico Montanaro reports, only a ""tiny slice"" of the electorate -- from 6% to the low teens -- is considered persuadable.

In NPR's own polling, there have been nearly four dozen undecided voters in the last four months who gave their permission to be contacted.

Montanaro spoke with 10 of them in the days after the Harris-Trump debate, and detailed their reflections here.

""The debate was important for Harris. Most who watched said she performed better than Trump. They were not all moved to vote for her as a result, but four who seemed to need a degree of reassurance about Harris are now voting for her or leaning Harris' direction after the debate.

And while undecided voters often have unique reasons for what influences their votes, there was a clear gender divide. All four who say they are now voting for or leaning toward Harris are women. That also reflects the wide gender gap seen in polls between the candidates.

The other six -- one woman and five men -- were a mix. Five said they likely won't be voting for Harris, most citing the economy or immigration as reasons. One other said he is still truly undecided, but said prices are a major concern.

Two are leaning toward Trump; another said she aligns more with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; a self-described progressive said he doesn't like Harris' stance on the war in Gaza; and one other, a conservative, said he might not vote at all.""

One thing the group had in common? Many did not want their names used, citing security concerns in the current political climate."

In addition, new changes to the program are intended to increase flexibility for projects and improve the application process.

For Main Streets across the country to thrive, it is critical that entrepreneurs in communities are able to keep pace with innovations and be part of the current business ecosystem. The Build to Scale program drives inclusive and equitable access to capital for technology-based companies to not be confined to the East and West Coasts and flourish across the country. Not only does it make the economy more equitable, it also promotes high-skilled job creation alongside innovative products and services to help lower barriers for underserved regions.

The Build to Scale program seeks to meet this need by generating critical support for regional commercialization, access to capital, and the formation of competitive innovation economies across the country. It offers winners award amounts ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to a maximum of $5 million to support programmatic and operational costs related to growing regional technological advancement initiatives.

This is intended to create stronger pathways for underdeveloped regions to craft tech-based economies that are up to speed with global and regional markets. According to the EDA's recently released Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the program shortens the gap between idea formation and marketable technology by unlocking investment capital across sectors and accelerating growth for its recipients.

The program calls for applicants that are committed to ""challenging the status quo of established markets or commercializing technologies, as well as furthering job creation within their businesses,"" with a specific focus on projects that directly address traditionally underserved regions and communities with histories of systemic economic suppression. This year's changes eliminate the former dual competitions, Venture Challenge and Capital Challenge, consolidating both into a single ""Implementation Challenge."" Eligible applicants include state and local governments, Indian tribes, and entities whose application is supported by a state or local government, such as a nonprofit, university, or public-private partnership.

If you are looking to increase the growth of technology driven businesses in your community, this could be a good fit for you. More information can be found at the EDA's Build to Scale program center. Applicants have until 4:59 PM ET, Time on October 28, 2024, to apply."

Biden has 'privately complained' about how quickly Democrats have moved on from him: Report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-has-privately-complained-about-how-quickly-democrats-have-moved-from-him-report,2024-10-01T18:29:04Z,"President Biden had some fun on ""The View"" by pretending to squash former President Trump like a bug and said his former rival has no ""redeeming value.""

A new report disclosed that President Biden is feeling left out in the cold by the Democratic Party after going all in on Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.

According to the Monday NBC News report, Biden has mentioned to his allies his feeling that his accomplishments and legacy as president are being forgotten by the party, especially as Harris has tried to distance herself away from her boss' policies and forge her own political identity after replacing him on the Democratic presidential ticket.

""President Joe Biden has privately complained to allies that his name and his accomplishments have virtually disappeared from the national conversation and about how quickly the party that he has served for more than five decades appears to have moved on from him, according to six people familiar with his comments,"" the piece reported.

PELOSI DEMURS ON IF 'EVERYTHING IS OK' BETWEEN HER AND BIDEN: 'YOU'D HAVE TO ASK HIM'

According to these sources, the president has commented on Harris not mentioning him during recent campaign speeches, noting that he believes she should acknowledge his economic accomplishments while touting her own vision on the issue.

""Biden has noted at times that Vice President Kamala Harris... hasn't been mentioning him in her campaign speeches lately, including when she talks about an economy he believes his policies set on a positive trajectory, these people said,"" according to NBC.

Additionally, the sources told NBC that Biden ""was particularly stung"" by Harris' recent line during her debate with former President Trump in which she drew a stark distinction between her and her boss.

""Clearly, I am not Joe Biden. And I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country,"" the vice president said during the debate, drawing a stark contrast between her and Biden's policies, as Trump was trying to grill her over the current administration's record.

Those familiar with Biden's feelings on the matter acknowledged that he still wants Harris to win and ""that he plans to do whatever he can to help her,"" the report noted.

An anonymous senior Harris campaign official said that Biden ""always just says to her, 'The most important thing is that you win.'"" The official added, ""We have to tell people who she is and what she would do.""

They also noted, ""There wasn't a real interest in hearing about [Biden's] accomplishments when he was running. That's still the case.""

However, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates denied the claims made by these sources, telling the outlet, ""These uninformed claims are the polar opposite of the truth.""

""President Biden welcomes the strong response the American people are having to Vice President Harris' leadership and to policies that move us into the future, away from dangerous agendas from the past like MAGAnomics and abortion bans,"" Bates added.

The spokesperson doubled down on his rejection of these claims, telling Fox News Digital they are ""not"" true.

The sources have said that Biden understands the political reasoning behind shifting away from his record, though they noted it still ""frustrates him at times.""

""But while Biden is attuned to political realities, he also has expressed a range of emotions about his exit from the race -- from feeling his legacy rests on a Harris victory to anguishing over his imprint's vanishing from the national stage, according to the people familiar with his private comments,"" the article stated.

One source described his mixed emotions on the issue, stating, ""It's very complex.""

Another Harris campaign official defended Harris' pivot away from Biden, telling NBC, ""She has to become her own person. She needs to do that to win.""

Despite Biden's acceptance of Harris' candidacy, he maintains that he would have beaten Trump in November if he was still in the race. He told the co-hosts of ""The View"" last week that he was ""confident"" he could have beaten Trump and said he didn't sense an ""overwhelming reluctance"" about his re-election effort from fellow Democrats.

""I was confident I would beat Trump -- he's a loser,"" he declared.

5 Steps For Job Seekers To Shine In The Crowded 2024 Job Market,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2024/10/01/5-steps-for-job-seekers-to-shine-in-the-crowded-2024-job-market/,2024-10-01T17:00:57Z,"Job seekers are scrambling to stand out amid fierce competition in today's job market. The average monthly rise in new jobs fell by 28% in 2024, compared to 2023 with 118 candidates applying for each new job that is advertised. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 818,000 fewer jobs in March of this year than were initially reported.

An Aerotek study finds the average 2024 job searcher still enduring longer job hunts in an uncertain economy. The findings also reveal that job hunters are feeling vulnerable, and job stability is at the top of their priority list along with higher pay and job engagement. And, although 72% of job seekers say the job search has harmed their mental health, help is on the way to show them how to stand out.

""In today's competitive and over-saturated job market, simply sending your CV is not enough anymore,"" notes Natalia Shahmetova, the CEO and founder of Woofz. She told me by email that the actual issue is getting recognized before you even reach the interview stage. ""But here's the secret: you don't need dazzling tricks; you just need techniques that prove you think differently.""

To help candidates land their dream jobs, Shahmetova shared five tips to stand out in the application process and make a lasting impression in the minds of the recruiters.

Shahmetova points out that the majority of applicants focus on what the job description states. She suggest that you try to dig deeper. ""Look up the hiring manager's LinkedIn profile or the team's most recent initiatives and pain points,"" she advises. ""Then, tailor your CV to target these difficulties specifically. However, sometimes, you have to take a look at the pain points of the company's target audience as well.""

""When you mention a side project, make sure it ties into the role you're going for,"" she recommends. ""Like, if you're applying to Woofz, highlighting programming skills might not do much, but showing off photography skills or your knack for negotiation could be a game-changer. Maybe you ran a social media page for a hobby or organized an event where your attention to detail shined. Employers love seeing how your outside experience connects to the job, not just your nine-to-five.""

A case study is an effective tool, but Shahmetova believes you can make it stand out by including a ""What I Would Do Differently Now"" section. ""Choose a previous project or problem you worked on, explain the situation and how you addressed it, and then reflect on how you might approach it now, given what you've learned since. This small addition shows that you are always evolving, learning and contemplating how to improve rather than relying just on previous triumphs,"" she explains.

This one is bold, Shahmetova cautions, but insists it can make you stand out a great deal. So if you really want to get noticed, she advocates finding a polite way to criticize a component of the company's existing strategy and propose a solution. ""For example, if the company recently introduced a new product but has had customer complaints, highlight it in your cover letter and propose a change that would improve the user experience. The idea here is to be diplomatic; instead of simply pointing out flaws, provide meaningful answers.""

""If the company uses an Applicant Tracking System (ATS), go beyond simply 'optimizing keywords,'"" Her recommendation is to include hidden information that most applicants don't consider adding to their resume. As an example, she suggests including a ""Key Competencies"" section that describes your talents and how they relate to wider industry trends or future issues. She continues that this addition demonstrates that you are focused on the task at hand and on how your function fits into the company's long-term plan as well.

To stand out in today's job market, Shahmetova insists you need to show that you think differently, that you truly grasp the company's needs and that you can add value to their goals. She advises that you focus on their pain points and tailor your application around solving their problems. Show off your side projects that actually connect to the role you want, and when talking about your past work, don't just list achievements -- talk about what you've learned and how you'd do things differently now. And if you're feeling bold enough, she advocates pointing out a flaw in their current strategy and offer a fix.

Driving technology, embracing of the strategic importance of a company's financial functions and an emphasizing corporate sustainability are all transforming the CFO's job. But they're also reshaping other jobs in a company's financial operations. A new report from EY zooming in on the financial controller's position found that 86% of people in that role expect significant changes in their career in the next five years. The majority of controllers told EY they expect their role to shift from one focused on value protection -- paying attention to internal controls and regulatory compliance -- to one that looks for value creation -- using technology, strategy and data to find new opportunities and recommend new policies.

""The controller of the future will be a trusted partner to the CFO right across the transformation spectrum,"" Mike Verbeck, EY Global deputy vice chair for Assurance, said in the report. ""They will create value in their capacity as analysts, collaborators, innovators, storytellers and leaders of talented teams, as well as in their capacity as accounting and compliance experts.""

The report makes clear that this is seen as a natural evolution of the controller's role, fitting with how most companies utilize their financial teams in the foreseeable future. But it's also clear that the report found technology -- including AI -- gives the controller the ability to pivot toward more of a focus on strategy and opportunity. The report found that nearly nine in 10 controllers already use AI, which is powerful on two fronts. It can do many of the basic tasks controllers spend their time on now, and also leverage data to find powerful insights.

EY suggests that controllers take advantage of the opportunity to look for value-creation opportunities by embracing data and AI and inspiring team members to see themselves as problem solvers. CFOs should empower their controllers, and also provide training in future-focused skills that build on technology use and responsibilities to climb the ranks at a company. And the CFO should also focus on an innovative and transformational spirit in potential new hires to work under the controller.

Regardless of how financial roles are created and recruited, the entire financial sector is struggling to find talent. Many college students today aren't pursuing accounting degrees, and even fewer are becoming CPAs. That makes recruiting for any financial position harder, from junior-level to CFOs. I spoke with Keith Giarman, president of the private equity and principal investing practice at executive search firm DHR Global, about how this shortage is impacting things right now. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are now open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Unionized port workers on the East Coast began their first strike in more than 45 years at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, stopping trade traffic at ports in Baltimore; Boston; Charleston, South Carolina; Jacksonville, Florida; Miami; Houston; Mobile, Alabama; New Orleans; New York/New Jersey; Norfolk, Virginia; Philadelphia; Savannah, Georgia; Tampa, Florida; and Wilmington, Delaware. About 45,000 union members represented by the International Longshoremen's Association want a wage increase of 77% and a ban on new automation as part of their new contract with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX), the organization that represents shipping companies. West Coast port workers earn over $30,000 a year more than their East Coast counterparts. Union members are refusing to meet with the USMX until their wage demands are met.

The strike could have fast and far-reaching impacts on the U.S. economy, with some analysts projecting it costing $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion a day. If the strike continues for long enough, it could impact consumer prices and the availability of goods. President Biden has urged the two sides to resolve the issue quickly and fairly, sending Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard to meet with USMX on Monday. While Biden can defer the strike for 80 days through the Taft-Hartley Act, he said over the weekend he will not ""because it's collective bargaining.""

While West Coast ports remain open, Boeing machinists remain on strike. The 33,000 unionized employees at the aerospace manufacturer's Pacific Northwest facilities rejected Boeing's ""best and final offer"" last week. From the union's social media posts, the sticking point appears to be the reinstatement of Boeing's pension plan, which the company did away with in favor of a 401(k) plan in 2014, according to Quartz. It's unclear from media reports what's happening currently with negotiations, but according to KING5, Boeing released a statement Monday saying it is ""committed to resetting our relationship with our represented employees and negotiating in good faith and want to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We are prepared to meet at any time.""

The interest rate cut that everyone was waiting for happened last month. And yet there's already lots of talk about how big the next one will be at the Federal Reserve policy-making committee's next meeting in November. (According to CME FedWatch, as of Tuesday morning, 38.4% of economists project another half-percentage point cut.) This isn't just a case of impatient analysts and investors, writes Forbes' Derek Saul. After the rate cut was announced, yields on the 10-year Treasury note increased. These notes are the basis for interest rates on things including mortgages, auto loans and corporate borrowing -- meaning financing might not be getting cheaper after all.

There are many reasons for Treasury yields to be increasing, some benign and some ominous. Some analysts say investors had already priced in the rate cut, especially since its yields are down compared with earlier this summer. But CNBC spoke with analysts who see uncertainty through the federal deficit and the Fed's willingness to cut interest rates, even with inflation a bit higher than the 2% it sees as tolerable. On Friday, reports showed the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index -- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- to be at 2.2% in August.

The stock market on the whole is responding well, however. The first nine months of 2024 were the S&P 500's best start to a year since 1997, writes Forbes' Derek Saul. The S&P's year-to-date gain is 20.3%, and the other markets have also fared well this year: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 12% in the first three quarters of 2024, and the Nasdaq is up 20%. Buoying the markets so far are last month's interest rate cuts -- insurers, home builders and utilities saw some of the best returns in recent months -- and optimism-fueled AI stocks.

Last week, the Chinese government announced several broad measures to boost its economy, which has been sputtering and looks unlikely to meet its government's annual growth target. The multi-pronged effort includes an interest rate cut from China's central bank, a potential capital injection into its biggest banks to increase lending capacity and governmental economic stimulus, reports Forbes' Derek Saul. Chinese stocks traded on U.S. markets rallied on the news and have continued to trade higher.

However, the rally -- and any benefit to China-based businesses -- may be short-lived for those in the U.S. In a note on Monday, JPMorgan Chase strategists said that if Donald Trump wins the presidential election, it's likely to slow down. Trump has campaigned on strict trade policies toward China, including a tariff of 60% or more on all Chinese goods, phasing out imports of essential goods and revoking China's most favored nation trade status. Vice President Kamala Harris has said in her campaign that she wants to enact policies that ensure the U.S. keeps its economic foothold above China, but she has not presented anything specific that is as restrictive. Analysts believe Harris will continue the Biden administration's approach of more targeted Chinese economic policies, including limiting imports and exports from high-tech industries.

As the nature of work has changed and new fields related to finance have cropped up, there's been a shortage of accountants on all levels -- especially with fewer young people opting for accounting degrees, and even fewer choosing to work at traditional firms and pursue the CPA path. This has immediate and potential long-term implications for finance departments and CFOs. I talked to Keith Giarman, president of private equity and the principal investing practice at executive search firm DHR Global, about what it means. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

It's hard to find the right talent today. What are companies doing to keep the talent they have?

Giarman: A lot of the compensation has gone north. It is a different level skill set that [companies] are asking for. There are a few [qualified employees], and they know that. They know that their price tag and their market value have gone up. Especially in private equity, where they've got a hopefully three-year timeline to improve operations and sell a company, they have to have the absolute best and invest in that role. They're working with the CFO more than the CEO.

For everybody else [in finance], if you accept my logic, there's fewer of them. Whether it's somebody running FP&A or somebody lower down in the organization, you've got to pay up.

That doesn't fix it, though, because people come for more than money. [Companies] have to create great working environments and be more flexible, including remote [work]. As a company, we have the same challenges. We've tried to create an environment for our research and associate staff where we emphasize things like wellness and the things that the younger generation wants to focus on and feel good about in terms of the community they're building around them. If you're not doing those other soft HR things, all the money in the world isn't going to make a difference. They'll stay for a couple of years, and they'll go.

Much of the attention of the accountant shortage is focused on lower-level employees. Are you seeing related challenges with recruiting CFOs?

The answer is a very loud yes, with an exclamation point. The CFOs who will make the cut, where the client will not bend on the requirements, seems like [there are] fewer and fewer as we move along.

It's also dependent on the cycle of the market. CFOs have been in assets in private equities for a while. We're finally starting to see the Fed lower interest rates. There could be some exit liquidity opportunity in a year or two. If more transactions are getting done, there's more folks who have proven themselves: They're able to flourish in these environments and get the job done. We haven't been in that for the last 12 to 24 months.

When we do a CFO search today, something that might've taken 90 days can take 180. There's a timing issue with candidates. There's a compensation issue. There's a flexibility issue in terms of where they are in the investment cycle, too, because if you're going to sell the company in two years, are you going to expect somebody to move their entire family on a plane three hours away?

The good news is at that level, you're thinking about wealth creation and longer-term things that take care of your family and your career. You're even more disposed to the financial element of the opportunity, and you're willing to put in the hard work to get it. If [companies] can make the numbers work and people can see a path to the end zone, there's a better chance you're going to land those bigger fish, and they're going to stick.

What does the future look like for this shortage?

The thing that's going to make it better is selling a bunch of companies, where good people free up. There's $8 trillion of private equity money floating around out there, and a lot of that's in companies that have CFOs that are waiting to exit. [After interest rates drop enough to restart more dealmaking, probably in 2025], that's when you're going to see more IPOs. You're going to see more deals, you're going to see more M&A. The people that are really good, there's going to be more freed up that you can get access to. They're going to be looking for their next great CFO opportunity.

What Is The Consumer Price Index  And How It Impacts Investing,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/what-is-cpi-consumer-price-index/,2024-10-01T16:40:33Z,"The Consumer Price Index ""is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services,"" according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which issues the monthly report. In this article, you will learn about how the CPI is put together, the different types of CPIs and the part it plays in investing trends and monetary policy.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average fluctuation over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of what consumers typically buy and use, such as food and beverages, housing, clothing, transportation, medical care and entertainment, and the sales and excise taxes consumers pay. The CPI does not include income or Social Security taxes. Nor does the CPI report investments, such as stocks, bonds, real estate and life insurance because those items are not day-to-day consumption expenses.

Because of the ways the CPI data on those items is applied, it affects nearly all Americans.

The CPI has three major uses, according to BLS. They are as an:

Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts.

The BLS describes the CPI as a ""measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a representative basket of consumer goods and services."" It also publishes other economic indexes, broken down by region, population and goods, but the one most widely quoted and consequential is the CPI-U, usually called simply the CPI, which covers the purchases of urban consumers and reports each month. A second large survey is the CPI-W, which is a monthly accounting of the average change in the prices that urban wages earners and clerical workers pay for a market basket of consumer goods and services.

To measure data, the BLS continuously collects information to come up with the CPI and other indexes. Its data collectors go in person or work through the Web and with apps to contact thousands of retail stores, service establishments, rental units and doctors' offices, all over the country to compile information about prices on thousands of items used to track and measure price changes in the CPI; it also records prices of some 80,000 items each month representing a ""scientifically selected sample of the prices paid by consumers for goods and services purchased.""

The list of items and services in the CPI basket include the following.

The indexes from BLS have many breakdowns. To better evaluate costs, the BLS presents the CPIs in two ways. They are:

It ""represents all goods and services in the report; in other words, 'the whole shebang,' "" wrote Britannica Money. ""It represents the average inflation rate across the entire economy.""

It ""strips out food and energy prices. Why? Food and energy prices tend to be more volatile than other products in the CPI mix,"" noted Britannica Money. Weather, international prices and geopolitics impact those two product categories. Even some economists at the Federal Reserve choose to leave them out of the equation to come up with a more constituent view on price inflation.

BLS publishes a family of price indexes covering regions and specific industries, which include the four Census regions, nine Census divisions, two sizes of city classes, eight cross-classifications of regions and size-classes and for 23 local areas as well as those for the major groups of consumer expenditures, such as food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation, medical care, recreation, education and communications, and other goods and services for items within each group, and for special categories, such as services. By studying sectors, too, the BLS is able to make educated guesses about the economic state of industries.

It also collects prices for goods and services in 75 urban areas and from about 23,000 retail and service establishments and data on rents from some 50,000 landlords or tenants

The CPI has wide-ranging implications for hundreds of millions Americans and the government, including Congress, the White House and the nation's central bank the Federal Reserve, as well as for Wall Street and investors.

The CPI is used to help adjust income eligibility for levels of government assistance, federal tax brackets, federally mandated cost-of-living increases, private sector wage and salary increase, poverty measures and consumer and commercial rent escalations. ""CPI indexes are used to adjust income eligibility levels for government assistance, federal tax brackets, federally mandated cost-of-living increases, private sector wage and salary increases, poverty measures, and consumer and commercial rent escalations,"" according to the BLS.

According to Cooke Wealth Management LLC, because the CPI gauges inflationary trends, ""it can lead investors to anticipate higher consumer goods and services prices in the future. This expectation can lead to adjustments in investment portfolios, potentially reducing stock market prices due to anticipated reduced purchasing power and demand.""

Dan Raju, CEO of the brokerage platform Tradier, told me that the recent Fed rate cut coupled with CPI movements have led to market volatility and posed a surprise for his traders, who didn't expect an interest rate cut until the inflation rate hit 2%, as suggested by the Fed. ""Lower interest rates typically encourage borrowing and spending, which can lead to increased market activity, but also heightened risk. For our clients, this means a potential for higher returns, but with amplified volatility,"" he added.

The ups and downs of inflation impact the various asset classes differently.

""When the CPI rises and inflation concerns increase, capital often shifts from bonds to stocks or other inflation-resistant assets, such as energy infrastructure, commodities and real estate,"" Jon DuPau, managing director at SuperDex, told me.

""Bonds have an inverse relationship with interest rates, and companies who utilize lending or discretionary spending may experience some uncertainties. Investors reassess the growth potential of companies under inflationary pressure. With CPI considerations, investors may seek safer, more conservative assets as a hedge,"" John Jones, investor advisor representative, at Heritage Financial, told me. Bonds can provide that hedge.

During the early years of the Biden-Harris administration, both the CPI and PPI (Producer Price Index) statistics reported monthly by the U.S. Government were running at nearly 30-year highs,"" Adam Ferrari, CEO of Phoenix Capital Group, noted.

He added that, ""This erosion of value has resulted in elevated home prices, stock market valuations and hard assets like gold and other industrial metals also reaching higher levels. Overall, elevated CPI levels in the U.S. economy has caused investors to seek reprieve in hard assets like real estate, gold or even oil and gas properties.""

""Retreating prices for some commodities are contributing to lower inflation today,"" according to U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Rob Haworth, the bank's senior investment strategy director noted that although food and energy prices rebounded in early 2024 and were ""raising inflation risks,"" prices later in the year leveled off a downturn in the inflation rate.

""The Consumer Price Index in the United States averaged 124.59 points from 1950 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 314.80 points in August of 2024 and a record low of 23.50 points in February of 1950."" according to the tradingeconomics.com from data reported by the BLS.

""Investors must carefully analyze CPI reports, considering that government-released numbers are often revised later, potentially creating credibility issues,"" Chris Hite, regulatory compliance manager at Nurp LLC, the software company that develops algorithmic software for Forex trading, told me.""A nuanced approach is key. Looking beyond headlines to understand core trends is vital. Some assets, like commodities, real estate and inflation-protected securities, can hedge against inflation. However, high inflation and sticky interest rate hikes can negatively impact stocks and bonds.""

The CPI is meant to paint the economic picture in broad strokes, so by its very nature, it doesn't address individual variations. In a post, the economic site Quickonomics addressed what it views as the CPI's four limitations.

They are:

The Federal Reserve Board has long looked for trends in the CPI to help to formulate fiscal and monetary policy and gauge inflation. However, in January 2012, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adopted PCE [personal consumption expenditures price index] as its primary measure of inflation over CPI.""

James Bullard, former president of the St. Louis Fed, wrote in 2013 that the PCE, issued by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, is a better way to gauge the prices that consumers face and determine inflation rates than the CPI.

Market reactions mean that investors can get spooked by the unexpected, or even the expected, which can be a number of events, including the CPI report. Most recently, in August 2024 when the latest report came out, stocks were ""briefly plunging as much as 743.89 points, before ending with its biggest intraday comeback in almost two years,"" according to MarketWatch. Other times, the CPI has virtually no impact on the market.

When you hear the results of the monthly CPI, you're getting a short-hand version of what's happening in the economy and what the average person is dealing with financially. Of course, the CPI doesn't present a nuanced picture, but it can suggest to you and the U.S. government when prices are static, falling or rising and where to make adjustments."
Taylor Lorenz leaves Washington Post following her Biden 'war criminal' post controversy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/taylor-lorenz-leaves-washington-post-following-biden-war-criminal-controversy,2024-10-01T16:27:28Z,"Washington Post tech and online culture reporter Taylor Lorenz skewered Elon Musk's management of Twitter, calling ""disaster"" during a recent interview on BBC World News.

Reporter Taylor Lorenz announced she left The Washington Post on Tuesday after being absent for weeks following a viral controversy involving her calling President Biden a ""war criminal.""

Lorenz went viral in August after a screenshot obtained by the New York Post's Jon Levine appeared to show her calling President Biden a ""war criminal"" in an Instagram post while attending a White House event. Lorenz initially implied the caption was edited by someone else before admitting that she shared the post herself.

As part of the launch of her User Magazine Substack, she explained ""why I'm leaving legacy media,"" saying her type of reporting ""has become increasingly difficult to do in corporate media.""

The Post confirmed her exit.

WASHINGTON POST'S TAYLOR LORENZ SAYS BIDEN 'WAR CRIMINAL' POST WAS 'OBVIOUS MEME' AFTER CLAIMING IT WAS EDITED

""We are grateful for the work Taylor has produced at The Washington Post. She has resigned to pursue a career in independent journalism, and we wish her the best,"" a spokesperson for The Washington Post told Fox News Digital.

For several weeks, The Post remained mum about whether Lorenz had been suspended from the paper over the controversy. Lorenz had not had anything published since Aug. 7. A spokesperson from the paper previously said it was ""looking into"" Lorenz's post but did not provide any updates until Oct. 1, confirming Lorenz's exit from the paper.

WASHINGTON POST LOOKING INTO ALLEGATIONS TAYLOR LORENZ PUBLISHED INSTAGRAM POST CALLING BIDEN A 'WAR CRIMINAL'

Lorenz previously told Fox News Digital that she was on an overseas vacation and implied she would be back to work at The Post the week of Sept. 30.

Meanwhile, Lorenz has remained active via her personal Substack newsletter as well as her podcast, which is produced by Vox.

It remains unclear whether Lorenz was officially suspended over her Instagram post.

The controversy began when Lorenz attended the White House Creator Economy Conference last month, where Biden made an appearance.

In the viral image shared by Levine, a masked Lorenz was seen taking a selfie with Biden speaking in the background. Included was a caption that read ""War criminal"" with a frowny face.

Fox News Digital learned the post was made in an Instagram story specifically using the ""close friends"" feature as indicated by the green star icon, meaning it was not posted publicly and could only have been seen by a select group of Instagram users of her choosing.

WAPO REPORTER SUGGESTS WHITE HOUSE CENSOR 'MISINFORMATION' FROM TRUMP-MUSK INTERVIEW DURING PRESS BRIEFING

Lorenz initially denied the post's authenticity, replying to Levine, ""You people will fall for any dumba-- edit someone makes.""

However, not only did Lorenz later admit it was real, she insisted it was a joke.

""I literally never denied it was real,'"" Lorenz told one critic on X. She told another that it was an ""obvious meme.""

There had been speculation online that Lorenz was making an obscure reference to musician Lucy Dacus, who called former President Obama a ""war criminal"" on social media last year, also with a frowny face.

NPR previously reported that ""four people with direct knowledge"" of the post ""confirmed its authenticity.""

""Only about 7 people saw the actual close friends post (I have very few people on CF) and almost all are my normie non-media friends. So [I don't know] who this guy is talking about [to be honest],"" Lorenz reacted to NPR's reporting.

Biden has been repeatedly attacked by the far-left for his handling of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, with many deriding him as ""Genocide Joe"" for continuing to provide military aid to the Jewish State following the Oct. 7 terrorist attack. Lorenz, known for her far-left opinions, is a fierce critic of Israel."
Reality Check: Building A Profitable Career In The Creator Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gustavlundbergtoresson/2024/10/01/reality-check-building-a-profitable-career-in-the-creator-economy/,2024-10-01T16:20:49Z,"The opposite of a microtrend, the creator economy is here for good. Set to grow to almost half a trillion dollars by 2027 (compared to $250 billion today), it's an increasingly enticing industry for young people. One in three between 18 and 30 aspire to be influencers, and as influencer marketing continues to ramp up, it's a more viable career option than ever.

But while effortless overnight success seems to come to many creators, social media can often be nothing more than a highlights reel, showing an unrealistic version of events. For every breakout internet personality, thousands of young creators are failing to succeed and struggling with an unpredictable freelance career. And with every viral video, millions of Gen Zers' perceptions of financial success are being warped.

Enter the social finance app Frich, whose co-founders Katrin Kaurov and Aleksandra Medina are on a mission to provide Gen Z with real, data-driven insights into how their peers manage money.

Gen Z has ""skewed ideas of what it means to manage a budget"" because of what they see on social media, explains Kaurov. Being constantly exposed to financially aspirational content - whether it's ""creators like Mr Beast, who regularly gives away huge amounts of money, or 17-year-old TikTokers buying their own house"" - makes it easy for Gen Zers to believe that's the norm for their age and life stage. With Frich, users enter their age, city, profession and salary before seeing benchmarking data on what their peers are spending on items such as rent, concert tickets and clothing.

""You might go to a bar with your friends, for example, and not feel like you can afford to buy a round of drinks; but if you're on Frich, you can discover that you might be earning above average for someone your age in your city, and therefore you probably can afford those $17 espresso martinis,"" Medina says.

The Frich founders built their company out of lived experience. Kaurov and Medina saw ""unattainable, extravagant lifestyles"" online while ""grappling with the realities of budgeting, worried our cards would get declined"" when they shared a student apartment in New York. They felt the effects of negative comparison and wanted to make money more transparent.

Behind the alluring influencer lifestyle lies a different reality - as Kaurov puts it, ""it's essentially a freelance job, which comes with its own unique financial challenges."" A career in content creation is unpredictable, with fluctuating income and instability based on ever-changing algorithms and audience desires.

For the Frich co-founders, financial literacy is a key skill for all Gen Zers, particularly those wanting to be influencers or planning to monetise their social followings. The skills for managing ""inconsistent income and no benefits"" are as crucial as building an audience, says Kaurov, who has over 40,000 Instagram followers herself thanks to a previous career as a teen model. From her perspective, building a personal brand requires the same time, money and dedication as building a business.

As the creator economy matures further, the Frich co-founders are seeing a counterbalance to the unattainable wealth springing up on TikTok and other social platforms. The rise of the micro-influencer - which Medina describes as a creator with ""a smaller but more cultivated and tailored audience"" - is shifting the financial dynamics online for content creators. Unlike the early days, when influencers became millionaires within months, micro-influencing can be a more sustainable way of building and retaining an audience, and therefore a more sustainable way of building a career in content creation. Creators who are more relatable or on a more typical salary can ""encourage more transparent and open conversations about money online,"" according to Medina.

Such influencers are a breath of fresh air in contrast to widespread misinformation on social media. A recent Moneysupermarket study found that 74% of financial advice given by influencers is incorrect, dangerous or misleading. Frich seeks to puncture misinformation online and direct its users to influencers who are ""sharing how they repay their debt, how they maximise their credit card points and negotiate their phone bill contracts,"" according to Medina. 82% of Frich users have never used a buy now, pay later scheme, for example: evidence that its financial literacy resources are working. Although the Frich co-founders advise exercising caution when consuming social media content, Kaurov caveats that ""social media can be a great resource for finding life hacks or inspiring personal stories if you follow the right accounts.""

Ultimately, whether creating or consuming content, Gen Z feels adrift financially. Medina sums it up: ""You don't know what you don't know. Most Gen Zers have no idea how they're doing when it comes to finances, and what they're searching for is the affirmation that they're normal, and that they're doing OK. They don't want to compare themselves to luxury influencers and feel like they're failing all the time. Instead, they want a vibe check from their peers that they're on the right track."""
"Queen Elizabeth II had 'form of bone cancer' before her death, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson claims",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/queen-elizabeth-ii-had-form-bone-cancer-before-her-death-former-prime-minister-boris-johnson-claims,2024-10-01T16:18:53Z,"Fox News host Martha MacCallum reflects on Queen Elizabeth II's life, her impact on the United Kingdom and the world.

Former United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson is revealing alleged private information about the death of Queen Elizabeth II.

Her Majesty, who passed away in September 2022, was battling ""a form of bone cancer,"" according to Johnson, and had known by the summer ""she was going.""

Official documents released after the queen's death confirmed the cause as old age. She was 96.

CANCER DIAGNOSES IN THE BRITISH ROYAL FAMILY OVER THE YEARS: 'THE GREAT EQUALIZER'

Johnson wrote about this in his forthcoming book, ""Unleashed,"" where he recounts his final interactions with the queen. In an excerpt obtained by the Daily Mail, Johnson wrote that he visited the queen at her Balmoral residence just two days before the U.K.'s longest reigning monarch died. Earlier that summer, Johnson had resigned from Parliament.

""Like all my 13 predecessors, I had come to spend the last hour of my premiership in the company of Queen Elizabeth II. The date was September 6, 2022, more than two months after I had resigned as prime minister, and under our ­system I had been required to stay on and mind the shop while the Conservative Party got on with choosing a new leader.

""It had been a rather frustrating summer,"" he wrote.

Once at Balmoral with his wife, Carrie, Johnson could sense lingering fatigue among the staff.

""Edward Young, her private secretary, tried to prepare me,"" Johnson wrote, according to the outlet. ""I had known for a year or more that she had a form of bone cancer, and her doctors were worried that at any time she could enter a sharp decline.""

Rumors that the queen battled myeloma, a bone marrow cancer, during the last years of her life have never been confirmed, although reported.

When reached for comment by Fox News Digital, Buckingham Palace said, ""We will not be offering guidance or comments on this, and this should not be seen as guidance of fact.""

Johnson wrote that Young told him the queen had ""gone down quite a bit over the summer."" When they met, Johnson wrote, ""she seemed pale and more stooped, and she had dark ­bruising on her hands and wrists, probably from drips or injections.""

""But her mind - as Edward had also said - was completely ­unimpaired by her illness, and from time to time in our ­conversation she still flashed that great white smile in its sudden mood-lifting beauty.""

Johnson wrote of his close relationship with the queen, admitting ""there was nothing I could not tell her."" He remembered lamenting about the COVID-19 pandemic, how it had impacted individuals and also the economy.

""'Oh well,'"" Johnson remembers the queen saying. ""'I suppose we will all just have to start again.'""

""I realized that she spoke with the historical knowledge of someone who had actually served in uniform in the Second World War, and whose first PM was Winston Churchill. She knew her kingdom was infinitely capable of rebounding and recovering. We just needed to get a grip, and get on with it,"" Johnson wrote, according to Daily Mail.

Johnson said that the queen's secretary later explained to him, ""she had known all ­summer that she was going, but was determined to hang on and do her last duty: to oversee the peaceful and orderly transition from one government to the next - and, I expect, to add another departing PM to her record-breaking tally."""

Could Dock Worker Strike Spike Inflation? Experts Are Split.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/01/could-dock-worker-strike-spike-inflation-experts-are-split/,2024-10-01T15:08:19Z,"The massive dock worker strike beginning Tuesday comes at an inopportune time for the U.S. economy, as the potential uptick in shipping prices comes ahead of the holiday season and as policy makers look to turn the page on inflation, though experts are split on whether the strike will have a major impact on inflation and the economy more broadly.

""The port strike could disrupt the data, essentially creating a smoke screen for the Fed when trying to stick the soft landing,"" wrote Essaye. The strike crucially comes two weeks after the U.S. central bank initiated the first interest rate cuts since March 2020, essentially declaring victory over inflation. The Fed has signaled it intends to continue cutting, meaning its toolkit is far more limited to stifle another inflation outbreak.

How an extended strike impacts retailers as the holiday quarter kicks off. UBS analyst Arpine Kocharyan wrote Monday retailers had already adjusted import activity in ""anticipation of supply chain disruption"" from the strike.

The East Coast accounts for 40% of U.S. shipping container volumes and about 5% of global volumes, according to Bank of America. The port-related inflation concerns evoke bad memories of the late 2021 supply chain snarls which came as ports globally dealt with significant backlogs due in part to COVID-19 outbreaks among workers. That contributed to the global inflation crisis, and inflation peaked in 2022 at a 41-year high of more than 9% in the U.S."
What Talent Executives Should Be Asking Themselves In The Age Of AI,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwinsor/2024/10/01/what-talent-executives-should-be-asking-themselves-in-the-age-of-ai/,2024-10-01T14:57:09Z,"The democratization of expertise and knowledge is not new; it's been accelerating for centuries. From the advent of the printing press to the internet and now to artificial intelligence (AI), the tools that once belonged exclusively to experts are increasingly available to all. AI is the latest -- and perhaps the most profound -- development in this ongoing trend.

Historically, access to expertise was the privilege of a few. Guilds and institutions held tightly to their knowledge, offering it to select members. The Industrial Revolution began to chip away at these barriers, and the digital revolution obliterated them. Today, knowledge creation, sharing, and application tools are increasingly decentralized. AI continues this trajectory, making vast amounts of data, insights, and capabilities available to anyone with the technology.

So, what does this mean for talent executives? As AI reshapes the workforce, executives must think strategically about five key questions to remain relevant and impactful.

1. Are We Embracing Continuous Reinvention?As Brian Glaser points out, the BANI (Brittle, Anxious, Nonlinear, Incomprehensible) world has replaced the VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) era, requiring companies to constantly pivot. Talent leaders must ask: Are we building a culture that embraces change and encourages rapid reinvention? Like companies such as Netflix and YouTube, which have successfully reinvented themselves in response to market shifts, HR must develop mechanisms to pivot quickly, not just reactively but proactively. HR teams should lead by example, constantly evaluating and updating their processes and systems.

2. How Are We Leveraging Co-Intelligence?The concept of Co-Intelligence, as defined by Ethan Mollick, suggests that humans and AI should collaborate, each amplifying the strengths of the other. AI can provide unprecedented data and insights, but human intuition, creativity, and judgment will unlock its full potential. HR must ask: Are we fostering a culture where AI is used to enhance human decision-making rather than replace it? This might mean upskilling the workforce in technical AI competencies and areas such as emotional intelligence and creative problem-solving.

3. How Are We Rethinking Traditional Job Structures?The traditional notion of the ""job"" is being increasingly questioned. Susan Cantrell writes that organizations are shifting from rigid job descriptions to fluid roles based on skills, autonomy, and project-based work. HR needs to ask: Are we moving toward a skills-based organization that aligns talent with the evolving needs of the business? This means investing in internal talent marketplaces, where employees can match their skills with dynamic organizational needs.

4. Is Our Technology Stack Aligned with Our Talent Strategy?Just as Chief Marketing Officers embraced digital tools to transform marketing from a tactical function into a strategic powerhouse, HR must now embrace AI, data analytics, and digital platforms. McKinsey's report highlights that technological adoption is crucial for HR's future. HR must ask: Do we have the right technology stack to manage and empower talent? This might include AI-driven talent platforms, advanced performance management analytics, and personalized employee development tools.

5. Are We Prepared for the Open Talent Economy?The freelance economy and open talent platforms are transforming how organizations source expertise. Executives must ask: Are we ready to tap into a global, on-demand workforce to meet our organizational needs? This is not a stop-gap measure but a strategic shift. Firms across the globe have demonstrated the power of integrating open talent to solve complex problems. HR leaders must build frameworks seamlessly integrating freelancers, contingent workers, and in-house teams.

AI represents the latest chapter in democratizing expertise, but its true power lies in how organizations leverage it. Talent executives must focus on continuous reinvention, embrace human-AI collaboration, rethink traditional structures, align their technology stack, and embrace the open talent economy. Those who do will not only navigate the AI-driven future but lead it."
Some Biden 2020 voters say they don't know enough about Kamala Harris,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/some-biden-2020-voters-say-dont-know-enough-kamala-harris,2024-10-01T14:33:38Z,"Fox News contributor Mary Katharine Ham and Democratic strategist Tim Hogan analyze Vice President Kamala Harris' 'easy' interview with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle.

Some Biden 2020 voters still want to know more about Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the election, telling the New York Times that they don't know enough about the Democratic nominee's policies.

""I need to hear more from Kamala Harris in terms of what she wants to do. I hear a lot from Trump, and I agree with some of his policies, but I don't like his character. And I think I need to hear a little bit more from her for her to win my vote,"" Prince, a Democratic North Carolina voter, told the Times.

The New York Times spoke to 15 voters that voted for President Biden in 2020 in a Times Opinion focus group. While some said they still wanted more from Harris, by the end of the discussion, only three voters remained truly undecided between Harris and former President Trump.

""I don't know that there's much that Trump could say, because we already know what he's like. I think for Harris, if she came out with a more specific outline of some of her policies and if I heard some policies that aren't too good to be true, like the $25,000 home-buyer tax credit,"" a North Carolina Republican voter said.

72 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS YET TO DO A FORMAL PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE EMERGING AS DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

The third person who was undecided, a 35-year-old Independent voter from Georgia, said he wanted to know more about Harris' plan for immigration and her economic policies.

The voter also said that he would be more invested in the vice presidential debate and hopes Gov. Tim Walz will be able to talk about Harris' policies in more detail.

An Independent voter from Nevada said while she leaned more towards Harris, she pulled back a bit because she didn't ""know enough about her.""

However, at the end of the discussion, the voter did not say she remained undecided.

The New York Times' moderator of the discussion, Magie Omero, asked the group what they liked best and least about the vice president and the former president.

One Michigan voter said what he liked best about Harris was that she was not Trump. Another said Harris is smart and ""relatable."" Others likened Trump to a dictator, and many suggested he was ""self-centered.""

""I don't feel like she's had time to set herself apart from what Biden's been doing for the last four years. For the most part, she's run with a similar plan. I don't know that that's the best plan,"" one of the Republican voters from North Carolina said, responding to the question about what they like least about Harris.

Another Republican voter agreed and added, ""She gives the impression of a fresh perspective, but I don't think we've had enough time to actually get details as to what that perspective is.""

A Democratic Pennsylvania voter agreed with both Republicans and said they didn't know enough about Harris' agenda.

When asked if they were happy that Harris was the Democratic nominee, multiple people said they were not satisfied, as Harris is the current vice president.

""I'm not that satisfied. She has been the vice president for the past four years and not really implemented anything. I wish the economy were better, and I heard she was in charge of border issues. We could have done a little bit better for a Democratic candidate,"" one Wisconsin Democrat said. She also said Harris was ""wishy-washy."""
African Immigrant Startups: From Student To Success In Global Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2024/10/01/african-immigrant-startups-from-student-to-success-in-global-economy/,2024-10-01T14:23:21Z,"Americans can learn a great deal about the global economy and the U.S. immigration system from successful African students. Africans who strive to achieve their dreams in the United States bring unique perspectives. Albert Owusu-Asare, a former international student, became a successful entrepreneur, and his story provides insights about America, the immigration system and the global economy.

Albert Owusu-Asare was born in Ghana and decided early on to study in America as an international student. Owusu-Asare became interested in U.S. universities after he noticed that students from his high school had gone to the United States for college. He wanted to be an aerospace engineer, and Ghana did not offer the kind of education he wanted. ""I learned about the schools in the U.S., the high caliber, and the offer of financial aid was also a factor,"" he said in an interview.

For U.S. universities and the American economy, Africa will be a significant source of international students in the years ahead. The number of students from China applying to American universities has stagnated, and low population growth in many countries limits the potential supply of future international students.

High visa denial rates for African students continue to raise concerns among U.S. lawmakers and universities wishing to attract more students from Africa. In a July 3, 2024, letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, members of Congress wrote, ""We believe all qualified applicants, regardless of where they come from, should have an equal opportunity to continue their academic journey in the United States. However, we are concerned that students from developing countries may be at a disadvantage when interviewing with State consular officers.""

The letter from Senators Peter Welch, Alex Padilla, Cory Booker, Ralph Warnock, Mark Kelly, Chris Van Hollen, Elizabeth Warren and Kyrsten Sinema stated that recent changes to the State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual did not alleviate their concerns: ""Between 2015 and 2023 . . . data obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request shows that State denied students from African countries at a significantly higher rate than those from other regions of the world."" They cited a recent report. The U.S. for Success Coalition and several of its members, including NAFSA, the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration and the Council of Graduate Schools, endorsed the letter.

Americans may not realize that international students can be denied visas even if a U.S. university accepts them for admission. ""It's a nerve-wracking process just preparing for your visa interview,"" said Owusu-Asare. ""That may lead to mistakes. The most stressful part for me was to go to another city to do the interview, and then you have to cross your fingers that you have a successful interview and come back home.""

His advice for students looking to study abroad is to start early. Begin researching all possibilities for universities before your junior year in high school.

Who you meet in college could be as important as what you study. Albert Owusu-Asare attended Grinnell College in Iowa, earning an undergraduate degree with a double major in computer science and physics. During the international student orientation program, he met his future cofounder, Ameer Shujjah. ""So, a guy from Ghana, a guy from Pakistan, the first day of college we meet each other, had classes together and eventually we started a business together,"" said Owusu-Asare.

For most Americans, graduating from college means finding a job. The stakes are higher for international students. As he completed his studies at Grinnell, Owusu-Asare remained in F-1 student status, which permitted him to stay in the United States only so long as he pursued a full course of study. He obtained Optional Practical Training, which lasts only 12 months but can be extended 24 months in a science, technology, engineering or math field.

While working on OPT for his employer, Goldman Sachs, the company entered Owusu-Asare's name in the annual H-1B lottery. The effort proved unsuccessful. In recent years, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services selected only about one in four applicants or registrants. The annual H-1B limit of 65,000, plus an exemption of 20,000 for graduate degree holders from U.S. universities, is low, equaling only about 0.05% of the U.S. labor force. ""Some people get lucky in the lottery, but I was one of the unlucky ones,"" he said.

Goldman Sachs wanted to retain Owusu-Asare and gave him the opportunity to work for the company in London. After more than three years at Goldman Sachs, he took an opportunity to become chief technology officer at Esusu, a successful startup company founded by an African international student.

Wemimo Abbey, an international student from Nigeria, cofounded Esusu in 2018. Esusu, with a headquarters in New York, is valued at $1 billion. The company ""helps renters build their credit histories and scores for free by reporting on-time rent payments to credit bureaus."" One-quarter of the billion-dollar startup companies in the United States have a founder who first came to America as an international student, according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis.

Finding niches in the global economy may include finding a job that provides services internationally or even starting a company that serves the international market. Many businesses begin after an entrepreneur sees a problem that the marketplace has failed to solve. That was the case with Albert Owusu-Asare. While working at Esusu, Owusu-Asare discovered that diverse laws and banking rules challenge companies attempting to manage workers in other countries.

In 2021, Owusu-Asare and his former Grinnell classmate Ameer Shujjah founded Cadana, which provides several functions for employers trying to pay employees and contractors working in other nations. ""Pay compliantly to millions of local banks, mobile money accounts, and e-wallets in Africa, Latin America and Asia,"" is how Cadana describes its payment platform.

To manage the company in the United States, Owusu-Asare, Cadana's CEO, obtained an O-1 visa for ""individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics."" (O-1 visa filings have expanded since the Biden administration issued new guidance in January 2022.) An attorney has applied for a green card for Owusu-Asare through the employment-based immigration system.

The company recently hired U.S. citizens in New York and Maryland and now pays their customers' workers in more than 30 countries. Cadana navigates for clients the foreign rules and government regulations that can trip businesses and frustrate workers who want to be paid on time. The company's platform and mission seek to align business needs with the desire of talented people to participate in the global economy. ""We're running the company pretty lean and close to profitability,"" said Owusu-Asare. ""So, it's been a successful journey so far.""

America remains a country that offers excellent opportunities. The small number of H-1B temporary visas allowed each year limits those opportunities for international students. Still, Albert Owusu-Asare's experience shows that finding niches in the global economy can be a path to success."
Forget Tech Volatility: 'Go Global' With This Steady 8.1% Payer,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/10/01/forget-tech-volatility-go-global-with-this-steady-81-payer/,2024-10-01T14:23:08Z,"Closed-end funds (CEFs), with an average yield of around 8%, are terrific for just about any investor -- especially those looking to their portfolios to help pay the bills.

Heck, even if you're not leaning on your CEFs for income, those big payouts are gold -- you just reinvest them to boost your portfolio's value and book an even bigger income stream going forward.

But of course, not all CEFs are great investments, with some best avoided unless they trade at big discounts to net asset value, or NAV, the key indicator of value for these funds. And sometimes even a great fund isn't the best one to buy, despite a big yield and an impressive record.

That's the situation with two CEFs that many income investors love: the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Income Fund (ETG) and Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK).

Both have their merits, starting with their payouts: ETG yields 8.1% and STK pays a solid 5.6% as I write this. But in today's market, one fund is clearly the better buy, and it's all about what lies beneath those dividends.

With that in mind, let's stack these two solid funds up and see how they compare, starting with ...

ETG makes a splash early in our matchup with a portfolio that's incredibly well-diversified, with exposure to sectors like financials, consumer staples, energy and, yes, the sector everyone's talking about today: tech.

The fund focuses on resilient large caps like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), pharma giant AstraZeneca SA and Nestle SA, the latter of which is best known for sweets in North America but makes a range of foods and ingredients you'll find in just about any kitchen.

As just those samples from the fund's top-10 holdings list tell us, ETG also goes beyond the US, where we all know stocks have been on a tear lately, with a bit more than a third of its portfolio overseas.

This level of diversification gives ETG an edge because it spreads risk across the global economy, insulating the fund from the volatility of any single sector or from another big turn in the US stock market.

And the roughly 12% of the portfolio in fixed-income investments (mainly investment-grade bonds) adds even more ballast. It helps support that big dividend, too.

Now let's switch over to STK, whose portfolio is in many ways the opposite:

You can clearly see that almost all of the categories in the table above are tech-related. The fund's top holdings read like a who's who of the tech elite and include Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research Corp. (LRCX).

These are all great companies, but when tech hits a rough patch, STK feels the brunt of it. NVIDIA's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is now over 70, highlights the risk here, reflecting how pricey some of these stocks are.

When tech goes up, STK soars -- but when tech stumbles, like it has recently, STK's performance suffers. Then there's the volatility.

Don't get me wrong. STK has performed strongly over the long term, with a five-year annualized return of 17.6%. But the flipside is clear: This is a high-risk, high-reward play. That's not ideal for income-focused investors looking for steady, reliable payouts -- especially when we look at the price you'll pay for STK now.

As I write this, ETG trades at a 10.4% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), so you can buy its portfolio for quite a bit less than it's worth.

This kind of deal is what we love to see in CEFs -- it sets you up for upside and provides a margin of safety in case the market wobbles (since the fund is already cheap, it's harder for it to get a lot cheaper).

In contrast, STK trades at a slight premium to NAV. In other words, you're paying more for a portfolio of tech stocks that's already trading at higher prices. With the tech sector well-known for its volatility, paying a premium doesn't make sense, especially when we can get ETG at a discount and lock in a higher yield at the same time.

Over the past decade, ETG has proven itself as a steady performer, delivering a 9.1% annualized return. That's impressive, especially for a diversified income fund that's built to withstand the market's ups and downs.

ETG's ability to provide consistent returns across various sectors gives it an edge when the market gets choppy. And choppiness is very much on the table after 2024's outsized stock-market gains, especially in the tech sector.

This also means STK is like a rollercoaster just at the top of a peak. Sure, its annualized return of 17.6% over the last five years looks fantastic on paper, but that's largely because it's been riding the wave of tech's explosive growth.

While STK has a portfolio perfect for those willing to ride the tech waves, ETG is simply the better buy for income investors now. Its 8.1% yield, combined with a double-digit discount to NAV and a diversified portfolio, make it a safer, more consistent play for those of us who prefer to sleep soundly at night while collecting reliable dividends."
"What To Know About JD Vance's Policy Views -- On Abortion, Economy, Immigration And More -- Before Tonight's VP Debate",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/01/what-to-know-about-jd-vances-policy-views-on-abortion-economy-immigration-and-more-before-tonights-vp-debate/,2024-10-01T14:19:54Z,"Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, will likely be asked about his opinions on abortion and other major policy issues when he faces off against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at Tuesday's vice presidential debate, amid controversy surrounding his stances since being named as former President Donald Trump's running mate over the summer.

Vance told The New York Times in February that his populist economic vision can be described as ""applying as much upward pressure on wages and as much downward pressure on the services that the people use as possible."" The senator said he supports raising the minimum wage as an incentive to get workers back in the workforce -- and has co-sponsored legislation to raise it -- and other government intervention to boost industries, like providing subsidies or tax credits. He does not support more stringent government regulations on private businesses, however, telling The Times that to boost the economy, ""there's a lot you can do on the regulatory side -- make building nuclear facilities easier, make building natural gas pipelines easier, make building housing easier -- that doesn't cost money and in fact brings in money."" Vance also supports tariffs that impose taxes on foreign goods, saying that while that can result in higher prices, ""when you are forced to do more with your domestic labor force, you have all of these positive dynamic effects."" He told The Times that while he wouldn't want to raise taxes on middle class Americans, he isn't necessarily opposed to raising taxes on the wealthy, but asked, ""How much revenue does that actually raise?"" Vance is also a big proponent of cryptocurrency, holding bitcoin himself and drafting legislation that would help the cryptocurrency industry.

Vance told The Times he supports Social Security, saying, ""I don't know why people think that you solve many problems by taking a bunch of elderly people and saying, 'You're on your own.'"" The senator suggested he believes in raising more money for the program through a combination of tariffs and bolstering the American labor force, arguing that if more Americans are working rather than relying on public assistance, it would mean more money can go toward Social Security.

Vance has been widely criticized for his views on abortion. In 2022 he said he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally"" and opposed the idea that pregnant people could simply cross state lines to obtain an abortion if the state where they reside banned the procedure. He has also compared abortion to slavery, saying in 2021, ""While the people who obviously suffer the most are those subjected to it, I think it has this morally distorting effect on the entire society."" The senator was part of a broader group of GOP lawmakers who asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to enforce the Comstock Act in 2023, a long-dormant law from the 19th century that would ban the mailing of anything related to abortion. While the letter specifically asked to stop the mailing of abortion pills, experts have suggested the law could be interpreted more broadly to ban the mailing of abortion-related equipment altogether, which would effectively ban the procedure in practice by ensuring physicians can't get the necessary materials to perform it. Vance has more recently downplayed his former support for restricting abortion and endorsed Trump's view of leaving the issue up to the states.

Vance has echoed Trump in calling for mass deportations of immigrants from the U.S. and criticized the Biden administration for allowing an influx of undocumented immigrants. He also helped spread false rumors against Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, and disapproved of the Biden administration extending temporary legal protections to Haitian migrants. The senator has denounced using immigrants for cheaper labor in the U.S., saying business owners should instead increase incentives to lure American workers.

Vance has perhaps garnered the most attention for his attacks on childless Americans, with comments resurfacing from 2021 in which he complained about Democrats being ""childless cat ladies"" who ""want to make the rest of the country miserable too"" and don't have a ""direct stake"" in the country's future. While Vance has claimed his comments were a joke, they do reflect his broader views, as the senator has pushed policies that would incentivize people to have children and benefit families. He has suggested there should be a higher tax rate for childless adults and even said in 2021 parents should have more voting power than voters without children, and has touted a policy in Hungary that provides loans to married couples and then forgives those loans if the couple has children. Vance has supported ""universal childbirth"" policies that would provide healthcare coverage for childbirth, though he has opposed ""universal childcare"" proposals, which he said in 2021 are a ""massive subsidy to the lifestyle preferences of the affluent over the preferences of the middle and working class."" He has also supported expanding child tax credits for low-income families, but has been criticized for missing a Senate vote on the issue. The senator made comments in 2021 suggesting he was against no-fault divorce -- though he did not explicitly call for repealing it -- claiming that ""children suffered"" because of more relaxed views around divorce and calling for a return to viewing marriage as ""sacred"" in order to preserve American families.

Vance has deep ties to the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank spearheading the controversial Project 2025 policy agenda proposing an extreme overhaul of the executive branch should Trump win the election. The senator authored the introduction to Heritage president Kevin Roberts' forthcoming book -- which calls for a ""second American Revolution"" and says ""it's time to circle the wagons and load the muskets"" -- and has long been allied with the organization, with Roberts telling Politico in March Vance is ""absolutely going to be one of the leaders -- if not the leader -- of our movement."" Prior to joining Congress, Vance penned the introduction to a Heritage Foundation report that endorses many of the policies also mentioned in Project 2025, promoting heterosexual nuclear families and decrying abortion and public assistance programs. He has also expressed support for a key pillar of the Project 2025 agenda, which calls for replacing career civil servants with political appointees. Vance has not explicitly endorsed Project 2025, however, particularly as the Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from its proposals. He said in July, prior to becoming Trump's running mate, that he thinks ""there's some good ideas in"" Project 2025's policy blueprint, but it also has ""some things I disagree with.""

LGBTQ+ advocacy groups criticized Vance's nomination as Trump's running mate due to his record on LGBTQ+ rights. As a senator, Vance introduced legislation opposing transgender rights, authoring bills that would classify gender-affirming care for minors as a felony and ban ""X"" from being used as a neutral gender designation on U.S. passports. Vance also said in 2022 he would vote no on legislation to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, and has voiced support for policies like Florida's law known as ""Don't Say Gay,"" which restrict what schools can say about sexual orientation and gender identity.

Vance is one of the GOP lawmakers who has vocally opposed providing additional aid to Ukraine, and has come under fire for saying in 2022 that he ""do[esn't] really care what happens to"" the eastern European country. The senator called at the Republican National Convention for the U.S.'s allies to ""share in the burden of securing world peace,"" saying there should be ""no more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,"" and told The Times in June the U.S. ""should be dealing with other countries based on whether they're good or bad for America's interests."" He criticized the Biden administration's Ukraine policy to The Times, saying the U.S. was not sufficiently working to deter China from invading Taiwan because ""we're sending all the damn weapons to Ukraine,"" though also acknowledged that handling the situation in Ukraine means ""there's going to have to be some American security assistance over the long term."" Vance also agreed that Russia gaining control of Ukraine is ""is not in our interest."" The senator has expressed strong support for Israel in its war against Hamas, saying at a rally on Saturday that his peace plan is ""elect Donald Trump"" and suggesting he aligns with Trump's view that ""the only way to get to peace is to destroy Hamas and let Israel finish the job.""

Vance's views stand in stark contrast to Democratic rival Walz, who has championed progressive policies including abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights and opposing climate changes. Walz is a gun owner but is strongly in favor of gun control measures like universal background checks and banning bump stocks, in contrast to Vance, whom the National Rifle Association described as ""a true Second Amendment champion"" and has opposed gun control reforms. As governor of Minnesota, Walz has signed bills into law that include free meals for school children, expanded protections for workers, restoring voting rights for the formerly incarcerated, climate change initiatives and legalizing marijuana, among other measures. Like Vance, Walz supports expanding the child tax credit, and he helped enact a nation-leading $1,750 tax credit in Minnesota after a federal tax credit expired. Walz's administration also eliminated many beneficiaries' income taxes on Social Security benefits, which Trump has also called for.

While Vance's economic philosophy has a strong emphasis on bolstering the American worker, the senator has come under fire from the left for his mixed record on supporting labor unions. Though Vance made headlines for visiting striking United Auto Workers union members on the picket line, the senator opposed the PRO Act that would have strengthened protections for unionized workers and codified the collective bargaining process. He told Politico in March that he opposed the legislation in part because he favors a system where industries negotiate union deals, rather than individual workplaces or companies, and because he ""think[s] it's dumb to hand over a lot of power to a union leadership that is aggressively anti-Republican.""

Vance has reached across the aisle for several of his efforts in Congress, working with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, on a bill to improve rail safety standards after the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on legislation regarding banking regulations. The vice presidential candidate told Politico in March that his wariness of big corporations often aligns him with progressive Democrats even as he disagrees with them on other issues, saying, ""If you look at the people that I've worked with most successfully, it's people who, even though they're from the left, recognize that something's pretty fundamentally broken about American society."" Warren, for example, is ""at least thinking deeply about what's going on in the country and why things seem to be going off the rails,"" Vance said. In his June interview with The Times, Vance said ""Bernie Bros"" are the group on the left ""whose politics I'm open to,"" while criticizing ""center-left liberals who are doing very well,"" arguing them and their center-right counterparts ""have an incredible blind spot about how much their success is built on a system that is not serving people who they should be serving.""

34.7%. That's the average number of U.S. adults who have a favorable view of Vance as of Monday, according to a compilation of polls by FiveThirtyEight, versus 45.7% of Americans who have a negative view of him. Polling suggests the Ohio senator is the least popular non-incumbent vice presidential candidate in at least the past 20 years, according to FiveThirtyEight."
"Panama Is Paradise For Rainforests, Wildlife, And Potential Partners",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2024/10/01/panama-is-paradise-for-rainforests-wildlife-and-potential-partners/,2024-10-01T14:00:01Z,"During my eight-day visit to Panama in September, the Minister of Environment, Juan Carlos Navarro, described his country as a ""little paradise"" where the continents of North and South America meet. Panama is a 480-mile-long strip of land, known as the isthmus, that extends from Costa Rica to Colombia, separating the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Panama is carbon-negative because its rainforests absorb more CO2 than its economy emits. Despite its efforts to preserve its trees, it has suffered from the effects of climate change. In 2023, the country experienced a drought that decreased the water levels of the Panama Canal, resulting in a $1 billion revenue loss. Scientists worldwide believe that the use of fossil fuels is worsening the greenhouse effect, leading to intense warming, extreme climate events, and longer dry spells.

""Even though we are victims of climate change, we have an ambitious climate agenda,"" Minister Navarro told me. ""We are losing the planet, and won't achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement"" -- to limit temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050. ""The only way to stop climate change is to involve the private and philanthropic sectors to deploy clean energy, electric mobility, conservation, and protection initiatives in Panama. There are tons of investments that private companies can make to generate financial returns.""

For example, Navarro founded Panama's Solar Energy Association, which has 62 companies building solar farms and investing in electric vehicle chargers. Panama is considered a developed country, driven mainly by the Panama Canal, which earns about $6 billion yearly and attracts companies such as Maersk and Proctor & Gamble. The Panama Canal Authority pays the government about $2.5 billion yearly.

The Panama Canal is a conduit for 6% of the global maritime traffic. It is amid Panama's rainforests covering 68% of its land or nearly 12.7 million acres -- natural CO2 vacuums. Roughly 32 ships pass through each day, taking 8-10 hours. It's one of the seven ""Wonders of the World.""

The country's gross domestic product is $76.5 billion, growing by 4% to 5% yearly. It is based on banking, insurance, container ports, medical, and tourism. Renewable electricity, mainly hydro, accounts for 80% of its electricity portfolio.

Without ample rainfall, the canal suffers the consequences. The forests act as a sponge, feeding two lakes that fill the locks and allow ships to pass through. Panama safeguards its trees, home to indigenous peoples as well as biodiversity and precious wildlife. I visited a few of the islands and saw various kinds of monkeys and bats.

Moreover, Panama just signed the High Seas Treaty to protect the ocean and its biodiversity. Roughly 60 other nations endorsed it.

""This is a perfect example of sustainable development,"" says Navarro, referring to the Panama Canal and the country's environmental strategies. ""Without this, the economies of the United States and Asia would suffer"" because the supply chains would get cut off. ""This would be an economic catastrophe.""

Climate change risks Panama, its natural wonders, and the global community. I spoke with Andres Diaz, a fellow for the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and a paleontologist who studies fossils. He explained that CO2 levels are now at 423 parts per million, and we risk hitting 500 parts per million by 2050. Since the Industrial Revolution began 200 years ago, CO2 levels have escalated, causing temperature increases of 1.2 degrees Celsius.

He studies plants and pollen, analyzing rainforest sediments using artificial intelligence to discover prior warmer periods. The study of fossils helps to understand and predict the future of the Amazon. Some analyses suggest that the rainforest's diversity will enable it to survive, while others indicate that it will transform into a savanna or grassy land. This modification would have a significant impact on the Amazon's freshwater reservoir.

Trees and plants take in water and release it into the atmosphere, delivering it worldwide. ""If the freshwater reservoir changes, we will have longer dry seasons and more trouble everywhere,"" says Diaz.

Therefore, the most advanced countries should not take Panama's treasures for granted. Last year, Panamanians protested the expansion of a Canadian copper mine -- the most significant display of public outrage since the people challenged General Manuel Noriega's military dictatorship in 1987. They feared that expanded exploration would displace indigenous populations and negate efforts to preserve the rainforests and keep CO2 releases in check.

Panama's Supreme Court sided with the protestors, saying that biodiversity and ecosystems remain paramount. However, this fight continues as Canada's First Quantum Minerals is appealing to an international court, arguing it paid Panama more than half a billion dollars.

""Panamanians are becoming more aware of the importance of nature in their lives, and this is a positive development,"" Minister Navarro says. ""I have dedicated my life to this cause. We are committed to promoting sustainable development for companies that contribute to our economy without harming the environment.""

The world's most developed economies contribute at least 80% of global CO2 emissions, while the poorest nations make up 1% to 3%. The most significant sticking point at climate negotiations is about how the major economies will compensate the less developed ones; South America, Asia, and Africa have sizable rainforests absorbing CO2.

Panama seeks international partnerships -- corporate or philanthropic investors who will bet on its future. Preserving its rainforest is a priority, which keeps its economy purring along with global commerce. But attracting risk-takers and benefactors is a high-stakes venture.

""We are in a great logistical area, but we have not linked that to other assets such as our forests and biodiversity,"" said Mirei Heras, former environmental minister for Panama, during dinner. ""And there is competition from various countries also aiming to attract funds. However, our location, along with our forests and their ability to reduce emissions, is a win-win strategy that could enable us to prosper.""

The Isthmus of Panama is celestial, offering maritime transportation, lush rainforests, and wetlands harboring diverse biodiversity and wildlife. But climate change is an omnipresent threat. Therefore, Panama strives to draw sustainable economic development with partners that could earn financial returns and environmental rewards.

Reporter's Note: This story is the first part in a three-part weekly series. The second story will focus on the symbiotic relationship between the rainforests and the Panama Canal. The third one will examine how to assess rainforest preservation using artificial intelligence and satellites -- information that could be shared globally at no expense to developing nations."
Driving Into The Future: Exciting Career Paths In The Autonomous Vehicle Industry,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/10/01/driving-into-the-future-exciting-career-paths-in-the-autonomous-vehicle-industry/,2024-10-01T13:45:58Z,"The rise of autonomous vehicles is not just transforming our means of transportation, but it is also creating a new ecosystem of job opportunities at the intersection of traditional automotive expertise and cutting-edge technology.

While job displacement is top of mind for today's workers, a report by the Chamber of Progress, a trade association that advocates for technology firms on matters related to self-driving cars, revealed a promising job market on the horizon for the AV industry.

The study, conducted by consultancies Steer and Fourth Economy, projects that the deployment of self-driving vehicles in the United States could create up to nearly half a million jobs over the next 15 years. The report estimates that for every 1,000 autonomous vehicles produced and deployed annually, approximately 190 workers will be needed for manufacturing and servicing.

The growth in employment will encompass a wide range of sectors. These include roles in production, distribution, maintenance, upgrades and repairs. Additionally, there will be a demand for software engineers specializing in machine learning and simulation, hardware engineers developing sensors and systems, research scientists working to advance autonomous driving technology and operations professionals managing vehicle deployments.

Moreover, careers in this field offer interdisciplinary collaboration, where engineers, data scientists, designers and policy experts come together to tackle complex challenges. This collaborative environment not only nurtures professional development, but also positions workers at the apex of groundbreaking innovations.

Workers in the AV space will have the chance to shape the future of mobility by contributing to initiatives that improve road safety, enhance accessibility and develop sustainable transportation solutions.

The development and deployment of driverless vehicles is currently being led by three major players: Waymo, Cruise and Tesla -- among others.

Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, has been a pioneer in the field since its inception as Google's self-driving car project in 2009. The company has developed the Waymo Driver, a comprehensive autonomous driving platform that has enabled the world's first fully driverless commercial ride-hailing service.

Cruise, backed by General Motors, is another key player in the AV industry, focusing on developing and deploying self-driving taxis in urban environments. Both companies leverage a multi-sensor system including LiDAR, radar and cameras, combined with high-definition maps to navigate pre-mapped areas.

Tesla, in contrast, pursues a vision-only approach using cameras and neural networks, aiming for a more scalable solution that can potentially work anywhere.

According to the Chamber of Progress, 82% of workers in the AV industry make more than the U.S. median wage. Additionally, many of these well-paying positions are available to individuals who do not have a college degree.

By pursuing these emerging career opportunities, prospective candidates can position themselves at the forefront of a rapidly evolving industry:

Companies like Vay offer ""teledriving"" services, where remote operators control vehicles from a distance. This role combines elements of traditional driving with technical skills, creating a new category of employment.

As autonomous fleets grow, there's an increasing need for specialists who can maintain and service these high-tech vehicles.

The autonomous driving industry requires experts who can process and improve high-definition maps, as well as develop and maintain advanced sensor technologies. These roles are crucial for enhancing the perception and navigation capabilities of self-driving vehicles.

The core of autonomous driving technology relies on sophisticated AI systems. There's a growing demand for engineers who can develop and refine the algorithms that power self-driving cars.

With the complex regulatory landscape surrounding AVs, there's a need for professionals who can navigate safety standards and ensure compliance with evolving legislation.

As the interface between humans and AVs evolves, there's a need for designers who can create intuitive and user-friendly experiences for passengers interacting with these new transportation systems."
Dubai Tourism BrandVoice: Dubai's Visa Solutions Attract The Global Yachting Community,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dubai-tourism/2024/10/01/dubais-visa-solutions-attract-the-global-yachting-community/,2024-10-01T13:20:32Z,"The range of visa options introduced as part of the U.A.E.'s wider tourism strategy is a boon for the yachting industry, offering international visitors seamless procedures and ease of access.

The rise in global wealth has fueled the appetite for luxury assets among ultra-high net worth individuals. In addition to investing in luxury homes, cars, watches and art, these affluent consumers are also driving yacht sales globally. Yacht ownership now spans from wealthy retired Baby Boomers to Millennials, especially those who have amassed their fortunes in tech. Today's yacht owners are on average 10 to 15 years younger than they were two decades ago. According to industry experts, Millennials are poised to become the primary buyers of superyachts in the coming years.

These trends have led to a growing fleet of superyachts -- vessels over 30 meters in length. Currently, there are about 5,700 superyachts in operation worldwide, according to SuperYacht Times. On average, around 150 superyachts are built each year, with a total value exceeding EUR 4 billion (US$4.4 billion). The yachting economy is projected to continue expanding.

Dubai is well-positioned to capture this growing market, thanks to its world-class maritime infrastructure, continued development of state-of-the-art facilities, strategic location and excellent climate. Its 5,000 berths across 22 marinas can accommodate a wide range of vessels, from pleasure craft and luxury yachts to gigayachts. Additionally, the city's live-work-play lifestyle has attracted global attention, including from the yachting community.

As part of its economic roadmap for the decade up to 2033, Dubai aims to be the best city to visit, live and work in. To achieve this, the emirate has introduced various visa options designed to attract international visitors, encourage long-term residency and foster business opportunities.

Tourist, crew and special yacht tourism visas cater to the specific needs of international yacht visitors docking in Dubai. These visas, such as the six-month renewable cruising permit and six-month multi-entry crew visa for all nationalities, are designed to ensure seamless entry for yacht owners, crews and passengers, allowing them to explore the city at their leisure.

Meanwhile, the virtual working visa is a one-year residency ideal for those working remotely, while the five-year multiple-entry visa enables tourists to enter the U.A.E multiple times and remain in the country for 90 days each time. Visas on arrival are also available for visitors from over 87 countries.

The coveted golden visa is designed for high net worth entrepreneurs, investors and highly skilled professionals, allowing them a 10-year residency anywhere in the U.A.E. This visa opens up new opportunities for investors and gives them the ability to sponsor their family members, enabling them to plan for the long term.

""The 10-year residency offers long-term security without the hassle of frequent renewals, allowing me to fully concentrate on growing my yacht management business. It has also given me peace of mind to focus on long-term business goals and investments, knowing that I have a stable base here in Dubai,"" says Ian Harris, CEO of PHOENIX Yacht Management LLC.

Harris received his golden visa in 2022 and moved to Dubai with his family from the United Kingdom. ""Relocating to Dubai was an easy decision for me, given the city's visionary approach to business and lifestyle. I saw Dubai as a relatively untapped yet highly promising market for large superyacht management,"" he says. ""While Europe has a well-established contingent of yacht management companies, there is a clear gap in the Middle East. The U.A.E, and Dubai in particular, has the infrastructure, luxury market and global connectivity that make it the ideal location to launch and grow this kind of venture, especially given the region's increasing appeal to high net worth individuals and luxury yacht owners,"" Harris adds.

The economic freedom that Dubai provides businesses is a major draw for global companies seeking to establish a local presence in the region. Camper & Nicholsons International (C&N), one of the oldest yachting companies in the world, opened its proprietary office in Dubai in 2022.

""We have many clients across the GCC and have been considering investing locally for many years,"" says Giovanni Alessi Anghini, Managing Director for Camper & Nicholsons Yacht Services FZE, and Chief Innovation and Technology Officer for Camper & Nicholsons International. Anghini moved to Dubai from Italy in 2021 for personal reasons, which provided C&N the opportunity to leverage his relocation and officially establish an office in the region. He received his golden visa in 2023.

""Our local presence allows us to manage relationships with our existing clients and connect with new ones, including yacht owners and family offices that have recently relocated their operations here. While they may not necessarily keep their vessels in Dubai or the region, they spend their winters here,"" Anghini says.

Dubai is the perfect jumping-off point for yachting enthusiasts looking to explore the wider region. Dubai's strong international air connectivity, both commercial and private, makes it an ideal gateway for yacht owners and their guests traveling to and from their vessels. The proposed GCC unified tourist visa will pave the way for increased regional connectivity, enabling yacht owners and their guests to explore not only Dubai and the wider U.A.E. but also other GCC countries, including Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

This initiative is expected to be rolled out by the end of 2024. It aims to drive a cohesive regional effort to position the Middle East as a leading global tourism destination and, ultimately, to further deepen economic integration within the region.

As the yachting industry in Dubai continues to flourish, these visa solutions will significantly benefit the city as a superyacht capital. Harris says, ""Dubai's innovative visa options, particularly the golden visa, have played a crucial role in the growth of the yachting industry. These long-term residency options provide the stability and confidence for yacht owners to base their vessels in Dubai, knowing they have security and a strategic location.""

He adds, ""The marinas in Dubai serve as hubs for a range of complementary businesses, from luxury retail and hospitality to yacht maintenance and charter services. This creates a thriving ecosystem around superyachts and the yachting community, spurring further development of related businesses. With these attractions and continuous investments in infrastructure, Dubai is positioning itself as a global destination for large superyachts and luxury lifestyle experiences, further boosting the regional yachting market."""
Fox News Power Rankings: Trump maintains lead on 2 top issues ahead of VP debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/power-rankings-trump-maintains-lead-two-top-issues-ahead-vp-debate,2024-10-01T13:08:36Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance are hours away from the first and only vice presidential debate.

As the latest Fox News Power Rankings reveal, Vance starts the evening with a lead on the economy and immigration, while Walz has an advantage on abortion.

Vice presidential hopefuls do not attract as much attention as their bosses when they debate, but as Fox News' Arnon Mishkin argued Monday, they have changed the direction of at least six elections in the last 50 years.

In most cases, these debates are won on policy. Voters are not as familiar with these nominees as they are with former President Donald Trump or even Vice President Kamala Harris, and they do not need to make their choice.

The smart play for these vice presidential candidates is to focus on the major issues at stake and how their administrations would solve them.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS TICKS UP AND SENATE REPUBLICANS TAKE CHARGE

That is especially true for Walz on the economy and immigration, since the Harris campaign continues to lag on those issues. Vance, meanwhile, has struggled with poor favorability ratings, so his challenge is to hammer the popular parts of the Trump agenda and avoid wading into the culture war trenches.

There are also style points up for grabs. Many voters will only ever see this debate in short clips on social media, so acting like a policy wonk is less likely than ever to get the job done.

Trump continues to hold an advantage on two of the top three issues in this campaign. He leads on the economy by nine points and immigration by 11.

Those numbers have barely budged since Harris and Trump debated. In August, when the Power Rankings last looked at the major issues, the former president led on the economy by eight and immigration by 13.

Harris is far out in front on abortion. She leads by 17 points on that issue, also a negligible movement since the last tracker (Harris +18).

This tracker includes polls from Fox News, Quinnipiac, CNN/SSRS, NBC News and the New York Times/Siena.

Trump lost a point in the horse race after his debate with Harris while the vice president gained one; these modest shifts mirrored those after the first debate in 2020.

Together, these results suggest that the cause of Trump's slight decline was style rather than substance.

Conversely, while Harris won the debate and held on to her advantage on abortion, she has not consistently closed the issues gap, particularly on immigration.

That is not ideal for her, given the economy (38%) and immigration (17%) are two of the top three issues for voters. A recent Fox News national survey showed those issues and abortion (16%) were the only three that a double-digit percentage of voters called their ""most important"" issue in deciding their vote.

According to the same survey, Harris has strong leads in issues outside the top three. That includes health care, helping the middle class and climate change. These are ""bread and butter"" issues that the left has relied on to drag out base voters in previous elections.

The Democratic candidate also has a lead in uniting the country and, as consistent with previous trackers, having the right temperament for the job.

The candidates are evenly divided on national security. Neither has an advantage in handling a crisis that puts the country at risk, being commander in chief or decisions about using nuclear weapons. Trump's temperament deficit should give Harris an opportunity to lead on some of these qualities, but that has not materialized.

ARNON MISHKIN: JD VANCE IS AN EXCELLENT DEBATER AND PRACTICES FOR THE DEBATE EVERY SUNDAY

Finally, voters prefer Trump on foreign policy. He has a six-point lead in handling the Israel/Hamas war and an eight-point lead on the Ukraine/Russia war.

Tuesday is debate night. Walz and Vance will face off at an event hosted by CBS News in New York City. Fox News will simulcast the debate with special coverage anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum at 8:20 p.m. ET.

Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate to be moderated by MacCallum and Baier in October.

Voters can now cast a ballot in more than half of all states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina.

"TM Global BrandVoice: Bridging Markets, Enhancing Global Connectivity",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tm-global/2024/10/01/bridging-markets-enhancing-global-connectivity/,2024-10-01T12:57:26Z,"TM Global serves as a strategic partner for content providers and hyperscalers in the U.S. seeking to expand their global footprint and enhance their services in Southeast Asia

With a population of over 600 million and a rising middle class, Southeast Asia holds tremendous opportunities for content providers, hyperscalers and other digital players. About 70-80% of the region's adult population are Internet users, while 50-60% regularly purchase digital products and services.

The digital economy in Southeast Asia is steadily growing and projected to reach US$1 trillion by 2030. The online media market, which includes video-on-demand services, online gaming, advertising and music streaming platforms, is expected to hit US$34 billion by the end of 2025.

To capitalize on the immense growth opportunities in the region, content providers such as music and video streaming platforms, gaming companies and hyperscalers -- businesses that require large-scale data centers and cloud infrastructure -- are partnering telecommunications and technology companies to expand their market reach into this highly competitive region.

Headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, TM Global, the domestic and international wholesale business arm of TM, is an infrastructure-based business that delivers cutting-edge connectivity and digital solutions, leveraging its extensive global connectivity and network infrastructure.

TM Global has regional offices in key locations worldwide, catering to the needs of organizations in major centers, including the U.S. (TMUS). This is among TM Global's six regional offices that includes Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai, Australia and UK.

TMUS established its first U.S. office in Washington D.C. in 2000. In 2014, it strategically expanded closer to the Silicon Valley by opening an office in San Francisco. This move provided opportunities for TM Global to work closely with leading hyperscalers, tech partners and over-the-top (OTT) players who are expanding their presence and services into Southeast Asia.

TMUS delivers a comprehensive range of solutions from connectivity to content delivery, and platform services. It also provides hosting services via its six data centers in Malaysia and one in Hong Kong, positioning its facilities as carrier-neutral and highly reliable hubs. These data centers are supported by TM Global's extensive global submarine cable systems spanning over 340,000km (211,266 miles), connecting Southeast Asia to greater Asia, the Middle East, Europe and the U.S.

""Our expansive network and extensive range of platform solutions uniquely position us to empower U.S. businesses seeking to capitalize on the burgeoning market opportunities in Southeast Asia. We aim to become the preferred partner for global digital infrastructure projects, providing seamless connectivity between the two regions,"" says Khairul Liza Ibrahim, Executive Vice President of TM Global.

Most recently, TM Global partnered Nxera, another leading telecommunications provider in the Southeast Asia region, to develop an advanced, AI-ready data center in Johor, Malaysia. This joint, hyperconnected data center will drive development of the region's digital ecosystem, enabling real-time information sharing that will benefit businesses of all sizes, while nurturing future digital talents.

When it comes to delivering seamless, low-latency content, hyperscalers and content providers must decide on their data hosting strategy. Typically, there are two options: setting up data centers in the targeted region, which is a capital-intensive model, or adopting an operating expenditure model by partnering with a strategic partner in that region.

Should they opt to set up their own data centers, there are several challenges that may arise. It is important to secure a reliable and uninterrupted power supply, to ensure continuous operation and data safety. This requires robust infrastructure and often backup systems to mitigate power outages. Finding the right location and obtaining approvals from local authorities can also be challenging, which may delay timelines.

Another key challenge they could face is retaining talent. While Southeast Asia boasts a highly skilled workforce, the competition for top talent is fierce. Key stakeholders, including governments and private sectors, are continuously working to grow digital talent pools.

Considering these challenges and the demands to scale quickly, partnering with established telecommunications companies such as TM Global is often a more viable option in entering this dynamic region.

Engaging a strategic telecommunications partner can help content providers and hyperscalers deliver low-latency, high-bandwidth content and reduce data bottlenecks to enhance user experience. TM Global's Edge services efficiently address these challenges, enabling content providers to bring their content closer to end users and processing data closer to its source, thereby ensuring high-quality digital experiences.

U.S. enterprises can also take advantage of TM Global's Platform-as-a-Service (""PaaS"") solutions, infrastructure and support to provide seamless content distribution across Southeast Asia. To better serve the entertainment and gaming industries, TM Global has expanded its TMUS operations to Los Angeles and Las Vegas, strategically positioning its offices closer to these key markets.

""The opening of two new offices in Los Angeles and Las Vegas demonstrates our dedication to provide best-in-class solutions and services to content providers and hyperscalers in that dynamic market. While our commitment to enhance connectivity infrastructure remains unwavering, we are also driving value for our stakeholders through continuous innovation to better serve the entertainment and gaming industries,"" Khairul Liza explains.

To date, TM Global works with more than 160 partners world-wide. This is a testament of its commitment to excellence and dedication to delivering innovative and sustainable solutions, marking a pivotal step in TM's aspiration to become a Digital Powerhouse by 2030."
Walz's debate performance expectations lowered ahead of showdown with Vance: 'Still largely untested',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/walzs-debate-performance-expectations-lowered-ahead-showdown-vance-still-largely-untested,2024-10-01T12:55:37Z,"A 'Fox News Live' political panel provided its expectations ahead of the vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz, as well as its views on the border issue.

Some Democratic allies of Gov. Tim Walz are concerned about how he will fare in the vice presidential debate between him and Sen. JD Vance, worrying that the Minnesota governor remains untested.

""We've never seen him on the national scale before,"" a Minnesota Democrat told Politico. The outlet reported that Vance hasn't been tested in a scenario like a debate, where he will face direct questioning and attacks from the other side.

Walz and Vance are set to clash on Tuesday during the first vice presidential debate, which will be moderated by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan.

""He can be very: 'That's it I'm done,'"" a Minnesota state lawmaker told the outlet. Politico reported that Walz shuts down conversations and gets defensive when he's asked to discuss ""missteps"" in private, and it noted Walz was ""still largely untested and has never faced the intense, direct questioning that Vance is sure to launch.""

HARRIS 2024 SENIOR CAMPAIGN ADVISER PREVIEWS UPCOMING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'TWO VERY DIFFERENT VISIONS'

""She did so strong. She's actually made it very difficult for Walz, because I don't see any way that he could match her level of intensity and humor,"" another ally of the Minnesota governor said, noting Vice President Kamala Harris' debate performance against former President Trump that received high media praise.

Harris' inner circle reportedly discussed Walz's habit of being ""gruff and brass,"" Politico reported, while they were vetting him.

According to the outlet, a Minnesota lawmaker recalled Walz saying ""'Alright, I've done all the answering I'm going to do. Meeting's over,'"" when he was asked about questions he didn't want to talk about.

A Democratic lawmaker described a call with Walz in 2020 amid the George Floyd riots, during which Walz reportedly ""signaled he was done with the conversation,"" after he was pressed on why he didn't call the National Guard in sooner.

""I don't think he hung up, but definitely that was it. The call was over,"" the Democratic lawmaker said.

""At times, he could be the exact opposite of what he usually is. That was one of them,"" the person told Politico.

Politico also reported that Walz struggled to explain Harris' economic agenda and kept repeating the words ""opportunity economy."" The report said it came off as vague to those in attendance.

MSNBC's Claire McCaskill, a former Democratic senator, said during an interview on Monday that expectations for the VP debates should be ""lowered.""

""I'm just a little worried about the expectations game at this point. I think people -- yes, J.D. Vance has said some really, I think, disqualifying things about women and how he views people and their role in life. But he will be articulate and he will be prepared and he will be better than Trump was,"" she said.

McCaskill said it would be a ""challenge"" for Walz to be able to counter Vance and ""stay really likable and relatable.""

""I just think we need to lower expectations a little bit, because then we can all be pleasantly surprised if I'm wrong and that Tim Walz just mops the floor with him the same way Kamala Harris mopped the floor with Donald Trump,"" McCaskill added.

Saudi Strategic Shift Raises Specter Of Another Oil Bust,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2024/10/01/saudi-strategic-shift-raises-specter-of-another-oil-bust/,2024-10-01T12:35:52Z,"After several years of relative stability in global crude oil markets, speculation is rising that strategic shifts from Saudi Arabia, OPEC, and the larger OPEC+ oil cartel could presage another period of higher market volatility in the months to come. If it happens, the good times enjoyed by US shale producers since the COVID pandemic could come to a quick end.

OPEC and OPEC+ - a combination of OPEC members, Russia, and other non-OPEC producing countries - have defended crude prices with relative success in recent years. But the ability of these cartels to support a target price floor has diminished during 2024 as rising volumes of crude have entered the market from places like the United States, offshore West Africa, and Guyana.

Saudi Arabia, a cornerstone OPEC member and the cartel's biggest producer, has signaled a notable shift in strategy in recent weeks. The Kingdom has traditionally maintained an unofficial target price of $100 per barrel, aiming to balance high revenue with market stability. However, faced with market dynamics including lower demand forecasts and pressure from other OPEC members, Saudi Arabia has now indicated a readiness to abandon this price target. This strategic pivot became evident recently as Saudi Arabia prepared to increase oil output, aligning with broader OPEC+ decisions to gradually unwind some production cuts starting in December 2024.

In an email, Josephine Mills, analyst at Enverus Intelligence Research EIR), said EIR views ""a potential rollback of production cuts as a recalibration of Saudi Arabia's desired leverage in the market. Doing so today provides allowance for potential cuts in the future. It is not lower prices for longer. Instead, it's lower prices to become stronger in terms of OPEC leverage.""

It must be pointed out that the last time Saudi Arabia sent this 'preservation of market share' signal was in 2014 when they and OPEC flooded the market with millions of barrels of additional crude. That move was in response to the then-nascent boom in US shale oil production coming mainly from the Permian Basin, the Bakken Shale, and the Eagle Ford Shale. Saudi and other OPEC officials at the time saw this US shale oil cutting into their market share and decided to mount a defense.

The result was a dramatically oversupplied market, a supply surplus that some believed reached as high as 8 million barrels of oil per day, and a collapse in crude prices. Over the next two years, more than 200 US shale producers were forced into bankruptcy, creating the worst depression in the domestic oil and gas industry since the mid-1980s. By the end of 2016, Saudi Arabia was coordinating with Russia and other big oil producing countries to form the OPEC+ cartel to raise prices to more economic levels.

This current shift in Saudi sentiment likely reflects a more complex set of factors. First, it probably reflects Saudi Arabia's acknowledgment of the changing global energy landscape, where the demand for oil might not rebound as robustly as once expected, due to shifts towards renewable energy and changes in consumption patterns in China and other major consumers. This move also indicates a tactical retreat from sustaining artificially high prices through production cuts, a hallmark of OPEC and OPEC+ strategy in past years.

Economically, for Saudi Arabia, this could mean immediate revenue implications. The $100 per barrel target was not just about profit but was crucial for funding ambitious domestic projects like NEOM and Vision 2030, which aim to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil dependency. Globally, it could also lead to higher market volatility as the anticipation of increased supply, even if modest, has already shown its impact with oil prices dropping significantly in response to the news.

Mills says EIR anticipates this current strategy shift will create a more modest impact on global markets than seen in 2014. ""EIR assumes in our base case view that OPEC rolls back the cuts by largely following their phase out plan. Due to the current overproduction this only adds ~ 1 MMbbl/d by exit-2025,"" she said. ""If no compensation for the overproduction is completed and cuts are rolled back, our Brent price forecast would be pushed down to $75/bbl for 2025. However, our current assumption is that OPEC will defend prices.""

For US shale producers, the implications are clear: After several years of living in a sweet spot created by focus on cost containment, scaling back drilling programs, and returning capital to investors, the prospect of another potential bust cycle now looms on the horizon. If the Saudi/OPEC/OPEC+ strategy shift is not carefully managed, this era of good feelings in the domestic oil business could come to a fast and painful end."

The bitcoin price has dropped after surging back toward its all-time high of over $70,000 per bitcoin as the market weighs the impact of a China earthquake.

Now, as Elon Musk reveals the details of his secret meeting with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink has warned he thinks the market needs to temper its expectations of Fed interest rate cuts -- while analysts think China's central bank will create ""fireworks"" with a ""tsunami of liquidity.""

""The amount of easing that's in the forward curve is crazy,"" Fink, who's led BlackRock to become the world's largest asset manager looking after $10 trillion on behalf of clients, told Bloomberg on the sidelines of a Berlin conference. ""I do believe there's room for easing more, but not as much as the forward curve would indicate.""

Traders are betting there's a one-in-three chance the Fed will cut another 50 basis points from interest rates at its November meeting, with a further 190 basis points shaved off before the end of 2025.

The market was caught somewhat off guard by the Fed's 50 basis point interest rate cut earlier this month -- its first post-pandemic era reduction -- widely expected to kick off a monetary policy easing cycle that could boost risk-correlated assets such as bitcoin and crypto.

However, Fed chair Jerome Powell played down chances of another 0.5% cut in a speech on Monday, saying officials ""are not on any preset course.""

Meanwhile, traders have been told to ""expect fireworks"" by analysts David Brickell and Chris Mill, who wrote in their newsletter that they see the bitcoin price hitting fresh all-time highs this week, pointing to China's long-awaited announcement of huge stimulus measures designed to reignite its stalled economy.

""The steps taken from China this week will unleash a tsunami of liquidity. Alongside the Fed more aggressively cutting and a global easing cycle, we're pumping in anticipation of that, but against this short term liquidity drain,"" Mill and Brickell wrote.

"Forbes Daily: Ahead Of Debate, How Much Are Vance And Walz Worth?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/10/01/forbes-daily-ahead-of-debate-how-much-are-vance-and-walz-worth/,2024-10-01T12:11:37Z,"You don't just need to be a billionaire to make this year's Forbes 400 list. The cutoff for the 2024 list of America's 400 wealthiest is $3.3 billion.

In fact, for the first time, there are more American billionaires not on the list than are on it. But many of those who did make the cut are familiar faces: Elon Musk is the richest person in America for a third-straight year, followed by Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.

Perhaps the most notable person to make the list, despite falling off of it last year, is Donald Trump, who has cashed in on the presidency more than anyone else, and benefitted from the shaky stock market run of Truth Social's parent company.

The S&P 500 had its best start to the year through September since 1997, gaining 21% so far this year. Big tech stocks benefitting from the generative AI boom have performed best, though the market has shifted slightly in recent months as investors anticipated and reacted to this month's supersized interest rate cut.

Dockworkers along the East and Gulf Coasts walked out on strike early Tuesday, a stoppage that one economist estimated could cost the economy up to $7.5 billion per week. The International Longshoremen's Association is requesting a wage increase as part of a new contract with the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents shipping companies.

If former President Donald Trump wins in November, it could hamper the Chinese stock market's recent rally, JPMorgan Chase strategists cautioned Monday. The risk of a Trump presidency for emerging market stocks is tied to his hawkish trade policies, especially toward China. Still, the strategists noted that emerging market stocks could be at a ""turning point.""

Fintech heavyweights like Jack Dorsey's Block and payments giant Stripe are joining a new compliance coalition for fintechs, in an effort to avoid the missteps of recent years -- which have led to everything from the dramatic collapse of Synapse to a surge in regulatory enforcement actions against fintech sponsor banks. ""Fintechs need to step it up and understand that regulatory requirements are real,"" says former startup CEO Sima Gandhi, a lawyer and former Department of Treasury official who organized the effort.

Aerospace and defense firm Sierra Nevada Corp. landed a $13.1 billion contract to build the next nuclear-ready 'Doomsday' planes, a game-changer for the privately-held company. The Doomsday project will help define the legacy of chairwoman and co-owner Eren Ozmen and her husband, who are worth a combined $7.8 billion. ""Taking smart risks is very important,"" says Ozmen. ""Without that, really, you're just following what's happening -- you're not leading.""

Video game company Epic Games accused Google and Samsung in a federal lawsuit of colluding to harm third-party app stores on smartphones running Google's Android operating system. Epic has taken on both Google and Apple in recent years, alleging that the companies abused their dominant position in the smartphone market to charge excessive fees to app makers.

X, formerly known as Twitter, is worth a little more than one-fifth of the $44 billion Elon Musk paid to acquire it in 2022, according to Fidelity. Fidelity's stake in the social media platform is now worth about $4.19 million, valuing X at $9.4 billion, according to recent disclosures from the financial services company.

Before JD Vance and Tim Walz face off in the vice presidential debate tonight, Forbes took a look at how the candidates stack up financially. While Vance is worth $10 million, exceeding Walz's net worth of just over $1 million, both candidates are less wealthy than their potential bosses: Donald Trump is worth $3.9 billion, while Kamala Harris has a net worth of $7 million.

As Donald Trump became perhaps the most polarizing and controversial president in recent memory, hotels began removing the Trump brand -- but he still made millions. The most likely explanation? Breakup fees. It's tough to say exactly how much all the breakup fees add up to, but Forbes estimates it was at least $15 million and could have been as high as $25 million.

The Israeli Defense Forces began ""limited, localized, and targeted ground raids ... in southern Lebanon"" against Hezbollah targets and infrastructure Monday -- escalating the conflict in the Middle East after Israel killed a number of Hezbollah leaders. The IDF said that the operations were ""approved and carried out in accordance with the decision of the political echelon.""

TOPLINE It was another great year to be rich, especially for the select few at the very top. With markets roaring, nearly all of the 25 wealthiest people in America got wealthier over the past 12 months -- some by billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars.

In all, the top 25 billionaires on The Forbes 400 list are worth a collective $2.5 trillion. They hold nearly half of the $5.4 trillion in total wealth of the entire 400.

This elite group is $471 billion richer than in 2023, with each of the top 25 up 31% on average, outpacing the 18% jump in wealth across list members overall and the S&P 500's 27% return.

Much of the gains come from two people: Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, who added $75 billion to his net worth thanks to rebounding Meta stock, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, who has ridden the AI wave to $63.3 billion in additional wealth since the 2023 ranking. They're two of a record 12 members of The Forbes 400 who are also in the $100 Billion Club, the lucky group of tycoons whose fortunes stretch a dozen digits.

Only three members of the top 25 got poorer over the past year: Elon Musk, whose fortune dropped by $7 billion but who remains the richest person in America; Bill Gates, after Forbes increased our estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement with Melinda French Gates; and Phil Knight, following a rough run for Nike stock since last year.

WHY IT MATTERS ""The Forbes 400 is a roadmap of America's great wealth,"" says Forbes senior editor Chase Peterson-Withorn. ""The 400 richest people in the nation are richer, and thus in many ways more powerful, than ever. It's crucial to investigate who they are, how they made it, where they spend it and how they choose to (or, as is often the case, choose not to) donate it.""

The Israeli military has launched what it calls a ""limited"" incursion ground offensive in southern Lebanon against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. This action comes almost a year after Israel and Hezbollah began exchanging fire, forcing Lebanese and Israeli people living along the border to flee their homes. It also follows Israeli airstrikes that killed a number of top Hezbollah officials in Beirut on Friday. Yesterday, Hezbollah's deputy Naim Kassem addressed supporters, stating they would continue the battle in support of Palestinians and defend Lebanon.

For the first and likely only time, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will face off in a vice presidential debate tonight. They both need to help their respective tickets win over undecided voters in crucial swing states, as voting is already underway in parts of the U.S. Here's everything you need to know about tonight's debate, from how to watch to what the rules are.

Union dockworkers along East Coast and Gulf Coast ports began striking early today, halting the movement of more than $2 billion worth of goods, including cars, clothing, paper, farm machinery and much more. Picketing started just after midnight after talks between the International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance, representing ocean carriers and port operators, failed to result in a new contract. The strike, which impacts work at 14 ports, has two major sticking points: wages and automation. Trade groups warned President Biden that an extended strike would have dire consequences for the U.S. economy.

More than half of the states In the U.S. have legalized the use of cannabis for medical or recreational purposes, with some states allowing both. However, the federal government still considers most types of cannabis to be illegal. A new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, has found that a disconnect between states and the federal government is leading to fragmented politics and risks to the public.

"In Nevada, Latinos could pick the next president. They aren't sold on either candidate",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25479/nevada-latino-voters-trump-harris-culinary-union,2024-10-01T12:02:30Z,"LAS VEGAS -- Walking out of a grocery store in a Latino neighborhood on the east side of the city, Flor Elena Fernandez says she's wrestling with who to vote for in this year's election.

The 36-year old housekeeping manager worries about the cost of food. She worries about the cost of living.

""We're all waiting for what is going to happen, especially us Hispanics, says Fernandez, who is originally from Cuba. ""The economy is bad. We're waiting to see what happens.""

Her one and a half year old son, dressed in a red Flash superhero shirt is riding in the cart. Her mom also walks along, smiling knowingly.

Flor Maria Parra, Fernandez' mother, explains that she's already decided.

""Yes, for Kamala Harris,"" Parra, explains. ""At least with Hispanics, she defends the Hispanics a lot, while Trump throws them out.""

Around 1 in 5 voters in the Silver State are Latino. Now, that's more political power than the group has in almost any of the other 7 key states in the electoral college count.

President Biden barely eked out a victory in Nevada, in part by winning 60% of the Latino vote, but polls suggest Trump has stronger Latino support than previous Republican campaigns.

It's here in Las Vegas where Trump unveiled his plan to eliminate taxes on tips, seen as a direct pitch largely to Latino workers who make up the backbone of the state's casino and hospitality industry.

Looking to regain their advantage, the Harris campaign is spending $3 million in Spanish-language radio this month, which it says is the largest investment in Hispanic media ever.

The Democrats have also launched their not-so-secret weapon in the state -- an army of service workers from the Culinary Workers Union who have been helping deliver the party victories for several elections.

Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Workers Union, admits Nevada, ""to be honest, should be Trump territory.""

""At the end of the day, we're competitive, and we outwork everybody,"" he said, adding, ""there's a pathway to win if we really can get workers talking to workers face to face at the doors.""

That's exactly what they do. Thousands of cooks and servers and room cleaners will take a leave of absence to knock on doors, six days a week for Harris and the Democrats. The Culinary Union will help cover their missed wages as they undertake this different kind of work.

The Trump campaign is also increasing its efforts to reach Latino voters. In Nevada, it's hosting Spanish phone banking sessions, postcard writing nights and trainings for local volunteers.

Tony Fabrizio, Trump's lead pollster, argues that Harris' team is spending so much money on Latinos because they've lost so much ground within the community, especially in Nevada and Arizona.

""I don't care whose national poll you look at -- even yours, from NPR -- it is really very clear that she is underperforming with Hispanics, not only nationally, but in these two key states,"" Fabrizio said.

Back at the supermarket, views of Trump are widely mixed. Alfredo Alcasar is a maintenance worker. He says he doesn't like how Trump talks about Latinos.

""I don't like to be minimized. Trump always minimizes us, he said. ""And why, if we've done nothing bad? All we've done is try to contribute to the country as best we can.""

But Pedro Fernandez, a carpenter -- who is not related to Flor Elena and her mom -- is less worried about Trump's rhetoric and more concerned about inflation and the cost of living.

""We've been here 18 years, and when Trump was in power, the economy was stronger,"" he said.

As for Flor Elena Fernandez, she's torn. It will be her first time voting after recently becoming a citizen, and she wants to make the right choice. She agrees the economy is bad, but she also sees her mother's perspective.

""We know that she has a plan, but we don't know how good it will be,"" Fernandez says of Harris."
Scotland's Brewgooder Releases World's First Full-Time Fonio Beer,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dontse/2024/10/01/scotlands-brewgooder-releases-worlds-first-full-time-fonio-beer/,2024-10-01T11:49:08Z,"""When we started Brewgooder in 2016, our vision was to use beer to build a better world,"" said Alan Mahon, founder, on a video call. ""Over the years, we've generated opportunities from the United Kingdom to different parts of the world."" Through its Brewgooder Foundation, Brewgooder estimates that it has impacted over 150,000 people, mostly with clean water initiatives. According to Brewgooder's website, in 2018, it became the first Scottish brewery to become B-Corp certified.

Brewgooder's latest efforts include fair trade sourcing, starting with the first full-time beer brewed with fonio, an ancient African grain and possibly the original cultivated cereal. Brewgooder first brewed with fonio as part of a collaboration with New York's Brooklyn Brewery. While Brooklyn Brewery would go on to collaborate with other breweries around the world to promote fonio, Brewgooder is the first to add such a beer to its permanent lineup.

Brewgooder plans to brew between 2,000 and 3,000 hectolitres of Fonio Session IPA per year -- the equivalent of between 560,000 and 845,000 12-ounce cans. Brewgooder estimates the new beer will annually contribute £2 million to the fairtrade economy.

To make this much beer, Brewgooder had to establish a new supply chain to ensure access to the grain. Working with Fairtrade Africa, Fairtrade Foundation UK and FLOCERT, Brewgooder is making Fonio Session IPA with fonio grown by Groupement des Producteurs de Fonio au Foutah, a farming cooperative based in Guinea which includes 67 farmers. With the help of the new beer and the new supply chain, those farmers may be able to produce up to ten times as much fonio than they currently do, impacting not only the farms, but their surrounding communities.

Brewgooder has also partnered with Terra Ingredients of Minneapolis and the Michigan State University to help the fonio cooperative with improving seed systems, strengthening gender-inclusivity, and boosting crop quality. The trio of organizations is aiming to develop stronger seed systems that help the fairtrade-certified cooperative in Guinea grow better crops while ensuring everyone has a chance to benefit from these advances.

As for the beer itself, approximately 10% of the grain used to make the beer is fonio, a proportion Brewgooder settled on having experimented with amounts varying from 5% to 12%. ""You'll 100% notice the difference between this and another session IPA,"" said Mahon. ""We're trying to introduce this in a way where people get some exposure to a grain they didn't know about before."" Mahon says fonio imparts flavors of candied oranges, cherries and Gewürztraminer grapes.

Accordingly to Mahon, the fonio supply chain has been purposefully overbuilt so that other brewers and food manufacturers can have access to the grain, which some consider to be a superfood. The WWF has named fonio one of its Future 50 Foods.

""We've done the hardest part,"" said Mahon. ""It's great to be a category first, but not a category only."" Mahon hopes other breweries will make fonio beers to increase knowledge of the grain."
The Human Cost Of Efficiency And Why It Should Matter To All Investors,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bhaktimirchandani/2024/10/01/the-human-cost-of-efficiency-and-why-it-should-matter-to-all-investors/,2024-10-01T11:12:29Z,"A Closer Look at the Spread of Algorithmic Management Systems -- Which Contributed to $8 Billion in Turnover Costs and a 45% Injury Rate at Amazon -- Across Corporate America

With the help of digital technology, machines can perform complex managerial tasks, like supervising employees and assessing job candidates. It is no wonder that 57% of workers expect AI to change the way they do their current job, and 36% expect it to go as far as replacing their current job. With employees often described as a business's most important assets and human capital a key factor in economic competitiveness, investors and policymakers alike must understand and manage the risks to businesses and workers stemming from the deployment of digital technologies. And because JUST Capital research shows that 51% of workers at Russell 1000 companies, who make up 15% of the employed population in the US in 2021, are not earning a living wage, defined as sufficient to afford a decent standard of living for the worker and his or her family in a particular place, long-term investors must also understand and mitigate the harms that AI can cause to low-wage workers.

While there has been a recent surge of interest in and funding for AI safety or mitigating catastrophic societal-scale threats of uncontrolled AI systems, ex/ante founder and managing partner Zoe Weinberg explains that more proximate harms -- like discrimination, bias, and fairness -- are taking back seat. The time has come for long-term investors to take the drivers' seat to first understand and address these harms.

The ways in which AI can impact job quality are manifold. This article -- the first in a series on AI and the workplace -- focuses on algorithmic management, the delegation of managerial functions to algorithms in an organization, which is becoming an important part of AI-driven digital transformation of companies. This article closely examines the impact of algorithmic management on Amazon to illustrate why algorithmic management systems should matter across portfolios to all investors.

Organizations increasingly rely on algorithmic-based HR decision-making to monitor employees, driven in part by the technology industry's claims that its decision-making tools are efficient and objective. Algorithmic management systems can increase the scale of management operations: matching Uber's 149 million riders with its over 7 million drivers in 10,000 cities across 70 countries through algorithms is indeed unprecedented. Companies also harness algorithms to increase efficiency: UPS trucks have long been equipped with computers that give drivers advice and filled with sensors that record when drivers open doors, buckle their seat belts, and back up their trucks. In addition, algorithmic management systems can make employees more effective: MetLife call center workers receive real-time feedback from AI on whether they are not empathetic enough, sound tired, or speak too quickly.

However, researchers from MIT find that focusing solely on efficiency can lower employee satisfaction, wellbeing, and performance in the long-run by treating workers like ""cogs in a machine"" or triggering employees to continue working to the point of exhaustion.

As Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), a coalition of faith-based and values-based investors, and OpenMIC, a nonprofit focused on responsible use of digital technologies, explain in their new report, Dehumanization, Discrimination and Deskilling: The Impact of Digital Tech on Low-Wage Workers, a critical element of algorithmic management systems is the monitoring and surveillance of workers in violation of their human rights. More specifically, the report outlines a number of human rights impacted by digital technologies, including right to privacy (Article 12 in the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights) and occupational safety and health (ILO Convention 155 in 1981 and 187 in 2006).

Worker well-being, satisfaction, and human rights should matter to all investors. When algorithmic management systems detract from them, the resulting higher worker turnover, higher injury rates, increasing regulatory fines and sanctions, and increasing regulation can materially dampen long-term value creation.

Tying Worker Satisfaction and Safety to the Financial Statements at Amazon

Amazon -- the second largest private employer in the US and the fourth largest US company by market capitalization -- is worth closely examining because of the scale of the impact of algorithmic management on labor wellbeing and shareholder value. The lessons learned from this close examination are relevant to other companies that also use algorithmic management.

Over the past couple of years, researchers, investigators, lawmakers, and workers have been reinforcing each other's claims that Amazon's high injury rates are linked to the company's workplace productivity quotas and surveillance practices. For example, Amazon warehouse worker Daniel Olayiwola, who became the first warehouse worker in corporate history to present his own resolution at Amazon's annual shareholder meeting in 2022, highlighted the dangers of Amazon's ""Time Off Task"" (TOT) policy, which tracks the amount of time per day to the minute that workers do not scan products (including during bathroom breaks), its rate system, the number of products that employees scan per hour, and algorithmic firing based on TOT and rates.

During the pandemic, the New York Times reported 3% turnover a week or 150% turnover a year, which means that on average Amazon had to replace its entire workforce every eight months. According to leaked internal documents marked ""Amazon Confidential"" that tech news website Engadget reviewed and reported on, the cost of attrition was an estimated $8 billion annually for Amazon in 2021 -- nearly 25% of Amazon's 2021 net profit of $33 billion. Engadget further reported that regretted attrition, or workers choosing to leave the company, occurred twice as often as unregretted attrition, or layoffs and firings, and that only one out of three new hires in 2021 stayed with the company for 90 or more days. Amazon's announcement last week to increase the average total compensation package for fulfillment and transportation employees in the US to over $29 per hour -- Amazon's largest ever investment of over $2.2 billion in pay and benefits -- may be a cost-effective way to reduce the $8 billion cost of employee turnover or said differently, it may be hazard pay.

Because it's challenging to update information gleaned from leaked confidential documents, and we must try to understand worker satisfaction and algorithmic monitoring following the pandemic, let's also discuss the interim report released by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which was investigating workplace safety.

According to the report, during Prime Day week in 2019, Amazon's rate of recordable injuries -- the injuries that Amazon is required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) -- was over 10 injuries per 100 workers. In addition, the report explains that Amazon's total injury rate, which includes injuries that the company is not required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), was nearly 45 injuries per 100 workers during the week of Prime Day in 2019. That is almost half of the company's warehouse workers! The report highlighted that although Amazon's total injury rate includes minor injuries, such as bruises and superficial cuts, it also includes serious injuries, such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions, which the company should have treated as recordable injuries.

Amazon examined the issue closely in a memo titled ""2021 Prime Day Lessons Learned,"" which analyzes staffing performance for the period leading up to Prime Day in 2021. As context, Amazon had 117,300 employees in 2013, growing steadily to the peak of 1.6 million in 2021 before declining in 2022 and 2023 to 1.5 million. The document states that Amazon had only a 54.7% success rate meeting its hiring target from the end of March through the beginning of May in 2021. That means Amazon filled barely more than half of the positions it needed to fill to have fully staffed warehouses during that period. From the beginning of May through the end of June -- ending the week of Prime Day -- the company met only 71.2%. Indeed, worker satisfaction and worker safety are deeply intertwined.

Tying Worker Satisfaction and Safety to Regulatory Risk at Amazon

Several states, including New York and California, passed bills that require companies to disclose production quotas to warehouse workers and prevent companies from retaliating against employees for failing to meet undocumented quotas. US Senator Edward Markey (D-Mass) earlier this month introduced the Warehouse Worker Protection Act at a federal level, which if passed would require companies to provide written notice to workers of quotas and prohibits dangerous quotas, including those that rely on constant surveillance.

In addition, the Stop Spying Bosses Act, introduced by US Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Brian Schatz (D-HI), would require any employer collecting data on employees or applicants to disclose such information in a timely and public manner, prohibit employers from collecting sensitive data on individuals (i.e., off-duty data collection, data collection that interferes with organizing, etc.), create rules around the usage of automated decision systems to empower workers in employment decisions, and establish the Privacy and Technology Division at the Department of Labor to enforce and regulate workplace surveillance as novel technologies evolve and grow.

As a case in point, two warehouses violating California's Warehouse Quotas law cost Amazon $5.9 million in June 2024 alone. If passed, the federal bills would expand the scope of costly fines. The biggest threat to Amazon is likely to be action by government regulatory bodies. Amazon's largest regulatory fine was EUR 746 million (US$887 million) in 2021 for violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a European privacy law. More recently, in January 2024, French regulator CNIL fined Amazon France Logistique EUR 32 million (US$35 million) for an ""excessively intrusive"" surveillance system: CNIL said that tracking the inactivity of employees' scanners was illegal and that the system set up to measure the speed at which items were scanned as ""excessive."" As US regulation catches up to EU regulation on AI and privacy, regulatory risk could weigh down Amazon stock price, which at $187.99 per share nears all-time highs.

Amazon is not alone. Algorithmic management systems are pervasive. According to researchers at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, across the country, employers are increasingly using data and algorithms in ways that stand to have profound consequences for wages, working conditions, and equity.

Countless workplace surveillance systems collect data about worker activities through a wide variety of means, including handheld devices, point-of-sale systems, mobile phones, fingerprint scanners, fitness apps, wellness apps, smart cameras, microphones, and body sensors, according to Aiha Nguyen, who explores the future of labor for Data & Society, a nonprofit research organization. Nguyen says algorithmic management systems enable ""work speedups, employment insecurity and instability, a shift of risks of and costs from employers to workers,"" among other issues.

The AI-driven digital transformation of companies is only beginning, and it would behoove long-term investors to understand and shape it. This series of articles -- which will also cover exploitation of data workers, the gig economy, and automated hiring tools -- aims to do just that. Investors that can proactively identify and reduce exposure to these harms in their portfolios should be better able to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and immunize their portfolios from regulatory risk."
IPhone 16 Off To A Rocky Start. What It Means For Apple Stock.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/01/weak-iphone-16-sales-dont-tell-the-whole-story-for-apple-stock/,2024-10-01T11:06:45Z,"Apple stock (NASDAQ: AAPL) has remained largely flat over the past month, underperforming the Nasdaq-100, which gained about 4% in the same period. The company recently launched its iPhone 16 series, and early signs suggest weaker-than-expected demand. For instance, Morgan Stanley estimates that the average lead time for iPhone 16 orders is around 15.2 days, compared to 25.7 days for the iPhone 15 and 18 days for the iPhone 14 series within the first 11 days after Apple started taking orders. But should investors be concerned? We don't think so.

It's important to note that the shorter lead times could be attributed to improved supply chain conditions rather than weak demand. Unlike the last two years, when Apple faced supply constraints due to post-Covid semiconductor shortages, supply has likely caught up. This could mean Apple has simply ramped up production to meet initial demand more efficiently. The iPhone 16 lineup, while solid, offers relatively incremental improvements over last year's models -- mainly camera and processor upgrades. The Pro models come with slightly larger screens, but the real game-changer for this upgrade cycle lies in the upcoming Apple Intelligence software updates. These features, which include enhancements to Siri, new writing assistance tools, and AI-powered image generation, are expected to roll out gradually over the next few quarters. Many customers may be holding off on buying until these features are fully available, potentially driving an uptick in sales later in the cycle. The Apple intelligence features could eventually drive an upgrade cycle. Although primarily a software update, these AI capabilities will be exclusive to the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro models. The only exception is last year's iPhone 15 Pro, which will also receive the update. This limited backward compatibility is likely to create an incentive for users of older iPhones to consider upgrading. Another factor that could work in Apple's favor is the improvement in U.S. wireless carrier deals for the iPhone 16 Pro. Trade-in credits for the Pro models are higher compared to last year, which could drive more customers toward these premium devices. Given that the Pro models carry higher margins, this could boost Apple's profitability in the longer term.

The increase in AAPL stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 35% in 2021, -27% in 2022, and 49% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could AAPL face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

Apple's revenues are expected to scale to record highs this year, with sales projected to grow 9% to $390 billion, per consensus estimates, led by growth in emerging markets such as India. Apple has also been astute at managing its costs. Apple also grew its gross margins to 46% for the first nine months of this fiscal year, reaching near all-time highs, up from about 44% in the year-ago period, driven by a more favorable product mix, and higher service sales. Apple's solid balance sheet and services business cash cow could make the company a relatively safe haven in an uncertain market. See our breakdown of Apple's services business revenues. We have a $219 price estimate for Apple stock, which is about 3% below the current market price. However, Apple stock trades at a P/E of about 34x currently, based on FY'24 consensus earnings, which is slightly high in our view, given the company's mixed growth rates in recent years. See our analysis on Apple Valuation: Is AAPL Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for an overview of what's driving our price estimate for Apple.

Above The Clouds: Discover SAS Business Class,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sandramacgregor/2024/10/01/above-the-clouds-discover-sas-business-class/,2024-10-01T10:49:09Z,"Wondering if splurging on business class is worth it? It can certainly be a huge cost when compared to flying economy but some top-flight airlines make the extra expense very much worth it. Read on to discover for yourself whether Scandinavian Airlines (more commonly known as SAS) is one such airline.

The airline is certainly a popular choice for those jetting between North America and Scandinavia, as the carrier offers many direct flights from numerous major cities. One particularly convenient route for Toronto-based Canadians is their non-stop service from Toronto Pearson International Airport to Copenhagen. But regardless of where you're flying, SAS Business Class does its best to encapsulate the essence of Danish hygge: coziness, contentment and well-being -- sensations one does not normally associate with air travel.

First Impressions

As you step aboard the SAS aircraft for your flight from Toronto to Copenhagen, you're immediately struck by the sleek and modern Scandinavian aesthetic of the Business class cabin. The elegant and relaxing hues of grey and black create an inviting space that puts you at ease and hints at the thoughtful attention to detail you'll enjoy throughout your flight. The journey begins with your choice of drink, with champagne being the drink of choice for many travelers, setting the tone for a luxurious and serene travel experience. Best of all, soon after the flight takes off, you'll be served a cocktail with warm nuts, a small touch that embodies the Danish concept of hygge of cozy indulgence.

Seating

Many SAS Business Class flights feature Thompson Aero Vantage XL seats, which convert into fully flat beds at the touch of a button. On the A330s and A350s, the seats are arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration, ensuring direct aisle access for every passenger. The seats offer a generous 22-inch width and convert into a 77-to-80-inch lie-flat bed, providing ample space for relaxation and comfort.

On the A321LRs, used for the Toronto-Copenhagen route, the business class cabin features spacious lie-flat seats but in a less-appealing, alternating 2-2 and 1-1 seating configuration across seven rows, with 22 seats in total. This layout means that there are ""throne"" seats in even-numbered rows, which are perfect for solo travelers, while couples can enjoy neighboring seats in odd-numbered rows. However, if you get placed in the 2-2 seating configuration beside a stranger, it can be a less-than-ideal situation as there is no way to exit your seat (to use the washroom, for example) without disturbing your neighbor. This can be especially vexing if your neighbor is sleeping in the lie-flat seat position as they would be required to move the seat into an upright position to let you exit. All this to say, if you are traveling solo, be sure to select a throne seat.

The seats are easy to position, with intuitive controls that allow you to find your ideal comfort level. The seat adjustment works electronically and also includes adjustable lumbar support. The real show-stopper is a massage feature (SAS is one of the few airlines in the world that offers this function). Throughout the flight, you can enjoy a wide range of entertainment on a 15.4"" HD screen, as well as free Wi-Fi (normally a rare perk even for Business class), as well as extra power and USB outlets.

Food and Drink

SAS Business Class offers an impressive range of delicious Scandinavian-centric dishes. Each course is served from an open-top cart trolley (a charming, old-school touch that adds to the personalized ambiance) that is wheeled down the aisle. To add a sense of panache to the proceedings, one of the flight attendants wears a chef's uniform during the main meal service.

The menu is carefully curated to highlight Scandinavian cuisine, with a focus on local and seasonal ingredients. Dishes include elevated fare, such as braised beef cheeks with red wine sauce and fried potato rosti, as well as Nordic risotto with grilled artichokes. The meal service is ends with a selection of regional cheeses, fresh fruits, and desserts, including scrumptious delights like panna cotta with red currants and peach and berry crumble. Be sure to save a little bit of room for a box of chocolate truffles from Hedh Escalante (a Swedish chocolate maker) to finish off the meal service.

The wine selection is equally impressive, with a focus on old and new world wines. SAS offers a minimum of two whites and two reds, as well as Champagne, including the Charles Heidsieck Brut Réserve MV. Passengers can also enjoy a range of beers, including Mikkeller Celebration IPA, which was specially made for SAS. The airline also has a selection of spirits that showcase Scandinavian distilleries, such as Hernö Gin from Sweden and Harahorn Gin from Norway. SAS's fun signature drink is the ""SASmopolitan,"" a twist on the classic cosmopolitan cocktail, made with Absolut Citron vodka, lingonberry juice, lime, and cranberry. There's also a refreshing non-alcoholic cocktail aptly called ""Above the Clouds"" which contains cranberry juice, apple juice and sprite. Cheers!

It's worth noting that if you are sitting in the back of the Business class section, it's possible that they will run out of your first meal choice. Apparently, according to information provided on the menu, you can preselect your meal to ensure you get your first choice. A thoughtful addition to SAS Business class service would be to do what Delta does, which is to proactively email passengers in Business Class and Premium a few days before their flight and invite them to preselect their meal. This proactive and thoughtful step ensures everyone gets their first choice.

Amenities

There is a dedicated washroom that is reserved for business class passengers. There is also a very small section in the galley (the size of the snack section depends on your flight and plane type) where you can help yourself to snacks like nuts, chocolate and chips. Business class passengers also receive a well-appointed amenity kit featuring popular Scandinavian brands.

The kit (which comes in a playful striped Dux laundry bag or shoe bag) includes:

Service

Scandinavians may have a reputation as being reserved, but warmth and a welcoming energy are what the Business class crew on SAS exudes. Throughout the flight, service is friendly and professional and the crew is proactive in anticipating your needs, whether it's refilling your glass, offering a snack or asking if you'd like an extra pillow.

Overall, flying business class with Scandinavian Airlines is an incredibly enjoyable experience with comfortable seating (yeah massage feature!), delectable cuisine and attentive service."
The Best Performing Energy Stocks Of Q3 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2024/10/01/the-best-performing-energy-stocks-of-q3-2024/,2024-10-01T10:29:20Z,"Robert Rapier is a chemical engineer covering the energy sector.

The S&P 500 finished the third quarter of 2024 with a gain of 5.5%, with all three major U.S. indices recording quarterly advances, though the Nasdaq lagged behind.

Typically, the S&P 500 is somewhere in the middle of the overall sector performances, but not this time. Because the S&P 500 is top-heavy with technology companies -- and because the technology sector was flat in Q3 -- nine of eleven S&P 500 sectors outperformed the S&P 500 in Q3.

Leading all sectors for the first time in quite a while was the utility sector, which gained 19.4%. Close behind was the real estate sector, with a 17.1% gain for the quarter. The only sector in negative territory was energy, which nevertheless managed a 7.3% return year-to-date.

Several factors contributed to strong stock performance in Q3 2024. Many companies reported solid earnings, boosting investor confidence, while stocks of companies involved in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies saw substantial gains, continuing a trend from earlier in the year.

Globally, the economy showed signs of stabilization, with disinflation trends and easing monetary policies in several regions. The quarter ended with the first interest rate cut in four years, which provided an additional boost to stocks.

The energy sector experienced a broad-based decline in Q3, although the midstream segment managed to eke out a small gain. According to data provider FactSet -- which I use to analyze companies -- the Big Three refiners -- Marathon Petroleum MPC , Valero, and Phillips 66 PSX -- were down an average of 8.3%. Valero was the hardest hit, with a loss of 13.3%, followed by Phillips 66 (-6.1%) and Marathon (-5.6%).

The average upstream company -- the pure oil and gas producers -- lost 8.6% in Q3. However, there were several double-digit losers among the upstream companies. Of the 48 public companies FactSet classifies as ""upstream"", 47 turned in a negative return. Two companies that bucked the upstream trend in Q3 were PrimeEnergy Resources, up 29.6% for the quarter, and Viper Energy, which gained 21.9%.

The midstream segment outperformed the broader energy sector in Q3. Among the 39 companies that FactSet classifies as ""midstream"", the average return was 1.2%. TC Energy led the midstream segment with a gain of 27.4%, followed by Golar LNG, which gained 18.2%.

The integrated supermajors were mostly lower, losing 4.8% on average. Among this group, the best performer (and only positive performer) for the quarter was ExxonMobil, which gained 2.6%. TotalEnergies SE was the second-best performer with a decline of 2.1%.

Energy prices have remained moderate in recent months, with record U.S. oil production helping to stabilize global prices. Although OPEC+ had hinted that it might begin easing production cuts this month, current oil prices are likely to delay that move. Global supply and demand are relatively balanced, and OPEC+ will likely prefer to avoid disrupting the market."
Investors Urged To Address Toxic Chemical-Related Financial Risks,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiehailstone/2024/10/01/investors-urged-to-address-toxic-chemical-related-financial-risks/,2024-10-01T10:15:07Z,"Investors could face $20 billion in corporate liabilities associated with plastic-related pollution in the U.S. alone, according to a new analysis.

The report by the financial think tank Planet Tracker urges investors to review their investments and reduce their ""toxicity debt"".

It also urges investors to assess the risk premium associated with toxic chemicals, which can leave companies financially exposed to lawsuits for decades.

And it claims investors face an estimated $20 billion near-term corporate liabilities from plastic-related pollution in the US. alone, as the chemical industry is increasingly exposed to fines and litigation costs.

In addition, it adds legal risks can also trigger profit warnings, asset sales and dividend cuts.

The analysis comes after California's attorney general, Rob Bonta announced the state was filing a lawsuit against ExxonMobil for allegedly engaging in a decades-long campaign of deception that caused and exacerbated the global plastics pollution crisis.

The Planet Tracker report focuses on the financial risk posed by what are described as novel entities, which are artificial chemicals and other human-made pollutants.

The study also warns a new chemical substance is being registered every 1.4 minutes somewhere in the world with the Chemical Abstracts Service.

According to the report, there is a ""significant risk"" to not knowing or disclosing the toxicity of these chemicals.

In Europe and North America, it adds more than 350,000 chemicals and mixtures of chemicals have been registered for production and use.

And it warns most of these chemicals are untested.

For example, it claims around 80% of these chemicals have been in use for at least 10 years without yet having undergone an EU safety assessment.

Planet Tracker's head of data Chris Baldock said novel entities pose a"" real financial risk"" to companies and their financiers in an interview.

""Novel entities are everywhere,"" added Baldock. ""Around 80% of all the chemical stock that has ever been produced is still in products that are currently in use.

""And then there is the pervasiveness of novel entities in all the sectors of the economy, from packaging to textiles.

""This is not an area which has had a lot of focus before, but we have tried to gather as much evidence to point investors and financiers to the risks""

Baldock told me the production of chemicals and goods containing toxic additives is not slowing down, with hundreds of companies producing new products every year.

He added Planet Tracker recently launched its petrochemical investor statement, whereby signatories call on companies to transparently disclose and define strategies targets to reduce the impacts of plastics.

The statement also calls on signatories to identify and address hazardous polymers and chemicals of concern in their products.

Planet Tracker's director of research, John Willis said from a financial point-of-view, novel entities are a ""complete and utter nightmare"" in an interview.

Willis added it is ""almost inevitable"" that some chemical producers face litigation and pointed to the ongoing controversy of PFAS or ""forever chemicals"" in drinking water and the recent developments in California as two recent examples.

""The longer companies exposed to novel entities delay transitioning to sustainable alternatives, the greater their liabilities are likely to become,"" added Willis.

""Investors need to ensure they are valuing these risks accurately and transition to more sustainable substances."""
Culture Wars And Unconstitutional Laws: The Threat To America's Future,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffraikes/2024/10/01/culture-wars-and-unconstitutional-laws-the-threat-to-americas-future/,2024-10-01T10:03:58Z,"Ill-advised and unconstitutional ideological crusades by conservative state legislators are infringing on the rights of American businesses and endangering America's future.

The Climate Crisis is Here...

It's no secret that the accelerating impacts of climate change are being felt worldwide. 2024 is likely to be the warmest year in recorded history, and nine of the hottest years on record have all been in the last decade. To take just one example, residents of Phoenix, Arizona experienced 113 days in a row this summer with over 100-degree temperatures.

With hotter days come more extreme weather events. In what was billed as a once-in-a-1000-year event, Sarasota, Florida and its environs experienced as much as ten inches of rain in just 24 hours this past June. (This followed once-in-a-millennium rainstorms in St. Louis, Kentucky, Death Valley in 2022, and Fort Lauderdale in 2023.) July saw Hurricane Beryl become the earliest-ever Category 5 hurricane to develop in the Atlantic. Last week, after another once-in-a-thousand-year rainstorm in Western NC, Hurricane Helene devastated the Southeast, bringing catastrophic flooding to Appalachian cities.

As climate impacts become increasingly extreme, we are collectively racing against time to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions before we reach 1.5 degrees of warming. The good news is the global renewable energy boom is here. With costs coming down and technology improving, the world will install an estimated 593 gigawatts of solar capacity this year, nearly 30% more than in 2023 and six times more than in 2019. Here in the U.S., led by California and Texas, we now have eight times more solar power and twice as much wind power as a decade ago. Battery storage capacity is also expected to double this year, meaning more renewable energy can be saved and used whenever needed.

...But Texas Legislators Would Halt Our Progress

Since its oil boom days, Texas has always been an energy leader, and these days are no exception - Texas now leads the country in wind power and is second only to California in solar. The clean energy transition is crucial for the Lone Star state since Texas is especially threatened by warming temperatures and hurricanes. Its statewide energy grid is also increasingly overwhelmed: Texas suffered 210 power outages between 2020 and 2023, more than any other state.

So, given the urgent necessity of decarbonizing our energy grid and Texas's role as a renewable energy leader, why have its lawmakers been trying to sabotage progress against climate change?

In 2021, Texas conservatives passed S.B. 13, a misguided and arguably unconstitutional law requiring all state entities, like pension funds and the K-12 education endowment, to divest any business that has moved away from supporting fossil fuels. Meant as an ideological attack against the growing move towards Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing, S.B. 13, according to a study by the Texas Association of Business, cost Texas nearly $700 million in lost economic activity, $181 million in annual earnings, more than 3000 full-time jobs, and more than $37 million in tax revenues in F.Y. 2022-2023.

S.B. 13's ideological crusade also prompted five of the largest underwriters for municipal bonds in Texas - JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Fidelity - to exit the Texas market, meaning much higher borrowing costs for Texas cities. These five banks ""used to underwrite about 35% of the debt in the market,"" notes Wharton Business professor Daniel Garrett, ""so they've left a really big gap."" The Texas public school fund also pulled $8.5 billion from Blackrock to comply with the law.

Last month, supported by Democracy Forward, the American Sustainable Business Council (ASBC) filed a lawsuit against S.B. 13 and a similar law, S.B. 19, which forces state funds to divest from companies that restrict business with gunmakers. ""SB-13 is not just a misguided policy,"" says David Levine, president and co-founder of ASBC. ""It is an unconstitutional attack that stifles free speech and punishes businesses for prioritizing responsible investments."" In fact, an Oklahoma District Court Judge has already struck down Oklahoma's anti-ESG law for similar reasons.

As Chris Tomlinson wrote in the Houston Chronicle of this ""unconstitutional, authoritarian power grab that hurts all Texans,"" ""whether you worry about climate change or not, the real issue is whether the government should dictate any company's investment strategy. True conservatives believe elected officials should stay out of private sector decisions.""

It's Not Just Texas.

Unfortunately, Texas lawmakers are not alone in these attempts to hamstring American businesses. Per Reuters, 2022 saw at least 44 new bills or laws in 17 red states that attempted to penalize companies for investment strategies or behaviors they deemed too progressive, up from a dozen in 2021.

Among these was Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's infamous ""Stop WOKE Act,"" which attempted to ban workplace trainings on improving race relations and which a federal judge permanently blocked in July. Similarly, the Republican-controlled House in Georgia passed a bill cutting tax breaks for Delta Airlines, the state's largest private employer, after its CEO lambasted new voting restrictions there. (The bill failed to pass the Senate.)

Even more frightening, the anti-ESG push has now been taken up by the authors of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation blueprint to supercharge a second Trump presidency. In their report, they call for Trump's Department of Labor to ""remove ESG considerations from ERISA,"" the law setting minimum standards for pension and health plans. After deriding ESG for taking into account woke causes like ""reducing greenhouse gas emissions,"" the Project 2025 report decrees that ""DOL should prohibit investing in ERISA plans on the basis of any factors that are unrelated to investor risks and returns."" However, considering the impacts of climate change is precisely the type of long-term risk that businesses and investors should be evaluating to protect their returns and financial health.

Of course, the government plays an indispensable role in regulating companies, so they follow the law, do right by their workers and communities, and don't conduct business with America's enemies. But trying to force U.S. companies, by law, to uphold far-right conservative ideology is simply a bridge too far. It is, in a word, unconstitutional. And amidst a global climate crisis that threatens all Americans, especially those most vulnerable in our society, these misguided ideological crusades don't just jeopardize our future prosperity and global competitiveness -- they endanger our communities, economy, and planet."
"The Next U.S. President Won't Define Crypto's Future, Congress Will",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2024/10/01/the-next-us-president-wont-define-cryptos-future-congress-will/,2024-10-01T10:03:54Z,"The national conversation around cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and U.S. innovation leadership has centered on the White House this election cycle. Presidential candidates Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have both made notable shifts regarding this emerging industry of financial technology. Harris has pivoted from President Biden's antagonistic approach, led by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and prudential regulators, to a more pro-innovation tone focused on blockchain and digital assets. These technologies, she claims, are crucial to her ""Opportunity Economy,"" aimed at empowering middle-class families and small businesses.

Meanwhile, Trump, who once called bitcoin a ""scam,"" now vows to make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and pledges to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler (the head of an independent agency who can only be removed for cause) on his first day in office. Although these promises grab attention, the reality is that the President's influence over the future of digital assets is limited. It is Congress that holds the real power to shape the regulatory framework for crypto.

Congress Holds The Real Power

Congress, as the first branch of government, holds the key to determining the future of digital assets in the U.S. While presidential candidates may dominate headlines, under Article II of the Constitution, the President's powers are limited. The President cannot unilaterally enact laws or overhaul regulations for digital assets; their role is primarily to enforce the laws passed by Congress and oversee regulatory agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

Executive orders, while impactful, are not laws and can be undone by future administrations. For long-term stability in the digital asset industry, Congress must pass legislation. Yet, much of the public and crypto advocates tend to focus on presidential races, overlooking Congress's critical role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation.

The ""Do-Nothing"" Congress And Regulatory Bottlenecks

The current Congress has been criticized for inaction, having passed fewer than 230 bills into law during the 2023-2024 term, well below prior legislative sessions. This delay has hindered the development of a modern legal framework for digital finance, leaving regulatory agencies like the SEC to rely on outdated laws from the 1930s, ill-suited for today's digital asset landscape.

Without clear legislation, these agencies continue to enforce old frameworks, leading to regulatory confusion, inconsistent enforcement, and stifled innovation. Democratic and Republican leaders have pledged to change this, with support from figures like House Leader Mike Johnson. However, without decisive action, the U.S. risks falling behind in global digital asset innovation.

Congress's Crucial Role In Shaping Crypto Policy

Congress holds the unique authority to craft laws that reflect the country's evolving needs, particularly in emerging sectors like blockchain and digital assets. The SEC operates under laws such as the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 -- long before the internet or digital currencies existed. Applying these outdated laws to digital assets has led to friction and uncertainty, as many assets -- often dynamic in nature -- do not fit neatly into existing categories and twentieth century legal frameworks.

Agencies like the SEC and CFTC are forced to apply outdated laws in ways that extend beyond their original intent, leading to concerns of regulatory overreach. A recent federal court ruling highlighted this issue, finding that the SEC acted arbitrarily and capriciously in its denials of bitcoin exchange-traded funds. This kind of regulatory overreach hampers innovation, creating uncertainty around compliance and making it challenging for startups to succeed. Industry leaders continue to call for clear rules of the road from the SEC. However, executive agencies get their rulemaking and enforcement powers from Congress. Accordingly, the clearest rules will come from Congress.

The FIT21 Act and Securities Clarity Act

A significant step in this direction occurred with the passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which included Representative Tom Emmer's Securities Clarity Act. This act aims to provide much-needed legal clarity for the digital asset industry by distinguishing between an asset and the securities contract it may be part of. As Emmer stated, ""This is an important opportunity for the United States to lead... The FIT21 Act will give entrepreneurs the clarity and assurance they need to build here, in the United States.""

Before the FIT21 Act, one of the biggest regulatory hurdles for digital assets was the confusion over how they were classified under existing securities laws. Many cryptocurrencies start as part of a securities contract but may evolve into something else once a project becomes fully decentralized. The Securities Clarity Act, now Title II of the FIT21 Act, addresses this by providing the flexibility for a digital asset project to transition from centralization (controlled by developers or investors) to decentralization, where it operates independently.

Emmer emphasized this point during his remarks on the House floor, saying, ""Among the many important provisions in this bill is my Securities Clarity Act... which provides the legal flexibility for a digital asset project to transition from centralization to decentralization. This transition is critical to the future peer-to-peer digital economy.""

This legislative clarity is crucial for allowing digital asset projects to grow without unnecessary regulatory hurdles. By passing FIT21, Congress aims to keep U.S. innovation onshore and ensure the country remains competitive in the global digital economy.

The Limits Of Leaving It To The Executive Branch

While Congress often delegates authority to executive agencies, this does not give those agencies free rein. Agencies like the SEC are tasked with executing the laws passed by Congress, not creating new laws through regulation. When Congress fails to act however, as it has with respect to the crypto asset industry, agencies like the SEC are left to make judgment calls, leading to inconsistent enforcement that chills innovation.

The SEC's approach of enforcing regulations on a case-by-case basis, without setting clear industry-wide guidelines, has been particularly problematic for digital asset companies. Ongoing legal battles over the classification of certain tokens as securities have cast a chilling effect on the industry. The absence of comprehensive legislation has left both regulators and businesses in a state of uncertainty. Even agency heads disagree on the best approach. While Gensler criticized FIT21, CFTC Chair Rostin Benham commented that with successful passage of the bill, he was ""confident"" his agency could build a regulatory framework within 12 months.

Congress must have the last word and settle these issues by passing comprehensive legislation, such as FIT21, that provides clear guidance to both agencies and businesses.

Shifting Congressional Attitudes Toward Crypto

Key members of Congress are increasingly supporting digital asset innovation. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), once a critic, now acknowledges the importance of engaging with technologies like AI and crypto, stating, ""We've got to move forward with AI, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency... we have to learn more.""

At the recent Crypto4Harris town hall, aimed at strengthening ties between Harris's campaign and the crypto industry, several pro-crypto lawmakers voiced their support. Rep. Wiley Nickel (D-NC) called for Harris to adopt a more pro-crypto stance, while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) expressed optimism about passing bipartisan crypto legislation, stating, ""Crypto is here to stay no matter what. So, Congress must get it right.""

Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) also demonstrated support, signaling growing bipartisan backing for a regulatory framework that balances innovation with consumer protection.

Industry leaders echo these sentiments. Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, emphasized the importance of bipartisan efforts, noting that many in Congress already understand how critical digital assets are to the U.S.'s financial future. Will Schweitzer, co-organizer of Crypto4Harris, added, ""Bipartisan Congressional support for Digital Asset legislation continues to gain momentum.""

The StandWithCrypto.com database shows over 50 Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-PA), and Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), are now somewhat or strongly supportive of pro-crypto legislation. This growing base of support suggests that Congress is ready to proceed with bipartisan long-term regulatory changes in the digital asset space.

Why Congress Must Lead on Crypto

To keep the U.S. at the forefront of blockchain technology, Congress must prioritize policies that foster innovation. This goes beyond regulatory reform that tinkers at the edges -- it requires a fundamental shift in how emerging technologies are approached.

Unlike the Executive branch, Congress holds the power to create laws specifically tailored to the needs of the crypto industry. By collaborating with stakeholders, experts, retail investors, and innovators, lawmakers can design frameworks that foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection.

As G. Clay Miller of Penrose Partners noted, ""We will have a pro-crypto President no matter who wins in November, but the real work begins in January.""

"Emmanuel Perrin, CEO Of Richemont's TimeVallée, On First USA Location",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertanaas/2024/10/01/emmanuel-perrin-ceo-of-richemonts-timevalle-on-first-usa-location/,2024-10-01T10:03:26Z,"The fate of luxury retail in America, especially as it pertains to watches and horology, has been in a state of flux over the past decade or so. Many brands have shifted from selling their fine timepieces via retail jewelry stores to opening their own mono-brand boutiques, operated in house. Some also recognize the importance of teaming with experienced retail partners for their mono-brand stores. Now, though, Richemont-owned TimeVallée brings the retail partnership to new heights in America -- collaborating with local, family operated retailer The Kodak Group -- to open its first American-based Swiss multi-brand luxury watch shopping destination.

In a rare one-on-one interview with Emmanuel Perrin, CEO of TimeVallée, he noted that the opening of this store was a long time coming. While America was on the radar for a while, finding the right partner and location (as Perrin calls it, finding the right white space) was key.

Richemont's TimeVallée started just about a decade ago, with its first stores in Asia. The idea was to create a luxury shopping destination, with top-notch client care, for Richemont to showcase many of its brands, sometimes even alongside non-Richemont brands. In all instances, these stores are operated by retail partners, not by the Richemont Group. As the TimeVallée concept grew, stores opened outside of Asia -fanning throughout Europe, the United Kingdom, the Middle East and elsewhere.

As of earlier this year, TimeVallée, with more than 50 stores in 14 countries, had yet to enter the American market. Now, after joining forces with New Jersey-based The Kodak Group, TimeVallée opened its first USA store this past July (with a grand opening event slated for late fall), in the American Dream Mall in East Rutherford, NJ.

One of America's largest and most lavish malls, American Dream, a stone's throw from New York City, is billed as the place where fashion, food, experiences and more come together. The malls boasts theme parks (think water parks, snow parks and even Nickelodeon), hundreds of iconic brand-name stores, and a luxury wing, called The Avenue, dedicated solely to the world's most renowned brands.

In this wing, shoppers will find a glamorous champagne bar, sculptures and topiaries, a balcony beneath a canopy of string lights - all alongside glamorous retail stores. Cartier, Montblanc, Dolce & Gabbana, Hermes, Gucci, Rolex, Tiffany & Co, and a host of others draw the attention of the most elite shoppers.

It is in this luxurious atmosphere that TimeVallée, operated by The Kodak Group, has opened its doors. The 2,540-square-foot luxury store was bult from the ground up, as no previous store existed in its space in the still-fledgling Avenue wing. The outcome is a deft blend of cream colors, generous waves and circular patterns that seem to ebb, flow and come together for an open and inviting feel.

There are no doors to walk through here; instead, the generous entryway spans about 15 feet, and the façade boasts meandering curved lines reminiscent of the Swiss mountains and valleys, but all in gold tones. One can easily enter to look at a single brand or peruse the entire selection of seven of the most prestigious brands that run the gamut from Vacheron Constantin to IWC Schaffhausen, Panerai, Piaget, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Baume & Mercier, and Roger Dubuis.

Each brand has its own representation, not just in selection of product, but also in terms of image and design that melds beautifully with the overall flow of the store. With a desire to offer personalized experiences for shoppers, TimeVallée boasts open spaces, lots of seating and even the Time Café' for drinks and small bites.

""It took us a while to come to America because this is the biggest economy of the world. It's the biggest market. America has always been a bit more mature and more qualitative, as well. You have fantastic stores throughout the US, so we needed to find a white spot where we could extend the reach for several maisons at once and do it with the right partner who is able to reach those pockets of clients that aren't as reachable through existing stores,"" said Perrin, noting that certain Richemont brands had already been working with The Kodak Group in its Hoboken store and there was very good rapport.

Once the partnership with The Kodak Group to open the TimeVallée store was established, the building of the store, from the ground up and according to the TimeVallée designs, took nearly two full years. As mentioned, the store opened in July as the first TimeVallée store, with plans to open another three stores over the next year or so already in the works. Additionally, says Perrin, TimeVallée just opened a store in Montreal - marking another country to call hom.

So, who is the client shopping at American Dream's TimeVallée? It isn't New Yorkers. According to Bradley Kodak, co-founder of The Kodak Group, ""We're getting a huge amount of clientele from Bergen County, which is one of the wealthiest counties in the state. And the traffic that we're seeing here is very, very qualitative. So, we're excited to attract these new customers.""

Another big draw to the TimeVallée store, in addition to the client care there, the American Dream mall's reputation and the great location, is the fact that customers can experience multiple brands at different prices. As opposed to having separate salons for each maison, seven brands are all housed under the same roof here, says Perrin. The store is warm, welcoming and open and there is plenty of opportunity to bring clients back to experience another brand or event."
Mortgage Rates 1 October 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-01-10-24/,2024-10-01T10:02:55Z,"Bank Rate was held at 5% in September by the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

Interest rates had been cut to 5% from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since March 2020. They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steadying interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Good news on inflation and interest rates has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy. We will know more in its Autumn Budget on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.58%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.56% and 4.23% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 3.73%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 3.99% and 3.71% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.39%, with the best in this category priced at 5.14%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stands at 7.24%, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 September there were 6,460 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,657 last month. But the number has largely grown. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

Nationwide's latest house price report (published 30 September) reported that average property values in September were 3.7% higher than the previous year. It marks the strongest annual house price growth since November 2022. On a monthly basis, the rise was 0.7% when compared to August. Nationwide, which bases its index on mortgage data, puts the cost of the average home in September at £266,094.

The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before. It marks the fifth consecutive month of rises. On a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."
What's New With AMD Stock?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/01/whats-happening-with-amd-stock/,2024-10-01T10:00:44Z,"Advanced Micro Devices stock (NASDAQ: AMD) has fared well over the past month, rising by close to 20%. This is roughly in line with rival Intel stock (NASDAQ: INTC) which has gained about 19% over the same period. AMD has benefited from a couple of factors, including the Fed's recent interest rate cut as well as recent customer wins for its GPU business. Here's a closer look at some of the recent developments for AMD.

The Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points earlier this month, marking the first interest rate cut in close to four years. Also, check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed's next move? With the current benchmark federal funds rate standing at 4.75% to 5% post the cut, there still remains room for the central bank to lower interest rates further. Lower rates are typically beneficial for growth sectors including technology, which have higher earning potential in outer years, as lower discount rates boost the present value of future earnings. Lower interest rates could also reduce financing costs for builders of large data centers, potentially driving up capital spending in the space, and helping players like AMD which sell CPUs and GPUs for servers.

AMD has also seen some tailwinds from the generative AI trend. Graphics processing units are becoming the de-facto chips for running AI-related workloads. AMD has launched new chips, such as the MI300X chip, targeted at large language model training and inference for generative AI workloads. AMD recently upped its guidance for MI300 sales this year to $4.5 billion and the number could be still higher. Oracle recently chose AMD's accelerated computing chips to power its latest supercluster for high-intensity AI workloads, after testing showed that AMD's GPUs delivered low latency and strong performance at a competitive price. With Nvidia's GPUs costing upward of $25,000 each, customers like Oracle are actively seeking more cost-effective alternatives, positioning AMD to grow its GPU business for data centers. To be sure, Nvidia has been the hottest of the AI stocks, rising by roughly 2.5x this year. But did you know that there is a lesser-known AI name that could offer more upside than Nvidia?

Besides this, there have been reports that AMD has secured the contract to design the processor for Sony's yet-to-be-announced next-gen PlayStation 6, edging out Intel. The deal will help AMD to continue its long-term relationship with Sony, as the company designs the chip for the PlayStation 5. Although the PS6 is expected to launch in 2027 or beyond, it could be a reasonably large money spinner for AMD, given that Sony has already shipped about 62 million PS5 consoles.

Now the increase in AMD stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 57% in 2021, -55% in 2022, and 128% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could AMD face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

AMD trades at about 48x consensus 2024 earnings, which is a relatively high multiple. although the ongoing recovery in the PC market and surge in demand from AI applications could justify this. We value AMD stock at about $168 per share, roughly in line with the current market price. See our analysis on AMD Valuation: Is AMD Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for more details on what's driving our price estimate for AMD. Also, check out our analysis of AMD Revenue for more details on the company's key revenue streams.

While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing for the U.S. economy following rate cuts, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes."
Huge Spike In Russian Drone Attacks For Winter With Chinese Help,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2024/10/01/huge-spike-in-russian-drone-attacks-for-winter-with-chinese-help/,2024-10-01T09:16:27Z,"Russia's strategic drone assault on Ukraine is has reached a new intensity. Attacks which were rising gradually through 2024 but have spiked dramatically, with over 1300 Shahed long-range drones reported in September, far higher than any previous month. This is the first month that drone attacks have been recorded every single day, as the details painstakingly compiled by ShahedTracker show. While most drones are shot down, some get through and cause significant damage.

Although Ukraine reports all these drones simply as as 'Shaheds' there are increasing signs that the Iranian-designed Shahed are being supplemented by at least three other types, some reportedly supplied directly by China.

These attacks are of critical strategic importance. Ukraine's power infrastructure is already severely damaged. As the Washington Post noted this week: ""The best-case scenario is just four hours of power cuts a day, but it could also end up being 20 hours of darkness or more a day in the depths of Ukraine's frigid winter.""

If the attacks continue at this increased level through the winter they could have a major impact on Ukraine's economy and morale. What weapons is Russia bringing to bear in this long-range bombardment?

The mainstay of the assault is the Shahed-136, known in Russia as Geran-2 (""Geranium-2""). The Shahed-136 is a one-way attack drone developed by Iran, with a seven-foot wingspan, a warhead of around 100 pounds and a range in excess of 600 miles. A propeller engine with 115 mph cruising speed means the Shahed is slower, less powerful and easier to shoot down than traditional cruise missiles, but it costs much less and can be produced at scale. Russia makes Shaheds in a giant new factory in Alabuga with cheap labor -- students drafted in from a nearby technical college and workers brought in from Africa.

We have seen several modifications from the basic Shahed. New versions have at least three types of warhead, and some carry 4G cell modems which communicate via the Ukrainian cellphone network; more recently a Shahed was found with Starlink communications. Black, supposedly radar-absorbing coating, probably to make them less visible at night is now standard.

Earlier waves of Shaheds came in at very low level, now with the prevalence of mobile air defence groups they approach at high altitude until they reach their target, so they can only be brought down by expensive missiles or by aircraft and helicopters.

According to an estimate in the Wall Street Journal, Russia aims to produce 500 Shaheds per month. The numbers of drones now being launched suggest other types are now involved.

As we reported in August 2023, the tenants were evicted from the Italmas shopping mall, 700 miles east of Moscow when the Aersocan company acquired it as a drone factory. The factory is for a new model, Izdelie 54 ('Product 54') described a loitering munition with a range of over 200 kilometers. Product 52 and Product 53 from Aersocan subsidiary ZALA are two versions of the highly successful Lancet tactical kamikaze drone, while Product 55 is a 'jam-proof' kamikaze FPV.

Product-54 was seen in the background of TV news footage when Putin visited an Aersocan facility in September 2023. It has a delta-wing layout similar to the Shahed.

Towards the end of 2023 Russian media reported the new drones in action though this was not confirmed. The drones were described as being smaller than the familiar Shaheds, and their engine makes a different noise; this was identified at Product-54 and has been given the nickname Italmas. Others call them 'lawnmowers' from the engine sound, to distinguish them from Shaheds, which are called 'mopeds'.

The Italmas has a DLE 60-type engine, a popular 60 cc engine for hobby drones from Chinese makers DLE engines. This delivers a fraction of the power of the Shahed's MD550 engine, reinforcing the impression that Italmas is a lighter, cheaper drone with a small warhead, thrown in to add to the numbers and confuse defenders.

Images of another new Russian drone appeared on social media sites in July. This is also smaller than the Shahed and as a different configuration with a conventional tail.

A Russian unit called Stalin's Falcons posted further details in a video later that month. They say the new drone is called Gerbera (another flower), and can carry out reconnaissance or decoy missions in addition to kamikaze attacks. Gerbera has a camera in its nose, and the video shows it can be guided visually to the target. A captured unit also had a SIM card and modem, so in theory it could be guided from long range via the cellphone network. It is a product of the Gastello Design Bureau, rather than any of the majors; the name 'Gastello,' from a famous Soviet pilot, was previously used for a Russian FPV which may be from the same makers.

Gerbera is described as Shahed's 'little sister', again implying a smaller payload. Further details such as warhead and range are unknown, but given that a Gerbera was brought down outside Kyiv it can travel several hundred kilometers at least. Ukrainian sources suggest that Gerberas main role is as a decoy.

The most alarming new drone is the Garpiya-3 (""Harpy-3""). According to a report in Reuters, the Garpiya-3 was designed by a subsidiary of Russian state-owned weapons company Almaz-Antey and has a range of about 2,000 km / 1200 miles with a warhead of 50 kilos / 110 lbs .

According to Reuters, Garpiya-3 does not just use Chinese components but will be produced ""at scale at a factory in China.""

We already knew that China made Shahed-type attack drones. A video from September 2023 shows the test of a Chinese Sunflower-200 drone - another flower name, and apparently a straight copy of the Shahed. One Chinese company even briefly offered another Shahed clone in the Ali Baba online marketplace. Officially sold for 'surveying, mapping, inspection' the $57,000 XHZ-50 with its 50 kilo / 110-pound payload offered strategic attack capability for the price of an SUV.

If China actually uses its industrial drone capacity to supply Russia with strategic weapons, then the number of drones will be limited only by Russia's ability to pay for them. Reuters have seen documents indicating that two Garpiya-3s have already been delivered to Almaz-Antey in Russia via a Russian intermediary. The delivery dates were not known, so larger shipments may already have been made.

Ukraine has beaten back waves of 400-600 Shaheds a month. Fighting off twice or three times that number with dwindling reserves of surface-to-air missiles will be a bigger challenge. The infrastructure has taken a pummeling over the last two and a half years, and further intense bombardment could tear holes in it.

Greater discrimination is important. If the defenders can separate the smaller Gerbera and Italmas they can concentrate their efforts on the real threat. And if new FPV interceptor drones, which have been effective against Russian reconnaissance drones, prove effective against Shaheds they will be a game changer.

Two things are clear. One is that Ukraine needs better air defenses, something the West can help with. Another is that no country, except possibly Israel, is ready for the sort of massed long-range drone barrage likely to feature in any future war anywhere in the world."
'Economy way better under Trump': Black voters share if they were better off 4 years ago,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/economy-way-better-under-trump-black-voters-share-were-better-off-4-years-ago,2024-10-01T09:09:05Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Black voters across several states spoke with Fox News Digital about whether they were far better off 4 years ago under former President Trump. Voters from Atlanta, Chicago, and Detroit shared if their financial situations had improved or gotten worse since the Biden-Harris administration took over.

One Black man from Chicago said that he has been ""shaking"" under the current economy.

""[The economy has gotten] really moreso worse. A lot of stuff hasn't really been getting better,"" Emmanuel told Fox News Digital. ""Everything went up.""

""Inflation has been terrible. And the person that was in the office there, he wasn't really doing too much for us,"" Atlanta resident Marcellus said.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

""When Trump was in office, it was gas prices that were lower,"" he added.

However, several voters said because Harris has not served as president, led them to believe she still has a chance to prove herself.

""Kamala, from my understanding, has never really been in office as the president like that ... she has been vice president,"" said Porter, a student at Harold Washington College in Chicago.

Porter, who lived in the Windy City his entire life, said ""I would say that I would have no answer for that. But I believe that when Kamala is elected towards office, her policies and what she believes in will better fit my needs as a person.""

Anneliese, another Chicago resident, said that she ""was absolutely not better under the Trump presidency.""

""Well, I wasn't under Kamala's leadership as president. I was under her vice presidency, so she was never president. Some people also get that messed up,"" she said. ""Ever since Trump started running, I experienced a lot more ... racial discrimination, gender discrimination. And I can't speak to the Kamala presidency because she hasn't been president yet.""

In Atlanta, Tim, raised the fact that Harris has never served as president.

""That's a question that we don't know yet. Right? Kamala not even in office yet, so we can't speak on it,"" Tim said. ""We just want to speak from what we can see, we have experience living under. So I guess you won't have to just wait for Kamala and see what Trump did.""

'HE HAS A WAY OF CONNECTING WITH OUR PEOPLE': SOUTHSIDE CHICAGO RESIDENT BELIEVES TRUMP IS GAINING SUPPORT

Over in Michigan, Black voters weighed in on whether they were better off under either candidate, with one of them saying that Harris ""did not do anything.""

Ithmamqureshi told Fox News Digital that he was better off under Trump.""Obviously, life was better and all that,"" Ithmamqureshi, a student in Detroit and Hamtramck native, told Fox News Digital. ""The economy was better ... life was better. COVID did take a hit and change everything to the fullest. But I would say life was better before 2020.""

""I want be biased, but I want to say I think its time for history to be made. I just think that its going to be a woman president,"" Detroit resident Mandela said.

""Trump. Them [stimulus checks] was fire tho,"" east side Detroit resident Keandre said. ""Definitely, when Trump was in office, it was gas prices that were lower."""
How young Republicans and Democrats are whipping up votes in key districts,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5123646/donald-trump-kamala-harris-georgia-election-young-voters,2024-10-01T09:06:16Z,"A member of the Young Republicans fills out a postcard asking for support for GOP candidates in Georgia. Nydia Blas for NPR hide caption

In a bustling restaurant in northwest Atlanta, roughly a dozen young Republicans are surrounded by pitchers, chips and salsa, chatting and laughing as they fill out postcards.

""Anybody need a drink?"" calls Winslow Jones, the president of Atlanta Young Republicans.

The group has met for what they're calling Margaritas and Mailers, and today they are handwriting postcards asking for support for two down-ballot GOP candidates running in nearby districts.

""Margaritas help,"" Jones laughs. ""This is an environment where people can come and connect with likeminded people.""

As election day nears, all eyes are once again on Georgia and its 16 electoral votes. And this time, one essential voting bloc is getting a lot of attention: millennials and Gen Z.

Voters under 44 years old will make up about half the eligible voting population in the U.S. this fall, according to population projections from the U.S. Census Bureau. NPR traveled to Atlanta to see how different groups of young organizers are approaching this moment.

At the Young Republican meet-up, Jones points to the intellectual diversity among its members, including the varying opinions on former President Donald Trump.

""I think across the board there can be mixed feelings about Trump,"" she says. ""But I think what we're all united on is this is a much bigger picture here that we need to look at ... issues that are affecting people at large.""

Jones says the issues resonating with younger conservatives like herself include the economy, the U.S.-Mexico border and crime.

Nearby, Jacquelyn Harn is also busy writing postcards. She's the chairwoman of the statewide group, Young Republicans of Georgia.

""We're excited for a change,"" Harn says when asked about Trump's 2024 run. ""We want the life that we had four years ago when President Trump was president. And his policies -- his conservative policies -- we need those back, and we want those to be able to achieve our version of the American dream again.""

Harn says young people have been hit hard by the economy and inflation. She points to housing and the fact that she can't afford to buy a house because she's ""paying rent out the wazoo every month."" And she doesn't see that changing if Kamala Harris wins.

""She's saying day one, she's going to fix the housing crisis and the pricing and inflation,"" Harn says. ""She's had three-and-a-half years to do that, so no one's buying it.""

Yet while younger Republicans in Atlanta are mobilizing, young conservatives in general are becoming increasingly rare, says Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University.

""Since the Obama years, the youth vote really has sided with the Democratic presidential candidate more often than not,"" Swint told NPR. ""The only question has been, what's the size of that turnout for the Democratic candidate?""

Back at the Margaritas and Mailers event, NPR asks Harn if it's harder for Republican groups to fire up younger voters who may be watching Harris, who is nearly 20 years younger than Trump and has landed high-profile endorsements likely to resonate with young people, like from Taylor Swift.

Harn says she isn't fazed: ""Taylor Swift is a billionaire who doesn't have to worry about how much groceries costs ... you can't tell me she relates to the average person around this table tonight. So if the best they can do is a celebrity endorsement that is not relatable at all, I don't see what they're doing.""

In the two months since President Biden stepped aside and Harris took the top of the ticket, Democratic groups in Georgia have shifted their campaigning into overdrive.

""Things just got crazy out of nowhere,"" says Davante Jennings, the president of Young Democrats of Georgia. ""Like, more people involved, more support, more work, more canvassing, more text banking. But it's good.""

When we meet Jennings recently at the Atlanta headquarters of the Harris-Walz campaign, he is joined by a dozen 20-somethings all typing on laptops set up on white folding tables, surrounded by pizza boxes. At the front of the room, a screen shows dozens more joining via Zoom. This is a joint text banking event, co-hosted by Young Democrats of Georgia, Men4Choice and Reproductive Freedom for All.

For organizers like Jennings, the goal is to hold onto the wave of enthusiasm Harris' candidacy generated and use it to mobilize all Georgians. At this event, they sent about 64,000 texts, all aimed at a very specific group: men of color, 27 to 50 years old.

""The backbone of the Democratic Party is the Black vote, which is why the Republicans are heavily focused on Black men specifically,"" Jennings says. ""When we show up ... elections seem to kind of flip. And right now it's not 100% guaranteed that we're going to get all of the Black vote.""

Jennings is also acutely aware of how seemingly small moments can build momentum. He just took over as the Young Democrats president from Parker Short, who recently went viral for lip-syncing Kendrick Lamar at a Harris rally in Atlanta. Jennings says the group got a lot more inquiries from potential organizers after that.

Yet while the Harris-Walz campaign is leaning hard into online messaging, embracing memes and viral moments on platforms like TikTok, political science professor Bernard Fraga of Emory University says it may have its limits. It's one thing to have that support from young people online, he says, it's another to turn that into ballots.

""It still remains to be seen whether the Harris campaign can continue that momentum all the way into November and make sure that Gen Z and younger voters are mobilized and active participants in our democracy,"" he told NPR.

Outside of campaigning for either party, a swathe of nonpartisan groups operate in Georgia and are working to simply make sure young people are politically engaged.

Among them is Rise, a nonprofit organization specifically targeting Gen Z students. It recruits ambassadors and pays them $3 for every person they get to pledge to vote. We met Rise's Georgia organizers recently in an area of Atlanta that includes a number of HBCUs, like Morehouse, Spelman and Clark Atlanta University.

In a presentation to a group of college students interested in becoming ambassadors, Rise's leaders tell them to highlight issues that are likely to resonate.

""How many folks in here have been impacted by gun violence?"" asks Aunna Dennis, Rise's director of Georgia. Nearly every hand in the room goes up.

Dennis tells NPR the aim is to mobilize millions of young voters across the country, but specifically in Georgia.

""We got 12 million voters here in this area alone, we have over five million registered voters. And we can unleash the youth wave on each of these campus communities,"" she says. ""That's a win for us.""

Meanwhile, at Kennesaw State University, nonprofit Poder Latinx has come to campus for National Voter Registration day. On the campus lawn, organizers are handing out pins, stickers, drinks -- even bottles of Tajin -- waving students over to the tent and encouraging them to register. By the end of the day, 81 new voters had registered, taking the total to more than 1,100 since Poder Latinx started doing this in March.

One of the students that came by the table was 19-year-old Iambianze Jackson. She told us she is planning to vote for Harris this November, but is less than enthusiastic.

""She doesn't really explain her policies well,"" Jackson says. ""She mainly talks about tax cuts for the middle class but like, she doesn't really have policies.""

And then Jackson says something we heard from a few people in this battleground state: The election can't come fast enough.

""I'm ready for it to be over,"" Jackson says with a laugh. ""I'm ready for the results to come out so we can just proceed from there, whatever happens."""
Claudia Sheinbaum to be sworn in as the 1st female president of Mexico,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25648/claudia-sheinbaum-female-president-mexico,2024-10-01T06:38:50Z,"MEXICO CITY -- Claudia Sheinbaum will take the oath of office Tuesday as Mexico's first female president in more than 200 years of independence, promising to protect an expanded social safety net and fight for the poor like her predecessor, but facing pressing problems.

The 62-year-old scientist-turned-politician will receive a country with a number of immediate challenges, foremost among them stubbornly high levels of violence, a sluggish economy and hurricane-battered Acapulco.

Sheinbaum romped to victory in June with nearly 60% of the vote, propelled largely by the sustained popularity of her political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

He took office six years ago declaring ""For the good of all, first the poor,"" and promising historical change from the neoliberal economic policies of his predecessors. Sheinbaum promised continuity from his popular social policies to controversial constitutional reforms to the judiciary and National Guard rammed through during his final days in office.

Despite her pledge of continuity, she is a very different personality.

""López Obrador was a tremendously charismatic president and many times that charisma allowed him to cover up some political errors that Claudia Sheinbaum will not have that possibility of doing,"" said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political analyst at Mexico's Center for Economic Research and Teaching. ""So, where López Obrador was charismatic, Claudia Sheinbaum will have to be effective.""

He is not leaving her an easy situation.

Her first trip as president will be to the flood-stricken Pacific coast resort of Acapulco.

Hurricane John, which struck as a Category 3 hurricane last week and then reemerged into the ocean and struck again as a tropical storm, caused four days of incredibly heavy rain that killed at least 17 people along the coast around Acapulco. Acapulco was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, and had not recovered from that blow when John hit.

Sheinbaum must also deal with raging violence in the cartel-dominated northern city of Culiacan, where factional fighting within the Sinaloa cartel broke out after drug lords Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after they flew there in a small plane on July 25.

López Obrador has long sought to avoid confronting Mexico's drug cartels and has openly appealed to the gangs to keep the peace among themselves, but the limitations of that strategy have become glaringly apparent in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, where gun battles have raged on the city's streets. Local authorities and even the army -- which López Obrador has relied on for everything -- have essentially admitted that the fighting will only end when the cartel bosses decide to end it.

But that's only the latest hotspot.

Drug-related violence is surging from Tijuana in the north to Chiapas in the south, displacing thousands.

While Sheinbaum inherits a huge budget deficit, unfinished construction projects and a burgeoning bill for her party's cash hand-out programs -- all of which could send financial markets tumbling -- perhaps her biggest looming concern is the possibility of a victory for Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.

Trump has already vowed to slap 100% tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico. Though that would likely violate the current U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, there are other things Trump could do to make life difficult for Sheinbaum, including his pledge of massive deportations.

Things with its northern neighbor were already tense after López Obrador said he was putting relations with the U.S. embassy ""on pause"" after public criticism of the proposed judicial overhaul.

First lady Jill Biden struck an optimistic tone for relations with the incoming Sheinbaum administration saying at a reception Monday that, ""Under Dr. Sheinbaum's presidency I know we will continue to build a more prosperous, safe and democratic region -- and take the steps in our U.S.-Mexico partnership.""

There are areas where Sheinbaum could try to take Mexico in a new direction. For example, she has a Ph.D. in energy engineering and has spoken of the need to address climate change. López Obrador built a massive new oil refinery and poured money into the state-owned oil company. But his budget commitments do not leave her much room to maneuver.

Jennifer Piscopo, professor of gender and politics at the Royal Holloway University of London who has studied Latin America for decades, said Mexico electing its first female leader is important because it will show girls they can do it too, but it can also create unrealistic expectations.

""Woman firsts are powerful symbols, but they do not gain magic power,"" she said. ""Especially when the governance challenges are so large, expecting magic solutions overnight can also generate outsized disappointment."""
Workers Across Major East Coast Ports Launch Strike That Could Have Major Economic Impact,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2024/10/01/workers-across-major-east-coast-port-launch-strike-which-could-have-major-economic-impact/,2024-10-01T05:24:03Z,"Dockworkers across all major ports along the East Coast began striking on Tuesday, in a move that could significantly impact the U.S. economy just weeks before the presidential elections.

45,000. That is the number of port workers the ILA represents across 14 major east coast ports impacted by the shutdown. The affected ports are Baltimore; Boston; Charleston, South Carolina; Jacksonville, Florida; Miami; Houston; Mobile; New Orleans; New York/New Jersey; Norfolk, Virginia; Philadelphia; Savannah, Georgia; Tampa, Florida; and Wilmington, Delaware."
"Dockworkers begin walking picket lines, risking to snarl East and Gulf Coast ports",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5133391/dockworkers-strike-east-gulf-coast-ports-shipping,2024-10-01T05:17:07Z,"BALTIMORE -- Union dockworkers along East Coast ports began walking picket lines early Tuesday, threatening to halt the movement of billions of dollars' worth of goods including furniture, paper, shoes, manufacturing components, farm machinery and much more.

Workers began forming picket lines outside of East Coast ports shortly after midnight, even though the International Longshoremen's Association had not yet released a statement. The pickets began just after midnight, after talks between the ILA and the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents ocean carriers and port operators, apparently failed to yield a new contract. Workers were seen picketing near the Dundalk Marine Terminal in Baltimore, Maryland.

The two sides have not met face-to-face since June. They appear to be far apart on key issues. The alliance asked for an extension Monday, a request that went unanswered by the union.

Despite pressure from House Republicans and more than 170 industry groups, who warned that a strike will have a devastating impact on the economy, the Biden administration is standing firm in its decision to let the collective bargaining process play out.

""I don't believe in Taft-Hartley,"" President Biden told reporters on Sunday, citing the federal law that allows the President to call for an 80-day cooling off period when the nation's safety is at risk.

How big an economic impact the strike will have depends on how long it lasts.

The strike affects work at 14 ports along the East and Gulf Coasts, according to the U.S. Maritime Alliance. They are the Ports of Boston, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Norfolk, Wilmington, Charleston, Savannah, Jacksonville, Miami, Tampa, Mobile, New Orleans and Houston.

More than $2 billion worth of goods typically flow through these ports daily, from cars and clothing to bourbon and bananas.

That includes more than half of all cargo containers coming into the U.S., or about a million containers a month. It also includes more than three-quarters of the containers carrying exports out -- about 327,000 per month -- according to the freight-tracking company Vizion.

Those volumes dropped sharply in recent days in anticipation of the strike.

""If it goes on for weeks, it's going to be a massive headache,"" said Vizion CEO Kyle Henderson. ""If it's just days, it's probably just a blip.""

Trade groups warned in a letter to President Biden that an extended strike would have dire consequences for the U.S. economy.

""It is imperative that the parties return to the table without engaging in disruptive activities that could harm the economy and the millions of businesses, workers and consumers who rely on the seamless flow of goods, both imports and exports, through our East Coast and Gulf Coast ports,"" the groups' letter said.

The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States notes more than three-quarters of imported liquor typically flows through the affected ports, along with more than 40% of the American spirits sold overseas. Halting those shipments could be particularly costly in the run-up to the Christmas shopping season.

""Consumers love to buy your favorite bottle of American whiskey or scotch or Irish whiskey or cognac as holiday gifts,"" says Chris Swonger, the council's CEO. ""Even a day's strike could have repercussions along the line.""

Companies have made contingency plans to blunt some of the economic impact.

Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a freight forwarding company, says customers already have diverted cargo to the West Coast in anticipation of the work stoppage.

""Really starting at the beginning of the year, it became very clear that this was going to be a major issue,"" says Petersen.

In recent days, he says, Flexport's focus has been on getting cargo out, so as not to incur hefty fees for containers left at East and Gulf Coast ports, and shoring up operations at West Coast ports in anticipation of a surge of activity.

Goods that are already on ships headed to ports affected by the strike will just have to sit offshore until the strike is over, Petersen says.

""The reality is, there's only so much you can do,"" says Jeff Sloan of the American Chemistry Council, whose members rely heavily on ports along the Gulf Coast and in New Jersey and New York. ""For large volume materials like plastic resins, there's just no way to feasibly divert that to other ports or to ship it in some other way.""

Two major sticking points are wages and automation.

In a statement Monday, the U.S. Maritime Alliance says the two sides had traded counteroffers on wages in the past 24 hours.

The alliance said its latest offer would increase wages by nearly 50% and triple contributions to employee retirement plans.

The International Longshoremen's Association had rejected earlier offers, calling them ""stingy,"" given the shipping industry's massive profits in recent years.

""Even a $5.00 an hour increase in wages for each year of a six-year agreement only amounts to an average annual increase of approximately 9.98 percent,"" ILA President Harold Daggett said in a statement last week.

Wage increases under the last contract, signed in 2018, were far more modest, with only $1-an-hour increases in four of the six years, bringing the top hourly wage to $39.

Jobs at the ports have traditionally been among the best-paying blue-collar jobs in the country, often topping $100,000 a year. But Daggett says the port operators should pay workers more.

""When they made their most money was during Covid, when my men had to go to work on those piers every single day,"" he says in a video posted by the union. ""They died out there with the virus. We all got sick with the virus. We kept them going.""

On automation, Daggett has been warning dockworkers that the foreign companies that operate the ports are seeking to replace them with machines.

The U.S. Maritime Alliance has said it's offered to keep the current ban on fully automated equipment and the requirement that any use of semi-automated equipment be negotiated.

At ports around the world and even on the West Coast, advanced technology is already being used to move shipping containers.

But at East and Gulf Coast ports, the International Longshoremen's Association remains staunchly opposed.

How many jobs would be lost in a transition to automated terminals isn't entirely clear. The shipping industry, backed by researchers at UC Berkeley, argues that automation helps ports stay competitive and handle more goods, which in turn creates demand for highly skilled workers.

The Biden administration says it's encouraged all parties to keep negotiating and to do so in good faith.

On Friday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su met with the shipping companies' representatives. They'd also ""been in touch"" with the dockworkers' union throughout last week, according to the White House.

It's clear the union has not been happy with Biden.

""Where's the president of the United States? He's not fighting for us,"" Daggett said in the union video posted in September.

The sharp rebuke came nearly four years after Daggett endorsed Biden in the 2020 election, citing his friendship and support while criticizing former President Trump for filling courts with anti-union judges and supporting so-called right-to-work laws, aimed at weakening unions.

In July, shortly after the first assassination attempt on Trump, Daggett posted a photo of himself with Trump, offered prayers on behalf of the union membership, and recalled ""a wonderful, productive 90-minute meeting"" at Mar-a-Lago with Trump in November 2023.

""I expressed to President Trump the threat of automation to American workers,"" he wrote. ""President Trump promised to support the ILA in its opposition to automated terminals in the U.S. Mr. Trump also listened to my concerns about Federal 'Right To Work' laws.""

While Biden and Vice President Harris have the support of the leaders of most labor unions, the same is not true for many rank-and-file union members.

In 2022, freight rail workers were deeply angry with Biden for signing a measure that imposed a contract on them, blocking a nationwide rail strike.

Now with dockworkers on strike and the presidential election five weeks away, the administration likely does not want to risk major blowback from labor groups."
72 days: Kamala Harris has yet to do formal press conference since emerging as Democratic nominee,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/72-days-kamala-harris-has-yet-do-formal-press-conference-since-emerging-democratic-nominee,2024-10-01T04:07:10Z,"'The Five' co-hosts discuss Vice President Kamala Harris' media strategy heading into November.

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 72 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Trump held his third news conference since the beginning of August last month in California, taking the opportunity to roast his opponent's home state and hold forth on a number of topics, including crime, immigration and inflation.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey last month at a star-studded campaign event.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

Google Doubles Down On Southeast Asia Investments With $1 Billion Data Center Project In Thailand,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/yessarrosendar/2024/09/30/google-doubles-down-on-southeast-asia-investments-with-1-billion-data-center-project-in-thailand/,2024-10-01T04:03:24Z,"Alphabet's Google will spend $1 billion to build new cloud computing and data center infrastructure in Thailand, deepening its digital investments in Southeast Asia.

Google said it will develop the digital facilities in Bangkok and the eastern province of Chonburi. The project aims to improve access to artificial intelligence applications and equip Thai's with digital skills, it said in a statement released on Monday.

""Google's investment in its data center and cloud region in Chonburi and Bangkok, respectively, coupled with growing Thai expertise in cloud computing and AI, are perfectly aligned with our national Cloud First Policy,"" Paetongtarn Shinawatra, Prime Minister of Thailand said in the statement. ""This synergy will accelerate the development of innovative digital services and in turn unlock economic opportunities and enhance the quality of life for all Thais.""

A recent Deloitte study projects that Google's latest investment in Thailand can add $4 billion to the country's GDP by 2029 and help create an average of 14,000 jobs annually from 2025 to 2029.The facilities in Bangkok and Chonburi are expected to meet the growing demand for cloud computing capabilities and AI innovations, as well as drive usage of the company's popular digital services like Search, Maps, and Google Workspace.

In June, Google partnered with Thai billionaire Sarath Ratanavadi's Gulf Energy to offer Google Distributed Cloud services in the country. The duo also plans to develop additional services within the Google Cloud ecosystem, including potential future ventures into AI and cybersecurity solutions.

Apart from its Thai initiatives, Google has commenced construction of a $2 billion data center and cloud infrastructure project at Elmina Business Park in Selangor, north of Kuala Lumpur. The project, which was originally unveiled in May, is projected to generate over $3.2 billion in Malaysia's economy and create 26,500 jobs by 2030.

""Google's investments in infrastructure, digital skilling, and sustainability represent progress on our joint efforts with the Government of Malaysia to create high-value jobs and bring the benefits of AI to local communities and companies,"" Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Alphabet and Google, said in a separate statement. ""Together, we will empower individuals and businesses in Malaysia to innovate, grow, and fully harness the potential of the digital age.""

As part of the deal, DNeX will offer cloud solutions in Malaysia specifically designed to meet the digital needs of organizations in regulated sectors, including public services, healthcare, and energy.

Underscoring Southeast Asia's growing importance, Google has been stepping up its investments in Southeast Asia. In June, it announced plans to will boost its data center and cloud infrastructure spending in Singapore to over $5 billion, a more than five-fold increase from $850 million in 2018.

Other tech giants including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have been ramping up investments across the region with a population of about 675 million people. with Malaysia becoming the region's fastest growing data center hub.

The Surprising Deregulation Legacy Of Jimmy Carter -- And Why It Still Matters,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/waynecrews/2024/09/30/the-surprising-deregulation-legacy-of-jimmy-carter-and-why-it-still-matters/,2024-10-01T03:33:36Z,"In the Wall Street Journal, former Texas Sen. Phil Gramm shared a compelling account of how President Jimmy Carter -- who turns 100 October 1 -- has not received the credit he deserves for the economic deregulation of the 1970s and early 1980s. Outlining the transformative legislative efforts of that era, Gramm wrote:

Without Mr. Carter's deregulation of airlines, trucking, railroads, energy and communications, America might not have had the ability to diversify its economy and lead the world in high-tech development when our postwar domination of manufacturing ended in the late 1970s. The Carter deregulation helped fuel the Reagan economic renaissance and continues to make possible the powerful innovations that remake our world.

Carter also deserves recognition for promoting the concept of a regulatory budget -- a notion now commonly associated with Republicans, but which Carter pioneered during his presidency.

A New Era of Expanding Regulation

While Carter's era saw a significant rollback in economic regulation, today's policymakers seem incapable of creating a similar sustained program for downsizing government spending, subsidies and the sprawling regulatory state. In fact, we've seen a return to, and even an expansion of, the regulatory frameworks that Carter helped dismantle with surges in economic, technology and social policy regulation.

Budget battles have been put on temporary hold with winks and secret handshakes ahead of the 2024 election, but trillion-dollar interest payments and a looming debt ceiling crisis await in early 2025. The successor to the Congress that just scooted out of town after approving yet another signature stopgap spending extension must acknowledge the urgent need for sweeping eliminations of federal departments and agencies as a prerequisite for meaningful spending and regulatory reductions.

As Gramm noted, Carter's elimination of the Civil Aeronautics Board was a significant triumph; however, new proposals for airline regulation have gained traction in the Biden administration. This underscores the reality that departments, agencies, commissions, and offices responsible for allocating spending and administering regulations are created far more frequently than they are eliminated.

What Happens to Regulations When Agencies Are Abolished?

As Congress confronts the reality that the federal government cannot -- and should not -- do it all, the question arises: What happens to the rules and regulations administered by a shuttered agency?

This is a key question for the 119th and future Congresses. The answer will depend on the specifics of ""Terminator"" legislation aimed at abolishing agencies. Such legislation should also explicitly repeal or sunset the rules and regulations once enforced by these agencies, ensuring that their regulatory influence and legal effect vanishes alongside. The aim would be for administrators to pursue other interests in the private economy or spend more time with their families. But it has not quite worked out that way.

Carter's Civil Aeronautics Board Example

Conscious nullification was uppermost in mind when the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 shuttered the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). The CAB's then-chairman Alfred Kahn, an ""avowed liberal"" according to Gramm, was unimpressed by the fact that ""Nobody could fly an airplane commercially on any route without specific permission from the Civil Aeronautics Board, and price competition, cutting prices, was illegal."" These restraints were ridiculous to Kahn, who memorably remarked to Time magazine regarding his tenure as CAB chairman, ""I will consider myself a success in this job if there is no job when I leave it.""

You don't find that sentiment much anymore. Under the Deregulation Act, government control over fares, routes, and market entry and exit was lifted. Without needing to ask Mother-may-I of the CAB, competition increased, prices fell and air travel -- once a luxury -- became democratized.

But exploitable regulation did remain. While many aviation regulations were abolished or modified during the Carter era, others resumed, such as certain consumer protections and safety regulations. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) -- within the Department of Transportation -- continued to oversee aviation safety (inspections and audits), aircraft maintenance, pilot training and certification, air traffic control, airport operations. Some of FAA's safety oversight practives have come under scrutiny today. FAA requirements also apply to advertising practices, and to compensation and remedies with respect to flight cancellations and delays, denied boarding, baggage handling and related procedures.

In addition, the Transportation Safety Administration's rise after 9/11 amplified security regulations governing passenger and baggage screening. Some sought to abolish the unwelcome TSA's ""security theater"" and privatize its functions. But the TSA remains entrenched, just as the FAA's regulatory authority has expanded to encompass new technologies like drones. Most recently, the Biden administration's Competition Council seeks to restore price regulation and other controls to the airlines -- and beyond.

Carter's CAB example implies that while legislation or administrative reorganization can end an agency, its regulatory footprint may survive or be transferred to other government bodies even when consumer protection and safety can best be secured by competitive disciplinary processes rather than administrative default. As CEI founder Fred L. Smith Jr. cautions, ""a pruned weed is a healthy weed"" -- regulations, once embedded, are notoriously difficult to fully uproot.

What Other Departments and Agencies Have Been Abolished?

Carter's elimination of the CAB stands as a rare example of agency abolition, yet even that has not been permanent. In the decades before and since, there have been few instances where agencies were truly abolished, with most functions instead simply transferred elsewhere. Consider the following:

1940s: Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration were abolished -- only to be revived in spirit by Biden's American Climate Corps.

1970s: The Atomic Energy Commission, the Energy Research and Development Administration and the Federal Energy Administration were disbanded, with their functions transferred to the newly created Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Energy.

1990s: The U.S. Information Agency was abolished, but its functions were absorbed by the Department of State. The Interstate Commerce Commission was abolished, but its functions transferred to the Department of Transportation and the Surface Transportation Board.

2000s: The Homeland Security Act disbanded the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) but transferred its functions to three then-new creations: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

2020s: We saw the abolition of the obscure Board of Tea Experts, decades after the Federal Tea Tasters Repeal Act of 1996.

These examples demonstrate that while agency names may disappear, the underlying functions -- and often the regulatory burden -- persist through other federal entities.

Takeaways for the Termination of Departments and Agencies

The primary lesson here is that true agency abolition is rare, and the corresponding deregulation rarer still. When Congress places departments or agencies in its crosshairs, such as the Department of Education termination being spearheaded by Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie, it will need to be exceptionally diligent to ensure that the government's reach is genuinely reduced, both in terms of spending and regulation.

The ideal outcome when abolishing an agency is the complete disappearance of its regulations. But achieving this requires clear legislative intent and mechanisms to prevent the transfer of regulatory authority to other entities, and to follow through with privatizations or restorations of authority to states and localities to prevent the regrowth of ""weeds."" Carter's deregulation of the CAB and the paltry inventory of examples otherwise show that while deregulation is possible, its legacy must be carefully guarded.

As part of the broader spending de-escalation and abolition of agencies, rolling back federal grants, subsidies, and the gargantuan contracting state would go a long way toward addressing both the budget crisis and regulatory overreach. These categories of reductions are the real weedkillers, and will be necessary for any successful ""Terminator"" legislation.

Vigilance: Upholding Carter's Deregulation Legacy

New champions of deregulation need to be ever-watchful, ensuring that reforms are lasting and that privatization, competitive disciplines, and federalism are reinforced and fully replace federal steering. As part of these reforms, new institutions such as a Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis (CORA) less inclined toward administrative control than the current Office of Management and Budget (now self-neutered by its new ""Circular A-4"" guidance on regulatory review) could help maintain focus. Naturally oversight hearings, reports, and consistent legislative action will be needed to ensure that agency terminations aren't undone by future administrations.

As Alfred Kahn wisely observed, success in the downsizing endeavor means creating an environment where the agencies themselves are no longer necessary. However, agencies are adept at protecting their turf, so we should anticipate resistance to any serious efforts at termination. The federal debt, projected to exceed $36 trillion, will ultimately compel Congress to make difficult choices, however. When that time comes, lawmakers can draw inspiration from Jimmy Carter's legacy. To him, we say thank you, and happy birthday."
How To Protect Your Mental Health While Staying Informed During Election Season,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nomanazish/2024/09/30/how-to-protect-your-mental-health-while-staying-informed-during-election-season/,2024-10-01T02:07:09Z,"Elections can be stressful for many reasons. More so when the electoral battle is as polarizing and bruising as the one currently unfolding.

Do your shoulders tense up when you hear a candidate speak? Does your stomach twist into knots when a family member brings up politics over dinner? You're not alone.

According to a recent poll by the American Psychiatric Association, nearly three-quarters (73%) of Americans report feeling anxious about the upcoming presidential election. Another survey by Pew Research Center found that about two in three U.S. adults find politics exhausting.

""Election season can be stressful because there are a lot of unknowns,"" says Dr. Dakari Quimby, LA-based psychologist and assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Southern California. People worry about who will win and how their decisions will impact policies, the economy, and, in turn, voters' daily lives.

This anxiety is further fueled by fear-based campaign messaging. Dr. Reneé Carr, clinical psychologist and host of Politics & Psychology podcast, explains that when you internalize these threats and feel helpless to protect yourself or others, your stress response is activated. And it increases as the final election day draws near.

Given how politics has become more intertwined with personal identity, many people also find it difficult to separate political beliefs from their overall sense of self, leading to more intense emotional reactions, notes licensed clinical psychologist Dr. Amanda Mead. This can make you feel more strongly about those with opposing views, which can strain relationships and add to the emotional distress, says Dr. Mead.

""Staying mentally well during election season is important, particularly for BIPOC communities, who might feel more deeply affected by the rhetoric of campaigns and outcomes of elections,"" says Dr. Quimby.

With political frenzy about to hit crescendo in coming weeks, here are a few coping strategies to protect your mental health while staying informed during this election cycle and beyond:

If you notice that election-related anxiety is impacting your ability to function normally, consider talking to a licensed mental health professional asap, as they can help you cope."
"The ""Saving Grace"" Of Today's Community Colleges",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brunomanno/2024/09/30/the-saving-grace-of-todays-community-colleges/,2024-10-01T01:42:00Z,"""Community colleges may prove the saving grace of college-level learning in America,"" wrote historian Sean Trainor in a 2015 article in TIME magazine.

Today, almost a decade later, two recent reports echo this notion in their call for community colleges to up their game and make a major contribution to improving the futures of young people and working-class Americans who don't have college degrees.

Both reports describe the role these institutions should play in expanding America's workforce education and training efforts, especially by greatly increasing the number of employer-connected apprenticeships and creating a new learning campus that combines paid work and education.

The first report from a group of economists is Toward a Potential Grand Bargain for the Nation, commissioned by the Center for Collaborative Democracy and published by the Bipartisan Policy Center. Its chapter on ""Growth and Mobility"" describes five strategies to improve economic growth and upward economic mobility. It includes a proposal for creating a more highly skilled workforce that involves community colleges and apprenticeships.

The approach described in the Grand Bargain has its complement in a report from Apprenticeships for America on How Community Colleges Can Help Scale U.S. Apprenticeships. It is written by four experts on community colleges and apprenticeships.

Both reports fit into a larger conversation in America on how young people and workers can be better prepared for careers and social and economic mobility. Vice President Kamala Harris has described this larger context as ""an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and the chance to succeed.""

She also has defined the problem we face doing this and a practical solution: ""For far too long, our nation has encouraged only one path to success: a four-year college degree. Our nation needs to recognize the value of other paths -- additional paths, such as apprenticeships and technical programs.""

I call this approach to creating additional paths to success opportunity pluralism. Creating more earn-and-learn apprenticeships through community colleges is a pivotal way to realize an opportunity economy where opportunity pluralism flourishes.

The federal government's authority over apprenticeship programs began in 1937 with the National Apprenticeship Act. It also gave states the option to register and oversee programs. Today, about half the states exercise that option.

These registered apprenticeships provide individuals with on-the-job training, pay for work and classroom instruction, and a nationally recognized credential when the program is complete. This approach has received bipartisan political backing at the federal level from Democratic and Republican administrations and in states as diverse politically as California, Colorado, Tennessee, and Texas.

Today, 27,000 registered programs enroll around 600,000 individuals, with roughly 70% in construction trades. That's only 0.3% of the U.S. workforce, the bottom of apprenticeship enrollment among developed countries.

Federal financial support is growing for apprenticeships and other workforce training programs. But it's far short of the billions of federal dollars spent on postsecondary education and training. A Progressive Policy Institute analysis of fiscal year 2022 shows that out of $139.5 billion allocated for federal postsecondary education and training, only $28.2 billion, or 20%, was spent on workforce development.

The Grand Bargain proposal for investing in workers' education and training through community colleges calls for expanding work-based learning, especially through apprenticeships. It also would expand other employer and occupational-connected training like sectoral programs. Doing this requires two elements: more education and training partnerships between community colleges and employers and additional federal and state financial support.

Financial support could come in the form of employer tax credits for training and federal and state program funding that is linked to pay for performance in achieving outcomes like program completion and job placement. While not often the case with economists, they add a word of caution: ""Economists do not have a good understanding of how to 'scale-up' these programs, so we recommend additional experimentation with rigorous evaluations.""

The Apprenticeships for America report argues that community colleges are uniquely positioned to experiment, scale up apprenticeship programs, and work with analysts to evaluate how these programs are working. It describes a four-part framework that community colleges should use to expand apprenticeships that includes:

1. Working with employers to design and deliver related technical instruction or RTI, which is made-to-order classroom instruction for apprentices.

2. Adding value to RTI by, for example, offering structured apprenticeship degree pathway programs or including the college's career guidance and support services in apprenticeship programs.

3. Sponsoring federally registered apprenticeship programs, relieving employers of the application process.

4. Creating apprenticeships across industries and occupations, reducing costs to employers.

The report includes other recommendations.

For example, rules for federal Pell Grants to students should allow them to use financial aid to pay for quality short-term workforce training programs not now eligible for support. Additionally, federal and state programs that fund apprenticeships should change from one-off grant programs to recurring formula grant programs. These would support a larger array of occupations and industries and use a pay-for-performance contracting model, similar to recommendations found in Grand Bargain.

Vice President Harris's idea of an opportunity economy for all Americans has earn-and-learn apprenticeship pathways as central to that economy's education and training agenda. Both reports recommend that community colleges play a major in creating these earn-and-learn apprenticeships. They assume a viewpoint that fosters opportunity pluralism, an education and workforce training approach that creates multiple pathways to jobs and human flourishing rather than a singular, preferred college degree pathway.

This opportunity program is built on an opportunity equation with three related elements that form the basis for individuals pursuing pathways to opportunity: Knowledge or what individuals know + Relationships or whom they know + Identity or who they are = Opportunity.

Community colleges can be that saving grace where apprenticeships make the workplace the new learning campus for young people and working-class Americans."
Bill Maher shocked by MSNBC's softball Kamala Harris interview: I didn't expect them to be 'rubbing her feet',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-shocked-msnbcs-softball-kamala-harris-interview-i-didnt-expect-them-rubbing-her-feet,2024-10-01T01:18:41Z,"MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle defended Vice President Kamala Harris not answering questions in her interview, arguing she is like any other politician.

""Real Time"" host Bill Maher appeared shocked by MSNBC's softball interview with Vice President Kamala Harris, taking a swipe at his recent guest Stephanie Ruhle.

""Working to shore up [Harris'] vulnerabilities, there has been a lot of pressure on her. She doesn't do interviews. She doesn't answer [questions]- so she sat for an interview. She said 'Ok, I will answer your hardball questions.' So she went on MSNBC,"" Maher quipped during his opening monologue Friday night.

""There were not-hardball questions, but I still expected not them to be rubbing her feet,"" the liberal host added, sparking laughs from his audience.

MSNBC'S STEPHANIE RUHLE FAWNS OVER HARRIS, SAYS NON-ANSWERS ARE 'OKAY': THESE AREN'T 'CLEAR AND DIRECT ISSUES'

Ruhle appeared on ""Real Time"" just days before she landed the interview with the vice president where she defended Harris not answering tough policy questions.

""Kamala Harris is not running for perfect. She's running against Trump,"" Ruhle said to Maher. ""We have two choices. And so there are some things you might not know her answer to. And in 2024, unlike 2016 for a lot of the American people, we know exactly what Trump will do, who he is and the kind of threat he is to democracy.""

The MSNBC host repeatedly fawned over Harris following her exclusive interview.

MSNBC'S STEPHANIE RUHLE CALLS OUT HARRIS FOR DODGING HOW SHE'D RAISE TAXES: 'SHE DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION'

""What I didn't hear from her was divisive language,"" Ruhle told her MSNBC colleague Nicolle Wallace. ""Imagine if I was sitting against Donald Trump, imagine the language he would be using, please! And just the fact that we were talking about collaborative inclusivity -- I don't know. Vote for her or don't vote for her, but isn't it great to just have a positive conversation right now?""

Ruhle admitted that Harris didn't answer a question about how she would get the funding for her ambitious economic agenda without Congress, but quickly defended her by saying Trump would ""balloon"" the deficit ""significantly bigger than Vice President Harris will.""

She went on to say it's ""okay"" for Harris not to offer specifics about her policy proposals and shrugged off the non-answers as her simply being a ""politician.""

""It's complicated, right?"" Ruhle exclaimed. ""We're a country of 330 million people, our economy is complicated. In the same way -- is the economy good or bad? It totally depends! So tariffs, if used in the right places, can work. And one could watch that and say, 'Well, she didn't give a clear, direct answer.' That's okay, because we are not talking about clear or direct issues."""
"Harris' ""Opportunity Economy""  Closes The Economic Gap With Trump",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardmcgahey/2024/09/30/harris-opportunity-economy--closes-the-economic-gap-with-trump/,2024-10-01T01:18:25Z,"With just over 30 days left until the presidential election, Kamala Harris is emphasizing an ""Opportunity Economy"" as a centerpiece of her campaign. Although Donald Trump held a substantial polling lead over Joe Biden on economic issues, Harris is now virtually even with Trump on economics. What's in her program that's closing the gap?

Harris' economic vision continually emphasizes the middle class -- not the poor, or minorities, or immigrants. They aren't central to her message and policies. Her campaign website says ""she will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans."" And the ""Issues"" page on her website leads, in big bold letters, with ""Build An Opportunity Economy and Lower Costs For Families.""

Why ""lower costs for families?"" Because the biggest economic problem faced by Joe Biden -- and still faced by Harris -- is inflation. An August CBS News poll found that ""76% of registered voters said it (inflation) was a major factor in their choice for president."" And in May, an ABC News poll found Trump trusted over Biden on inflation ""by a margin of 14 percentage points.""

Inflation was driven by the Covid-19 pandemic's ""supply shock,"" with disruption to supply chains, the economy, and prices. The inflation rate has been trending downward, with the current rate of 2.5% the lowest since February of 2021. But consumers remain heavily scarred by the pandemic inflation, which reached an annual rate of 9.1% in June of 2022, a rate not seen since the oil shock inflation of the early 1980s.

Harris doesn't duck away from inflation. Her program calls for bringing down housing costs by building more, but also for ""legislation to outlaw new form of price fixing by corporate landlords."" Another major provision would ""take down bad actors and bring down costs,"" calling for the ""first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on food and groceries.""

Economists are skeptical about these policies. Yes, investors buy many homes to rent them out. But the vast majority of housing investors are small local landlords, not big corporations.

And even some Democratic economists don't endorse the attack on price gouging. Jason Furman, chair of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, says ""this is not sensible policy...there's no upside here, and there is some downside."" But economists like Isabella Weber at the University of Massachusetts argue that large and powerful firms took advantage of the pandemic shock to raise prices and generate profits beyond covering their costs -- what she calls ""sellers' inflation.""

Of course, Harris is running for president, not leading an economics seminar. And her attacks on price gouging are very popular. A new poll for The Guardian did a blind test of Harris' and Trump's economic ideas, and found Harris had ""four of the top five most popular proposals."" The most popular of twelve policies tested in the poll? A ""federal ban on price-gouging food and groceries.""

That's one reason Harris' has closed the ""trust gap"" with Trump on the economy. A recent Morning Consult poll found Harris and Trump were equally trusted on the economy, a major gain for the Democrats compared with Biden's double-digit polling gaps with Trump.

Harris' economic plan goes well beyond managing prices. She promises to continue (and perhaps expand) Biden's support for US manufacturing, using trade policy (including tariffs) and subsidies to support critical industries like semiconductors, electric vehicles, and clean energy. She ties these to other specific policies to lower energy costs and help with the climate crisis.

Although Harris endorses strategic, limited tariffs, she opposes Trump's plan to raise tariffs on all imports by 10 to 20%, and on imports from China by 60% or more. She calls this a ""tax"" on American households, and economists agree with her. Economists at Goldman Sachs, the Peterson Institute, the Tax Foundation, and the Tax Policy Foundation all find Trump's draconian tariffs would slow the economy, penalize households, and cause higher inflation.

Harris also want to focus on care work, both for children and for the elderly, as important for the economy. Better care would help workers -- the vast majority of them women -- better balance care responsibilities and their careers. And it would help the women workers who provide paid care work while suffering inadequate wages and working conditions.

Although commentators criticize Harris for not providing enough detail on her economic policies, her proposals are a model of clarity compared with what Trump offers. The New York Times reports Harris has distributed an 82-page booklet on her proposals, compared to Trump who has ""coughed up a string of four- or five-word slogans promising tax cuts, some of which his advisers cannot fully explain."" '

Harris also is battling complex economic views held by voters. In spite of continued job creation, rising real wages, slowing inflation, and continued GDP growth, consumer confidence is sending mixed signals. September's Survey of Consumers from the University of Michigan rose 3% above August, ""as consumers' expectations for the economy brighten."" But the Conference Board's consumer confidence index suffered its largest drop ""since August 2021"" between August and September.

We're in the home stretch of the election, so don't expect significantly more policy details from Harris. Rather, she will continue emphasizing economic security and opportunity for the middle class, contrasting her optimistic vision against a bleaker and less coherent approach from Donald Trump. So far, that's working in her favor."

2024 Toyota Prius Vs 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2024/09/30/2024-toyota-prius-vs-2025-honda-civic-hybrid/,2024-09-30T22:39:15Z,"The current Toyota Prius, the longstanding poster child of fuel efficiency, is facing direct competition from Honda in the form of the new 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid. Both are outstanding vehicles, with plenty of positive merits -- yet which should you put in your garage? After looking at the closely matched specifications, the answer comes down to buyer preference.

Interior Space

Honda offers the Civic in sedan and hatchback body styles, while Toyota only offers a sleek hatchback. When considering the hatchback models, front legroom is nearly identical. However, Honda offers slightly more legroom room for second-row passengers -- a couple of inches, which could matter if you frequently carry four aboard. On that note, the Civic also delivers nearly another cubic foot of cargo space (larger, but not enough to matter, in our opinion).

Powertrain

The Toyota Prius has a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine with two electric motors (optional all-wheel drive variants are fitted with a third electric motor to drive the rear wheels). A continuously variable transmission (CVT) sends all power to the front wheels. Power is rated at 194 hp and 139 lb-ft of torque for the front-wheel drive model (the AWD model, with the additional motor, is rated at 196 hp).

The Honda Civic is also fitted with a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine with two electric motors -- it is not offered with all-wheel drive. One of the motors is used for propulsion, while the second is used as a starter/generator. Power is rated at 200 hp and 232 lb-ft of torque. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) sends all power to the front wheels, matching the Prius transmission.

Acceleration

While both share the same combustion displacement and similar hybrid configurations, the difference comes in how the power is applied. Honda uses its electric motor to significantly increase torque for the driven wheels, while Toyota relies on the combustion engine for much of its power. In terms of acceleration, there's a big difference. The Prius will sprint from a standstill to 60 mph in just 7.1 seconds -- swift an economical hybrid. But the Toyota's acceleration pales compared to the Honda, which makes the same sprint in an impressive 6.2 seconds -- downright quick.

Efficiency

The 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid is EPA estimated to deliver 50 mpg city / 45 mpg highway. Those numbers are quite a bit off from the 2024 Toyota Prius, which the EPA estimates at 57 mpg city / 56 mpg highway (front-wheel drive model). In terms of ultimate efficiency, Toyota cleanly takes the win.

Safety

Toyota equips the 2024 Prius with its Toyota Safety Sense equipment suite, including front automatic emergency braking, rear cross-traffic alert, blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, road sign recognition, and automatic high beams. Honda equips the 2025 Civic Hybrid with the Honda Sensing package, including front automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, automatic high beams, and road sign recognition (blind-spot monitoring and a rear cross-traffic alert system will be offered, but trim-specific). Both offer very high levels of safety equipment, without either standing above the other.

Which is the better choice?

Both the 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid and 2024 Toyota Prius are excellent choices, but they target different buyers. Toyota is not giving up the podium in terms of efficiency -- the 2024 Toyota Prius remains the fuel economy champ, so those obsessed with squeezing miles out of a gallon have a clear winner. Yet if driving pleasure and a bit more of an athletic flair are what you are seeking, the 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid -- quicker, sportier, and more traditional in appearance -- may be a better choice."
James Beard Award Winner Chef Pati Jinich Becomes Avocado Ambassador,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/claudiaalarcon/2024/09/30/james-beard-award-winner-chef-pati-jinich-becomes-avocado-ambassador/,2024-09-30T22:16:01Z,"Chef Pati Jinich has been busy lately. Aside from working on a new cookbook, her PBS show ""Pati's Mexican Table"" is going into its 13 season. Now, she has been named as the culinary spokesperson for Avocados From Mexico, the number one selling avocado brand in the United States.

With Jinich as the first-ever avocado culinary ambassador, the brand will encourage innovation with avocados for home cooks and culinary professionals. She will be sharing tips and recipes that reimagine the possibilities of the avocado, in addition to developing educational content for the brand, starting with her first curated collection of recipes.

Jinich has been working closely with the brand for at least a decade, as they have been one of the sponsors for her PBS series almost since the beginning.

""I feel like the recognition and the audience that we have is because of the support of partners like Avocados from Mexico that believe in this content, and so we're going to continue to go to different regions of Mexico, share the classic recipes but also new ways of using avocados,"" she says.

""I feel like the avocado really represents how Mexican cuisine is kind of borderless, and it benefits every country that it touches. That if you put avocado on pizza, it makes your pizza better. Avocado for baking is also super fun. I make these incredible oatmeal avocado and banana pancakes. I like avocado for chocolate mousse, too. It makes it so the consistency is buttery and moist, but at the same time it's good for you.""

Born and raised in Mexico City, Jinich is based in Washington D.C. and continuously travels across Mexico, researching recipes and working on her TV series. But she not only presents recipes for her audience to cook at home; she also goes deeper to explore the culture, traditions and current affairs of the communities she visits.

Her efforts paid off when the James Beard Foundation recognized her with the 2024 James Beard Award for Best Docuseries for the second season of ""La Frontera with Pati Jinich,"" which explores the people and cuisine of the U.S.- Mexico border.

""I thought it was the longest shot,"" she says of the award. ""I wasn't even able to go to the awards because it was my youngest son's graduation. But I went to the Borderlands specifically to talk to people about what their life is like. There's 31 million people that are enriching not only like their liminal space, but also two countries at the same time, and I feel like we need more content about our common ground, like how we enrich each other's table.""

Despite the troubles and difficulties the borderlands face, Jinich chooses to focus on the positive while shining a spotlight on the issues through a hopeful lens.

""Because people are seeing the Borderlands and the roles that Mexicans play in a different light, we're getting a seat at the international table,"" she says. ""And my role as avocado culinary ambassador is so important because it's like, look how much we're adding to your table. It's not only an ingredient that makes everything better, but it's also helping the economy of not only one country, but two countries. It creates jobs on both sides of the border, and I think all around it's such a beautiful thing.""

Jinich believes that a big part of what makes Mexican cuisine such a modern cuisine is that it continues to evolve. ""When I first started with Pati's Mexican Table and writing cookbooks, I really stuck to the traditional. This is how we do it in Mexico City. This is from Puebla. This is how my mother did it. But now, I think that you bring with you the techniques, the recipes, the knowledge that has been passed on through generations, but you have the freedom to play a little.""

""Mexican food is for everyone, and our ingredients are for everyone. And the more the merrier!"" she says. ""You learn new ways [of cooking] and being that open and not afraid of innovation allows us to play. I think that avocados really shine a light on so many things that we Mexicans are proud of - our resiliency, our creativity, our capacity for innovation no matter the hurdles.""

Another reason her PBS programs are so popular is her personality. It's practically impossible not to be captivated by Jinich, her positive outlook, quick wit and charming smile. As a bilingual and bi-cultural icon, she seamlessly surfs through the languages and traditions of both countries while gaining fans in both.

Having lived in D.C. for decades, she has fully embraced Thanksgiving as her favorite holiday because it's the time when everyone brings a favorite dish and sits at the table together.

""Thanksgiving is the time people are so eager to try something new and different, because it's like you have the classic dishes, right? You have the Thanksgiving turkey, you have the sweet potatoes, you have the green beans,"" she says. ""Whenever I bring something, I'll bring like an avocado and pomegranate and charred sweet potato salad, and everybody is like, 'wait, what?' But people are very open for these new things.""

""And it's not only that. It's what we bring to the table along with our food and our ingredients. Not only are we bringing our ingredients, like guacamole and avocado, but our traditions for the sobremesa (after dinner conversations) and for repurposing the food,"" she says.

""So, you make turkey today, and tomorrow you turn your turkey into tinga and make tostadas with avocado on top, right? And I think our food helps us share how much we enrich this country. We bring our hard work, we bring our sense of humor, we bring our amazing food.""

Pati's Mexican Table Season 13, premiered on September 13, 2024. The next episode will air on Oct. 8"
Hurricane Helene And Longshoremen Strikes Could Batter The Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2024/09/30/hurricane-helene-and-longshoremen-strikes-could-batter-the-economy/,2024-09-30T22:15:53Z,"The economic disasters began Thursday night at 11:10 p.m. when Hurricane Helene made landfall 45 miles east-southeast of Tallahassee, Florida. Initial projections of how much damage the winds, starting at 140 miles an hour, would not contemplate the degree of disaster that swept 800 miles north up the coast.

And all of that is separate from the International Longshoremen's Association's plan for strikes at 36 East Coast seaports run by 14 port authorities from Maine to Texas that handle half the cargo volume into and out of the U.S. that travels by ship.

Put both together and there is the very real potential of a force that could send the economy spinning sideways. Not today, but by the holiday season and into next year.

Hurricane Impact

Start with the hell of Helene. It's difficult to keep pace with the reports of death and destruction. According to AccuWeather as of September 30, 120 people are reported to have been killed during the ""once-in-a-generation"" storm. The ""catastrophic flooding, ferocious winds, and perilous conditions"" extend hundreds of miles inland. An estimated 2 million people and businesses remain without power. When the storm was raging most, the number was 4 million, the largest number since Hurricane Irma left 7.6 million customers without power in 2017.

Initially, experts from major reinsurance companies that backstop the insurance industry had predicted the potential of $3 billion to $6 billion in damages before the hurricane landed. Now those numbers seem ludicrously small because no one could have known what would happen.

AccuWeather noted the levels of rain hitting. Atlanta received 11.2 inches in 48 hours, breaking a 138-year record. Some parts of Western North Carolina received more than a staggering 32 inches. The current damage estimates are between $145 billion and $160 billion, making Hurricane Helene ""one of the costliest storms in United States history because of the devastating storm surge, damaging winds, and historic flooding.""

Entire communities are largely gone. Big areas no longer have passable roads or bridges. Getting help to those who need it will take a long time just to establish ways of reaching them. And different areas could have outsized impacts on the national economy. Georgia and Tennessee have some of the business shipping and logistics hubs in the country. Delays in getting back to normal could have rippling effects.

Port Shutdowns

As for the port strike, some experts say it is mostly about opposing automation to protect jobs in the future, even though having computers controlling cranes and other heavy equipment will likely happen anyway. According to others like Ron Leibman, a partner at law firm McCarter & English who has been practicing in logistics and supply chain law for 30 years, such typical issues of dues checkoff (employers deducting dues and sending them to the union), wages, and working conditions are likely the bigger issues.

Not that the reason matters to the economy. This would bring enormous import and export volume to a virtual standstill. Mirko Woitzik, global director of intelligence for Everstream Analytics, estimates that each day of a strike would require a week of work to catch up. A strike of one week would keep affecting the economy until after the presidential elections. ""General retail goods may be the only category not as affected by a short or medium-term strike action, as many importers anticipated that the strike would move forward and moved up the typical seasonal peak shipping season from September to August to stock inventories for holiday spending upticks,"" he says.

But some industries would be hit hard. Pharmaceuticals see 91% of containerized imports and 69% of containerized exports move through the affected ports. More than a third of containers leaving the U.S. with critical medications pass through the Port of Norfolk, VA. Agri-food will be heavily affected as well as automotive manufacturing, so the potential of higher prices.

Container and cargo ships are already waiting off-shore from ports, some delayed from earlier arrival because of Hurricane Helene.

Effects could potentially stretch through the holiday season and into 2025. There are wide estimates of the cost of the economy. The Conference Board pegged the price at $540 million a day. JPMorgan Chase analysts say it would be $5 billion a day, or 6% of GDP, as the New York Times reported.

In short, no one knows the cost, but everyone expects it to be a lot. Put together the storm and port strikes and that's a lot of economic impact before the holidays and through the election."
How Does Restoring Mangroves Make A Better Life For Fishers In Haiti?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/09/30/how-does-restoring-mangroves-make-a-better-life-for-fishers-in-haiti/,2024-09-30T22:08:38Z,"Conservationists in Haiti are helping to restore mangroves and through that effort, protect marine ecosystems and build a more sustainable income for fishers.

Between 2000 and 2016, human activity was the primary driver of global mangrove area loss, with urbanization being a key factor. In Haiti, the total mangrove area decreased from 16,462 hectares in 1996 to 14,759 hectares in 2016.

Jean Wiener, executive director of the Fondation pour la Protection de la Biodiversité Marine explains that that he and his team are active in Haiti's northern ThreeBays Protected Area, which at over 75,000 hectares, constitutes Haiti's second largest declared marine protected area.

""Mangroves serve as nurseries for fish and other sea life, protect the coast from erosion from storms, protect coral reefs from siltation, sequester carbon, produce oxygen at rates higher than rain forests,"" he says, adding that the NGO is training rangers, doing mangrove and reef rehabilitation, environmental education and a range of other activities aimed at generating alternative livelihoods for local coastal communities.

""We are undertaking some research to monitor anthropogenic impacts, and to continue to determine the best locations to develop marine protected areas, but our main work is with local coastal communities and providing them with the knowledge, skills, and opportunities to protect their resources while still making a living,"" he says, adding that they are also engaging in apiculture, ecotourism and helping fishers exchange unsustainable and potentially illegal gear for better ones.

""Research is necessary and great to undertake, but we are in the middle of a house fire and we need to put the fire out as quickly as possible, not sit around and continue to examine the situation while the house is burning down around you,"" he says, ""We have the knowledge and the skills on how to put out the fire; we just need the resources.""

In 2014, Wiener won a Whitely Gold Award and in 2023 received £100,000 (about $134,000) in continuation funding for stabilizing futures through marine and coastal management over two years.

Wiener grew up in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, but his family would often go to the beaches along the southern coast.

""I was always in the water: snorkel masks had just become really popular along with fins and I was face down snorkeling for pretty much the entire time we were at the beach,"" he says, ""I was examining every detail of the reef and its fishes in front of our favorite beach for hours at a time.""

Wiener explains that over the years, he observed a decrease in the amount of fish in the area, a degradation of his favorite reef, and an increase in marine pollution.

""This is when I decided that I wanted to protect these invaluable resources,"" he says.

Wiener explains that scientists from the Global South have the unique perspective and a deep understanding of the ""what"" and ""why"" of what is happening around them.

""Having been brought up in Haiti and later educated in the US, I have an important perspective which encompasses one of the richest and one of the poorest countries in the world,"" he says, ""I can and do easily understand the views, concepts, experiences, and expectations of probably the broadest spectrum of these two societies as they relate to conservation and protection of natural resources.""

Another group of conservationists, this time in southern Haiti, are helping communities and restoring mangroves in order to help climate adaption and increase biodiversity.

Guy Cezil, an engineer-agronomist and a member of a local organization called the Marbial's Sons and Friends Association (AFAM in French) has been working at Community Organized Relief Effort (CORE) on an ecosystem-based adaptation project in the Nippes department in the south of Haiti.

Cezil says that there are two projects being implemented in the southern peninsula of Haiti to protect coastal and marine biodiversity by strengthening the resilience of ecosystems, particularly mangroves.

""Putting ecosystems in good health to provide equitable ecosystem services is the project's main challenge, given the socio-economic vulnerability of the target communities, which are dependent on the natural resources available daily and require long-term economic support,"" he says adding that in addition to the ecological restoration of watersheds and mangroves, the aim is to improve the livelihoods of farmers and fishermen throughout the green economy (agriculture and forestry) and blue economy (fisheries and marine value chains).

""Ecosystem-based adaptation implies the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of a comprehensive adaptation strategy to help people adapt to the negative effects of climate change,"" he says, adding that 385 community members were trained in natural resource management and 45 fishers were trained in sustainable fishing techniques."
Why China's Struggling Economy Is A Huge Price Boost For Bitcoin,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/30/why-chinas-struggling-economy-is-a-huge-price-boost-for-bitcoin/,2024-09-30T21:57:17Z,"China's economic growth is slowing significantly. This year, it may fail to achieve what was already a low 5% annual growth rate goal. Beyond representing a significant economic change, this will have many implications for Bitcoin. It may well represent a hidden bullish factor as Bitcoin prices continue to test upward momentum after a couple of months of stagnation -- a theme I often explore in my book on Bitcoin + China.

Asset bubbles are being created in China, which has been responsible for the stark increase in gold prices. Since Chinese equities and real estate are down, there's a premium for exiting money from the Chinese system and getting a return elsewhere. Chinese investors have piled onto gold ETFs and government bonds. In 2022, Chinese savers were estimated to sock away over $2.6 trillion in the domestic Chinese banking sector. However, that behavior may change with interest rates now ticking down and more stimulus being put on the table. A persistently high Chinese savings rate unique among other nations may need a new place to go: with historic interest in Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other cryptocurrencies, Chinese investors looking for an exit ramp may just choose Bitcoin's allure - a path towards getting money out of the Chinese system and being able to transact with financial freedom.

With an exchange ban in the Mainland, over-the-trading counters are one way for Chinese people to buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. While some Chinese crypto buyers use exchanges with different addresses, many large buyers would prefer to work with OTC desks. Those OTC desks have recently seen record inflows since 2021, showing a rebound from when China imposed restrictions on Bitcoin mining and trading. This recent surge in price-boosting demand seems motivated mainly by the declining return on Chinese assets.

China's economic downturn has created pressure on both monetary and fiscal authorities to turn the economy around. The most alarming statistic is the high unemployment rate for youth. The central bank is decreasing interest rate targeting and loosening the money supply in China, which will help in the short term with Bitcoin's correlation with risk assets as central banks race with one another to fight growing downturns in the economy around the world. Already, Chinese investors are racing back from bonds to Chinese equities - risk assets more correlated with Bitcoin's price. In the United States, the Federal Reserve is also lowering rates and expanding US monetary supply, which will allow the Chinese central bank to also lower rates to keep the Yuan at the same preferred trading range as now and not to worry about a weakening Yuan against the US dollar (in fact, both may just weaken against Bitcoin.)

In the case of Bitcoin mining, it's estimated that about 20% of the global hash rate still resides in China despite increasing amounts of restrictions and province-level bans as of 2022. As local governments in China struggle to raise tax revenue because of declining land value, the prospect of working with companies that can leverage stranded power into tax revenue and economic growth becomes much more attractive - and may account for the surprising amount of global hash rate securing the Bitcoin network remaining in China despite the level of restrictions and bans.

Bitmain and Bitcoin mining companies were originally from China. Though tariffs have hit them on the American side and restrictions on the Chinese side, and now they manufacture mostly outside of China, they still maintain many offices in China. Many mining pools offering software that coordinates Bitcoin mining originated from China, and exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, and OKX did, too. As an economic downturn with few state-guided technological windfalls unwinds, the entrepreneurial energy dedicated to starting Bitcoin's momentum in China may now be directed towards Bitcoin again, along with increases in buying activity. Chinese entrepreneurs, businesses, and buyers will once again have the opportunity to contribute their efforts to Bitcoin - as I've written at length about in my book on Bitcoin + China. China's loss, in this case, may well be Bitcoin's gain."
Port Workers' Expected Strike Could Cost Billions -- Here's What To Know,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2024/09/30/port-workers-expected-strike-could-cost-billions-heres-what-to-know/,2024-09-30T21:28:46Z,"Dockworkers along the East and Gulf Coast are expected to walk out on Tuesday, a stoppage that could become one of the most disruptive strikes in U.S. history, experts and trade organizations said, halting the daily shipment of goods worth billions.

Up to $7.5 billion. That's how much the ILA's strike could cut from the U.S. economy each week, Grace Zimmer, an economist at the financial analyst firm Oxford Economics, told the BBC. Analysis from The Conference Board, a New York-based think tank, estimates a one-week strike could cost the U.S. economy about $3.7 billion, ahead of estimates of $2.1 billion from the financial research firm Anderson Economic Group.

The ports involved in the strike handle about 14% of all agricultural exports in the U.S. and 73% of all imports, according to the American Farm Bureau. Wilmington's port is the nation's leading importer of bananas, and about one-fourth of all banana imports in the U.S. will be impacted, the bureau said. The ports also handle more than 68% of all containerized exports -- goods sold in bulk, like food, raw materials or electronics, that are shipped in containers -- and about 56% of all containerized imports, CBS News reported. Perishable and non-perishable goods will also be affected, including cherries, wine, beer and liquor, as well as cocoa, sugar, furniture and appliances, among others. The Port of Baltimore handles the nation's largest volume of auto imports, according to government data. Other goods that could face shortages include tin, tobacco and nicotine, Zimmer said.

President Joe Biden has said he would not exercise powers under the Taft-Hartley Act to end the strike, despite requests from hundreds of business groups, according to CNN. The act could prevent a walkout for 80 days, after which time the workers could once again strike.

The USMX has claimed for months it has reached out to the ILA to negotiate a new contract while being unable to schedule a meeting. The ILA argued Monday the USMX has continued to ""block the path forward"" on a new contract, though the union did not specify how. If the ILA goes on strike, it would be the first walkout by dockworkers on the East Coast since 1977, according to the USMX. The group filed an unfair labor practice complaint against the ILA last week, accusing the union of a ""repeated refusal"" to negotiate -- a move the ILA suggested was ""another publicity stunt."" Several sectors have urged both sides to reach an agreement -- the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group representing retailers in the U.S., said Monday both organizations should return to negotiations to ensure ""these vital supply chain gateways are fully operational."" Suzanne Clark, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, reportedly called on Biden to use the Taft-Hartley Act by saying it would be ""unconscionable to allow a contract dispute to inflict such a shock to our economy."""
September Material Handling Data Reflect Mixed Supply Chain Dynamics,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/09/30/september-material-handling-data-reflect-mixed-supply-chain-dynamics/,2024-09-30T21:08:12Z,"Data from the material handling industry group MHI showed contractions in new orders, unfilled orders, inventories, exports, and capacity utilization in September 2024. On the upside, shipments and overall business activity expanded. Plus, future new orders expanded, revealing potential upside future potential in the year ahead.

Some U.S. industrial and manufacturing economic data have been mixed or weak recently, including durable goods orders and the ISM manufacturing index. Material handling data also falls in the mixed-to-weak data category following the September 30 release of the MHI Business Activity Index by Prestige Economics -- known in shorthand as the MHI BAI.

The material handling industry is comprised of manufacturers, technology providers, and other suppliers who provide the hardware and software to move goods through the U.S. and global supply chains. The data in the MHI BAI comes from leading executive members of MHI, which is the largest material handling, logistics, and supply chain association in the United States.

In September, data collected from MHI executives reflected more weakness than in most MHI BAI reports with monthly contractions in new orders, unfilled orders, inventories, exports, and capacity utilization. Meanwhile, there were expansions in shipments, future new orders, and overall business activity.

For the economy, this data should be watched closely. After all, weakness in material handling could imply that aggregate economic demand is slowing. Despite slowing new orders, shipments and future new orders have been solid. However, if those series were to weaken, it would be a bigger cause for concern.

In the MHI BAI, series readings above 50 indicate that a majority of the respondents reported increased monthly activity, while readings below 50 indicate a majority of respondents reported decreased activity.

Over the past two years, MHI BAI new orders have been weak, but shipments have been expanding. Based on a deeper assessment of the data, the relatively persistent strength in shipments for material handling companies appears to be a function of companies burning off the backlogs and WIP inventories that rose significantly in the wake of the COVID pandemic.

In September, 42% of respondents reported monthly expansions and 58% reported monthly contractions. More importantly, new orders have been weak recently, expanding in just 12 of the past 27 months. Unfilled orders have also been weak recently, falling to a new record low in September after expanding only seven times in the past 27 months. Inventories have also been weak, expanding just twice in the past 22 months.

Despite frequent contractions in new orders, unfilled orders, and inventories, shipments have expanded in 30 of the past 36 months. In September, 54% of respondents noted monthly expansions, while 46% reported monthly contractions.

The ongoing weakness in new orders, unfilled orders, and inventories against the relative strength in shipments appears to indicate that companies have been burning off their backlogs and running down WIP inventories.

MHI BAI future new orders have also been strong and were at a record high of 100% in September. This percentage shows that every single respondent expects future new orders will be higher in 12 months. The September three-month average for the future new orders series accelerated to 93%, while the six-month average was unchanged at 91%. Both of those averages are exceptionally high.

With high future new orders expectations and shipments still strong, some critical positive dynamics remain in play for material handling despite weakness and contractions in a number of series. However, if shipments were to weaken or if future new orders expectations were to fall, the outlook for material handling and the overall economy would soften.

Responses from MHI BAI are collected from approximately 30 leading executives in the U.S. material handling industry who sit on the MHI Board of Governors and Roundtable Advisory Committee.

What do you think of recent U.S. manufacturing and material handling data?"
Economists And Regular Americans Dangerously Disagree About Presidential Candidates' Proposals,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hershshefrin/2024/09/30/economists-and-regular-americans-dangerously-disagree-about-presidential-candidates-proposals/,2024-09-30T20:05:53Z,"Regular Americans and professional economists sharply disagree about the merits of key economic policies being put forward by the country's two Presidential candidates. This is extremely important because while professional economists seek to identify rational policies, regular people are psychologically limited in their abilities to engage in rational economic analysis.

Economic analysis is complicated, detailed, and uses sophisticated techniques. Most people lack the requisite skills to understand the analysis; and therefore, they resort to intuitive ""sniff tests."" These sniff tests are sometimes effective; but, not always, and it is the ""not always"" situations that can be dangerous.

The votes of regular Americans will decide the winner of the presidential election, not the recommendations of professional economists. Some might believe in the principle known as ""the wisdom of crowds,"" but that principle breaks down when the issues involve judgmental tasks that are emotionally laden.

An example where regular Americans and professional economists disagree is former President Trump's proposal that the U.S. levy a tariff of up to 20% on all imported goods. According to a survey administered by the Wall Street Journal, 47% of regular Americans surveyed support this proposal, despite no professional economist surveyed doing so.

Standard economic analysis indicates that tariffs harm the general public, even though they may benefit a few special interests. Tariffs work by imposing taxes on imported goods. These taxes are paid by the consumers of those goods, not the foreign companies or countries selling the goods. The point of these taxes is to reduce the cost advantage enjoyed by foreign competitors, thereby forcing Americans to buy ""made in America"" that is more expensive to manufacture, or of lower quality than what comes from abroad, or both. Remember, Trump is talking about imposing a 20% tariff on all imported goods!

The 47% of Americans who favor Trump's tariff proposal appear not to understand the economics of tariffs. Their intuitions are more likely influenced more by the language they hear from Trump, which is laden with emotion. For example, Trump describes tariffs as ""beautiful."" He avoids describing tariffs as taxes on American consumers, but instead says that tariffs ""will take in hundreds of billions of dollars into our Treasury and use that money to benefit the American citizens.""

The psychological elements in Trump's pitch for tariffs are highly germane, and apparently effective. The word ""beautiful"" has a positive spin, what psychologists call ""positive affect."" Avoiding the description of tariffs as a tax is an example of psychological salience, or the lack thereof: out of sight out of mind. The statement about billions of dollars flowing into ""our Treasury"" that will ""benefit the American citizens"" is intended to create a false image in which the 47% view themselves as being the beneficiaries of the alleged flows into the Treasury, rather than special interests.

Trust is the overarching psychological principal at work in Trump's communications about tariffs, and of course other campaign issues. The academic framework for the psychology of trust suggests that Trump's followers trust him because of four reasons.

1. They regard him as a friend, not a foe. He does tell them he loves them.

2. They regard him as having integrity, and believe his statements that the accusations against him in the courts are a witch hunt.

3. They judge him to be competent, and believe him when he says that, as president, ""I took in from China hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes and tariffs, and I had no inflation.""

4. They view him as predictable; and indeed, he routinely delivers the same basic messages.

Behavioral economics use the term ""nudge"" for interventions designed to alter people's behavior. The nudge framework has several components, such as ""incentives/feelings"" and ""mapping of actions to consequences."" Dark nudges are interventions that harm people, even though on the surface they appear to be beneficial. In respect to tariffs, dark nudging helps people feel as if our country is socking it to China. It helps think that doing so adds billions of dollars to the Treasury. However, the nudge is dark because the tariffs will do much more harm than good for the country.

Vice President Harris has proposed penalizing companies that engage in price gouging for food products. The Wall Street Journal reports that although 72% of regular Americans support this proposal, only 13% of economists do so.

Standard economic analysis focuses on the role that prices play in aligning demand and supply. Prices naturally tend to rise in the wake of a shock that either reduces supply or increases demand. Suppressing price changes typically creates market inefficiencies by reducing the motivation for producers to increase supply and for customers to reduce demand.

The 72% of regular Americans who support Harris' price gouging proposal appear not to understand the subtleties associated with the dynamics of equilibrium pricing. Research in behavioral economics finds that people instead focus on a perceived lack of fairness when the price of key products rise after the occurrence of an unfavorable event. The term ""gouging"" is emotionally loaded, and implies the violation of a right people assume they have.

Harris' economic plan, for lowering costs and creating what she calls an ""opportunity economy,"" states the following:

""Vice President Harris and Governor Walz's proposal -- like many of the laws already on the books in 37 states -- will go after nefarious price gouging on essential goods during emergencies or times of crisis. When an emergency strikes, the American people deserve to know the government can take on bad actors that take advantage of a crisis to excessively jack up prices.""

The details of Harris' proposal are vague, but her plan references the existing state laws that are on the books. Her plan suggests that she plans to introduce national legislation along the same lines.

Psychologically, Harris' proposal might redirect attention away from voters' perception that the economy is weak, and that inflation remains a threat. To be sure, the inflation experienced during the Biden presidency badly stung most regular Americans. They are still feeling the pain, still experiencing the fear of a resurgence in inflation, and by associating Harris to Biden, in her role as Vice President, connecting her to that pain and fear.

Nevertheless, the economy is currently performing well. The rate of economic growth is normal, the odds of an imminent recession are low, the unemployment rate is low, and inflation is coming down. The Federal Reserve is reducing interest rates, which sets the stage for future growth. Still, for many regular Americans, psychologically, it is the past inflation that is salient, not the state of the current economy: They find themselves experiencing the ""peak-end rule.""

Economists are right about the negatives of both Trump's tariff proposal and Harris' price gouging proposal. The gut instincts of regular Americans' psychology on these two issues are simply off.

The net costs to Trump's tariff proposal are much larger than to Harris' price gouging proposal. Imports are continuous, and therefore high inefficient tariffs are continuous. Moreover, Trump's proposal applies to all imports! In contrast, price gouging in response to emergencies is intermittent, and confined to a few products.

Economists have more disagreement with Trump than with Harris. In the Wall Street Journal survey, economists and regular Americans disagree more about proposals put forward by Trump than about proposals put forward by Harris.

In going to the polls this year, regular Americans should carefully reflect on where their gut instincts might lead them, lest they get what they wish for."
Biden's old backyard now a key Pennsylvania battleground filled with 'purple' votes,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-old-backyard-now-key-pa-battleground-filled-purple-votes,2024-09-30T20:05:23Z,"SCRANTON, Pa. -- While northeastern Pennsylvania's Lackawanna County has been a Democratic stronghold in state and federal elections, voters on the streets of the old coal mining region say the area runs ""purple"" and will likely be a nail-bitter of an election.

""It's not as blue as people think. It's more purple underneath because people are afraid to say anything around here because they think that there's going to be retaliation. That's an old thing that goes back generations around here,"" David Kveragas told Fox News Digital from a pizza shop on the main drag of Scranton as a storm sloshed rain across the Wyoming Valley last week.

Lackawanna County is home to cities and towns such as Scranton, Carbondale and Throop, mixing cityscapes backdropped by factories of a bygone era, and dotted with suburbs and expansive farms. The county has long voted blue in state and national elections, last throwing its support behind a Republican in 1984 during President Ronald Reagan's blowout election when he won each state except Washington, D.C., and Minnesota -- the home state of Reagan's competitor that year, Walter Mondale.

The county has trended right in recent elections, however, teeing up a heightened election battle that will likely help determine how the key battleground state will swing come Nov. 5.

ECONOMY, BORDER, ABORTION DIVIDE BIDEN'S HOMETOWN AS SCRANTON LOOKS BACK ON NATIVE SON'S FIRST TERM

Between 2000 and 2012, Democratic presidential nominees earned between 56% and 63% of the vote, U.S. News and World Report found. That standard fell below 50% in 2016, when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unsuccessfully ran against former President Donald Trump, but still carried a win for the Democratic Party's ticket even with the lessened support.

President Biden was born and raised in Scranton until the age of 10, when his family moved to Delaware. Biden's hometown status likely helped boost his popularity among locals in the 2020 election, winning 53.58% of the vote to Trump's 45.23% that year.

As the election cycle comes down to its final five weeks, Fox News Digital spoke to voters on the streets of Scranton to ask about their top election concerns and who they will cast their ballot for come November. Fox News Digital received a mixed bag of responses, with some voters proudly declaring Vice President Kamala Harris' support of abortion access earned their vote, while Trump supporters said voters only need to look at their pay stubs from the 2016-2020 era compared to today to determine their ballot choice.

""If you are a minority and a woman, what is the better choice? I'm not here to knock Trump or any candidate. But as a woman of Puerto Rican descent, I feel it's really important for us to really sit and discuss the pros and cons of each candidate. But especially as a woman,"" a local mom named Adrianna, who is supporting Harris in the election, told Fox News Digital.

BIDEN CLAIMS TO SEE THE ECONOMY THROUGH THE EYES OF SCRANTON, NOT WALL STREET

Adrianna is a mom to a young boy and said that inflation issues and childcare issues have rocked her day-to-day life as she has tried to find a daycare for her son for more than a year. When asked if she believes Harris will correct inflation if elected as president after serving as vice president for three and a half years, she responded, ""I hope so.""

""If you are a minority and a woman, what is the better choice?"" - Pennsylvania mom Adrianna

Adrianna said that while inflation concerns her, abortion is her top voting issue.

""I believe nobody should tell a woman what to do with her body, especially -- not to sound sexist -- but a man. I think that should be an individual decision that a woman should make,"" she said.

PENNSYLVANIA LEADERS IN BOTH PARTIES TALK GROUND GAME AS GOP SEEKS TO UNDO DEM GAINS: 'MASSIVE SHIFT'

For Trump supporters, the economy, inflation, national security and immigration came in as top concerns for voters.

""The price of gas is a big issue with me. I do a lot of driving. And I remember back in the day, you know, when you got $20, it'd fill up your gas tank. It's just going up and up,"" Trump supporter John Soentgerath told Fox News Digital.

""With all due respect to my Democratic friends, I have a lot of them, [under] this previous administration there has been less take-home pay. The prices of gas [is] up, food. And I like to eat like anybody else. You tell me any mother or father that doesn't want to put food on the table for their kids, give them treats, ice cream, goodies and things of that nature,"" Soentgerath added.

Larry West of Scranton told Fox News Digital from a bus stop near The Marketplace at Steamtown that Trump earned his vote for his national security platform as wars continue raging in Ukraine and Israel, saying Harris appears ""weak"" on foreign affairs.

""I'm voting for Donald Trump. And I just believe that as far as globally, I don't feel that Kamala Harris has what it takes to represent the United States globally. Like especially with all that's going on with Russia and China,"" West said.

I don't feel that Kamala Harris has what it takes to represent the United States globally. - Scranton voter Larry West

Kveragas told Fox News Digital that he is an independent who ""voted against Hillary"" in 2016, before becoming a Trump supporter while evaluating the 45th president's record in office.

HARRIS SUPPORTERS IN PENNSYLVANIA SAY WORKING CLASS WILL SUPPORT HER

""He straightened out the economy. He got the border under control. He cut regulations. He did pretty much everything you would want a -- a realistic person would want -- a president to do. So with this election, it's primarily the economy, obviously. My retirement was up 40% under Trump. I lost the 40%, plus another 20% under Biden. So things are terrible there. The border, which we're being overrun. Obviously, it's not just a matter of jobs. It's a matter of housing and crime fighting, fentanyl, which has run rampant. Fentanyl is killing more people than guns,"" Kveragas said.

On the flip side, a Harris supporter who identified himself as Michael told Fox Digital that ""women's rights"" is his top priority this election cycle.

""I believe that every woman should have a choice to make their own decision,"" he said.

Michael explained that the economy and inflation have also affected his life, saying that he works two jobs to pay the bills and that expenses were much cheaper a decade ago. When asked if he feels Harris is better equipped to handle the economy over Trump, Michael argued that while Trump is a ""businessman,"" he will ""ruin the country.""

""Donald Trump, he is a businessman, yes. But he's going to ruin the country. He's going to ruin it. And Kamala Harris, you know, she is more steady-handed. She doesn't think with an iron fist, and we don't need that. We're not trying to go to war with China. [We're trying to] actually progress in this life. That's the only thing that we do in this life is to share information and progress,"" Michael said.

GOP GAINS VOTER ADVANTAGE IN PENNSYLVANIA SWING COUNTY NEAR BIDEN'S BIRTHPLACE

Trump's and Harris' campaigns have respectively heaped loads of attention on the Keystone State this year, with both candidates repeatedly visiting the massive state, from its rural areas in the rolling hills to industrial cities in the coal and rust belts that run across the state.

Fox News Digital spoke to both a Trump campaign volunteer and a Harris campaign volunteer, who both work to register Lackawanna voters, door knock and motivate residents to cast a ballot.

Susanne Green is a Trump campaign volunteer and former Democratic voter who began supporting Trump and Republicans in the last decade.

BIDEN'S HOMETOWN SPEAKS OUT ON BIDENOMICS

""I grew up in a Democrat household. Here in the valley in Lackawanna County, we believed in 'Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you could do for your country,'"" Green told Fox Digital, quoting President Kennedy's powerful inaugural address in 1961. ""And it really does choke me up some because it's truthful.""

Green said that her politics have not changed, but that the Democratic Party has morphed into something she can no longer identify with.

""I haven't changed. The Democrat Party changed. I was a Democrat. I registered as a Democrat when I turned 18, and I voted Democrat in every election until 2016, when I really saw that that wasn't the direction that our country needed. Our country really needs to really get back to patriotism and believing that our country is great,"" she said.

ARMED SERVICES REPUBLICANS, WHITE HOUSE PUSH BACK AGAINST CLAIMS THAT ZELENSKYY'S PA VISIT WAS 'POLITICAL'

Green said that when she speaks to locals about the election to motivate them to vote, many Democratic voters will balk at the GOP's abortion platform. Green said she explains to such voters, most notably suburban women, that Republicans for Choice has long been a powerful vote in the party and that the GOP is not working to place a wholesale ban on abortion.

""I think we can all agree, or most of us can agree, that it should be legal and rare,"" Green said in a hat tip to the famous Bill Clinton formulation that abortions be ""safe, legal and rare,"" a sentiment that has since been purged from the party's platform in favor of more lax abortion access.

""That's how most women that I talk to in my experience over my whole lifetime have said that we wanted abortion to stay legal, but rare.""

Andrew Cutillo, a Harris campaign volunteer in Lackawanna County, spoke to Fox News Digital via a phone call this week and said that he has supported Harris since her campaign launch this summer and touted the VP as someone who can ""intuitively"" connect with Northeastern Pennsylvania voters based on her middle class upbringing.

""Kamala Harris is someone who, you know, intuitively understands what it's like to grow up or live in Northeast Pennsylvania and Scranton, Pennsylvania, as she grew up middle class. Her kind of focus has been on building a strong middle class,"" Cutillo said. ""Her focus is on supporting families and understanding what families and communities need, that they can live their lives, that they can not worry about paying grocery bills, not worry about paying all the expenses that come with just trying to raise your family.""

Cutillo added that when he's out door-knocking or speaking with traditionally Republican voters, including his own dad, people have pulled away from Trump because they are ""concerned for democracy,"" and view Harris as a potential president who would ""govern for the people who don't agree with her, too.""

He said despite the fevered political focus on Scranton and Pennsylvania at large this election cycle, Republican and Democratic neighbors in Northeastern Pennsylvania have and will remain friends no matter how the election shakes out despite any portrayal of ""divisiveness"" in the battleground state.

Voters in the area remarked that they have been inundated with campaign efforts, with West saying he's ignored some of the door knockers.

""I'm flooded with ads, flooded. They have knocked on the door. But I didn't answer the door because I saw what it was. But we are definitely bombarded with ads,"" West said.

Soentgerath said that he's seen ""a big push from both sides. And again, with all due respect to either side, the bottom line is, if you want change, get up, go to work and pull that lever on Nov. 5.""

While Michael remarked that while he hasn't seen ""too much out here yet,"" he noted he has seen more Trump ads than Harris ads.

""So that just means we need to work harder,"" Michael said.

Tony Monopoli is a Scranton native who has since moved to another key battleground state, Georgia, and told Fox News Digital that he is supporting Harris in the election. Monopoli was visiting Scranton with his brothers and spoke to Fox News Digital outside of the Lackawanna County Courthouse, where there is a veterans memorial.

""I think her plans to support small businesses by offering a $50,000 tax credit for small business owners is a big deal. I think her plan to offer $25,000 in first-time homebuyers' assistance is a big deal, given the cost of homes today. And also, the $6,000 child tax credit for the first year of a child's life is a big deal,"" he explained of his support of Harris.

Fox Digital asked Monopoli if he's seen more or less campaigning efforts from either candidate in Pennsylvania vs. Georgia, where both candidates are also heavily campaigning for votes.

TIKTOK CREATOR ROASTS OPRAH, HARRIS FOR FEATURING HER IN TOWN HALL INTERVIEW: 'I DO NOT SUPPORT HARRIS'

""I'd say it's about the same,"" he said. Remarking that he hasn't ""really seen any different"" in either area.

Pennsylvania will again serve as a key battleground state this election cycle as former President Donald Trump and President Biden are anticipated to face a rematch in a state that narrowly voted for Trump in 2016, and elected Biden in 2020 at a 1.17% margin.

For Soentgerath, he encouraged voters to do their own homework before casting their ballots, leaning on his concerns over the economy, he said voters should simply review their pay stubs from just a few years ago to help determine their vote.

The Fiscal Impact Of Mass Immigration On U.S. And European Taxpayers,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/30/the-fiscal-impact-of-mass-immigration-on-us-and-european-taxpayers/,2024-09-30T19:56:58Z,"A year ago, I shared with you my thoughts on the immigration crisis, both here in the U.S. and Europe. At the time, there was speculation that international bad actors may be at least partially to blame for the record numbers of immigrants pouring across the U.S. Southern Border and arriving by boat in Southern Europe. Below is an update to the story.

Immigration is once again making headlines (has it ever stopped?), and it's not just the sheer numbers that have people talking. Concerns about mass immigration -- both legal and illegal -- have dominated political and economic conversations in the U.S. and Europe.

Although the number of migrants crossing into the U.S. has eased significantly in the past 12 months, the underlying challenges remain. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the undocumented immigrant population in the U.S. stands at 14 million, a huge increase from just a few years ago. The share of foreign-born residents is now over 14% of the total population, its highest level since the early 1900s, when waves of immigrants came from Italy, Poland and elsewhere.

Today, the new arrivals are straining resources in ways that directly impact the American taxpayer and investor alike.

Let's take Springfield, Ohio, as a microcosm of what's happening across the country. You've probably heard that this town of 58,000 has recently seen a large influx of Haitian asylum seekers, leading to skyrocketing housing costs and a sharp rise in the cost of living. The median rental price in Springfield jumped 43% in just one year, according to Zillow. Locals are feeling the pinch at the pump and the grocery store as inflation ripples through their economy.

It's not just prices that are going up. Health care providers are stretched thin, as more translation services and additional staff are needed to accommodate the growing population. In September, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced $2.5 million in state support for Springfield, but the burden on local taxpayers is undeniable.

We're seeing similar stories play out across the U.S. as towns and cities grapple with the surge of new arrivals. In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams, recently indicted on federal corruption charges, reported last summer that the city expected to spend $12 billion over the next three years on housing, food and health care for recently arrived immigrants. To cover these costs, the city plans to cut services across the board -- sanitation, public education, even the police force. The fiscal strain is real, and it's hitting Americans where it hurts most.

What's happening in the U.S. is mirrored on a much larger scale across Europe. Over the past decade, 29 million immigrants -- both legal and illegal -- have poured into the region, overwhelming an already dysfunctional immigration system. Concerns about public safety and inadequate integration policies have led to widespread public unrest. Just look at the riots in the U.K., where immigration has emerged as a defining issue.

Investors should be paying close attention. Western Europe, traditionally known for its social safety nets and generous welfare systems, is struggling to accommodate this massive population influx. Europe's current situation is a reminder that unchecked migration, without the proper systems in place, can lead to long-term fiscal challenges.

Having said all that, it's important to recognize the value of legal immigration. With fertility rates having fallen well below the replacement level -- or 2.1 children per woman -- the U.S. and Europe face the prospect of near-zero population growth. Legal immigrants, then, play an essential role in maintaining productivity and supporting programs like Social Security.

The hard truth is that the U.S. and Europe face declining populations and a shrinking tax base. I believe the solution lies in smart, sustainable immigration policies -- ones that emphasize legal pathways and prioritize integration."
The Partnership That Can Save American Democracy And Its People,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petergeorgescu/2024/09/30/the-partnership-that-can-save-american-democracy-and-its-people/,2024-09-30T19:42:28Z,"Historian Heather Cox Richardson recently highlighted a shocking statistic about the political and economic trend known as neoliberalism: ""That system, begun in the 1980s, called for the government to allow unfettered markets to organize the economy. Neoliberalism's proponents promised it would create widespread prosperity, but instead, it transferred more than $50 trillion from the bottom 90% of Americans to the top 1%. As the middle class hollowed out, many of the huge numbers slipping behind lined up behind an authoritarian figure who promised to restore their former centrality.""

This $50 trillion transfer (calculated by researchers from RAND and featured in Time magazine) got me thinking. As regular readers know, I am a strong advocate for multi-stakeholder capitalism as the best path to driving better outcomes for all members of our society, including investors, executives, customers, employees, and communities at large. I've explored research showing that all of those stakeholders can win when companies give up the narrow-minded, ineffective mindset of shareholder primacy.

I now realize that there's another essential reason to embrace multi-stakeholder capitalism: it's also the best tool we have to protect and preserve our democracy. With the resources of government increasingly overstretched and diminished, only corporate America can reverse the hollowing out of the middle class that now threatens our political and social stability.

""Democracy"" comes from a Greek word meaning ""rule by the people."" And ""the people"" has always been the foundation of our country, highlighted everywhere from the Declaration of Independence (""It is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish [destructive government]""), to the Constitution (""We the people"") to the Gettysburg Address (""Government of the people, by the people, for the people."")

When those historic words were written, everyone presumed that ""the people"" could only be defended by their elected officials. It was the government's job to safeguard democracy, while companies were expected to provide goods and services for customers and jobs for workers. But that neat dichotomy between government and business has blurred to the vanishing point. Today's companies must accept their share of responsibility for helping to protect our democracy against dark and destructive forces from abroad and at home.

For nearly four decades following World War II, most corporate executives saw themselves as a force for public good, in addition to their role in seeking profits for their shareholders. Their decisions about how to treat employees and customers helped build the strongest, broadest middle class in the world, and generated enough tax revenue to help build the world's greatest economy and military. Partnerships between the government and companies led to tremendous public benefits, ranging from infrastructure like the Interstate Highway System and major airports to technological achievements like the polio vaccine, the moon landing, and the internet.

But as Richardson notes, a fundamental shift took hold in the early 1980s. Businesses increasingly stopped treating their employees, customers, and communities as equal stakeholders, instead focusing entirely on boosting their stock prices. The ensuing four decades of shareholder primacy have done major damage to the American dream of rising prosperity for anyone willing to work hard. OECD data shows that the U.S. is now the most unequal nation in the developed world, as well as most difficult country among our peer group for working people to achieve upward mobility.

These are not my opinions; they are facts backed by global research on the Gini coefficient, which measures inequality, and the Gatsby curve, which measures mobility. And these facts are consistent with polling and focus groups. For instance, one recent poll found that 60 percent of middle-class Americans are now ""struggling financially"" and do not expect things to turn around for the rest of their lives. Furthermore, 40 percent of all Americans said they can't plan beyond their next paycheck, and 46 percent said they don't have enough savings to cover an emergency expense of just $500.

The business community often focuses on systemic risks that can derail an industry or the entire economy. It's hard to imagine a worse systemic risk -- or a bigger threat to our democracy -- than a growing percentage of chronically struggling, economically immobile, disgruntled Americans. Individuals in distress find it hard to think of themselves as ""we the people"" and hard to feel good about voting or other forms of civic participation. So it's no surprise that rates of voter participation have mostly dropped in recent decades. When people become convinced that voting won't improve their lives, they tend to stop voting. And they become more open to radical alternatives, perhaps even violence and anarchy.

America has reached a crossroads: we can either reverse these ominous trends or watch them worsen into full blown crises. The big question is how can we turn them around?

Government alone can't do it. Neither major party can command the resources to reduce inequality and immobility, even if they had the determination to do so. The federal government takes in about $4.4 trillion in annual revenue and spends about $6.1 trillion, most of it pre-committed for defense, social security, health care, and other huge programs, and the federal debt already exceeds $35 trillion. The national piggy bank contains nothing but IOUs. Governments in other countries have tried to spread prosperity via various forms of socialism, including nationalizing key industries, but the results were always disappointing, if not catastrophic.

Corporate America has deep pockets, but that doesn't mean business alone can solve inequality and immobility. Unfettered capitalism tends to lead to monopolies that exploit their customers and employees, thus making these problems worse. For instance, in the late 19th century big business had so much power that it became unhealthy for every part of society. Giants like U.S. Steel and Standard Oil began to monopolize their industries, then abused their employees and customers. The government had to step in to restore fairness and reduce monopoly power.

The best option, whether in 1905, 1955, or 2025, is a productive partnership between government and business that enables a growing middle class and broadly shared prosperity. With a return to the mindset of multi-stakeholder capitalism, business can deploy its resources to improve conditions for employees, customers, investors, and citizens alike -- who are, of course, the same people wearing different hats at different times. And the government can and should be a supportive partner by enforcing reasonable regulations and a level playing field for companies, employees and consumers.

This partnership requires an end to mutual demonization. Business leaders can't trash government as the enemy of prosperity, because sometimes only governments can make essential investments that drive prosperity. No single company or alliance of companies could have spent enough to map the human genome, build the interstate highways, set up the air traffic control system, or link distant computers into the early internet. Capitalists must acknowledge that such huge public investments have unlocked enormous value for private industries.

Similarly, we can't encourage government to tear down the business community, including via punitive levels of taxation. Beware of any politician who doesn't recognize the amazing power of capitalism, properly harnessed, to drive broadly shared prosperity.

We know that a return to multi-stakeholder capitalism will work better for everyone, both by studying history and studying the present. JUST Capital, the nonprofit research and advocacy group where I serve as a director, ranks the 1000 largest public companies on how well they support multi-stakeholder capitalism. We've found that the top 100 on that index -- the ones that pay their people better, provide the best benefits, deliver the best customer service, and contribute to their communities -- also deliver the highest returns to their investors.

A widespread return to multi-stakeholder capitalism will also make people feel better about their country and therefore more likely to vote and participate in politics, strengthening the foundations of our democracy and greatly reducing the systemic risk of social disruption and chaos.

The headline is simple and clear. The 40-year era of shareholder primacy badly damaged our country and our democracy. A wiser, newer version of business governance, multistakeholder capitalisms, together with a supportive government can help our democracy and all our people recover and prosper. There is no practical alternative if we continue to want a healthy, stable successful nation of thriving and widely diverse citizenry in the decades ahead and beyond. Our role now is to choose and to act."
Behind The Seams: Empowering Women Through Sustainable Fashion,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmichelson2/2024/09/30/behind-the-seams-empowering-women-through-sustainable-fashion/,2024-09-30T19:12:24Z,"""These hundred ladies also like, you know, break the culture norms,"" Madhu Vaishnav, Founder of Saheli Women in India said during a session last week in the UN SDG Media Zone during the UN General Assembly and Climate Week in New York City. Produced by the Fashion Impact Fun and the PVBLIC Foundation in partnership with the UN, Vaishnav and a few other women explained how buying and investing in sustainable fashion supports communities, families, the environment, and women's economic and personal lives. ""The stories are just unbelievable,"" Vaishnav said, as she shared the story of a woman who was married off as a child, learned garment industry skills at Saheli Women, and dramatically improved her finances, her life and her family's lives, including finally sending her children to school.

""When woman earns money, she changed everything."" Vaishnav added. ""Another thing which I would say is, more majority of our ladies are saying that we stop facing the domestic violence."" She shared the story of a woman who told her, ""My husband doesn't beat me (anymore). He respect me,"" because now she earns money that supports the family.

""I always say woman is a not a leader, she's a ladder. And when she became a ladder, she let lot of other ladies climb on it and she create such a beautiful world around us,"" Vaishnav impassioned, adding, ""it's an economy of caring.""

Vaishnav is one of three recipients of grants from the Fashion Impact Fund that were honored at the UN session. Saheli Women is a woman-owned business empowering women in rural India with what she called, ""ethical fashion. We co-create slow fashion garments with international fashion partners, utilising traditional craft practices and creating meaningful livelihood opportunities."" They are preserving traditional crafts and their cultural heritage, empowering women and manufacturing and selling sustainable clothing. Saheli partners with 20 global fashion brands to date, which she told the audience they created through Instagram.

Garment factories can be very bad workplaces for women - and are bad for the environment

Women make up 80% or more of the garment factory workers. Nearly 97% of them are in China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Cambodia, and Laos and they earn meager wages. In Bangladesh. For example, some women workers are paid 33 cents an hour. Their wages cover about a fifth or so of their living expenses and they work excessive working hours, 14 to 16 hours a day, often in dangerous conditions. For example, there was fire in a Bangladesh factory that killed about 1,000 workers (women) and there are reports of violence against a lot of these women. There are reports of female garment factory workers being underpaid and overworked in England and Italy as well.

The fashion industry is ranked as the second most polluting business in the world by the UN and 7% of landfills is garments. In addition, the garment industry is responsible for eight to 10% of global CO2, and 500,000 tons of micro plastics are dumped into oceans each year.

Teaching women sustainable fashion and business in New York City

Another women-owned business in sustainable fashion that earned a recent Fashion Impact Fund grant, and another large grant from New York State, is Custom Collaborative, whose Founder and Executive Director, Ngozi Okaro also spoke at this UN session. It's a training program supporting marginalized women in building careers and businesses in sustainable fashion. Okaro, an attorney by training (Georgetown Law School), has received numerous recognitions, including as a 2022 Goldman Sachs Black Woman Impact Leader, Crain's Notable Women Business Owner, and Kate Spade ""World-Changing Women in Conscious Business"" awardee.

""There are three parts to Custom Collaborative's work,"" Okaro explained, ""Our training institute, which is a 15-week, 30 hour per week program that teaches women to design and sell sustainable fashion. So, they learn about concepts of sustainability, actually practice it, all the materials that we use are upcycled and, and recycled. Women learn personal finance. There is a 10-part business curriculum in addition to them learning how to actually create and understand the design and production of clothing."" Some of the program's alumni return to mentor the new classes of students.

""The work that we do with companies like PVH or Chanel or, Theory or others, it's really about them coming in and providing maybe services and support on more specific issues like resume writing or public speaking or career discernment."" Custom Collaborative also has a business incubator and production co-op.

Custom Collaborative recently received a $1.1 million grant from New York State, which ""relates to revitalizing downtown communities,"" Jeanette Rausch of New York State Office of Planning, Developing and Community Infrastructure told the audience. These funds have to be used for ""capital dollars,"" she clarified, ""so they can't use them for operation or ongoing costs or deferred maintenance, or things like that.""

With these funds, Custom Collaborative moved from their small temporary space to a 10,000 square foot space, and will build out its infrastructure. They are also going to buy new equipment, including a new high-capacity felting machine, ""Where you can take old fabrics and make it into a new textile or weaving things, or even like 3D printing and 3D design, which allows people then to make prototypes without going through a sampling process that wastes a lot of fabric,"" Okaro explained.

""We want to make sure that the women who come through our programs are trained for the jobs that are available today and the jobs that will be upcoming.""

Advice for how to purchase clothing sustainably and that supports women?

Okaro suggested, ""buying less,"" because, she added, ""part of the problem is there's this like rampant over production. And so if we buy fewer things, but nicer things and take care of them for longer, that would definitely I think help women.""

She also suggested ""thinking about like how to extend the life of your garments,"" and shared a story about how she is doing that, repurposing a skirt from her grandmother.

Naturally, they suggested supporting women-owned businesses and buying locally as well.

Vaishnav insisted that we be conscious shoppers. ""We really want the consumer to really understand where they are buying from, why they are buying. And if something is super cheap, just think, 'wow how it could be possible?',"" because it took a factory worker's time (likely a woman) and materials. ""So, always be careful what you're buying."" She reminded us that, ""every single consumer is equally very, very important."" Therefore, to make purchasing decisions responsibly."
Ageism May Be Holding Younger Women Back From Advancing At Work,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hollycorbett/2024/09/30/ageism-may-be-holding-younger-women-back-from-advancing-at-work/,2024-09-30T18:04:21Z,"Ageism encompasses stereotypes and the unfair treatment of people based on their age, and it impacts people's advancement in the workplace. While ageism has traditionally been associated with older people, new research finds that younger women in the workplace may be more susceptible to age-based discrimination as compared to young men and older workers of any gender.

""Young women are saying that [ageism] is leading to missed opportunities -- whether it's promotions, raises, or other career-advancing opportunities,"" says Caroline Fairchild, editor in chief and VP of education at Lean In. ""They feel like because of the way that they present or the way they look or just their age in general, they're having a harder time being taken seriously.""

Almost half of women under 30 say their age has negatively impacted them at work, compared to 35% of men under 30, according to the Women In In the Workplace Report 2024, the largest study of the state of women in corporate America and Canada done by LeanIn.Org and McKinsey & Company. (For people ages 50-59, 25% of men and 29% of women say age has negatively impacted them at work). Women under 30 are also almost twice as likely as men of the same age to field unwanted comments about their age.

'Youngism,' a type of reverse ageism, may be an overlooked contributor to the broken rung, where women, and particularly women of color, are less likely to be promoted to that first rung of manager level. According to the report, for every 100 men promoted to manager, just 81 women overall are promoted -- and that number shrinks to 54 for Black women and 65 for Latina women. It's a major barrier to more women advancing into leadership, and means there aren't enough women in the pipeline to leadership so women will never be able to catch up.

Of course, the report shows that people of all ages experience ageism in the workplace. More research from the Harvard Business Review confirms this, finding that women face age bias whether they are young, middle aged or older. Creating more equitable workplaces calls for combating pervasive ageism and sexism simultaneously (along with racism), as we are nearly 50 years from reaching parity in the workplace.

Some progress has been made: Women today make up 29% of the C-suite positions, up from only 17% in 2015, the first year the Women in the Workplace Report was released. However, that progress is fragile. Fairchild shares a few reasons why.

Women Are Underrepresented In Line Roles

While there's been a 12% increase in women's representation in the C-suite and a 7% increase in VP roles since the report first came out in 2015, the increased representation of women in senior leadership comes down to more women being represented in staff roles versus line roles.

As we move up the corporate pipeline, a significant majority of line positions -- particularly in profit and loss domains such as sales and product management -- are predominantly occupied by men. Women are more often found in staff roles, which encompass vital support functions like legal and human resources.

""Over time, we have seen a gradual decline in the number of line roles, which disproportionately affects men,"" says Fairchild. ""This shift has inadvertently increased women's representation in leadership, given that staff roles have been more stable and where women are more concentrated. While it is commendable to see more women in staff roles within the C-suite, we must ensure that women are actively promoted into line positions as well, fostering a truly sustainable path to gender parity.""

Companies Are Wavering On Their Commitment To DEI

The report finds that over the last 10 years, companies are doing more to de-bias the hiring process and performance reviews. Companies are also offering more benefits for caregivers and those struggling with health issues, as well as more flexible work policies overall. However, this year companies are scaling back on programs designed to advance women and address the unique barriers they face. The persistence of the 'broken rung' signals that companies can't afford to go backwards on efforts to advance gender and racial equity.

""What is concerning is that there are signs that we're in a moment right now where company commitment to diversity -- both on the gender and racial front -- is declining,"" says Fairchild. ""Companies can be a powerful force when it comes to driving change, but we're at this critical inflection point right now where we can't afford to slow down. Our call to action for companies is to stay committed.""

Sexual Harassment In The Workplace Is Still Prevalent

Creating safe and respectable workplace cultures where harassment is never tolerated may still be out of reach. Roughly 4 in 10 women have experienced some form of sexual harassment during their careers. One sign that sexual harassment -- such as having sexually-explicit comments directed at you -- is not becoming any less common is that younger women are just as likely as older women to have experienced this in their career.

Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women's Law Center Action Fund, told me in a previous Forbes article, ""If I've learned nothing else [since the #MeToo movement went viral], it is that fixing laws and policies alone won't be enough, and that taking on our culture is going to have to happen alongside it in terms of how it is that people see and understand the issues of gender-based violence in this country.""

This year's Women in the Workplace Report shows that we can't take any gains in women's representation in leadership for granted, and must keep taking intentional action steps to make workplace work for everyone. Doing so will benefit women, families, companies, and the economy. Closing gender gaps in employment, for example, would lead to a 20% boost in GDP per capita.

""Our concern, given the data that we explore in this year's report, is that unless companies not only reinvest and recommit to advancing within their organizations, but also start to adapt a more expansive and creative playbook of solutions, we're going to continue to see stalled progress,"" says Fairchild. ""Fifty years is too long for us to get to parity for all women in corporate America."""
"Newsom vetoes slew of bills over the weekend, bucks Dem legislature on progressive initiatives",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-vetoes-slew-bills-over-weekend-bucks-dem-legislature-progressive-initiatives,2024-09-30T18:01:17Z,"Co-hosts on 'The Big Weekend Show' discuss Gov. Gavin Newsom's latest attempts to continue to expand benefits for illegal migrants in the state of California.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom tossed out a slew of bills over the weekend, bucking several of his Democratic Party's more progressive initiatives on things like standards for transgender care, regulating gas stoves and providing additional benefits for noncitizens.

Newsom, who has had to review more than 1,000 bills over the last few months ahead of Monday's legislative deadline, vetoed AB 2442, AB 2513 and SB 227.

AB 2442, which would have expedited medical licenses for applicants seeking to perform transgender surgical procedures and abortions, was declined by Newsom on Friday.

NEWSOM'S DEEPFAKE ELECTION LAWS ARE ALREADY BEING CHALLENGED IN FEDERAL COURT

""As the number of applicants who qualify for expedited licensure grows through legislation, the benefits of mandated prioritization may start to diminish, at the expense of potential negative impacts to other applicants,"" Newsom said in his veto letter. ""Additionally, the increase in staff needed to ensure expedited applications may lead to licensing fee increases.""

AB 2513 - a bill that would have required gas stoves to be sold with a warning label on them for potential toxins emitted - was also a hotly debated bill in the legislature but ultimately shot down by Newsom and dubbed a ""static approach"" that would fail to allow for timely updates to labeling content according to the most up-to-date scientific knowledge.

""While I appreciate the author's intent to provide consumers with information about the products they purchase, I am concerned that this bill codifies highly prescriptive labeling content that could only be changed by a future statutory amendment,"" Newsom said in the veto letter.

800-PLUS BILLS LEFT ON NEWSOM'S DESK ILLUSTRATE CALIFORNIA'S OVERRGULATION PROBLEM: EXPERTS

Among the progressive bills shot down was also SB 227, which would've required the Employment Development Department (EDD) to create an Excluded Workers Program to provide unemployment-style benefits to noncitizens.

Newsom said that while ""California has taken taken important steps to advance inclusion and equity for undocumented workers and mixed-status families who contribute significantly to California's economy and local communities,"" Congress must uphold its duty to create solutions that offer a legitimate pathway to citizenship for long-term residents who have made significant contributions.

NEWSOM VETOES BILL THAT WOULD LET NONCITIZEN STUDENTS WORK AT STATE'S PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES

""We can have a fair immigration system that works for families, U.S. workers, and employers, and also have a safe border,"" Newsom said. ""However, this bill sets impractical timelines, has operational issues, and requires funding that was not included in the budget.""

Also on Sunday, Newsom vetoed a bill to create safety measures for large artificial intelligence models, which would have been the first such law in the nation.

Some high-profile bipartisan bills aren't immune to being tossed out, either. Last week, Newsom vetoed a bipartisan accountability legislation that would've required more accountability and data reporting on the state's spiraling homelessness crisis.

Already, Newsom has signed a package of public safety bills aimed at reducing organized retail theft. He's also vetoed a number of progressive bills, including several that would have expanded aid to illegal immigrants through housing loans and permitted employment through the University of California (UC) system, and a reparations package for Black residents.

Promising to tackle the mental health crisis among young people, the blue state governor also signed a historic bill restricting cellphones in schools.

Newsom often vetoes bills if they appear redundant or the cost would further burden the state's budget shortfall, according to a CalMatters analysis. Last year, Newsom vetoed 156 bills and signed 890, reflecting a veto rate of about 15%, similar to the previous year. His veto rate in 2021 was under 8%."
"Is Graduate School Worth It? If You Want To Be A Social Worker Or Teacher, Maybe Not",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/annaesakismith/2024/09/30/is-graduate-school-worth-it-if-you-want-to-be-a-social-worker-or-teacher-maybe-not/,2024-09-30T17:45:49Z,"As the cost of graduate education continues to rise, prospective students are increasingly weighing the benefits against the growing burden of student debt. Higher earnings and career advancement often motivate the pursuit of advanced degrees, but financial risks can outweigh these rewards.

A new report from Georgetown University's Center for Education and the Workforce (CEW) shows that accruing high debt for a graduate degree is manageable but only if graduates earn enough to repay it. Graduate Degrees: Risky and Unequal Paths to the Top indicates that while today's knowledge economy needs highly-educated workers, some graduate programs do not produce financially viable outcomes.

""Due to scientific and technological advancements, the economy of the future will increasingly require professionals with advanced degrees,"" said Jeff Strohl, CEW Director and co-author of the report, ""but graduate costs have increased 233% since 2000. The current trajectories of cost and debt put graduate education out of reach for too many students.""

Graduate degrees -- whether master's, professional, or doctoral -- offer the highest earnings and employment prospects of any educational credential. Over the past 30 years, the earnings premium for graduate degrees has stayed steady and even expanded for doctoral degrees, according to the CEW research.

Indeed, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the total number of master's degrees conferred increased by 16% between 2011-12 and 2021-22, from 756,000 to 880,200 degrees. During this time, the number of doctor's degrees awarded grew 20%, from 170,200 to 203,900 degrees.

However, rising costs and student debt are undermining the value of some of these degrees.

Since 2000, median tuition and fees for graduate programs have more than tripled, and median debt for graduate borrowers has increased from $34,000 to $50,000, according to the CEW report.

At the same time, the report's program evaluation shows that, based on available data from the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard, 14% of master's degree programs and 4% of professional degree programs fail to produce graduates that earn more than the median earnings of young workers with only a bachelor's degree in the same field and state.

In addition, 41% of master's programs and 67% of professional degree programs do not produce graduates whose median federal loan payments are less than 10% of their median discretionary earnings, the research indicates. Fields such as social work, teacher education, psychology, and counseling are among those most likely to fail these evaluation criteria.

""Some of the worst-performing programs fall under the broad field of education and public service -- representing professions that are critical to a well-functioning society,"" said Catherine Morris, co-author of the report and senior editor at CEW. ""We recommend that federal and state governments fund targeted grant programs to support graduate education in these critical yet often underpaid professions.""

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for social workers was $58,380 in May 2023. Amongst that group, the lowest 10% earned less than $38,400, and the highest 10% earned more than $94,910.

NCES data shows that health professions and related programs were among the top three most-popular fields of study at both master's and doctoral levels, as was education.

The CEW report also highlighted disparities in graduate degree attainment and earnings by race, ethnicity, and gender. For example, median earnings for Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino workers with graduate degrees are $16,000 below the median earnings of all graduate degree holders. Also, while women are more likely to earn graduate degrees than men, the gender wage gap is more prominent among graduate degree holders than those with lower educational attainment."

A reality she is determined to change. Her current focus is on biodiversity- the essential species and habitats that underpin the ecosystems supporting our various industries and human livelihoods.

To coincide with climate week, she took this topic to Capitol Hill, where she presented an advanced screening of American Humane's latest documentary, Escape from Extinction Rewilding, narrated by Meryl Streep, which opened in theaters on September 27.

I spoke to Dr. Ganzert about her role as a female leader and activist at a time when urgency and commitment is in dire need, and how she maintains momentum for her organization in the battle against indifference, misinformation, and politicization.

Since it first hit the headlines in the 1970s, the topic of Climate Change has been fraught with avoidance and denial. For a time made easy by the fact that its impacts were not visible, yet now they are almost impossible to ignore. Climate disasters such as wildfires, flooding, hurricanes, and heatwaves are now everyday news stories. It is estimated that In the USA, from 2017-2023, 5,500 people died in climate disasters, costing >$1 trillion in damage.

You might think that considering these terrifying realities, Dr Ganzert's work would be easy. Yet the battle for public attention and action is greater than ever before. This summer while temperatures reached such highs in particular states, pharmacists warned of risk of evaporation and life threatening damage to mail-order medications, new denial, a viral approach to climate denial claiming global warming will be beneficial at best, harmless at worst gained significant momentum on YouTube.

Dr Ganzert says her work has shown that while there will always be a level of denial, much of the avoidance is rooted in priorities, a key of which is economic. Her aim is not to undermine but to address the competing priorities and remind people that the environment and the economy are two sides of the same coin. Protect one, and you protect the other. Ignore either, and we risk losing both.

So when the public sentiment is one of stress and uncertainty, how can you capture the attention of a cause that can seem so abstract? For Dr Ganzert, one of the oldest and most powerful ways to capture attention is through storytelling. Stories told with the intent not to incite fear, but to demonstrate the power of change.

Unlike many environmental documentaries that can seem scolding and alarmist in their push for hard-hitting impact, ""Escape from Extinction Rewilding"" is a look at real-world efforts happening right now to turn developed or blighted areas back into viable habitats for threatened species. This is not just a story; it's a call to action.

""Preserving biodiversity is critical for wildlife and is key to human survival,"" Dr. Ganzert says. ""The existence of every living being -- plants, animals, and people -- is intertwined. Removing too many Jenga blocks could cause the whole tower to crash down. Storytelling is a powerful tool that connects people with wildlife that lives beyond their backyard,"" she shares. ""Documenting powerful stories of hope, spirit, and survival helps viewers better understand these species' challenges and the need for innovative conservation efforts like rewilding to protect them. After all, you cannot protect what you do not love, and you cannot love what you do not know. This aims to create a sense of urgency, but more so hope. ""

Yet we know hope alone is not a strategy for success, especially on Capitol Hill. Climate change has become a highly politicized, divisive partisan battleground, with discussions trapped in an ongoing tug-of-war over policy and priorities. We have seen the fare of dignitaries, politicians, scientists, and celebs who have championed this cause with little collective or corrective action. I asked Dr Ganzert what makes this moment and this campaign any different?

She says environmental policy cannot be written in a vacuum or it risks misinformation. ""A lot of folks love fly-ins,"" she shares, but I believe it has to be about a lot more than that. It's about all of us working together. I spent the guts of nine months being door to door, office to office, to pave a runaway for a meaningful and sustainable conversation this week. Good old-fashioned shoe leather is used to get this message heard.""

However, we know if politics is anything, it is a game of sides, but one she says she does not want to play. Her focus is on telling a real and compelling story that cuts through the political noise and humanizes the impacts of the ecology of our planet.

""Climate change knows no political party, no presidential candidate,"" she shares. ""The reality is no matter what your politics, we all need to eat, we all depend on clean water, fertile soil, and stable climates -- farmers, ranchers, and fishers around the globe rely on these ecosystems. This is not about sides; it's about basic economics. We need legislators and policymakers across the board to understand the scale of impact and ensure every weapon at our disposal should be deployed to fight it.""

The most significant weapon of our time is, of course, artificial intelligence, a potential game changer in environmental conservation. It holds the promise to revolutionize how we monitor ecosystems, manage resources, and combat climate change. However, its use also raises significant concerns due to the energy consumption and resource demands . The question that arises is how we can harness its potential while mitigating its negative impacts?

She shares that the balancing act of climate justice and artificial intelligence is one of the toughest that we will face in modern times. The benefits and risks are both equally enormous and these two worlds need to meet in very intentional way.

She points to the example of technologies like advanced gene editing, which aims to resurrect extinct species or at least restore their critical functions within ecosystems. ""Imagine restoring species that were essential to pollination or forest maintenance but were wiped out by human activity?"" she says. Yet these same AI models can increase the use of harmful pesticides in agriculture when prioritizing food yields over the environment, again applying additional pressures on biodiversity."" She shares that active and intentional transparent dialogue between environmentalists and industry, is the only way forward. We need earnest collaboration across government, industry, and academia rather than a blind hope in pipe-dream technologies.

While a balanced use of AI brings new hope for Dr Ganzert is hugely inspired by engaging with younger generations, who she says has experienced the human-animal bond like no other. ""Pet ownership has skyrocketed; attendance and zoos and aquariums has reached record numbers. This is exciting as the future of biodiversity lies with the next generation who understand that animals and nature make us better humans. They see the issues clearly, and humanely. Not marred by political agendas which have no basis in science or facts.""

While the challenges are increasingly complex and nuanced, her leadership remains grounded in creating and advocating for solutions. On November 5th, Dr Ganzert will show Escape from Extinction Rewilding Documentary to the British parliament as part of a global campaign that also includes screenings next Spring for the European Union parliament in Brussels. She is seeking to share a key message with all audiences, regardless of political leanings. That is our planet is in serious and undeniable danger and the future of our ecosystems depends on our willingness to innovate thoughtfully and collaboratively on a global level."
"Fossil Fuel Dominance In India's Power Mix To End By 2030, Says Central Bank",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gauravsharma/2024/09/30/fossil-fuel-dominance-in-indias-power-mix-to-end-by-2030-says-central-bank/,2024-09-30T16:56:55Z,"India's burgeoning economy continues to be overwhelmingly powered by fossil fuels including coal, but that dominance will be consigned to the history books by end of this decade, according to the country's central bank.

In its latest report published earlier this week, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) noted: ""The era of fossil fuels' dominance is coming to an end with renewables expected to cross 50% share of electricity generation globally by the end of this decade.""

It added that record capital investment and accelerated deployment of clean technology was driving this change both in India as well as globally. However, the central bank observed that much more needs to be done as a tripling of renewable energy capacity by 2030 remains essential to meeting net zero emissions targets by mid-century.

""On the energy supply side, for every $1 that goes to fossil fuels, an average of $3 needs to be invested in low carbon energy over the remainder of the decade,"" the report noted.

It also highlighted that a fully decarbonized global energy system by 2050 will come at an estimated cost of $215 trillion. At the present moment, both traditional and renewable energy segments are broadly receiving equal levels of fresh investment, and a tripling of investment in favor of the latter appears to be challenging.

However, doing so with urgency would offer a pathway to meaningfully address ""hard-to-abate"" sectors of the global economy like steelmaking and aviation, where low carbon alternatives are still in their nascent stages, the Reserve Bank of India report observed.

Policymakers are not underestimating the challenge India faces. It currently needs crude oil to power its 7%-plus annual GDP growth and imports a huge 88% of its national requirements. It also has nearly 300 coal-fired power plants in operation.

But on its road to achieving net zero emissions by 2070, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has set an initial target of reaching 500GW of renewable capacity by 2030, versus a recorded capacity of 135GW at the end of 2023.

India is furthering this green transition through what it calls ""financial inclusion"" via instruments ranging from green debt and equity issuance in domestic capital markets to external commercial borrowings and foreign direct investment.

The central bank's observations on India and the global energy mix follow a speech by its Deputy Governor Michael Patra in which he noted the mammoth financing levels required by the world's fifth-largest economy to discover its green horizon and how it intends to get there.

""Over the period 2024-30, it is estimated that India will need $0.4 trillion in green investments. Going forward, the private sector will move into centerstage for infrastructure spending, especially in energy and transportation,"" Patra told the Confederation of Indian Industry's Financing 3.0 Summit earlier this month.

The Deputy Governor also estimated the costs of India achieving its goal of becoming independent of fossil fuel imports by 2047, and hitting net zero by 2070 at $10.1 trillion.

""With 100% foreign direct investment permitted [in India] under the automatic route for the renewable energy sector and relaxed norms for external commercial borrowings for companies raising funds for green projects under the automatic route, the flow of climate finance, both domestic and international, is expected to increase, once a green taxonomy is developed and aligned with global standards."""
8 Things Expats Wish They Knew Before Moving To Panama,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenpeddicord/2024/09/30/8-things-expats-wish-they-knew-before-moving-to-panama/,2024-09-30T16:48:01Z,"Things that took expats by surprise after moving to Panama, explained

Panama is a long-standing crowd favorite among expats and retirees, with a pensioner's visa program that's often been called the Gold Standard among worldwid

e retirement programs.

This little country offers a well-appointed, cosmopolitan capital city, plus two long coastlines -- one along the Pacific and another along the Caribbean.

The country is rich in natural beauty and resources, and it's user-friendly as an expat destination for folks from up north. It has a familiar culture, easy-to-access residency options, and favorable tax policies.

Comfortable yet exciting. Convenient, yet still charmingly rough around the edges. For the potential retiree or foreign resident, Panama offers big and unequaled advantages -- year-round warm weather, a low cost of living, a foreign-resident-friendly tax system, one of the best banking systems in the world, a stable political situation, a bright economic outlook, and the world's best program of discounts and perks for foreign retirees...

Still, Panama is not for everyone. Panama City is often compared with Miami, and the similarities are many. But life is going to be different here than you're used to... maybe more different than you're ready for.

Here are a few of the things people wish they had known before they had moved to Panama...

1. Living In Panama City Isn't Cheap, But The Rest Of The Country Can Be...

Anyone coming into Panama from another country starts their journey in Panama City, which can be misleading. The capital has an economy all its own and it's not at all representative of the rest of the country.

Costs of living in the city are likely not too far off what you may currently pay, with rents in the center of the city in the thousands and grocery stores offering a huge inventory of pricey imported goods.

And even though the city isn't huge and there's a metro and bus system, you're going to need a car living here, which can be a big part of your monthly budget here.

Just outside the city, though, your costs could be a fraction of what they'd be in the capital. Once you get farther into the interior of the country, living in the countryside or in any of the country's charming towns or villages, you could easily live on $2,000 a month, or even less.

2. Little Changes On The Equator...

There are no seasonal temperature changes here and you get about 12 hours of daylight every day, year-round.

On the one hand, this means that beach season never ends, and the gorgeous sunny, warm weather is something you can depend onurs every day.

On the other, once you've been here a few years, it can be hard to track the passing of time.

Plus, while it's nice that the sun rises at about 6:30 a.m. every day, it also means the sun sets around 6:30 p.m. every day. It's a very subjective aspect of life -- would you like this consistency or would it get boring?

However, while there's no temperature change, there is a rainy season...

3. The Thunderstorms Are Epic...

The rainy season is roughly from May to December, but that doesn't mean there's six months of non-stop rain.

Thunderstorms here typically only last about 20 or 30 minutes and are usually in the afternoon, the rest of the day is as sunny as ever.

But while short-lived, you'll be amazed at the amount of water that will fall during a storm. Flooding can be a risk -- always bring an extra pair of shoes when you go out.

The rain is often accompanied by thunder and lightning, which are truly spectacular... though better enjoyed from a window than from outdoors.

Never leave the house during these months without an umbrella.

4. This Is The Jungle...

Spiders, cockroaches, mosquitoes, snakes, scorpions, caimans, and other ""pests"" abound here, even in the city to an extent. Once you leave the capital, these critters will be part of your daily life.

5. You Need A Mail Forwarding Account...

There's no postal service in Panama, and to receive mail or packages from overseas, you'll need a mail forwarding service, most of which operate out of Miami.

For a nominal monthly fee, you'll be able to receive all your mail from back home, as well as shipments, for example from Amazon.

6. Holidays Are Disruptive...

November is called mes de la patria, and it's chock full of the country's several national holidays. Most people take off long weekends and businesses may shut down for weeks at a time. This is not the time of year to get administration done...

Dec. 8 is Mother's Day, another national holiday, and with Christmas a major event in this Catholic country, there aren't a lot of days to get things done in December, either.

After the new year, there's carnaval, which takes place in February and is another excuse for folks to shut things down for a week or so.

7. The Lifestye Is Very Laidback...

It's the reason many folks want to move here -- the pace of life here is much slower than up north, and the atmosphere is relaxed. There's no rush to get anything done, wait times are longer than you'll expect (whether it's the grocery store line or trying to get an appointment with a plumber... etc.).

Generally speaking, there's not much urgency to life in Panama, which is a great thing... except when you need an issue resolved.

8. Fireworks...

All the time, for any and all reasons... or no reason at all!"
What The Latest Fed Decision Means For Businesses And The Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/franksorrentino/2024/09/30/what-the-latest-fed-decision-means-for-businesses-and-the-economy/,2024-09-30T16:47:57Z,"The latest decision by the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates marks a significant turning point for the U.S. economy. While many consumers have been eagerly anticipating lower rates, it's important to understand that a rate cut doesn't necessarily signal good news for the broader economy. In fact, it reflects a cooling of economic activity, a slowdown that businesses need to navigate carefully. While the cut itself was widely expected, its impact on businesses and consumers extends far beyond simple monetary policy.

The current economic environment remains a crucial period for understanding the implications of the Fed's actions and why it may be a great time to capitalize on new opportunities before further economic shifts occur.

Understanding the Real Impact of Rate Cuts on the Economy

Lower rates can ease borrowing costs, they also come with broader implications that the consumer should be prepared for. Many are quick to celebrate reduced interest rates, but it's essential to remember that this also means a reduction in returns on savings, affecting both individuals and businesses with large cash reserves.

What's more, the recent rate cut points to a broader economic transition, one where we are starting to see a downtick in economic activity. The latest jobs data will have been a key indicator for the Fed to make the decision to cut rates. The goal now is for them to continue following the data and making the necessary decisions to achieve the soft landing that is within reach.

Why Now is Still the Time for Opportunities

Despite the slowing, businesses are in a prime position to seize opportunities. Lower borrowing costs make capital more accessible, particularly for industries like real estate and construction. The window for securing favorable financing remains open, but waiting too long may result in missed chances as market conditions stabilize.

Businesses that act now will benefit from improved liquidity and the availability of capital. This is not the time to hold back -- if you're planning to expand, invest, or grow, now is the time to make those moves. We are still very much in a robust economy, productivity is strong with a 2.5% annual rate vs. prior estimates of 2.3%, inflation is easing, and technology continues to offer new paths for growth. The key is recognizing that opportunities exist even in slower growth environments.

The Role Community Banks Play

In uncertain times, community banks play a critical role in providing stability and access to capital. For small and mid-sized businesses, community banks remain committed to relationship-based lending, offering the support that larger institutions may pull back on when things get tough. At ConnectOne, we've seen firsthand how these relationships can be the lifeblood of a business during challenging times.

Recent mergers in the banking sector, such as ConnectOne's own merger with First of Long Island, point to a trend of consolidation that strengthens the foundation of community banks. This isn't just about survival, it's about creating a stronger, more resilient banking industry.

Just as in banking, businesses may find opportunities to partner in order to achieve scale, take on new business lines or expand their talent base. As M&A activity continues, the banking landscape will shift, offering more robust services and improved capital access for businesses. The rise in mergers signals confidence in the long-term health of the U.S. economy, even as the broader environment eases.

--

The Federal Reserve's rate cut is more than just a policy move -- it's a signal that businesses need to recalibrate and plan strategically for a slower but more stable economic environment. While the headlines may focus on the rate reduction, the real opportunity lies in how businesses respond. Those who understand the benefit of moving swiftly to secure financing or making smart investments will be better positioned to thrive. The road ahead may not offer the rapid growth of previous years, but with the right strategy and foresight, businesses can continue to capture significant opportunities and set the foundation for long-term success."
The End Of The SaaS Era: Rethinking Software's Role In Business,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/josipamajic/2024/09/30/the-end-of-the-saas-era-rethinking-softwares-role-in-business/,2024-09-30T16:47:50Z,"In the ever-evolving landscape of technology and business, a provocative thesis is gaining traction: the Software as a Service (SaaS) era may be coming to an end. This bold claim was made by Sam Lessin, a GP in Slow Ventures, in a recent Tweet challenges the long-held belief that SaaS represented the pinnacle of software business models. Reddit threads indicating the decline of SaaS have been popping up and discussions on VC LinkedIn and blogs posts are only confirming the fears: the SaaS dream may be over.

For over a decade, SaaS has been hailed as the holy grail of software business models. The promise of recurring revenue, scalability, and high customer lifetime values (LTVs) attracted entrepreneurs and investors alike. However, industry insiders are now questioning whether this model has lived up to its lofty expectations.

One of the primary criticisms leveled against SaaS is the misconception of infinite LTVs. The idea that once a customer is acquired, they will continue to pay indefinitely, has proven to be overly optimistic. In reality, businesses face continuous pricing pressures and competitive threats, making customer retention an ongoing challenge rather than a given.

Another factor contributing to the potential decline of SaaS is the increasing commoditization of software. With the advent of artificial intelligence and more accessible development tools, creating sophisticated software solutions has become easier than ever before. This democratization of software development has led to a proliferation of options for businesses, driving down prices and reducing the perceived value of individual SaaS offerings.

As a result, software code itself is depreciating in value. What was once a significant barrier to entry and a source of competitive advantage is now often seen as a replaceable commodity. This shift has profound implications for how software companies position themselves and create value for their customers.

Despite its theoretical appeal, selling SaaS solutions has proven to be more challenging than many anticipated. The often-touted Product-Led Growth (PLG) strategy, which relies on the product itself to drive customer acquisition and expansion, has not been universally successful. Even for companies with impressive software and potentially margin-expanding stories, closing deals remains difficult without a clear and compelling value proposition.

Moreover, the revenue generated from SaaS sales often falls short of the value created for customers. This misalignment between value delivery and value capture presents a significant challenge for SaaS companies seeking sustainable growth and profitability.

While the traditional SaaS model may be losing its luster, software itself remains a critical component of modern business operations. The key shift is in how companies think about and utilize software. Rather than viewing it as a standalone business model, forward-thinking entrepreneurs and executives are beginning to see software as a powerful tool for creating value in other business contexts.

Instead of focusing solely on selling software subscriptions, innovative companies are using software to enhance and transform existing businesses. The goal is to leverage technology to make certain businesses significantly more valuable, efficient, and competitive.

This approach involves developing software that can improve the operations of ""real world"" businesses by 20-30% or more. By creating such powerful tools, technology companies can position themselves to acquire or partner with the businesses they've enhanced, thereby capturing a larger share of the value they've created.

Consider a hypothetical scenario where a tech company develops an AI-powered inventory management system that dramatically improves efficiency for retail businesses. Instead of simply selling this system as a SaaS product, the company could use it as leverage to acquire successful retail operations. By implementing their proprietary software, they could significantly boost the profitability of these businesses, creating value far beyond what they might have captured through traditional software licensing.

This strategy allows technology companies to benefit from margin expansion, operational improvements, and competitive advantages in industries that might have previously seemed unrelated to their core competencies. It's a way of using software not just as a product, but as a means to enter and dominate entire sectors of the economy.

A recent example that illustrates this shifting paradigm is Klarna, the buy-now-pay-later giant. In a move that has stirred both interest and skepticism in the tech world, Klarna announced plans to ""shut down SaaS providers"" and replace them with internally built AI solutions. The company has already severed ties with major enterprise software providers like Salesforce and Workday, opting instead to develop its own applications, likely built on OpenAI's infrastructure.

Klarna's CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, framed this decision as part of a broader strategy to consolidate and streamline operations through AI, standardization, and simplification. The company claims that its AI-powered customer service assistant, launched in collaboration with OpenAI, has already performed the work of 700 human agents and handled millions of interactions.

However, this bold move has been met with skepticism from industry experts. HR technology analyst Josh Bersin pointed out the complexity of replacing systems like Workday, which have ""decades of workflows and complex data structures built in."" Others in the tech community question whether building these systems in-house is the best use of capital, especially for a company without plans to sell the resulting software solutions.

Klarna's strategy aligns with the idea of using software as a transformative tool rather than a product. By developing its own AI-powered systems, the company aims to enhance its core business operations and potentially reduce costs. However, the success of this approach remains to be seen, and it highlights the challenges and risks associated with such a radical shift away from established SaaS providers.

This case study underscores the broader trend of companies reevaluating their relationship with software and exploring ways to leverage AI and custom solutions to gain a competitive edge. Whether Klarna's gambit proves successful could have far-reaching implications for how other businesses approach their software strategies in the future.

Proponents of this new approach argue that while others will eventually catch up in terms of software capabilities, the first-movers will have already used their technological edge to acquire valuable real-world assets. These assets - be they retail stores, manufacturing plants, or service businesses - represent tangible, scarce resources that retain value even as the software that enhances them becomes commoditized.

In essence, this strategy flips the script on the traditional tech company playbook. Instead of building a software business that can be easily replicated or made obsolete, companies are using their technological prowess to accumulate a portfolio of improved, efficient real-world businesses and assets.

While this new paradigm presents exciting opportunities, it's not without its challenges. Companies pursuing this strategy will need to develop expertise in industries far removed from software development. They'll need to navigate complex regulatory environments, manage physical assets, and deal with the day-to-day realities of running diverse business operations.

Moreover, this approach requires significant capital and a long-term vision. The payoff may not be as immediate as a successful SaaS launch, but proponents argue that the eventual rewards - ownership of improved, efficient businesses across multiple sectors - are worth the wait and investment.

As we look to the future, it's clear that software will continue to play a crucial role in business success. However, its role may evolve from being the product itself to being the competitive advantage that allows companies to excel in various industries.

This shift doesn't mean that all SaaS companies will disappear overnight. Many will continue to thrive, especially those providing essential services or operating in niche markets. However, for ambitious tech entrepreneurs and investors, the bigger opportunity may lie in using software as a means to an end rather than an end in itself.

The potential end of the SaaS era as we know it doesn't signal the demise of software's importance in business. Rather, it heralds a new age where software becomes an even more potent force - not as a standalone product, but as a transformative tool capable of reshaping entire industries.

As this paradigm shift unfolds, we can expect to see tech companies venturing far beyond their traditional boundaries, using their software expertise to become major players in a diverse array of sectors. The winners in this new landscape will likely be those who can most effectively leverage their technological capabilities to identify, improve, and ultimately own valuable real-world businesses and assets.

For entrepreneurs, investors, and business leaders, this evolving perspective on software's role presents both challenges and opportunities. Those who can successfully navigate this shift may find themselves at the forefront of a new wave of value creation, where the lines between technology companies and traditional businesses blur, and where software serves as the ultimate competitive advantage across all sectors of the economy. Questions like compliance and security for AI replacement tools remain unsolved, but the threat remains real.

As we move forward, it will be fascinating to watch how this new approach unfolds and what it means for the future of business and technology. The SaaS era may be waning, but the era of software as a transformative business weapon is just beginning."
8 Passive Income Ideas To Make Money From Home In 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2024/09/30/passive-income-ideas-to-make-money-from-home/,2024-09-30T16:07:30Z,"If the U.S. job market for the remaining months of 2024 is going to be anything like what we've witnessed over the past couple months, then it's certainly something to be concerned about.

The U.S added just 142,000 jobs in August of this year, which fell below previous projections of 161,000 in job gains. Similarly, in June and July, the economy was down by a cumulative 86,000 jobs, in contrast to expectations by economists and analysts.

What we're seeing here is a slowdown in the job market, and if you are a job-seeker looking for new roles, then this news is certainly disheartening. You're likely wondering about what other means you have to make money, to support you while looking for a job, or you've probably thrown in the towel altogether and decided to quit job-hunting and dive straight into entrepreneurship.

With the job market being difficult and highly competitive right now, and with job availability being concentrated in certain industries such as construction and healthcare (both of which you may not be particularly keen on), it's best to focus on building multiple streams of income externally, without reliance on traditional employment.

This provides you with more options, gives your career and personal finances more stability, develops new skills and improves your existing skill set, and also ensures that you don't have an ever-widening gap in your employment history due to being out of a job for so long.

So, what options should you consider to start making money from home and building streams of passive income?

Undeniably, one of the most popular ways to make money from home is through writing. Writing is a high-income skill because there are so many ways you can leverage it to produce multiple streams of income. Additionally, one of the most beautiful things about writing is that you don't need much more than word processing software -- many of which are free -- your laptop, and a reliable Internet connection.

You can also use it to build passive income -- meaning it continues to make money for you through recurring payments, royalties, and commission without you needing to put in the same extended effort.

Below are just a few examples of ways you can make money through freelance writing alone:

Although the cooling job market presents significant challenges for job-seekers, with limited opportunities in some industries, the good news is that there are alternative ways to generate income equivalent to your desired salary or at least close enough, particularly through writing and freelancing. Through exploring passive income streams such as those listed above, you can remain adaptable and resilient despite job market changes, and build long-term financial and career stability."
"China's Historic Stock Rally Could Be Stifled By Trump Win, JPMorgan Indicates",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/30/chinas-historic-stock-rally-could-be-stifled-by-trump-win-jpmorgan-indicates/,2024-09-30T15:15:19Z,"A win in November's presidential election from Republican candidate Donald Trump could throw a wrench in the Chinese stock market's explosive recent performance, cautioned JPMorgan Chase strategists in a Monday note to clients, dousing seemingly unfettered optimism surrounding the world's second-largest equity market.

27%. That's how much the Chinese stock index CSI 300 is up over the last two weeks.

Chinese stocks' massive rally raged on Monday, as the CSI 300's 8.5% gain was its best day since Sept. 2008, according to FactSet data. After falling to a five-year low earlier this month, the Chinese stock resurgence came as Beijing rolled out a variety of stimulatory measures designed to jumpstart its economy and stock market, such as interest rate cuts and stock buyback incentive programs. The JPMorgan note reflects a common view that the major rebound may not have the required foundation; Bank of America's lead China equity strategist wrote Friday ""the Investors we spoke to generally have low conviction in the sustainability of the rally."" Trump has floated a 50% tariff on U.S. imports on Chinese goods. China accounted for about a quarter of the MSCI emerging markets index at the end of last month and is by far the largest economy considered an emerging market, with the U.S., Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom among those considered developed markets (you may be familiar with the terms from your 401K account elections).

David Tepper, the billionaire investor considered one of the best hedge fund managers in history, is among those all in on Chinese stocks, telling CNBC last Thursday he's buying ""everything"" he can tied to Chinese equities."
On Federal Fiscal New Year's Eve: Not Much To Celebrate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dougcriscitello/2024/09/30/on-federal-fiscal-new-years-eve-not-much-to-celebrate/,2024-09-30T14:40:27Z,"As we mark the dawn of a new fiscal year for the U.S. government, the fireworks are staying in the box. There is little to celebrate from the year that just ended -- and plenty to do in the year ahead, from reaching agreement on 2025 budget and tax policies to addressing longer-term fiscal challenges.

For the fiscal year that ends today (September 30), the Congressional Budget Office estimates the budget deficit at $2 trillion -- $7 trillion in spending compared with $5 trillion in revenues. A deficit of that size is remarkable given the year lacked a pandemic, a financial crisis, or a direct U.S. war. It shows the structural deficiency plaguing the U.S. fiscal condition: Spending far outweighs revenues, year after year, even when nothing extraordinary happens.

A wide range of fiscal matters will occupy federal policymakers in the new year, but the only resolutions made with true determination will be of the continuing variety. That is continuing resolutions -- or in Washington parlance, CRs. Like the law just passed to fund the government through December 20, CRs are used when the government cannot complete its annual budget process on schedule. That has been the case every year since 1998, with CRs averaging more than four months in duration before full-year funding is approved.

At least Congress managed to pass a CR this year, which has not always been the case, averting a government shutdown while pushing budgetary decisions to after November's election.

The new year comes with precipitous fiscal issues to address: From getting funding in place for the new year, increasing the debt ceiling, determining whether and how to extend tax cuts, and accommodating the budgetary priorities of a new president and Congress.

The news that the government will avoid a shutdown -- at least for the first 3 months of the year -- is good. But the risk of a funding lapse will remain until full-year funding is put in place. And besides, the term shutdown is misleading: Rather than saving money (which the word evokes), shutdowns increase taxpayer costs by forcing federal employees to not work for weeks at a time, then giving them back pay once the government is reopened. According to the Congressional Budget Office, a shutdown in 2019 cost taxpayers $3 billion to keep 300,000 federal employees at home and idle for five weeks.

Assuming full-year funding is provided by Congress in the next several months, attention will shift to extending the debt ceiling -- a self-imposed limit on paying the government's bills. That ceiling has been suspended since June 2023, but will be reimposed on January 1, 2025. Failure to extend the borrowing limit could negatively impact the stock market and overall economy, precipitating job losses, higher interest rates, and reduced access to credit. Despite that importance, the threat of political gamesmanship is high.

Some legislative focus will also shift to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, better known to some as the Trump tax cuts. Many of that law's provisions sunset at the end of 2025, including lower marginal income tax rates, a higher standard deduction, fewer itemized deductions, and a $10,000 cap on state and local taxes. A notable exception is the principal tax cut in TCJA -- a 21% flat corporate tax rate that does not expire. Whether and how the TCJA is extended will be influenced significantly by the outcome of the upcoming election.

The new president will have an opportunity to set his or her fiscal priorities through a budget request in the spring of 2025. Items in need of attention include:

As the new fiscal year begins, the government would benefit from having at least one central and achievable fiscal improvement goal. In a previous post on Forbes.com, I wrote about the country's increasingly unworkable budget process and its precarious fiscal condition. (To illustrate: Annual interest payments on the national debt now exceed defense spending.) Legislation has been introduced in Congress to create a national fiscal commission to devise policies to get the country back on a sustainable fiscal path, reviving a proposal twice attempted in the 2010s. That idea could benefit from a new approach.

Achieving any New Year's resolution often requires breaking down goals into manageable tasks. A narrower working group could explore budget concepts and processes to modernize budgeting. Such a group could sew the seeds of bipartisan fiscal cooperation, and lay the groundwork for a national fiscal commission to propose specific policies. Such progress would not only improve the country's fiscal outlook and also help to reverse declining levels of trust in government.

A new year with a new president and Congress offers an opportunity to advance fresh ideas. The United States should make the most of it with an achievable fiscal New Year's resolution."
"The Startup That Wants To Automate Boring, Rote Work",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenamcgregor/2024/09/30/the-startup-that-wants-to-automate-boring-rote-work/,2024-09-30T14:15:51Z,"In this week's Future of Work newsletter, a look at the platform using AI to replace dull work responsibilities, an interview with PwC about customized benefits and more.

This is the published version of Forbes' Future of Work newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief human resources officers and other talent managers on disruptive technologies, managing the workforce and trends in the remote work debate. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Monday!

f you've heard the constant drumbeat that AI is expected to ""free people from the boring parts of their jobs"" and wondered if it's really happening, you might want to listen to these guys.

Forbes' Rashi Shrivastava profiled conversational AI platform Moveworks, the $2.1 billion company making tens of millions in revenue by automating dull workplace tasks such as troubleshooting IT issues or submitting PTO requests. Moveworks is used by some 5 million employees at over 350 companies like Hearst, GitHub, Toyota and Salesforce, Shrivastava reports, while amassing more than $300 million in venture capital from high-profile backers like Lightspeed Venture Partners, Bain Capital Ventures and Kleiner Perkins. CEO and cofounder Bhavin Shah says AI startups ""won't work unless you actually tackle all of these gritty, ugly, messy problems, because that's actually what makes the world work.""

Meanwhile, Forbes senior writer Richard Nieva profiled billionaire Duolingo founder and CEO Luis von Ahn, who, late last year, decided not to renew the contracts of about 10% of the company's contracted workforce who did translations and lesson writing. ""Our stance as a company is that if we can automate something, we will,"" von Ahn told Nieva of the dismissals. ""A full-time employee's job is very hard to automate. But we had some hourly contractors who were doing pretty rote stuff."" Nieva's story digs into von Ahn and Duolingo's efforts around AI and his optimistic view that AI can bring high-quality education to the masses.

Both stories are reminders that all these discussions about AI's impact on jobs, and on how people work, are not just related to the future of work -- they're happening now. These tools are changing how people deal with administrivia on the job. Some rote jobs are getting replaced -- yet there's optimism for how AI can help many others. How leaders deploy it will play a big part of how it makes an impact -- for good or for ill.

Consumer confidence fell in September by the largest amount since August 2021, according to a monthly survey released last week by the economic research firm Conference Board. The index, which checks Americans' temperatures on a host of economic issues, such as expected inflation and job prospects, hit its lowest level since June. The proportion of respondents expecting higher incomes and more jobs available decreased last month, while the percentage of individuals anticipating worse business conditions rose, Forbes' Derek Saul reported.

While Boeing continues negotiations with its striking union workers, another strike ""looks unavoidable,"" writes contributor Mark Faithfull. Today, a six-year master contract between the International Longshoremen's Association -- the largest union of maritime workers in North America -- and the United States Maritime Alliance is due to expire. The contract includes six of the 10 busiest U.S. ports, handling more than 13 million containers annually, and could impact U.S. retailers as they enter their busy holiday shopping season.

Amid increasingly quiet corporate support for diversity and inclusion, a cohort of civil rights organizations called on CEOs and board members of major companies to maintain their commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have come under attack. Signed by 19 organizations -- including the NAACP, the National Organization for Women, the League of United Latin American Citizens, Asian Americans Advancing Justice and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation -- the open letter says that ""a small, well-funded, and extreme group of right-wing activists is attempting to pressure companies into abandoning their DEI programs.""

Employee well-being and the crush of child care costs were two major themes at the Forbes Future of Work Summit earlier this month, with several panels digging into what HR leaders can do to help battle burnout, improve meeting culture and provide child care benefits at a time when workers' stress and heavy workloads remain stubbornly high. Two particular highlights: Moms First founder Reshma Saujani telling the story of how she asked GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump about child care costs and his platform, and a trio of thought leaders (Atlassian's Annie Dean, Work Time Reduction's Joe O'Connor and author Brigid Schulte) sharing what more employers can do to make structural changes that prevent overwork and address the root causes of burnout.

The concept of personalized or customized benefits -- such as flexibility in retirement benefits (some might choose matching contributions toward student loan payments, while others might want a larger 401(k) match) -- has been gaining ground in recent years. The top request from workers for improving compensation, according to consulting firm Mercer's Global Talent Trends study, is to have more types of rewards and the chance to personalize the rewards they get.

That employee request was one reason professional services giant PwC recently shifted how it rewards employees when they reach certain milestones. Rather than handing out rewards when people are promoted, the firm has made the benefits tenure-based, giving out awards at the 3-, 6-, 10- and 15-year milestones (and every five years after that), as well as giving workers more choice about what kind of reward they receive. Options include a paid wellness-oriented vacation in Hawaii or a conservation-driven trip to South Africa to help with wildlife protection -- as well as cash rewards (PwC would not share the size of the cash rewards, but said they had to be at least equivalent to such paid retreats or international trips). Forbes spoke with Kimberly Jones, PwC's talent strategy and people experience leader, about the shift. Excerpts from our conversation have been edited for length and clarity.

What problem are you looking to solve here? Is this addressing a retention issue?

I wouldn't describe it as a problem that we're trying to solve. It really was trying to position our firm for the future and respond to what we hear from our employees. It's an opportunity to show more appreciation and recognition for time of service at PwC. It's a very demanding environment, and so we're always trying to be very focused on how to promote well-being.

Are you taking anything away in offering this? Is the money going here instead of somewhere else?

I wouldn't describe it as taking something away, but replacing something that we had before. It's a way to be able to recognize more people -- not just people who've been promoted in any given year. We have repurposed that program. The program we have now is also more personalized because we are offering a choice of rewards.

I'm hearing about companies trying to help people feel like they're getting ahead in their careers at a time when there's less turnover and promotions are harder to come by. Is this aimed at addressing that issue?

Like I said before, it is not a particular problem we're trying to solve. We've been working on this for a couple of years now, so it predated [the current job market]. Overall, the strategy is meant to make our environment the best that it can be to hopefully positively impact retention, of course. But more than that, to help people to enjoy their day-to-day as much as possible in what's a really demanding environment.

Do you have other ways you're customizing your benefits?

We have a menu of different options, and people can choose from those options. What we hear from our people is all of that is great and nice, but honestly, what they value most is flexibility day-to-day. And so we focus quite a lot on trying to be able to find that balance and give them flexibility, whether it's through contract work weeks or reduced schedules or just working with your team to figure out ways to honor personal commitments.

Speaking of flexibility and how important that is to employees, I've read headlines about the U.K. PwC arm tracking workers' locations to look at return-to-office behavior. Is that used in the U.S.?

It is not. Two separate firms, the way that we're organized. Our U.S. policy has not changed. We have hybrid work. People can work with their teams to figure out where they want to be, whether it's in the office or the client site or working remote that day. We do encourage people to be in person, and we emphasize the benefits of being in person. But no, we're not tracking [location] or doing badge swipe [tracking].

A new survey of CEOs by KPMG found that despite a significant decline in confidence about the global economy over the past decade, top business leaders are still optimistic about growth, senior contributor Jack Kelly reports.

72%: The proportion of CEOs who are confident in the world economy's direction, down from 93% in 2015

92%: The percentage of CEOs who plan to increase their workforce in the next three years, the highest since 2020, according to the new outlook report

64%: The percentage of CEOs ranking AI investments as their primary focus for 2024

Two-Phase Program Targets  Both Accelerators And Startups In Africa,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/annefield/2024/09/30/two-phase-program-targets--both-accelerators-and-startups-in-africa/,2024-09-30T14:15:34Z,"Accelerators and other startup programs in Africa play a key role helping entrepreneurs in the region succeed. But they often lack the resources needed to accomplish their jobs effectively.

That's why startup accelerator pioneer Village Capital recently launched a program aimed at strengthening the capacity of accelerators, incubators and other entrepreneurial support organizations (ESOs for short), so they can more successfully work with the startups they target, especially climate-focused enterprises.

Called Empowering Sustainable Entrepreneurship Africa, the three-year program is funded by Norad, a Norwegian development agency.

The program targets accelerators and entrepreneurs in five countries in Africa -- Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania -- that are focused on climate-related issues or, at least, in the area. (There's also one investment fund). Workshops cover four main themes including blue economy, climate adaptation, food security and renewable energy.

Since the focus is on both ESOs and startups, the program takes a dual-track approach. The first part, which is currently underway, aims to help participants from 14 accelerators develop the necessary technical expertise for expanding their work. Experts lead workshops looking in more depth at the four main thematic areas, with case studies of entrepreneurs and a discussion of investors in the area. ""As ecosystem hubs, ESOs are strategically situated to catalyze both the necessary increase in capital and education needed to de-risk green businesses and grow the green-tech ecosystem,"" says Susan Nakami, regional lead at Village Capital.

There's also a big emphasis on collaboration. Take Malvika Bhansali, programs associate at Pangea Accelerator, a Nairobi-based accelerator participating in the program. ""We're concentrating on breaking down silos that currently exist in our ecosystem,"" she says. She's also learned about approaches used by accelerators in other regions that can work well in Kenya.

In addition, they've talked about issues related to the valuation of newer sectors, like blue economy. ""Investors don't have a lot of experience investing in it,"" says Jonas Tesfu, Pangea's founder.

Once part one is over, there will be a summit in Cape Town later this year for five of the 14 participants to discuss strategies for the second phase, which will start next year, based on issues that arose during the first stage. No matter what, it will focus on helping those accelerators ramp up their support of 500 climate-focused enterprises, as well as build a pipeline of promising startups using lessons learned to guide their programs. ""ESOs will take the thematic curriculum and embed into their regular programs,"" says Nakami.

There also will be a focus on getting startups ready to pitch to investors. To that end, Village Capital plans to make use of its existing tools and systems for investment readiness.

For Village Capital, which started working on the initiative more than a year ago, the ultimate goal is to address the lack of access to financing for both ESOs and startups. ""Supporting SEOs is the solution because they are strategically positioned to catalyze both the necessary increase in capital and access to information,"" says Nakami. ""We will build a longer-term foundation for success."""
Could The Basic SMS Save Content Creators From The Algorithm?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianshepherd/2024/09/30/could-the-basic-sms-save-content-creators-from-the-algorithm/,2024-09-30T13:51:53Z,"In an era where social media algorithms can make or break a creator's career overnight, a growing number of content creators are turning to an unlikely ally: the humble text message. This shift comes as creators seek to reclaim control over their audience relationships and shield themselves from the unpredictable tides of platform changes.

Mike Donoghue, co-founder of Subtext, a subscription-based text messaging platform, is at the forefront of this movement. In a recent interview with the Business of Creators, Donoghue shed light on the challenges creators face and how direct communication channels like SMS are becoming crucial in the creator economy.

The Algorithm Dilemma

""We looked at media companies and creators and artists and brands and athletes, the amount of time and money and love and effort and resources that went into building up these huge audiences and social channels, only for a lot of those same folks to come to the realization that, via algorithm shifts or monetization policy changes, they were renting the relationship with their biggest fans, as opposed to owning a direct, meaningful bilateral form of communication,"" Donoghue explained.

This sentiment echoes a growing concern among creators who have experienced the whiplash of sudden algorithm changes. A single update can dramatically reduce visibility, engagement, and, ultimately, income. This vulnerability has led many to seek out more stable, direct channels to their audience.

SMS: The Unsung Hero of Creator-Fan Relationships

Enter SMS. While it might seem like a step backward in the age of sophisticated social media platforms, text messaging offers several unique advantages:

1. Near-Perfect Open Rates: ""The open rate on our messaging is still 98%,"" Donoghue revealed. This staggering figure dwarfs the average email open rates, which hover around 20-30%.

2. High Engagement: ""The CTR, if that's a metric that you care about, is north of 32%,"" Donoghue added. For context, average click-through rates for emails are typically in the single digits.

3. Direct Communication: Unlike social media posts that may or may not be seen due to algorithmic filtering, SMS messages land directly in a fan's most personal inbox - their text messages.

4. Ownership of Data: With SMS, creators own their subscriber list, providing a level of security that social media platforms can't match.

Subtext: Empowering Creators Through SMS

Subtext is positioning itself as a bridge between creators and this powerful communication channel. The platform allows creators to set up subscription-based text messaging services, providing a direct line to their most engaged fans.

""Our goal always is to facilitate the empowerment of creators and give them something that they can own,"" Donoghue stated. This ownership extends beyond just the communication channel - it includes valuable data and insights about the audience.

Beyond Monetization: Building Community

While the monetary benefits are clear, the true value of SMS lies in its ability to foster genuine connections. Donoghue shared an example of how musician Maggie Rogers used the platform:

""The concept was, people can call in, they can listen to a snippet of the new single, and then leave a voicemail expressing what they thought about the single.""

This level of interaction creates a sense of intimacy and exclusivity that large social media platforms struggle to match. It turns passive followers into active community members, deepening the bond between creator and fan.

The Future of Creator-Fan Relationships

As we look to the future, Subtext's approach to creator-fan relationships could well become the new norm. With growing concerns about the dominance of big tech in our digital lives and the precarious nature of social media algorithms, creators are increasingly looking for ways to own their audience relationships.

""More and more people are looking at the social channels as sort of a top of the funnel type of execution,"" Donoghue observes, ""and then saying, how do I convert people to an experience that I can not only directly monetize, but also creates a portable audience for me, that I can take platform to platform?""

This shift towards owned audiences and direct monetization is likely to accelerate as creators become more business-savvy and seek to build sustainable, long-term careers. Platforms like Subtext that enable this direct relationship are well-positioned to play a crucial role in this evolving ecosystem.

In an age of cutting-edge AI and virtual reality, it might seem counterintuitive that a technology as old as SMS could be leading a revolution in creator-fan relationships. Yet, that's precisely what's happening. By offering a direct, intimate, and highly engaging channel of communication, SMS marketing through platforms like Subtext is empowering creators to take control of their audience relationships and build sustainable, profitable businesses.

The text message revolution is here, and it's changing the game for creators everywhere. As Donoghue advises, ""Focus on your first 10 community members. Focus on your first 100 community members, really lean into the quality of that relationship and sort of activate them as your super fans and your evangelists for what it is that you're doing."""
A Bitcoin Beginner's Travel Guide To Guatemala,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/30/a-bitcoin-beginners-travel-guide-to-guatemala/,2024-09-30T13:37:38Z,"An important part of life for many bitcoin enthusiasts is exploring the different options available to remain free and sovereign while living in economies that are friendly to their lifestyle.

Since the enactment of the Bitcoin Law in El Salvador a couple of years ago, Latin America has become an attractive region for this purpose, not only because of its relaxed rules regarding the use of bitcoin in some countries but also due to its natural resources, welcoming people, and delicious cuisine.

For this reason, I've written this second travel guide, this time focusing on Guatemala, a must-visit country for bitcoiners. Within its territory you'll find a circular economy known as Lago Bitcoin, located on the shores of Lake Atitlán in the town of Panajachel. Here, you'll find more than 50 businesses that accept bitcoin as a form of payment.

From hotels to pharmacies, you can experience a full day of living with bitcoin. Some of my recommendations for businesses that helped me cover all my needs during my stay in Pana are Hotel Los Manantiales, Restaurant Coffe Art, Restaurant Atlantis, Restaurant Monkey Pizza, Jazz Café, Casa Amaranto, Laguna Azul Travel Agency, the Bitcoin tuk-tuk, and Ruby Laundry.

A super tip if you want to explore other options is to use a website called BTC Maps, which will help you find local businesses and ATMs, not just in Guatemala but anywhere you travel around the world.

Within the Bitcoin Lake community, meetups are held from time to time. My friend Eliazar, a Panajachel native and a volunteer of this project since 2021, is an excellent person to get in touch to find out about upcoming bitcoiner events, contact the bitcoiner tuk-tuk, or get ideas about different tourist activities in Pana or the towns surrounding the deepest lake in Central America.

Now that I've told you how amazing Lago Bitcoin is, you're probably wondering how to get there. Depending on your location, you can find flights ranging from $100 to $1,000. Before boarding your plane, don't forget to fill out your SAT form, a mandatory immigration questionnaire. This will help you avoid some delays when entering the country.

A basic tip that will be useful not just for this trip but for many others is to purchase an eSIM with bitcoin before taking off to have local internet service in the country. You can easily buy it through Bitrefill.

Once you arrive in Guatemala and collect your luggage, you'll find different booths outside offering private or shared shuttles at various prices that can take you to Panajachel. The approximate cost of a shared shuttle is 330 quetzales per person, which is around $43 at today's exchange rate.

I should mention that the journey to Pana is long, taking between 3 to 4 hours with many curves, so I recommend taking some medication for motion sickness before boarding your transportation.

However, if you prefer to save time and enjoy luxury, there are helicopter services from the airport that can take you to your destination. Currently, there's even a service that accepts bitcoin payments, which you can find online under the name ""Let's Fly.""

As for alternatives to obtain quetzales, the currency of Guatemala, if you're one of those bitcoiners who travel light on fiat but loaded with sats, there's an ATM at Hotel Amaranto with a very friendly exchange rate at the time of my visit.

If you've spent many days in Panajachel and want to explore other beautiful places in Guatemala, Antigua is another town where you'll find some businesses that accept bitcoin; Café 12 Onzas or Antigua Cerveza are excellent options for food and entertainment with friends.

Guatemala City doesn't lag behind either, as Zone 4 has an area known to the bitcoiner community as ""El Barrio Bitcoin."" Besides being a kind of tech hub for startups and companies, it offers a wide variety of gastronomic places that accept Bitcoin. Meetups are often held in this area, and it's another spot where I found an ATM for exchanges.

Hoping this guide proves useful, I invite you to immerse yourself in the bitcoiner experience of Guatemala and enjoy a country that combines tradition with innovation in a truly unique way. Safe travels, and may your adventure be filled with satoshis and great moments!"
Are Small Businesses Growing?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danestangler/2024/09/30/are-small-businesses-growing/,2024-09-30T13:37:33Z,"The dataset used, how ""small businesses"" are defined, what part of the country is measured, what sector of the economy is tracked, seasonal variations -- these and many other factors determine what answer, at any given moment, can be provided to that question.

We know with some certainty that new business creation remains strong. Through its Business Formation Statistics (BFS), the Census Bureau tracks monthly business applications filed with the IRS. As explored here previously, monthly business applications spiked in mid-2020 and have stayed at historically elevated levels. In July, for example, the number of new business applications was still 57% higher than the monthly average between January 2015 and February 2020.

That's also true for ""high-propensity"" business applications -- those, based on several variables, that the Census Bureau deems likely to become firms with employees. The number of high-propensity business applications in July was 30% higher than the 2015-20 monthly average. Americans appear to remain entrepreneurially optimistic, even as observers put the odds of a recession at somewhere between 20 and 30%.

What about existing small businesses? Are they similarly optimistic? More importantly, how are they performing? It's one thing for lots of new business applications to be filed and for some share of them to be probable employer firms. It's another to look at the environment into which those businesses are entering and attempt to gauge prospects for growth. This is not an easy task -- fortunately, some organizations make valiant and credible efforts to do so.

The monthly Fiserv Small Business Index, useful because it is calculated from point-of-sale transaction data, has generally trended upward over the past year. This is true for both its Sales Index and Transactional Index. The nice thing about Fiserv's data is it gives us a sense of how both small businesses and their customers are doing. In August, for example, average transaction size in retail sectors fell both monthly and yearly even though the number of transactions rose.

Fiserv data give us a broad view of sales performance across small businesses of all sizes. We get a slightly different look from the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index which, for the first time, now includes revenue as well as employment data.* It captures the smallest businesses, those with fewer than 10 employees.

In its latest reading, the QuickBooks Small Business Index finds that, since February 2024, average monthly revenue at small businesses has risen six consecutive months. While monthly revenue growth among small businesses is more volatile, it has been in positive territory for four straight months. Employment data in the QuickBooks index is less rosy. Through the first seven months of 2024, employment growth has been positive in just one, July. The July growth number was small (0.03%) but was the first positive reading since December 2023.

Based on these two data sources, existing small businesses are enjoying mildly positive growth. Recent survey data from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) tend toward a more negative view. The net percent of respondents regarding earnings changes has been persistently and deeply negative for four years. There's less negativity in ""actual sales changes"" but still a clear downward trend (as measured by net percent of respondents) since mid-2023.

So, positive or negative? What do we see if we look under the surface?

Headline findings in a small business index could obscure considerable unevenness among different types of companies. And that's exactly what the Fiserv and QuickBooks indices find: wide variation across economic sectors.

In the QuickBooks Small Business Index, the highest revenue growth rate was in the Education and Health Services sector. The greatest revenue decline was in Finance and Real Estate. By contrast, in the Fiserv Small Business Index, the largest monthly increases from July to August were found in Truck Transportation and Food Manufacturing, with the biggest declines in Insurance Carriers and Educational Services. (The two indices are not precisely comparable regarding sectors, as they capture difference slices of the NAICS codes that categorize economic activity.)

Geographic variation is evident as well. According to Fiserv data, small businesses in Illinois and South Dakota saw healthy monthly increases in sales -- their counterparts in Vermont and New Mexico did not. Similarly, in the QuickBooks index, small business revenue grew in Indiana and Illinois but fell in New York and Oregon.

Some small businesses are growing, some are not; in some states, small businesses are adding jobs and increasing sales, in others they aren't. That sounds like a fairly banal conclusion to be drawn from the rich data we have at hand. Yet it should remind us of two things.

First, while there is a ""national"" U.S. economy, shaped by interest rates and the tax code and the like, many American businesses -- and thus many American workers -- are still more affected by what happens either regionally or within their specific economic sector. This matters for educational institutions, lenders, job seekers, potential entrepreneurs, and others.

Second, what we call ""small business"" is far from a monolithic entity. That matters especially for policymakers. We can strive to make laws and policies to help small businesses across the board. We should keep in mind, however, that the effects of those actions will ultimately be shaped by sectoral and regional factors."
Is It (Finally) Time To Invest In China?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicksargen/2024/09/30/is-it-finally-time-to-invest-in-china/,2024-09-30T13:23:15Z,"This question is being asked in the wake of policy actions announced by China's government last week to support economic growth by bolstering the country's property market and stock market. They represent a sea-change from Xi Jinping's previous stance in which he refrained from undertaking bold government stimulus.

Traders, investors and speculators have responded enthusiastically to the policy announcements: The 15% increase in the benchmark CSI-300 index last week and 8.5% rise today represents the strongest showing since 2008. According to Bloomberg, the index has entered a technical bull market after it had declined by more than 45% from its high in 2021 through mid-September (see chart below).

The policy shift began with the People's Republic Bank of China (PBoC) announcing it would cut interest rates, lower reserve requirements and reduce the cost of existing mortgages. It will also take unprecedented action to bolster the stock market by enabling market participants to borrow government bonds from the PBoC by using stocks as collateral in order to strengthen their balance sheets.

China's Politburo subsequently devoted its September meeting to the economy, where it resolved to arrest the property market's slide. According to Reuter's, it will issue an additional 2 trillion yuan of bonds, which is equivalent to about 1.5% of GDP. Half of the proceeds will be used to backstop local governments, while the other half will encourage spending by households and businesses.

These measures represent about one half of the ""bazooka"" package during the 2008 global financial crisis. The final tally eventually reached about 9.5 trillion yuan over more than two years, which is widely credited for China's economy leading the global recovery.

The main question today is whether the latest actions will serve as a catalyst to revive China's economy and renew foreign capital inflows. Previously, China's equity markets had been among the worst performers globally. Bank of America's latest Global Fund Manager Survey showed growth expectations for China were at a three-year low, and the report stated that ""avoid China"" had become one of the biggest themes of investors it surveyed.

By comparison, eight of 12 investors in a Bloomberg survey last week believed the actions will be the turning point for a long-term rally, while four viewed it as a short-term rebound.

My take is the rally may continue for a while longer. The main reason is the market selloff over the last three years has left Chinese stocks relatively cheap. For example, China's forward P/E ratio is roughly one-half of that for the S&P 500 index. Consequently, global equity managers may increase their allocations to Chinese equities considering that most are considerably underweight now. In addition, the policy actions could give the economy a temporary lift, which would help to improve investor confidence.

Nonetheless, I remain skeptical that China's equity markets are a good long-term strategic play. The principal reason is the economic slowdown in recent years is mainly a result of structural forces rather than cyclical forces, and China's leaders are reluctant to embark on much-needed economic reforms.

One of the biggest challenges policymakers faces in bolstering China's long-term growth is its population growth has stagnated owing to the former one child policy. Even though this policy has been repealed, China faces declines in its population from 1.4 billion to 1.3 billion by the middle of this century according to the latest United Nations report.

Another challenge is the property sector is plagued by an excess supply of housing units that are estimated to exceed 7 million homes according to Reuters. Government statistics show prices for new and existing homes are down by 5% and 8%, respectively, over the past three years. Bloomberg economics estimates that a 5% decline in home prices could wipe out up to $2.7 trillion in household net worth.

It is also widely acknowledged that to bolster economic growth Chinese households need to spend more and save less. Yet, the lack of a social safety net makes it difficult for this to happen. Furthermore, household debt has more than doubled in the past decade, and deflationary pressures are building that make it harder to lessen the debt burden.

Meanwhile, one of the biggest mistakes the government made three years ago was to clamp down on leading technology companies such as Alibaba and Tencent. According to the Financial Times, fundraising for both domestic and overseas venture capital has ""fallen off a cliff"" since 2022. Yet the government has not acknowledged that the shift to favor state-owned entities over private enterprises is likely to hamper efforts to boost China's productivity, which has been on a slowing trend.

Finally, China's strategy to emphasize export-led growth in electronic vehicles and other manufactures faces a growing backlash in the U.S. and European Union, both of which have increased tariffs on imports from China in recent years. Moreover, Donald Trump has threatened to increase tariffs on Chinese goods by as much as 60% should he win the presidency.

For these reasons, I believe global investors need to be nimble if they jump on board the rally in Chinese stocks."
"NY Times endorses Kamala Harris, chooses Democrat in 17th straight presidential election",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ny-times-endorses-kamala-harris-chooses-democrat-17th-straight-presidential-election,2024-09-30T13:21:25Z,"Kaylee McGhee White of the Washington Examiner breaks down the implications of the upcoming vice presidential debate and warnings from Rep. Elissa Slotkin, claiming that Vice President Harris is 'underwater' in Michigan.

The New York Times continued its 64-year streak of supporting Democrats for president over Republicans by endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris this week.

""Kamala Harris is the only choice,"" The New York Times editorial board wrote in an article from Monday headlined, ""The only patriotic choice for president.""

This is the 17th straight election that the outlet has supported a Democratic candidate for president over a Republican, with the outlet's continuous blue streak beginning in 1960 with John F. Kennedy. The last time Republican it backed was President Dwight D. Eisenhower, when he successfully ran for re-election in 1956.

NEW YORK TIMES REPORT RIPS VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS' 'FRIENDLY' MSNBC INTERVIEW: 'ROUNDABOUT RESPONSES'

""This unequivocal, dispiriting truth -- Donald Trump is not fit to be president -- should be enough for any voter who cares about the health of our country and the stability of our democracy to deny him re-election,"" the editorial board wrote.

""For this reason, regardless of any political disagreements voters might have with her, Kamala Harris is the only patriotic choice for president,"" The Times wrote.

Harris, The Times continued, is not a ""perfect candidate"" but is a ""more than necessary alternative"" to Trump on issues like the economy, immigration, and America's international alliances.

The Times acknowledged that some voters are concerned over Harris' press avoidance strategy.

""Many voters have said they want more details about the vice president's plans, as well as more unscripted encounters in which she explains her vision and policies,"" The Times wrote. ""They are right to ask. Given the stakes of this election, Ms. Harris may think that she is running a campaign designed to minimize the risks of an unforced error -- answering journalists' questions and offering greater policy detail could court controversy, after all -- under the belief that being the only viable alternative to Mr. Trump may be enough to bring her to victory.""

NEW YORK TIMES REPORT ADMITS 'INTERVIEWS ARE A WEAKNESS' FOR KAMALA HARRIS

""That strategy may ultimately prove winning, but it's a disservice to the American people and to her own record,"" the editorial board continued. ""And leaving the public with a sense that she is being shielded from tough questions, as Mr. Biden has been, could backfire by undermining her core argument that a capable new generation stands ready to take the reins of power.""

The endorsement doesn't come as a surprise. In 2016, the Times' liberal board declared Trump to be the worst major party nominee in the nation's history and has continued to speak out vehemently against him since then. It endorsed Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden against him in the past two elections.

During its lengthy streak of supporting Democrats, the Times has endorsed such candidates as George McGovern in 1972, Walter Mondale in 1984 and Michael Dukakis in 1988, who all were defeated in electoral landslides.

The Trump campaign was unconcerned.

""An endorsement from the New York Times is about as useful as a moldy old dishrag that hasn't been cleaned in years,"" Trump Campaign Communications Director Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""They had to apologize in 2016 for misleading their readers and completely misreading President Trump's historic victory, but it seems like they still haven't learned their lesson. Kamala Harris is endorsed by the Fake News because she is fake, a phony, and unfit for office.""

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

The Times isn't alone in major newspapers having blatantly Democratic-favoring editorial boards. The Washington Post began endorsing presidential candidates in 1976 and has never supported the Republican hopeful.

RYAN & WOLF: We're moderate capitalists and our presidential pick is simple,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ryan-wolf-were-moderate-capitalists-presidential-pick-simple,2024-09-30T13:14:06Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The nation just heard competing economic speeches from Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, both with a focus on manufacturing. This is not a surprise as we believe that whoever has the better plan for the rebuilding and revitalizing of industrial America will win the election.

Of course, we are big supporters of the Harris-Walz campaign, but we write this as two clear-eyed moderates and capitalists who know the stakes in this election. And, we believe Harris has a significantly more persuasive and credible argument to make to the American people.

Why is that? Because the Biden-Harris administration's bold, and mostly bipartisan legislative victories, have stemmed the tide of 40 years of deindustrialization. Their administration has added nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs and is rebuilding America's rotting infrastructure with over $1 trillion of investment in the modernization of our roads, bridges, broadband and ports. There is no better investment of America's hard-earned tax dollars than public infrastructure.

FORMER REPUBLICAN US SENATOR ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS, SAYS ELECTION OFFERS 'STARK CHOICE'

We both publicly applauded and supported the Biden-Harris bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act as well as the CHIPS and Science Act, and view them as two of the most consequential legislative accomplishments in our lifetime.

These acts have overwhelming broad-based support from unions, small and large business, Republicans, Democrats and independents (and co-author and former Rep. Ryan voted for both). And this is quite a contrast to Trump's failures. He talked about infrastructure week continually throughout his term but never even put up a bill (and still talking about it now).

Not only does a rebuilding America plan resonate strongly with the American people, but the American Society of Civil Engineers also gave America's infrastructure a grade of D+ in 2017 when Trump took office and a C- when he left, which was almost zero progress.

Currently, U.S. infrastructure investment spending is under 5% of GDP annually, which is at the low end versus other countries; with over a $1 trillion funding shortfall over the next five years with an ever-increasing deficit as we maintain, upgrade or modernize structures and systems. Infrastructure investment remains one of the best ways to bolster our economy!

A ""Modeling the Impact of Public Infrastructure"" study in 2023 found two major impacts on the GDP: short term (during construction phase) and long term (both directly and indirectly which can translate into consumer spending). These investments also have a huge multiplier effect because the new, high-paying jobs pay, on average, over 20% higher than the median income nationally.

So, while Trump has been doing the talking, Biden-Harris has been doing the walking. Since August 2024, approximately $564 billion has been deployed for 56,000 projects in 4,500 communities in all 50 states and territories. The initial investment is being deployed. Now it is time to double down.

The yin to infrastructure's yang is manufacturing. In the first quarter of 2024, the White House published the Future Made in America fact sheet showing incredible momentum:

During the Trump years, manufacturing got torched with a net loss of 75,000 manufacturing jobs versus hundreds of thousands of gains under Biden-Harris. It is worth noting that the Alliance for American Manufacturing (a non-partisan nonprofit) attributes Trump's decline mainly to erratic trade policies that he enacted, not the pandemic.

The king of chaos' policies were anti-business and anti-worker. And if you listened to the former president's speech in Georgia, you will understand why. He randomly pitched onerous across-the-board tariffs and old world, protectionist-style ideas targeted primarily at an iconic American company, John Deere.

This led to the Wall Street Journal editorial board writing that, ""A Deere in Trump's Political Headlights"" stating that ""Mr. Trump thinks he can bully Deere as he did Carrier ... Meantime, his threats help Democrats argue that Ms. Harris would be friendlier to business.""

Harris is friendlier to business. In her recent speech in Pittsburgh, she said one of her pillars for her ""opportunity economy"" was ""leading the world in the industries of the future."" Her goal is to out compete China with smart, pragmatic public investments and policies, all while working with business to strengthen our economic, national and energy security.

These kinds of capital-intensive projects in artificial intelligence and clean energy take time to build, which is why we are seeing a construction employment boom. Manufacturing jobs are coming back, and because of these policies huge growth is on the way. Look at what's already happening:

These successes are even winning over Republicans. Recently, a large group of House Republicans wrote a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson asking him not to repeal the IRA clean energy tax credits because they were creating jobs and factories in their districts. The administration needs to brag about this bipartisan support for their plan and build on it.

During the Trump years, manufacturing got torched with a net loss of 75,000 manufacturing jobs versus hundreds of thousands of gains under Biden-Harris. It is worth noting that the Alliance for American Manufacturing (a non-partisan nonprofit) attributes Trump's decline mainly to erratic trade policies that he enacted, not the pandemic.

As we look to the future, our recommendation to the next president would be to focus on a balanced, ""all of the above"" energy policy that includes natural gas, nuclear and renewables to help power this resurgence of manufacturing. And the creation of a National Infrastructure Financing Authority (NIFA) to promote continued public-private partnerships in transportation, energy, climate, AI and more.

Kamala Harris has the vision and experience to build on the initiatives that are already revitalizing industrial America. The choice is clear in this election. One candidate has a fresh vision for our future. And one has plans that are way more dangerous to our economic well-being than our failing infrastructure."
SAS Steers Toward Stronger AI Data Lifecyle Via Viya,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2024/09/30/sas-steers-toward-stronger-ai-data-lifecyle-via-viya/,2024-09-30T13:11:42Z,"AI needs history. To build the new artificial intelligence functions that we seek to put inside our modern enterprise and consumer applications, AI needs a base of historical data upon which to operate. While the Silicon Valley start-ups gain a lot of attention (and will inevitably continue to do so), it's worth remembering the ""family"" of (usually competing) firms that have been wrangling with data to create analysis intelligence way back when it was just called data mining.

Now boasting almost fifty years of operational health (the company was founded in 1976 by Dr James Goodnight and he is still CEO), SAS Institute is today more commonly known as SAS.

Quietly reinventing its core technology proposition through the various ages of client-server, early networks and disaggregated computing, the first era of the web and onward into cloud computing and today's fascination with generative AI (good old fashioned predictive and descriptive AI does still exist), SAS has moved with the times and continues to point toward new weather patterns on the data landscape. Nowhere is this truth born out more clearly than its work to create SAS Viya, the company's flagship data and AI platform.

Among the more important developments seen this year has been the arrival of the SAS Viya Workbench developer environment for building AI models. Described as a ""lightweight developer canvas"", this is a self-service on-demand compute environment for conducting data preparation, exploratory data analysis and developing analytical and machine learning models.

Technology vendors use the term lightweight to denote software tools that are built with fewer lines of code, a smaller memory footprint, tools that come with prebuilt scalable infrastructures to get started more quickly, or ones that are more nimble in terms of form, function and their ability to work inside tight spaces (edge computing across the Internet of Things for example) and SAS Viya Workbench checks all those boxes. Viya Workbench allows developers and modelers to work in the language of their choice, initially SAS and Python, with R available by the end of 2024.

A casual glance across the technology trade newswires will often bring up the term ""developer happiness"" and workflow productivity. SAS appears to have put the generation-Z factor into generative AI and thought about these factors (i.e. SAS Viya Workbench on-demand as already noted), but it's also self-provisioning and self-terminating, so therefore requires minimal IT support. The dedicated analytical environment features customizable CPU/GPU compute power to match the needs of any given project. Models and other results can then be used in SAS Viya for data management, governance and operational deployment.

If that's not happiness, then it's somewhere close to quite convenient and rather nice, so make sure you stop and have a decent lunch and eat some greens.

SAS insists that the business case for Viya Workbench is strong i.e. AI developers and modelers want to work with modern, open source packages and cutting-edge cloud computing functions, but they are also under pressure to deliver fast results and manage costs.

""The many challenges developers face aren't just minor annoyances - they are obstacles that prevent questions from being answered and work from getting done,"" said Jared Peterson, senior vice president of platform engineering, SAS. ""Viya Workbench provides maximum flexibility and results by allowing developers to use their language and integrated development environment of choice, tailor compute power up or down to meet the needs of the project, and ultimately boost their productivity and efficiency. They can work faster, be more creative and take more risks - which, let's be honest, is not only what's expected but it makes the job more fun.""

Additional AI developer happiness offerings currently in development from SAS include Viya Copilot, a technology for software engineers and data scientists designed to shoulder the administrative analytics tasks involved with solving industry-specific business problems. The tasks here would typically include code compilation, essential code commenting processes (i.e. annotations and documentation) and other actions designed to create streamlined code interpretation. With data scientists typically (we might even say ""always"") spending more time on data wrangling, data ingestion and crucial data preparation tasks than they would like to, this service may prove popular.

The SAS Vita total toolset is large and we need to stop somewhere, but let's make sure we also note SAS Data Maker, a technology which has been described as a trusted synthetic data generation tool. SAS Data Maker is built with a suite of synthetic data algorithms that can produce synthetic data for situations where original data is not available (perhaps because of personally identifiable information concerns, perhaps due to governance or cross-border restrictions between states or countries), but where analytical processing using carefully created synthetic data is still eminently useful. Synthetic data is also much-needed for AI analysis related to extremely uncommon events where we still want to perform modeling, such as medical environment analysis of patients with a rare condition, tumor or infection.

Keen to validate the use of its tools in the context of this discussion, SAS enlisted technology analyst house Futurum Group to evaluate the latest AI developer and data science tools. An analysis document has emerged this September 2024 which suggests that the SAS Viya data platform helps users execute the lifecycle of collecting data, building models and deploying decisions 4.6 times faster than ""selected competitors"" (see below) to increase innovation, speed up decision-making and drive revenue growth.

The Futurum Group analysis says Viya was compared to a leading commercial environment and non-commercial open source environments including Jupyter Notebook with MLFlow and Python Libraries.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics defines productivity as a comparison between input and output. In the case of Viya versus selected competitors, input factors measured encompassed data, labor, tools & technology, infrastructure and time. In his scenario, output includes business decisions, insights data products and innovation. But why is productivity important and how can a data and AI platform like Viya make a difference?

According to Forrester, as AI teams are comprised of data scientists, AI experts, business and technology leaders, organizations need AI/ML platform tooling that maximizes productivity for each role while enabling friction-free collaboration.

""Testing showed that an end-to-end data and AI lifecycle can be achieved with more than 4x greater productivity in SAS Viya than in competitive solutions,"" said Russ Fellows, VP and analyst at The Futurum Group. ""The ability to quickly begin working, together with SAS Viya's productivity enables AI teams to rapidly produce business results and insights from their data.""

Futurum studied Viya's speed in 2023; the productivity study is a continuation of their research. According to Futurum, Viya excels for a variety of technical and non-technical users. For example, data engineers are 16 times more productive accessing, preparing and governing data with Viya; data scientists are 3.5 times more productive building, optimizing and validating models; MLOps engineers are 4.5 times more productive automating, monitoring and retraining models; and business analysts and other non-technical staff can complete 86% of data lifecycle tasks using Viya, compared to 56% in the commercial environment and 47% in the non-commercial environment.

All of which really starts to beg the question - what do we want next from our AI tools, applications and data services?

It's a tough question to answer, but look at the facts i.e. the chatbots and user copilot technologies will continue to gain plenty of attention for most of the rest of this decade. The embedded AI on your smartwatch that you can interact with via Natural Language Processing enables you to ask what the weather is like, set an alarm or even turn a light on. That won't be old hat for a while, but it will become an assumed function sooner or later.

Nobody gets excited about Uber cars arriving, automated Google Chrome updates, Zoom calls or Bluetooth connectivity anymore, right?

Comments from Jay Upchurch, executive vice president and CIO at SAS may point the way, ""AI runs faster and more efficiently on Viya, so teams learn and see results faster. Viya provides agility and resiliency that empowers an organization to see opportunities before competitors do whether those opportunities involve approving customers for car loans, keeping trains safe or distributing merchandise from a retail distribution center.""

Perhaps it's these big picture industry-specific AI enhancements that impact a country's core infrastructure and entire economy that we hanker for most (remember how annoyed we were when supply chains broke during Covid-19?) as they start to manifest themselves. For that level of AI to really engage and penetrate, we'd need technology vendors with solid experience and maturity. A hero may rise."
"Gaining 26% This Year, Will Ericsson Stock Rally Any Further?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/30/gaining-26-this-year-will-ericsson-stock-rally-any-further/,2024-09-30T13:05:19Z,"Ericsson stock (NASDAQ: ERIC) has increased by about 26% year-to-date, outperforming the broader indices. Ericsson posted better-than-expected Q2 results, with revenue declining 7% but beating expectations, driven by a 5G licensing deal that boosted revenue and margins. Ericsson's revenue for the quarter declined by 7% year-over-year (y-o-y) to SEK 59.8 billion ($64.4 billion), with net income (loss) of SEK -11 billion, including a SEK -11.4 billion impairment impact. The company's Q2 EPS was SEK -3.34 compared to -$0.21 in the year-ago quarter. Sales in North America grew by 15% y-o-y, due to increased network sales. However, this was partly offset by a decline in India - where investment levels have normalized after a record year in 2023. Overall sales to the South East Asia, Oceania, and India region fell 44% y-o-y in Q1. That said, margins have increased with ERIC's adjusted gross margins growing to 43.9% up from 38.3% in the year-ago period, due to a higher mix of sales from the U.S. - which is seen as a high-value market. Going forward, the company's guidance suggests that no fundamental shift is underway toward meaningful new deployments. Ericsson's long-term growth trajectory is anticipated to remain sluggish unless strategic initiatives focused on midband 5G and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) generate substantial momentum. The company's revenue growth is currently projected to be low single digits, with modest operating leverage potential. It should be noted that the company's second-half sales are expected to benefit from contract deliveries in North America.

Notably, ERIC stock has performed worse than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were -7% in 2021, -44% in 2022, and 13% in 2023.

In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period.

Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could ERIC face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?

We forecast Ericsson Revenues to be $23.5 billion for the fiscal year 2024, down 6% y-o-y. Given our revenues and EPS forecast changes, we have revised Ericsson Valuation to $7 per share, based on a $0.53 expected EPS and a 13.2x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2024. That said, the company's stock appears expensive at the current levels, with our valuation at a 10% discount from the current market price.

It is helpful to see how its peers stack up. Check out how ERIC's Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Artisan Raises $7.3 Seed Round To Launch AI Employee For Sales Teams,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariashunina/2024/09/30/artisan-raises-73-seed-round-to-launch-ai-employee-for-sales-teams/,2024-09-30T13:05:07Z,"Artisan, a UK-founded company deploying human-like AI employees to replace the legacy GTM stack, has announced a $7.3 million Seed Round led by Oliver Jung, an early investor in Airbnb, Deel, and Revolut, with participation from Sequoia Scout, Y Combinator, Soma Capital, BOND Capital, Anu Hariharan, Paul Daversa, Fellow's Fund, Mento VC, and more. Just six months after being accepted into Y Combinator with a team of three, Artisan has launched Version 2 of its platform, onboarded over 100 companies, and expanded its team to 13 employees.

At the center of Artisan's innovative drive is its 23-year-old Founder and CEO, Jaspar Carmichael-Jack. A serial entrepreneur and the middle child of seven, Jaspar began his entrepreneurial journey at just seven years old. Today, he is building what he envisions as the next industrial revolution.

The company has already achieved $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) within just three months, boasting over 120 customers, including Treatwell and Fondo.

Onboarding is remarkably quick. According to Y Combinator, ""You onboard Ava with a 10-minute conversation, and using the inormation you give her and a scrape of your site, she can run an outbound email campaign. Ava has over 270M contacts and can send thousands of tailored emails to prospects on your behalf.""

Jaspar identifies two major challenges Artisan addresses: Automation and Consolidation.

As Jaspar mentions, ""It's such a strong need on a market for a product like this, the existing players in space don't work that well, it has been very easy for us to sell."" He also mentioned that doing Y Combinator was also really helpful, specifically, in terms of brand awareness. ""I think it's their biggest value"".

At Artisan, they build Artisans -- employees that are more human and capable of handling entire job functions, not agents. ""In the long run, no one wants to work with cold, unfeeling agents. We want people to have the same relationships with Artisans as they do with other employees,"" says the company's Founder and CEO.

Being a young founder makes the fundraising process easier, though hiring people who are ""double your age"" can be complicated. As of now, Jaspar is the youngest person in the company. The most important factor in building trust and motivating people is a company's culture. ""We hire for culture fit, we are passionate about building and mission-driven,"" he emphasizes.

Interestingly, the first check Jaspar received was from a cold LinkedIn message.

Another factor that distinguishes Artisan from other companies in the crowded market is its ambitious vision -- to build a generational company. This vision truly resonates with investors. Being charismatic and confident also helps, as does Jaspar's British accent.

According to Pitchbook's Enterprise SaaS Report, VC funding for the enterprise SaaS industry rebounded in Q2, with startups raising $21.9 billion across 713 deals -- the highest quarterly deal value in over a year.

Starting with sales, Artisan is replacing and automating the entire GTM SaaS stack. As stated on their website:

""We launched our AI Sales Agent, Ava, in February 2023. She automates 80% of a BDR's role and operates within our Artisan Sales platform, which consolidates dozens of outbound sales tools into a single platform. It's also the only sales software that automates personalized email writing with dynamic email playbooks capable of emulating any style a human BDR would use. In the past few months, we've seen strong interest from large B2B SaaS companies ready to consolidate their complex, fragmented software stacks.""

Next in Artisan's pipeline are Liam, the Marketing Artisan, and James, the Customer Success Artisan.

As the integration of AI into workplaces accelerates, Ava's ability to automate a significant portion of the BDR role signifies a profound shift in work dynamics and the role of human employees in the digital economy.

As the work landscape evolves, Artisan is focused on raising its Series A and onboarding mid-market and enterprise companies, paving the way for a new era in business development."
"China's Youth Should Not Be Seduced By ""Garbage Time"" Meme",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/drewbernstein/2024/09/30/chinas-youth-should-not-be-seduced-by-garbage-time-meme/,2024-09-30T13:04:59Z,"There are few sentiments as seductive to youth as pessimism and none so poisonous. In the West, we hear about young people giving up on the prospect of having children due to their ""rational"" concerns about climate change or housing costs.

In China, social media has been overrun by the meme of the ""garbage time of history,"" which suggests that China has entered a period of stagnation analogous to the final decades in which the Soviet Union slowly suffocated under a sclerotic leadership. Initially coined by the essayist Hu Wenhui, this term adopts the metaphor of a basketball game when one side has amassed so many points that the outcome is a foregone conclusion.

""When the overall situation is set, and defeat is inevitable no matter how hard you try, it's just a futile struggle,"" Hu said. ""How should those unfortunate enough to encounter the garbage time of history conduct themselves?""

The concept of ""garbage time"" provides a world-historical framing for the fashionable ethos of ""lying flat,"" in which young people choose to withdraw from China's hyper-competitive educational and professional race to focus on their personal interests. This Chinese counter-cultural movement recalls the young Americans who embraced the ""slacker"" identity tag during the recession of the early 1990s when the economy stalled under the weight of the savings and loan crisis, and unemployment spiked to nearly 8%.

What accounts for the attraction of the ""garbage time"" memes?

First, we should acknowledge that China is undergoing a profound reset in its economic model. Since 2009, its economy has been turbocharged by government infrastructure spending, breakneck real estate investment, and explosive credit formation by corporations and local governments. This model was ultimately unsustainable. The resulting correction parallels the deflation of Japan's real estate bubble in the 1990s and the American housing and credit derivative debacle in 2008.

As a result, China's Gen Z is coming of age in an environment of reduced expectations. GDP growth will likely downshift to a more modest pace over the next decade. Investing in housing is no longer a one-way bet. The ""easy money"" in financial services, e-commerce, and real estate development has already been made. Youth unemployment remains troublingly high at nearly 19%, even after the government adjusted the formula to calculate it.

For all these headwinds, succumbing to the defeatist ""garbage time"" vibe is a spectacularly wrong bet. The best times to start something new are when capital is scarce, established business models are faltering, and talent is plentiful.

Remember America's slacker generation? Fortunately, not every Gen Xer decided to focus their time on bong hits and coffee shop guitar solos. Instead, we saw a string of companies founded, including Nvidia (1993), Amazon (1994), eBay (1995), and Netflix (1997) that would fundamentally transform the American economy. Many of these were not straight-line successes and even went through near-death experiences, but they scrapped through the famine years until they found their groove.

Two decades ago, China was embarking on explosive growth that would shake the world. That transformation was rooted in cheap and abundant labor, massive land privatization and development, and accommodative credit policies.

Today, those drivers have reached their structural limits. But China brings a whole new set of strengths to the table. China's young people would be well advised to bet on the forces that will create the next few decades of opportunities rather than pining for the past.

First, China is unquestionably an economic, scientific, and technological peer to the United States. It is an irreplaceable manufacturing powerhouse with a density of supply chains, logistics, and practical industrial expertise that outstrips rivals. In several sectors, including new energy vehicles, renewable energy, drones, and battery technology, China has leap-frogged American technology to the point where American producers rely on steep tariff barriers to survive.

By 2025, China is expected to generate nearly twice the number of STEM PhDs as the U.S. In 2022, the US Patent and Trade Office granted four times as many patents in AI to Chinese inventors as to Americans. While American universities still lead in fundamental research in many fields, China may, in many cases, be better positioned to commercialize basic science given its robust industrial base and scale manufacturing.

China's past success was often based on being a low-cost, fast follower. Today, there are a growing number of fields in which Chinese companies and technologies have the opportunity to set the global standard, including robotics, mobility, AI applications, and renewables. Competing to define new markets carries a high risk of failure, but the rewards for the winners can be immense.

The second reason for optimism is that China is better positioned to compete in specific regions that will make an outsized contribution to global growth in the decades to come. According to the United Nations, there has been a lot of attention to China's aging workforce and the resulting socio-economic pressures, with nearly half of the population projected to be over 60 by 2020. However, this demographic crisis is not exclusively a Chinese problem; it is afflicting most of the developed world.

When you look at the regions projected to continue to experience stable or growing populations, including Africa, Southeast Asia, and parts of South America and the Middle East, you will see that Chinese companies and technology are well suited to these markets. Much of the manufacturing boom in Southeast Asia has been fueled by Chinese management expertise and capital. If Africa is to experience a green power industrial future, it will likely be by deploying Chinese technology. China is such a significant player in South America that even Argentina's anti-socialist firebrand president, Javier Milei, has had to dial back his rhetoric.

Therefore, if a bright and ambitious Chinese young person doesn't like the prospects in their home country, there is a world of opportunity to prepare for and take a risk in the decades ahead. The most convincing reason not to succumb to ""garbage time"" futility is that even failure and frustration provide enormous opportunities for growth. Pessimism is an indulgence that no young person of talent can afford."
More China Stimulus And A Looming Port Strike,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/09/30/more-china-stimulus-and-a-looming-port-strike/,2024-09-30T12:32:09Z,"U.S. Chipmakers Fall On China's Potential Chip Sector Investments

As we head into the final day of both the month and quarter, stock index futures are trading down slightly in premarket. On Friday, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. However, the Russell 2000 gained 0.7% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved higher by 0.5%. For the quarter, the S&P is up over 5% through Friday and over 1.5% for the month. The Nasdaq Composite is up over 2% for the quarter and 2.2% for the month.

One of the more interesting stories that I'm watching is what is taking place in China. With the Chinese economy struggling, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has unleashed a plethora of tools aimed at stimulating the economy. Some of these I've already discussed, but they include a lowering of mortgage rates, funding for buying stocks by institutions and also assisting with share buyback programs. As a result, Chinese stocks have rallied sharply and are up another 8% Monday. It's the best performing day for China's market since 2008. While the stimulus measures are showing initial strength, as I mentioned on Friday, this is a major attempt at boosting markets and should it fail, I'm not sure what more China has to offer in terms of stimulus tools. Therefore, I'm very focused on whether or not stocks can hold their gains or if this is simply a short-term rally in a bear market.

On a side note, U.S. chipmakers are indicated lower in premarket trading. One of the potential concerns with respect to China's stimulus efforts is they may choose to begin heavily investing in their own chip sector. That could in turn lead to greater competition and cheaper alternatives as companies forge ahead with Artificial Intelligence (AI) related investments.

Back here at home, there are a number of significant newsworthy items. I'll start with the looming strike on the East Coast. The International Longshoremen's Association is set to go on strike tonight at midnight if a new contract isn't accepted. There are some 45,000 workers who could potentially strike, shutting down ports from Maine to Texas. According to The Wall Street Journal, the strike would impact imports of food, vehicles, heavy machinery, construction materials, chemicals, furniture, clothes and toys. The economic impact could cost the U.S. economy an estimated $3.8 - $4.5 billion per day. Companies that could be impacted by a strike include Walmart, Caterpillar, General Motors and others. This is definitely a situation worth monitoring, especially as we head into the holiday shopping season. Also, should the strike go on for an extended period of time, it could reintroduce inflationary pressures.

There are a couple of companies in the news this morning, starting with Stellantis. The automaker is warning on their forecast for gross profit margins. As a result, that stock is down 13% in premarket. I'll be curious how other automakers react to the Stellantis news, as well as the looming ports strike. AT&T is selling their 70% stake in DirectTV business to private equity firm TPG for $7.6 billion. At the same time, DirectTV announced this morning that they reached an agreement to purchase Dish, which is owned by EchoStar. The details are a bit complicated, but essentially result in DirectTV assuming $9.75 billion of Dish's debt. And lastly, shares of CVS are higher in premarket trading by 3%. The company is being pressured by activist shareholder Glenview Capital to make changes aimed at creating greater value.

In the broader economy, we are heading into what could be an interesting period. This is a heavy week for economic data with the theme being jobs. Tomorrow, we'll get the latest report on job openings and then Wednesday, a look at private, non-farm payroll hires. However, Friday will be the big day with the latest unemployment figures scheduled for release. I'll have more on that in my Wednesday piece.

For today, I'm watching the VIX which had a late day run on Friday. The VIX is up 2% in premarket and given the geopolitical issues as well as economic news coming, I can't say I'm too surprised. In addition, we're just under two weeks away from the beginning of earnings season and a month away from the election. Not to mention, October markets have a history of throwing child-like temper tantrums. Therefore, there are a lot of potential catalysts floating around and I think it's fair to suggest we could be in for some choppy trading. Like I suggested last Friday, it may be a good time to review your holdings and how your portfolio is positioned as we head into the final quarter for the year. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."

Standing over six feet tall and with long braids, Snoop Dogg was hard to miss as the torchbearer at the Paris Olympics. And he's become a fixture for all ages.

Snoop's public image has changed dramatically since he was in and out of prison before his early rap career, thanks in part to shifting attitudes about cannabis and hip-hop -- but also his own reinvention.

Coming off his work for NBC at the Olympics, Snoop has never been more popular. This fall, he'll join The Voice and release a new album produced by Dr. Dre. And yes, America's favorite stoner uncle is looking for new joint ventures.

""I just think when you're organic and authentic to who you are, eventually the world will catch up,"" he tells Forbes.

In our upcoming edition of The Forbes 400 -- the definitive ranking of the wealthiest Americans -- 54 billionaires on the list are the controlling owners of a sports team in a major professional league. The 20 richest owners from that group are now worth a combined $504 billion, according to Forbes estimates, a 32% increase from a year ago.

Nearly a hundred people have died and hundreds more are still unaccounted for after Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida last week, leaving widespread power outages across six states and historic flooding in North Carolina. In a press conference Sunday, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said the state is facing an ""unprecedented tragedy.""

Billionaire Peter Thiel offloaded $600 million worth of stock in data mining firm Palantir last week, and he's not the only insider to do so. Thiel, who cofounded and invested in the company, started the sales one day after Palantir joined the S&P 500, with its share price up 150% from a year ago.

Last month, the NFL became the last major professional league to open its doors to private equity firms, a watershed moment for a league that has seen team values skyrocket into the multibillion-dollar range, severely limiting the pool of potential buyers.

DreamWorks' The Wild Robot took the top spot at the box office and exceeded many projections for its debut weekend, as Francis Ford Coppola's self-financed Megalopolis flopped. Coppola's sci-fi epic cost about $120 million and drew in just $4 million in its debut weekend, but the well-known director wasn't wasn't too concerned about the film's financial success, telling the AP, ""I say: Give me less money and give me more friends.""

Two Hezbollah leaders were killed in Israeli strikes over the weekend, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, a major victory for Israel but a further escalation in the conflict. Israel expects Hezbollah or its allies to launch retaliatory strikes following Nasrallah's death and has prohibited gatherings of more than 1,000 until Monday evening in certain parts of the country, the Washington Post reported.

The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board sanctioned four audit firms for violating its rules and standards. The four firms were each censured and subjected to a monetary penalty ranging from $30,000 to $45,000. Auditing a public company involves determining whether its financial statements follow the generally accepted accounting principles.

TOPLINE Judy Faulkner, the billionaire founder and CEO of Epic Systems, has eschewed any outside interference in the company whose medical records software is used for 325 million patients worldwide.

And she intends to keep it that way. At 81 years old, Faulkner told Forbes in an interview she has no plans to retire. ""If you retire, you don't have a purpose in living much anymore,"" she says.

Over the past 45 years, Faulkner has become one of the most influential people in the $4.5 trillion U.S. healthcare system. Epic's software is used for patients in more than half of the 890,000 or so hospital beds in the U.S., according to estimates from the health IT research firm KLAS.

The big unknown is whether Epic's dominance will persist after its exacting, visionary leader is no longer at the helm. Plus, the hospital market is saturated. Epic's next stage of growth will have to come from inroads with new customer groups, like health insurers, medical devices and laboratories. One such move recently prompted an antitrust lawsuit alleging Epic holds a monopoly on electronic health records, charges the company dismissed as ""baseless.""

Faulkner says she has already set a plan in motion to ensure that Epic remains private and employee-owned in perpetuity. She currently owns nearly half of Epic, and Forbes estimates her net worth to be around $7.7 billion. The rest of the company is owned by employees and a handful of Faulkner's family members.

WHY IT MATTERS ""While Cerner (now Oracle Health), AllScripts (now Veradigm) and Athenahealth, grew by taking venture capital money, executing mergers and acquisitions, going public and then private again, Faulkner has exerted full control,"" says Forbes senior writer Katie Jennings. ""She says this is central to what sets Epic apart from its competitors: Since Epic has never acquired another company, it hasn't had to build bridges to interface from one type of software to another, which is why many IT acquisitions fall apart.""

"Trump narrows Harris' small lead in battleground Michigan, Wisconsin, poll finds",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-narrows-harris-small-lead-battleground-michigan-wisconsin-poll-finds,2024-09-30T12:27:09Z,"Former President Trump spoke to supporters in Prairie du Chien, Wis., on Saturday, focusing on the arrest of a Tren de Aragua gang member accused of sex crimes.

Former President Trump has narrowed Vice President Kamala Harris' small lead in the battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin, new polling by the New York Times/Siena College finds.

Among likely voters in Michigan, Harris received 48% support, while Trump garnered 47%, locking the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees in an essential tie well within the poll's margin of error. Harris polled at 49% among likely voters in Wisconsin, while Trump received 47% support in the same state where polls usually overestimate backing for Democrats, according to the Times.

The Times pointed to the economy, which remains the most important issue for voters, as Trump's strength on economic issues helps him edge away at Harris' slim lead in the two northern battlegrounds.

The new poll contrasts with August's New York Times/Siena College survey, which has Harris leading Trump by four percentage points, 50% to 46% among likely voters, in the battlegrounds of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania as well. That poll was the first conducted as the race reshaped with Harris becoming the presidential nominee following President Biden's July departure from the contest.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP IN CLOSE RACE IN NORTH CAROLINA

Now with less than 40 days until the Nov. 5 election, New York Times/Siena College polling places Harris ahead of Trump by nine percentage points in Nebraska's Second Congressional District, whose sole electoral vote could be critical in the Electoral College. The Times says Harris could receive exactly 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House if she picks up that district - given the vice president also wins Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Trump is victorious in the Sun Belt battleground states.

Though Ohio does not fall into the battleground state category for the presidential race, it's home to one of the nation's most competitive Senate contests between Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown and GOP challenger Bernie Moreno. New York Times/Siena College polling has Trump six points ahead of Harris in Ohio, whereas Brown leads Moreno by four points.

TRUMP VISITS WISCONSIN TOWN SHAKEN BY MIGRANT CRIME: 'CROSSED KAMALA'S WIDE-OPEN BORDER'

Democrats have enjoyed an advantage for months in presidential contest polling in Wisconsin, which has been determined by less than a percentage point in four of the last six elections, including the 2020 race, the Times notes. Meanwhile, Biden carried Michigan by three points in 2020, while Trump won that Wolverine State in 2016 by three-tenths of a point.

Abortion was placed as the second most important issue among Michigan and Wisconsin voters.

The new poll found 18% of voters in the two states listed abortion as their top issue, noting an uptick since May when 13% of voters in Michigan and Wisconsin marked it as their determining cause. On abortion, Harris leads Trump by 20 points in Michigan, but now only by 13 points in Wisconsin. Harris had a 22-point lead over Trump in August on the abortion issue in the Badger State."
China Stimulus Sends Las Vegas Sands Stock Up 8% In A Day,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/30/china-stimulus-sends-las-vegas-sands-stock-up-8-in-a-day/,2024-09-30T12:12:38Z,"Las Vegas Sands stock, a casino and resort company operating in Macau and Singapore, rose 8% on 26th September, as compared to a 0.4% increase in the S&P 500 index. LVS's peer Wynn stock (NASDAQ: WYNN) was also up 8.20% on the same day. China has announced plans to inject approximately 1 trillion yuan (~$142 billion) into its largest state-owned banks as part of its stimulus measures. By making this strategic move, the banks will be able to support China's struggling economy, which has been facing shrinking margins, faltering profits, and a rise in bad loans in recent years. The news sparked optimism among investors, leading to a surge in the Macau casino's stock price.

LVS' business in Macau largely collapsed in 2021 and 2022 due to strict Covid-19 restrictions that severely impacted tourist inflows to the region. Now the situation in the Macau gaming market has recovered considerably. Tourist arrivals at Macau have rebounded strongly and LVS and other casino players have witnessed sizable gains from the release of all the pent-up demand. Over the first half of 2024, the number of visitor arrivals increased by 43.6% year-over-year (y-o-y) to 16.7 million. However, visitation to the market remains well below the levels reached prior to the pandemic.

The decrease in LVS stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were -37% in 2021, 28% in 2022, and 3% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period.

Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could LVS face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?

In Q2, LVS' revenue increased 8.7% y-o-y to $2.76 billion but landed $60 million short of the consensus expectation. Its consolidated adjusted property EBITDA was $1.07 billion compared to $973 million a year ago. The casino company said the Marina Bay Sands property delivered $512 million in adjusted property EBITDA during the quarter and Macao operations contributed $561 million. In addition, the company's earnings per share came in at $0.55, up 20% y-o-y, but missed expectations by 1 cent. Its operating results reflect growth in Macao and Singapore businesses compared to the second quarter of 2023. On the balance sheet, LVS ended the quarter with unrestricted cash balances of $4.7 billion. The casino operator had access to $4.4 billion for borrowing under its U.S., SCL, and Singapore revolving credit facilities. Total debt outstanding at the end of the second quarter excluding finance leases and financed purchases was $13.7 billion.

Why Amazon's Back To Work Order Is A Warning For The Future Of Work,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/annkowalsmith/2024/09/30/why-amazons-back-to-work-order-is-a-warning-for-the-future-of-work/,2024-09-30T12:12:26Z,"Last week, CEO Andy Jassy called all of Amazon's employees back to work five days a week, to preserve the company's culture and return to a pre-Covid reality. By clawing back the pre-pandemic era, Jassy reminded the world that companies have officially regained the upper hand-hiring, firing and changing the rules at will. And Amazon has certainly flexed that power, laying off more 27,000 of its workers since 2022 and now rescinding flexibility for the rest.

Amazon's decision isn't just another episode in the return-to-work soap opera. It's actually the canary in the coal mine for a dangerous problem. The relationship between employers and employees has become one based on power, not mutual respect and collaboration. And that's seriously eroding trust, which drives engagement, loyalty, belonging and performance.

And leaders know this full well. PWC's 2024 Trust Survey found that 93% of business executives say building and maintaining trust is critical to the bottom line. Yet only 23% of employees trust their company leaders to do the right thing. And 40% of employees don't feel trusted by their leaders. Little wonder with so many companies using surveillance devices to measure keystrokes, police attendance and test loyalty.

This is a far cry from the pandemic-promised ""new normal""-a clean sheet of paper to design and build the winning workplace of the future. We imagined a place where productivity and flexibility worked hand in glove, where employees could learn, grow and collaborate in innovative new ways-together. But this vision has stalled-with whiplash-level force. Through the lens of Amazon's actions, the workplace looks more like Game of Thrones: a battle to control and conquer rather than create a community of collaborative colleagues. Here are three ways we're all going to lose if the battle continues.

To state the obvious, the last few years have seen a lot of upheaval. First, demand for talent in a tight labor market empowered employees to make significant inroads in work-life balance. Employers offered flexible and hybrid work options, wellness benefits and rising wages. As the economy became uncertain, employers reclaimed control, leveraging an extraordinary number of layoffs that destabilized and disenfranchised workers. Flexible work had become a common, even expected, feature of the modern workplace, until many organizations, like Amazon, arbitrarily pulled employees back to offices.

This power struggle takes a toll on both employees and the organization -- replacing relationships with transactions. Employees are not widgets. Rapidly growing technologies, diverse generational norms and a tough competitive landscape are bringing seismic changes to the workplace, requiring individuals to work together more than ever. The transactional tenor of many recent workplace decisions forces people to protect themselves, to act competitively instead of collaboratively. Employees who trust that their employers have their back are 260% more motivated at work. When people feel valued, share a strong common purpose, and have invested in the skills to work better together, they are more innovative and collaborative. Turning the workplace into a zero-sum game undermines workers, erodes culture and damages productivity.

As work becomes more transactional, the underlying social contract among colleagues becomes frayed. Many assume that the social contract is an agreement between employer and employee on treating each other with respect and consideration. That's not a social contract, it's a code of conduct. The social contract is the fabric that holds a company together. It's grounded on an understanding among colleagues, from the CEO to the front line, that collective success is powered by individual commitment-to the mission and more importantly to each other. Colleagues in an organization with a healthy social contract ask themselves, ""what do we owe each other?""

What does this look like in real time? A manufacturing executive in a company with a fledgling apprentice program for urban youth cosigning bank accounts so that they can build productive and fiscally sound habits. Another skipping a family dinner to help an apprentice with their algebra homework, because success at work starts with confidence and self-efficacy in life. Or a female software engineer who adds hours to her week mentoring younger women so that they can advance in their careers, finishing her own work late at night. An effective social contract requires a strong sense of agency, where each person has the power and autonomy to represent the organization and its values from a place of authenticity and belonging. Layoffs and work mandates rob employees, at all levels, of that agency. When they stop caring, they give up. And the social contract dies-taking productivity and profits to the grave.

In his missive, Amazon CEO Jassy leans hard on culture, citing it as a critical success driver for the company. He justifies his decision to ""strengthen"" a face-to-face culture, where ""collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another."" What exactly does he mean by culture? Does it jive with what his employees believe the culture might be?

Culture has come to loosely mean ""how I like to work."" For example, the evidence is mounting that hybrid workplaces yield the strongest productivity and creativity. But for older leaders, the nostalgic pull of the watercooler remains steadfast. Many of Jassy's frustrated employees (especially members of the massive water-bottle carrying generation who have no memories of the communal fountain) may describe Amazon's culture as ""toxic,"" a commonly heard refrain when workers are at odds with their employers. Remember quiet quitting? Culture is not a weapon to be thrown around by the person with the largest muscle. Admittedly elusive, culture encompasses the norms and practices that guide the way we work together; it's the how, not the where. It's about productivity and engagement and a healthy social contract. And while it's tough, it's not impossible to take a more evidence-based approach (both qualitative and quantitative) to understand when it's at its best. Until we agree on what a healthy culture looks like, it's just another pawn in the workplace power struggle.

The Amazon decision clearly signals the where-we-work conversation is not over. And although Amazon may have broken from the tech pack, we will now see other companies (tech and beyond) following suit with RTO orders. The only thing we know for sure is that the pendulum keeps swinging. When the economy gets tough, companies win the throne. In boom times, employees wrestle it back. And trust takes a hit every time. Sustainable success requires more than survival of the fittest. It's time to end the battle and make an authentic commitment to working together. The future of work depends on putting away the sword and picking up the social contract."
The Billion-Dollar AI Gamble: Data Centers As The New High-Stakes Game,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2024/09/30/the-billion-dollar-ai-gamble-data-centers-as-the-new-high-stakes-game/,2024-09-30T11:36:42Z,"In today's hyper-connected world, data centers have become the nerve centers of our digital economy. Hyperscale tech giants like Microsoft and global investment powerhouses like BlackRock are pooling their vast resources and pouring billions into data center construction, betting that these facilities will underpin the next wave of technological innovation. With artificial intelligence evolving at a dizzying pace, the stakes have never been higher. A prime example of this is the recent announcement of a groundbreaking 1 GW data center near Houston -- an off-grid, hydrogen-powered hub designed to fuel AI. This colossal project underscores the immense scale of the high-stakes AI gamble.

The U.S. government is paying close attention. The White House has created a Task Force on AI Datacenter Infrastructure to prioritize AI data center development as a matter of national security and economic interest. CEOs of the biggest data center operators and tech firms -- CoreWeave, QTS, Google, AWS, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, and Anthropic -- recently met with utility industry leaders to ensure that the U.S. maintains its competitive edge in AI infrastructure.

But with these massive investments come immense risks. As tech investors begin to scrutinize the timing of returns on these AI ventures, it's critical to understand the specific use cases of data centers before committing billions of dollars to their development. Data centers are not fungible or easily repurposed without massive capital expenditure. The adage ""measure twice, cut once"" has never been more appropriate -- especially when a 100 MW facility could set you back $1.4 billion. This financial reality is why titans like Microsoft and BlackRock are joining forces to tackle these high-stakes projects in partnership, rather than going it alone.

Data centers are built to handle staggering volumes of data and traffic with minimal latency, making them indispensable for a wide range of critical functions. But the design of these data centers must be closely tied to their intended use case. For instance, crypto mining prioritizes cheap power over low latency, which profoundly affects location, design, and redundancy requirements. Meanwhile, AI inference workloads require high computational power and very low latency, demanding a different approach altogether.

The importance of data centers in today's digital economy cannot be overstated -- they are the lifeblood of everything from:

These are just a few examples of how data centers are integrated into every corner of modern life. As digital needs continue to grow, the complexities of building and managing these facilities also expand.

Building a data center is no simple task. A typical facility houses racks of physical servers, cutting-edge networking equipment, and massive storage devices -- all supported by a highly redundant power and cooling infrastructure designed to ensure near-perfect uptime. Today's data centers are increasingly reliant on smart control systems, like Data Center Infrastructure Management software, to optimize performance and energy efficiency.

But data centers are not cookie-cutter solutions. They require significant upfront planning and capital. Each type of data center is designed to meet specific needs, and changing use cases down the line can have disastrous effects on long-term viability and profitability.

When building or investing in a data center, understanding the different types is crucial:

Data centers are also traditionally ranked by tier, based on their expected uptime and reliability:

As AI and machine learning become more central to the global economy, data centers will play an even more critical role in powering our digital world. But with this expansion comes significant risk and complexity. The rapid growth in AI workloads adds pressure on data centers to deliver more computational power with lower latency, but the costs of getting it wrong are enormous. That's why carefully assessing the intended use case of a data center before committing to construction is essential.

The companies that approach data center investments strategically -- by aligning technology with specific business drivers -- will be the ones to succeed in this rapidly shifting landscape. Those who fail to understand the nuances of data center design, construction, and operation could face enormous financial losses and miss out on the AI-driven future."
Musk's Trump Card: Will Tesla Be Boosted Or Totaled?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/30/teslas-trump/,2024-09-30T11:03:58Z,"It's no secret that Donald Trump admires Tesla CEO Elon Musk -- and perhaps more importantly, values the votes Musk might bring from his passionate fan base. Musk, in turn, has reciprocated the sentiment and appears to hold significant influence with the Presidential candidate. That being said, the Biden Administration policies have been pretty good for Tesla. The carmaker has benefited from the sizable incentives for electric vehicles (EVs), including the $7,500 tax credit for U.S.-made EVs and the removal of the eligibility cap of 200,000 vehicles, a provision that previously hurt Tesla. Republicans, on the other hand, generally oppose government subsidies for EVs and renewable energy, favoring a free-market approach. Trump has taken an aggressive stance as well, suggesting that he would end the federal electric vehicle mandate on day one if elected. However, despite the potential continuity of regulatory sops under Democrats, the Tesla CEO is wagering that the company might fare better under Trump. Surprising? Not really.

Can Tesla Thrive Without Subsidies?

We believe that in a subsidy-free, market-based system, Tesla is well-positioned to not just survive, but thrive, on account of its position as one of the lowest-cost producers among EV manufacturers. The company has consistently demonstrated discipline in managing its fixed costs, including R&D and SG&A, which has enabled it to maintain profitability even in tough market conditions. Tesla has vertically integrated its operations - it controls a bulk of its supply chain, ranging from battery production to software development, and has considerably automated its manufacturing process. Tesla's so-called Gigafactories also play a big role in its cost structure by boosting economies of scale for battery production. Tesla also rarely spends on splashy advertising. All these factors have contributed to low costs and thicker margins. In the most recent quarter, Tesla posted a 7% adjusted profit margin, despite industry-wide headwinds and declining volumes. The company posted an impressive 17% margin for the fiscal year 2022 when the EV market was much more favorable.

As government subsidies are reduced or more likely eliminated under Trump, Tesla's lower cost base becomes a critical advantage. In a market where EV manufacturers can no longer rely on subsidies to offset inefficiencies, Tesla's superior operational efficiency will potentially allow it to outlast its less efficient competitors. For example, Rivian - one of Tesla's key competitors, despite having a very compelling vehicle lineup - has been hemorrhaging around $1.4 billion per quarter over the past two quarters. Without the support of government incentives, companies like Rivian could face a much more uncertain future. And it's not just Rivian. Other automakers, including U.S. giants like GM and Ford, could also struggle in a subsidy-free landscape. Neither has yet achieved the scale or cost efficiency required to make their EV operations profitable. GM, for instance, sold just 22,000 EVs in Q2 2024, out of a total of about 696,000 vehicles. This limited volume makes it difficult to achieve the same economies of scale as Tesla. Foreign automakers from Korea and Japan, who planned to invest billions in the U.S. to capitalize on the $7,500 EV credit, may also rethink their expansion in the U.S. market.

The performance of TSLA stock with respect to the index over the last 3-year period has been quite volatile. Returns for the stock were 50% in 2021, -65% in 2022, and 102% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Despite the wild stock fluctuations, Tesla is set to thrive, even in less favorable regulatory environments.

Trade Barriers Can Give Tesla A Leg Up On Chinese EVs

Moreover, Trump's trade policies could strengthen Tesla's position relative to its Chinese rivals. While the U.S. has already imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, Trump has suggested the possibility of a 200% duty on Chinese EVs built in Mexico and imported into the U.S. This would create significant headwinds for Chinese automakers trying to penetrate the U.S. market. Though Trump has invited Chinese automakers to build factories in the U.S., it's unlikely that they will make such a move, given their significant capacity investments in China and the unpredictable regulatory environment. Most Chinese EV players - except BYD and Li Auto -- remain loss-making and it isn't clear if their manufacturing operations would be viable anywhere else in the world with a lack of government support and higher labor costs. Even BYD, which is now the world's largest EV maker, posted net margins of under 5% in the most recent quarter, despite robust demand and support in China. This is below Tesla's margins. As tariffs and trade barriers increase, Tesla's focus on domestic production and its cost efficiency could give it a meaningful edge over both its domestic and foreign rivals.

Tesla's Energy Business Should Hold Up

Trump has been a proponent of boosting fossil fuel production and cutting down on subsidies for renewables. However, Tesla's battery business is well-positioned to thrive regardless. The renewable energy market is expected to grow due to increasing cost competitiveness and global environmental concerns, making government policy less of a determining factor. Per the IEA, global renewables capacity could increase to 2.5x its current level by 2030 and renewables are expected to become the largest source of global electricity generation by 2025, meaning that the need for energy storage will only intensify. Storage solutions address the intermittency of renewable power by storing excess energy and discharging it when demand is higher. Tesla's energy division has been expanding rapidly, driven by its battery technologies. In the last quarter, the company deployed a record 9.4 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of storage solutions, fueled by demand for its Megapack and Powerwall products. Tesla has a competitive edge in energy density, cost, and software integration for its batteries, and its significant investment in manufacturing capacity strengthens its position. Even without government support, Tesla's energy business should be able to capitalize on the growing renewable energy market. A closer look at Tesla's fast-growing Clean Energy business.

"Click, Edit, Thrive: Photoroom's Ascent As The Go-To Professional-Grade Photo Editor For Consumers And SMEs",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/josipamajic/2024/09/30/click-edit-thrive-photorooms-ascent-as-the-go-to-professional-grade-photo-editor-for-consumers-and-smes/,2024-09-30T11:03:04Z,"When was the last time you posted a completely unedited photo on social media? If you're a business owner, a Gen Z or Millennial, or looking for love on a dating site, chances are the answer is close to never. This is exactly why Photoroom, a YC backed, fast-growing app, is conquering both B2C and B2B markets globally.

In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and e-commerce, Photoroom stands out for its innovative approach to photo editing and its commitment to small businesses. This AI-powered photo editing app has recently hit a significant milestone: $200 million in revenue. This achievement not only highlights the company's rapid growth but also underscores the increasing demand for AI-driven tools in the digital marketplace.

Photoroom's journey to success is rooted in its unique approach to AI-generated imagery. Unlike many competitors in the space, Photoroom has focused on enhancing existing photos rather than creating entirely new ones. This strategy has proven particularly effective for small businesses and e-commerce ventures, where authenticity and trust are paramount.

""We started with background removal,"" explains the company's founder and CEO Matt Rouif during our recent interview. ""We take the interesting subject of a photo, remove the background, and replace it with a different scene."" This seemingly simple concept has far-reaching implications for businesses looking to improve their online presence without breaking the bank on professional photography services.

Photoroom's innovation lies in its ability to provide what Rouif describes as ""a studio in your pocket."" This concept resonates strongly with small business owners and entrepreneurs who often lack the resources for expensive photo shoots. By allowing users to enhance their product photos without altering the core subject, Photoroom has positioned itself as a tool for building trust in the digital marketplace.

""What you're trying to do is build trust with the other person who is looking at the photo,"" the founder and CEO explains. ""You don't want to lie on what's behind and what are the bits behind the pixels."" This philosophy sets Photoroom apart in an industry where fully AI-generated images are becoming increasingly common.By preserving the integrity of the original product image while enhancing its presentation, Photoroom helps businesses create appealing visuals without misrepresenting their offerings. This is particularly crucial for industries where the physical product is a key selling point, such as fashion, food, and home goods.

""If you're e-commerce, you don't want people to be disappointed by what you sell, because it creates more trouble than advantages,"" Rouif notes. This focus on honesty in visual representation could be a significant factor in reducing return rates and improving customer satisfaction for online retailers.

Photoroom's success is closely tied to the rise of entrepreneurship, particularly among younger generations. Rouif cites compelling statistics: ""50% of UK citizens want to start a business at some point. That's their dream. 40% of Gen Z in the US have a side hustle."" By providing accessible tools for these aspiring entrepreneurs, Photoroom is tapping into a vast and growing market.

The app's user base primarily consists of solo entrepreneurs and small businesses with one to five employees. These users leverage Photoroom to pursue their passions and turn them into viable businesses. ""You can start a business from your phone now with an app, a small business with an app, a banking app, and probably a broadcast like WhatsApp or Instagram,"" the founder explains. ""You need three apps, and you're good to go.""

While specific financial details are limited, Photoroom's recent achievement of $200 million in revenue is a clear indicator of its strong market position. The company's founder reports that Photoroom is ""growing fast and being break-even,"" an enviable position in the current tech landscape where many startups prioritize growth over profitability.

This financial health puts Photoroom in a unique position. Unlike many AI startups that are aggressively seeking funding, Photoroom's founder states, ""We still have plenty of money. We're break-even."" This self-sufficiency allows the company to focus on product development and user needs rather than courting investors.

Looking ahead, Photoroom is poised to expand its offerings and deepen its impact on various verticals. The founder anticipates unlocking more use cases as the technology evolves, potentially venturing into video and sound in the coming months. ""People have a merging of multimodal sound, video, text, to create some impressive, very impressive stuff. And we'll be part of that,"" Rouif predicts.

The company's future strategy revolves around helping businesses tell unique stories through their visual content. ""What's very valuable is what you created for yourself, you won't have it from another business,"" Rouif explains. This focus on uniqueness could be a key differentiator in an increasingly crowded digital marketplace.

For investors eyeing the AI space, Photoroom presents an intriguing opportunity. The company's break-even status, coupled with its rapid growth, suggests a solid foundation for future expansion. Moreover, its focus on practical applications of AI for small businesses sets it apart from more speculative AI ventures.

However, Rouif 's current stance on funding is cautious. ""We're really focused on being useful to our users and making the tech move forward,"" he states, indicating that the company is not actively seeking additional investment at this time. This approach may change as the company eyes expansion into new modalities and markets.

Photoroom's success is set against the backdrop of a rapidly evolving AI industry. Rouif notes that only a handful of companies have successfully shipped fundamental updates to their AI models, placing Photoroom in an elite group alongside tech giants.

This ability to iterate and improve AI models while maintaining user trust could be a significant competitive advantage. As Rouif observes, ""People get very attached to AI models more than software, usually."" This emotional connection to AI tools presents both opportunities and challenges for companies in the space.

Photoroom's journey from a simple background removal tool to a comprehensive AI-powered photo editing platform exemplifies the potential of focused AI applications in the business world. By prioritizing user needs and maintaining a strong ethical stance on image manipulation, the company has carved out a unique niche in the crowded AI marketplace.

For investors, Photoroom represents a blend of technological innovation and practical business application. Its financial health, growing user base, and potential for expansion into new modalities make it a company worth watching in the coming years.

As AI continues to reshape industries, companies like Photoroom that can balance innovation with user trust and practical application are likely to emerge as leaders. Whether Photoroom will maintain its independent growth trajectory or eventually seek additional funding to fuel expansion remains to be seen. What is clear, however, is that the company's approach to AI-powered visual content is resonating strongly with its target market of small businesses and entrepreneurs.

In a world where visual content is increasingly crucial for online success, Photoroom's mission to provide ""a studio in your pocket"" could well be the key to unlocking the potential of countless small businesses around the globe. As the digital economy continues to evolve, tools that empower entrepreneurs to compete effectively in the visual realm will likely play an increasingly important role. Photoroom, with its blend of AI innovation and practical application, seems well-positioned to be at the forefront of this transformation."
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: September 30, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-09-30-24/,2024-09-30T10:59:40Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are going down. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Shopping for an account where you can put some money aside? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are infamous for paying puny interest rates. But this isn't always the case. Many online banks and credit unions likely pay rates 10x higher than your neighborhood bank.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you spot a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield also was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.23%, Curinos says. Last week, it was 0.24%. APY, or annual percentage yield, shows the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts often pay much higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the trade-off is you may have to meet strict conditions laid down by the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.97%. You'll be in good shape if you can find an account offering a rate close to 4.97%. Last week at this time, the best rate was a similar 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's below last week's 0.26%.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

That's tough to say -- it depends on the path of inflation and the overall economy.

The highest interest rates in recent history were seen in the early 1980s when the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to over 19%. That was in response to record-breaking inflation that had prices rising at a rate of over 14% annually.

In the early 1980s, the average five-year CD paid almost 12%, compared to less than 2% today, according to Bankrate data. Savings rates eventually fell as inflation cooled and the federal funds rate was brought back down.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
Uber Safari Launches In South Africa With $200 Big Five Game Drives,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissakravitz/2024/09/30/uber-safari-launches-in-south-africa-with-200-big-five-game-drives/,2024-09-30T10:52:30Z,"Starting this October, Uber Safari will transport riders from Cape Town to the South African wilderness for a big five safari just a few hours' drive from the city.

""Safari is such an iconic travel experience throughout Africa,"" said Imran Manji, Head of Uber East and South Africa. ""We're thrilled to offer tourists and locals alike the opportunity to book an affordable, luxurious and seamless wildlife adventure within our app.""

The Uber Safari experience is the latest iteration in Uber's 'Go Anywhere' series, following Uber Bubbles chauffeuring riders between Paris and Champagne this past summer, as well as Uber Boat in Mykonos, Uber Balloon in Cappadocia, and more excursions that transcend the typical rideshare experience.

Typically offered in a destination's high season, these limited-time travel offerings are designed to help travelers easily book bucket list adventures. Uber users can take advantage of the app's Reserve feature, and efficiently secure an enviable itinerary with minimal planning required.

""We're always striving to push the boundaries of what is possible in transportation, from luxury travel to climate-conscious mobility solutions,"" Manji added. ""Each innovation, including Uber Safari, is designed with the future in mind, making travel more exciting, accessible and sustainable.""

Designed as a luxury day trip from Cape Town, Uber Safari partners with Aquila Private Game Reserve, about a two hour drive outside of the city, to offer an intimate and unique safari experience on 25,000 acres of protected land.

Up to four passengers can share a booking for the round trip ride and game drive via the Uber App. During the game drive at Aquila, safari-goers will see South Africa's big five: lions, elephants, buffalos, cheetahs, and rhinos, plus more local wildlife including giraffes, hippos, flamingos, zebras, springboks, birds, and more.

""In partnership with Aquila Private Game Reserve, one of South Africa's most popular wildlife conservancies, customers can be proud that every booking contributes to conservation efforts that help protect endangered species and ensure the preservation of South Africa's rich biodiversity,"" said Manji.

Uber Safari is a day trip that starts with a pickup from any hotel or accommodation in Cape Town around 9 a.m. Travelers can relax in a BMW during a scenic and well-paved highway ride to Aquila, where everyone is greeted with a welcome toast of South African wine and a hearty lunch (vegan options available).

Following the meal, groups will board safari vehicles for a three hour game drive, during which field guides and game rangers will help spot animals. The covered safari vehicles are designed for all weather, including rain. After the safari, guests will have time to enjoy Aquila's stunning grounds and swimming pool before an Uber ride back to their hotel.

""We're excited to partner with Uber to extend our bucket list wildlife experiences to their customers,"" said Johan van Schalkwyk, Commercial Officer of Aquila Collection. ""Uber Safari allows folks to book and enjoy an unforgettable day at Aquila, where they'll get to experience the Big 5 in an easy and luxurious way. It's the perfect combination of modern convenience and natural beauty, all while supporting wildlife conservation efforts that are vital to preserving South Africa's biodiversity.""

Uber Safari's safari day trip comes at a stunningly accessible price point. The $200 booking includes both transfers, the game drive, and lunch, for up to four passengers, meaning you can go on safari for $50 per person. Tips, of course, are always welcome, so hit the ATM before boarding your Uber.

And yes, high demand is expected for Uber Safari trips, which take place during Cape Town's high season, which is peak summer, November through January. Booking in advance is encouraged.

Already, Uber has a strong presence in the region and will be offering 20% off rides to wine country during the summer season.

""At Uber, our number one priority is to positively impact the communities and economies we serve,"" said Maji. ""In South Africa, we're proud to serve more than 80% of the urban population in nearly 30 cities across the country. In so doing, we contribute to the economy in a meaningful way. In 2023 alone, Uber contributed an estimated R17B ($970M USD) to the South African economy, R1B ($58.4M USD) of which went to the tourism industry.""

Uber Safari reservations will become available in the Uber app on Wednesday, October 2. The experience will be bookable 24 hours to 90 days in advance. The Uber Safari icon on the will be visible on the Uber home screen to all riders in South Africa. Excursions run on Fridays and Saturdays until January 25, 2025.

Uber users can change their in-app location to South Africa to book. Cancellation is free if you cancel more than 24 hours before your trip.

From the United States, United Airlines flies nonstop between New York (EWR) to Cape Town (CPT) and Washington D.C. (IAD) to Cape Town. Delta Air Lines also offers a nonstop route between Atlanta (ATL) and Cape Town. All three routes are about 15 hours."
Opinion | Why Tim Walz is so well-positioned to trounce JD Vance,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-tim-walz-vp-debate-populism-rcna172575,2024-09-30T10:32:34Z,"In the vice presidential debate between two midwestern populists, my money's on Walz over Vance.

Vice presidential debates are typically a lot less interesting than presidential ones. Despite the pundit buzz surrounding the veepstakes, VP candidates rarely sway voters, and it follows from that historical pattern that vice presidential debates are unlikely to be consequential. They're low-stakes affairs that feature candidates tasked with playing a supporting role: The candidates are meant to act as defenders or attack dogs on behalf of their running mates, and they don't usually announce policies or break new ground politically. The bar for a solid performance is avoiding any gaffes.

But Tuesday's vice presidential debate is going to be different. The presidential race has unfolded unconventionally, with Vice President Kamala Harris' surprise last-second nomination. She is still filling in a number of gaps in the public's perceptions of her agenda, and for this reason, her VP pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, could play an outsize role in shaping how undecided voters perceive the Democratic presidential ticket. The quality of Walz's performance could conceivably determine some voters' decisions on whether they trust the Democrats on the top-tier issue of economic policy -- or even just on the level of ""vibes.""

But the exceptional importance of this debate goes beyond the time crunch that Harris and Walz face in introducing themselves to voters before Election Day. Both Walz and his opponent, Republican Sen. JD Vance, occupy unusually influential roles on their tickets. In particular, both are at the leading edge of their respective parties' ongoing experiments in populism, and they have taken a muscular role in shaping the communications strategies of their campaigns. Walz has played a formative role in the Harris campaign's efforts to frame the Democrats as joyful normies and to depict Republicans as ""weird"" extremists. Vance, meanwhile, has been doing a striking amount of heavy lifting on the ground for Trump, establishing new Trumpian theories in defense of lying and charting new territory in denigrating migrants and women by putting nativism and social traditionalism front and center in the race.

In the clash of the populisms, Walz has the advantage. He is well positioned to poke holes in the ruse of right-wing populism and to make Vance look like a phony. Walz should lean into those differences as hard as he can if he wants to have a chance at leaving a lasting mark.

At a stylistic level, populism comes to Walz naturally. He grew up in rural Nebraska, he served in the Army National Guard, he only attended state schools, and he was a teacher and a football coach before getting into politics. He is the first person on a Democratic presidential ticket in about half a century not to have attended law school. He organically exudes the ""everyman"" affect that many politicians strive desperately for but rarely achieve. His comfort with his identity as a regular dude is what helped him stick the ""weird"" put-down that transformed the Democratic Party's comms strategy overnight and has continued to vex MAGA ever since. And his natural ease with people underpins the Harris campaign's emphasis on documenting the quotidian details of life on the campaign trail.

On the other side, Vance also comes from a working-class background and served in the military. But his life eventually went down a more conventionally elite path: He attended Yale law school, went into venture capital, and then parlayed punditry and relationships with Silicon Valley billionaires into a vice presidential candidacy. Vance's journey also involved a swift and opportunistic political transformation, during which he went in just a handful of years from denouncing Trump as ""cultural heroin"" to stumping as a MAGA zealot. Vance is intelligent, but during unscripted public appearances he does not appear as comfortable in his own skin as Walz does, perhaps in part because he has chosen to reinvent his political worldview to secure access to power. He also simply seems to lack the people skills that are deployed so deftly by his counterpart. (This may also explain in part why Walz's favorability among registered voters is much higher than Vance's.)

To take down Vance at the debate, Walz has plenty to work with. Walz can argue that his own record -- a life of public service -- demonstrates a more reliable commitment to the people than palling around with tech tycoons and a scam-addicted billionaire politician. Walz can nail Vance for his massive flip-flops on his positions on Trump. Walz can continue to point out how right-wing populism uses culture wars to obscure their encroachment on Americans' civil liberties and the restructuring of the economy to benefit the rich. Walz can wield his record supporting unions and helping pass sweeping social policies in Minnesota, such as the biggest child tax credit in the nation, to demonstrate his commitment to the people, which contrasts with Vance's mostly shallow posturing in support of organized labor and devotion to protecting corporate interests.

I can't predict who will be better received by voters at Tuesday's debate or who will land the zingers that echo across the internet the next day. But Walz's career and political sensibilities have primed him to be a strong foil against the false populism of the right. He has all the tools in his hand -- he just needs to use them."
Donald Trump's 'Crucial' China Nightmare Is Suddenly Coming True,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/30/crucial-development-donald-trumps-china-nightmare-is-suddenly-coming-true/,2024-09-30T10:22:35Z,"Donald Trump, the former U.S. president who's hoping to retake the White House this year, has thrust bitcoin and crypto back into the limelight with his embrace of the technology this year.

Trump's support of crypto has helped the bitcoin price surge in recent months, pushed on by a growing crypto revolution on Wall Street.

Now, as Elon Musk meets with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, China's former minister of finance, Zhu Guangyao, has warned Trump's embrace of bitcoin and crypto means it can no longer be ignored.

Crypto ""has negative impacts, and we must fully recognize its risks and the harm it poses to capital markets,"" Sina News quoted Zhu Guangyao as saying during a forum hosted by Tsinghua University. ""However, we must also study the latest international changes and policy adjustments, as it is a crucial aspect of digital economy development.""

Zhu Guangyao reportedly referred directly to Trump's Bitcoin 2024 conference pledge in June to adopt a bitcoin strategic reserve if he retakes the White House in November alongside a warning that if the U.S. doesn't take the lead on bitcoin and crypto development, then ""China will do it.""

Crypto is ""the steel industry of 100 years ago,"" Trump said at the time. ""You're just in your infancy. One day, it probably will overtake gold. There's never been anything like it.""

Trump's full-throated adoption of bitcoin and crypto via his family's mysterious World Liberty Financial crypto project and his non-fungible token (NFT) collections as well as his promises to relax regulations the crypto industry has claimed are stifling development have also pushed his White House rival, vice president Kamala Harris, toward a more crypto-friendly stance.

Speaking at a fundraiser Harris earlier this month, Harris said her administration would ""partner together to invest in America's competitiveness,"" pointing to artificial intelligence and crypto as key areas of focus.

Following Trump's bitcoin and crypto endorsements this year, tron founder Justin Sun urged China to reconsider its stance on crypto, posting to X that China ""needs to step up... U.S. policies have warmed. China should make further progress.""

China's 2021 bitcoin ban that made the trading and mining of cryptocurrencies illegal triggered a sudden bitcoin price crash at the time, however, some reports have suggested those rules are being flouted.

In June, crypto investor Brock Pierce predicted it's only a matter of time before China reopens its digital doors to crypto.

""Is China going to open up [to crypto]? ... I'd say it's inevitable,"" Pierce, a former child actor who cofounded the USDT dollar-pegged stablecoin issuer Tether in Hong Kong a decade ago, told the South China Morning Post. ""The question is not so much if, it's a matter of when.""

In May, attendees of a Hong Kong bitcoin conference sparked speculation the much-hyped Hong Kong spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could eventually be opened up to mainland China investors."
Generative AI Adoption: Do Startups Have The Edge?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevorclawson/2024/09/30/generative-ai-adoption-do-startups-have-the-edge/,2024-09-30T10:01:54Z,"Britain's startups and relatively small, innovativebusinesses may have the edge over larger companies in taking advantage of the Generative AI revolution, according to a report published last week by industry trade body, TechUK and financial services firm Experian.

The study predicts that Generative AI could add as much as £120 billion annually to the value of the U.K. economy but only if companies manage to successfully address a range of challenges that include a shortage of skilled people, employee resistance and poor quality or incomplete data. In passing, the survey notes that young, technology-driven businesses have an opportunity to deploy more quickly than their longer-established counterparts.

SteetBees is a case in point. Founded in 2015, the company collects and analyzes customer behavior data on behalf of its clients. CEO Vidisha Gaglani says the company carries out what she describes as ""conversational research."" Customers are asked open questions about their experience with brands and can add videos and pictures to their responses. The aim is to gain deep insights into consumer behavior.

Streetbees launched the platform long before the current wave of Generative AI Technology but Gaglani says it has been a rapid adopter. ""In the last year the platform has evolved and we are using large language models (LLMs),"" she says. ""We are using LLMs to almost automate the end-to-end research work.""

In practice, survey generation is automated, as is the AI writing the reports and the conduct of conversations, albeit under the guidance of humans. ""And we are also able to generate executive summaries,"" says Gaglani.

Gaglani says a combination of AI automation and human involvement has enabled Steetbees to work more quickly on surveys but retain the depth and quality of the data. It's an example of how Generative AI is already changing the way businesses work.

What about the bigger picture? Businesses in the marketing industry have been among the first to adopt Generative AI - often to create personalized marketing messaging on a scale that wouldn't otherwise have been possible. But is the Experian/UKTech report right to say that innovative small businesses are better placed to exploit the technology than large corporations.

Nick Hall is General Manager of Experian's GenAI Centre of Expertise. He says businesses of all sizes are aware of the need to move fast, initially by experimenting with ways to incorporate AI technology into the their operations. ""Within that context, one always says startups are better at moving fast than large corporations with hundreds of thousands of people.""

Equally important, Large Language Models are there to be used. ""This is a field that has been pretty much democratized,"" he says. A small two or three-person startup has access to the same LLMs as, say IBM or Experian,"" he adds. ""They can buy the same enterprise product and have access to the same level of intelligence.""

However, as he sees it, there are areas where startups might be challenged - skills being a case in point. ""Tech startups may have the skills they need. But that's not necessarily the case if you are a startup working in, say, retail,"" he says.

And good data is also crucial. ""All of this technology needs to be fed by high quality data. Even if you are a small business and you just want to do things like use Generative AI to create product copy or design a marketing campaign, it will do that far better if you have equipped it with high quality information on your sales, and customers,"" says Hall.

There are some distinctions to be made. Some startups will be creating AI-driven tools to sell. Others will be buyers of those tools. ""At the moment, a lot of the money is being made by companies creating AI tools,"" says Hall.

Hence the buoyant stock prices of big tech companies and the almost feverish investor interest in startup companies at the cutting edge of data science in general and AI in particular.

Tom Henriksson is a General Partner at early-stage VC OpenOcean. As he sees it, there is still a huge amount of caution in the VC community, except perhaps when it comes to AI.

""There is a lot of capital in VC funds at the moment. A lot of large funds have raised but they haven't deployed very aggressively. There is lots of money to deploy but there is still carefulness. However, AI is super hot at the moment. It is seen as the next big platform after the cloud.""

So much so that even a Seed round can look pretty Stellars. Henriksson cites the example of H, a French LLM developer that recently raised $220 million. ""At the moment, it is still the AI infrastructure layer that is being built. We have the OpenAI and Generative AI platforms that require massive investment,"" he says.

But other categories are opening up. OpenOcean is particularly interested in startups that are helping large corporate businesses adopt AI. ""That could be software tools, specific technologies or approaches. For instance, helping enterprises adopt AI that you can trust and that won't be biased. Helping engineers implement AI in their data sets,"" he says.

Then there are vertical solutions. AI tools designed for specific industries, such as banking. Henriksson says this tier of AI startups will require founders who not only understand data science but also the specifics of the sector. ""True vertical solutions require a deep understanding of their market. So you might get people who have worked in banking teaming up with data scientists."" Henriksson says this is corner of the market this is less well developed.

We are probably only in the foothills of the generative AI revolution. And for the moment, at least, startups developing AI solutions and those putting the technology at the heart of their business models are well placed to attract the attention of investors. Meanwhile, small and tech-driven companies can take advantage of toolks that are already widely available and accessible. Those who are agile enough may gain an edge over larger rivals."
Fed Rate Cut: Will Prices Ever Go Back To 'Normal'?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/fed-rate-cut-impact-prices/,2024-09-30T09:45:00Z,"Inflation may have (nearly) returned to normal. But prices don't feel normal.

The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September as inflation has moved closer to its 2% target. This was the first rate cut since the onset of the pandemic and might be a turning point in the Fed's years-long battle to get prices under control.

Despite the Fed's move, though, average Americans are feeling downright crabby about the economy, according to recent surveys, even as wages have climbed. With the prices of many goods and services still much higher than before the pandemic, it'll likely take much longer for prices to not seem so out of hand.

""Eventually we will adapt,"" says Moody's Analytics economist Matt Colyar. ""But it's going to take time.""

The Fed's preferred gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (core PCE) price index that strips out food and energy costs, was up 2.7% in August over the past 12 months and has declined sharply from levels in 2022. The central bank expects inflation to hit 2.2% next year before dropping to its 2% target in 2026.

So inflation is under control, right?

Well, the pace of price growth may have slowed, but it amassed a lot of damage in its wake. Another inflation metric, the more widely covered consumer price index (CPI), shows that prices gained 22% between January 2020 and August 2024.

Wages, though, have risen as well.

While prices gained 22%, weekly earnings went up by almost 24%, according to monthly data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, median annual household income hit $80,600 in 2023, per the Census, up about $3,000 from 2022.

""People are getting paid more, and paying more,"" says Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, a financial services company that supports financial advisors.

Still, that doesn't mean all families aren't feeling the financial burn.

Earnings, after adjusting for inflation, dropped in 2020, 2021 and 2022. In fact, the typical family made $81,210 in 2019 (using today's dollars), or about $600 more than in 2023.

Even if families saw their paycheck rise above inflation in 2024, it's not surprising that many are more pessimistic about their finances than economists might expect.

The Gallup Economic Confidence Index has shown a negative number since July 2021, while the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence survey dropped to a nearly two-year low this August.

While concerns about inflation would likely improve if it continued to hew more closely to 2%, American spirits could be dampened if the labor market continues to slow down.

That was the rationale behind the drop in consumer confidence in August, per the Conference Board, and the Fed deciding to cut rates during its September meeting.

Even though price growth is decelerating, inflation is still above the Fed's target. It'll likely take many months, if not years, of stable prices for consumers to feel secure.

Below is a more detailed look at three major areas of your budget to see just how long that may take.

Gas and grocery prices tend to be volatile; that's why economists look at inflation metrics that exclude them. Since 2020, though, they've vexed consumers.

A gallon of gas cost $2.57 heading into 2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, compared to $3.19 now on September 23. That's a 24% increase, which largely tracks wage growth.

Gas fell to $1.77 in April 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic shutdowns, and hit $5.00 in June 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine before falling to its current level.

But it's difficult to say what is and isn't normal when it comes to gas prices.

Between the end of 2014 and 2020, a gallon of gas never rose above $3. However, it cost more than $3 for almost all of the time between 2011 and 2014.

Therefore the price of gas, in its twists and turns, has been entirely normal, albeit higher than many would like to spend.

The August CPI report showed that grocery prices gained 2.1% over the past 12 months, signaling that food prices were becoming more normal.

But zooming out from that report shows just how much more expensive your grocery shopping has been over the past four years compared to recent history.

The cost of nearly every major food item, save tomatoes, rose faster between August 2020 and August 2024 than between August 2016 and August 2020.

Eggs are a particularly glaring example: A dozen eggs cost $1.46 in 2016, $1.33 in 2020 and now $3.20.

Your grocery bill will need many more months of low inflation to feel more normal, but you shouldn't expect prices to ever go back to 2020 levels.

While groceries and gas are constant reminders of price changes, neither bears as much weight on your finances as home ownership: Nearly two-thirds of Americans own a home, according to the Fed's 2024 Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households.

Purchasing a home was largely affordable in the years between 2009 and 2020, according to a Forbes Advisor analysis of the Atlanta Fed's Home Ownership Affordability Monitor, thanks in large part to low mortgage rates following the Great Recession.

The tide turned in 2022, though, as mortgage rates soared following the Fed raising interest rates to tamp down inflation.

Prices also climbed thanks to a lack of available homes for sale, says National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun.

""We have had a lack of housing supply, which is why prices increase so much faster than income growth,"" Yun says.

Many existing homeowners are unwilling to give up their low mortgage rates and are staying put. Meanwhile, builders have been cautious with construction for new homes when so many potential buyers are priced out.

The good news is that borrowing costs have fallen from recent highs -- the average 30-year fixed rate was 6.09 in mid-September compared to 7.8% in the fall of 2023. And they may have a bit further to drop in the near future.

""Rates will probably be around 6% by the end of this year,"" Yun says. ""Next year they might be slightly under 6%, maybe 5.50%.""

Just don't expect the abnormally low mortgage rates that spurred so much demand in the early part of the pandemic to come back anytime soon."

Vice presidential candidates Ohio Sen. JD Vance (R) and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) will face off in a debate Tuesday for the 2024 election cycle.

This will be the only time the candidates meet on stage and simultaneously present their policy positions to the broader American public, which may be less familiar with them than with their partners on the presidential ticket.

The two hold similar roles in their respective campaigns: to appeal to working-class voters in the ""Blue Wall"" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this fall.

Here's what you need to know about what is historically the only debate between the candidates for vice president.

When and how to watch?

This debate will be hosted by CBS News in New York City at 9 p.m. ET.

CBS Evening News anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell and Face the Nation moderator and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan will moderate the debate at the CBS Broadcast Center. The debate will air live on CBS, CBS News Streaming Network and Paramount+ and stream live without a cable login on CBSNews.com.

Follow NPR's live blog on Tuesday for the latest updates, analysis, fact-checking and color -- and also watch the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate Simulcast. And you can listen to NPR's special debate coverage on many public radio stations and in the NPR app.

Who are the running mates?

Former President Donald Trump announced Vance as his running mate on the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this summer.

The first-term senator, who was once a critic of Trump, came to political relevance when he wrote the book Hillbilly Elegy, blaming Biden and Democrats for the struggles of the rural economy he grew up in. In the Senate, Vance has positioned himself against Republican leadership at times but on issues like abortion, immigration and election integrity, he's closely aligned with Trump.

Vice President Harris chose Walz just weeks after she was tapped to replace President Biden at the top of the ticket.

Walz got the nickname ""Coach Walz"" for being a former football coach and teacher. As governor, Walz secured several progressive wins in his state, including clean energy mandates, universal free school meals, family and medical leave benefits and abortion protections.

What to watch for

Since his nomination, Vance has had to address controversies that are likely to come up again during the debate, including couch-related jokes and criticisms of him calling prominent Democrats ""childless cat ladies."" Vance has also come under fire for spreading the false claim that Haitian immigrants are eating pets in Ohio.

Walz, a two-term governor, has also faced questions about his response to riots in Minneapolis following the 2020 murder of George Floyd and widespread fraud during COVID-19 under a federal program intended to provide food assistance to students after schools closed. Audits have suggested lapses in oversight by the state Department of Education.

Walz has been getting help for the debate from Pete Buttigieg, the U.S. Transportation Secretary. Buttigieg helped Harris with her VP debate prep in 2020. It wasn't immediately clear whom Vance is preparing with.

The military records of both candidates are also likely to come up.

Vance criticized Walz for his military record, including for saying he carried weapons ""in war"" when he had not been in combat.

Walz, who served in the National Guard for 20 years and reenlisted after Sept. 11, only saw wartime deployment to Italy in 2003. Vance, who served in the Marines and did a six-month deployment to Iraq, also has not seen combat.

What are the rules for the debate?

The debate will last 90 minutes and both campaigns have agreed to a set of rules.

There will be no audience in attendance, and the candidates will each take a stand behind podiums. Candidates will have two minutes for closing statements. Vance won a virtual coin toss on Sept. 26 and elected to go second with his closing statement.

Vance and Walz will not be allowed to have prewritten notes or props, and topics and questions will not be shared in advance with campaigns. Unlike the presidential debates, microphones will remain on but CBS News reserves the right to turn them off.

According to CBS News, each candidate will get two minutes to answer each question, and the other candidate will get two minutes to respond. Then, each candidate gets one minute for further rebuttals. At the discretion of the moderators, candidates may get an additional minute each to continue a discussion.

What comes next?

This is likely to be the last debate before Election Day. Across several states, mail ballots have already started going out.

Harris challenged Trump to one more debate on Oct. 23 but Trump declined, saying it was ""too late."""
MIKE POMPEO: Kamala Harris would crush families with big-government price controls,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mike-pompeo-kamala-harris-would-crush-families-big-government-price-controls,2024-09-30T09:12:34Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

When a politician promises to use government power to force ""lower prices"" and ""transparency,"" you should expect the opposite outcome. Under the Biden-Harris administration, families have faced skyrocketing costs on everything from groceries to prescription drugs, yet Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed on the campaign trail that the best way to fix this is to insert even more federal control into every corner of our economy. Here's why these policies would be so devastating and lead to even higher costs for Americans.

While Harris has largely avoided the press and declined to publish policy plans on her website, she recently gave a speech outlining her economic priorities in three key areas: food, healthcare, and housing. An examination of her proposals shows that they would all be disasters.

Harris began her remarks by acknowledging that under her tenure as vice president, ""a loaf of bread costs 50% more"" and ""ground beef is up almost 50%."" She's right -- and anyone who has been to the grocery store has seen similar price increases for eggs, cereal and many other staple foods.

HARRIS DROPS MILLIONS ON PRIVATE JET SPENDING DESPITE CALLING CLIMATE CHANGE AN 'EXISTENTIAL THREAT'

But instead of taking responsibility for the out-of-control government spending and failed policies that actually caused these increases, Harris instead proposed passing the ""first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food."" Under this ""ban,"" bureaucrats in Washington would get to decide what constitutes gouging -- or, in other words, what they think the price should be.

Banning ""price gouging"" is not a new or novel idea -- it's just that when the Soviet Union was still around, we called it by its proper name: price controls. Federal bureaucrats at the Federal Trade Commission would decide a ""fair"" price for bread in Pittsburgh or milk in Topeka.

Price controls don't work for very simple and sound reasons. Grocery stores operate on very thin profit margins, often just a few percentage points. So, when a federal bureaucrat tells them they must sell bacon for less than what it costs them to purchase it, they simply won't sell bacon.

Smaller stores that rely on sales of such products to survive would go under. Customers would be left with fewer options to buy bacon at all. And as stores stop selling bacon, there would be less of a market for farmers and ranchers to produce it, reducing supply and pushing prices even higher -- as competition and incentives collapse. This isn't just theory. We literally saw it happen to the Soviet Union.

The price hikes we're seeing under the Biden-Harris administration are driven by inflation across the market, not by suddenly greedy grocery store owners. The solution is to return to responsible, limited government and a pro-growth economic platform -- not impose ruinous price controls that would set a course toward total implosion of our economy.

Harris's healthcare proposals have received less attention but are just as damaging. She criticized pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) -- the companies that negotiate lower drug costs on behalf of employers and other purchasers of healthcare coverage.

I ran small businesses in Kansas and, having seen the high cost of prescription drugs for employees, I know the importance of these negotiations, and the savings they produce. Harris's attacks on PBMs follows years of anti-PBM policies from the current administration, particularly from Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan.

While transparency sounds appealing, what she's really proposing is for PBMs to disclose publicly -- including to all drug manufacturers -- the savings they secure in negotiations.

Disclosing this information would be good only for the biggest drug manufacturers. It would allow them to gain a government-created upper hand in knowing which drugs they can discount less, ultimately meaning higher prices for patients.

Imagine if grocery stores had to disclose to food manufacturers the prices they paid to other manufacturers. This would effectively end negotiations and set one price for everyone -- a higher price. And just as it would be harmful for grocery stores, forcing PBMs to reveal their negotiated prices would allow pharmaceutical companies to raise costs for patients.

Additional proposals targeting the market-based, cost-saving role of PBMs have been touted by Harris allies in Congress. These proposed government mandates would eliminate market-based incentives that produce savings through competition and negotiation, hiking healthcare costs for employers and consumers by billions of dollars each year, while artificially increasing drug company profits.

Healthcare costs have already risen under the Biden-Harris administration. Government intervention would drive them even higher, making it harder for American businesses to offer cost-effective prescription drug coverage, and increasing costs for consumers and taxpayers.

Finally, Harris turned to housing costs, a fitting focus given that average mortgage rates have nearly tripled since the Biden-Harris administration took office. She proposed preventing landlords from setting ""artificially high rental prices,"" which might sound appealing -- until you consider that this means federal bureaucrats would decide what constitutes a ""fair"" rent.

The price hikes we're seeing under the Biden-Harris administration are driven by inflation across the market, not by suddenly greedy grocery store owners. The solution is to return to responsible, limited government and a pro-growth economic platform -- not impose ruinous price controls that would set a course toward total implosion of our economy.

If federal bureaucrats control housing costs, it would discourage homebuilders from entering the market. Why would builders invest their capital and time constructing homes if, after making that investment, a federal official could arbitrarily decide its valuation? Fewer homes being built would lead to even higher prices for both renters and homebuyers.

The consistent theme in Harris's economic approach is clear: she believes the government knows better than the free market, and that putting the government in control will somehow lower prices.

Every leftist leader promises that just a little more government intervention will lead to better outcomes -- but common sense and history tell us this approach doesn't work. You can't fix problems caused by socialism with more socialism. Americans should reject these reckless policies come November."
"Most Americans are hesitant to share their honest opinions on key political issues, Social Pressure Index says",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/most-americans-hesitant-share-honest-opinions-key-political-issues-social-pressure-index,2024-09-30T09:11:57Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A shocking new study shows a dramatic difference between what Americans publicly claim they believe on key issues compared to how they really feel when discussing polarizing political topics in private.

Populace, a Massachusetts-based think tank focused on understanding people's private views and values rather than what they'll say publicly, recently unveiled its first Social Pressure Index. The findings indicate that Americans don't trust the government or the media and are hesitant to publicly admit their true feelings on a variety of key issues. This could be critical with the presidential election looming, as many Americans feel pressure to support a specific candidate or issues publicly but wouldn't necessarily vote that way in private.

""I think it's going to be really fascinating to see what happens on election night. I will also say I think people are going to be surprised not just about presidential elections, but about some of the ballot initiatives and things like that are going to play out very different than public opinion might suggest,"" Populace CEO Todd Rose told Fox News Digital.

'HE HAS A WAY OF CONNECTING WITH OUR PEOPLE': SOUTHSIDE CHICAGO RESIDENT BELIEVES TRUMP IS GAINING SUPPORT

Rose said polling ""isn't bad,"" but it's flawed because Americans aren't honest about their personal views.

""Polling assumes you're telling the truth, and we're not,"" Rose said, noting that he began private opinion research after former President Trump's 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton stunned pollsters.

A staggering 61% of Americans admitted to self-silencing their true beliefs, and 58% of Americans believe most people cannot share their honest opinions about sensitive topics even if they believe they are correct, according to the study.

Rose said the Social Pressure Index was the largest private opinion study ever conducted, and it both acknowledges societal pressures to have the ""right"" opinion and also where that pressure impacts what Americans are willing to say out loud. He said the study spanned 64 of the most controversial issues in American society and included a massive sample of over 19,000 respondents and upwards of two dozen demographic groups.

""Across these 64 issues, every single demographic group in the country, every one of them, is outright lying about multiple issues to the point where what they say publicly is not what they believe privately, as a group,"" Rose said.

Rose called it ""frightening"" that some of the public dishonesty can lead to policy implications.

For example, he noted that the study found that for a while, the ""Defund the Police"" appeared to be supported by the majority of Democrats, but only 3% of Democrats supported it in private.

""I don't think we would have gone down the road of some of the stuff in Seattle and other things had we known it was just 3%. And we're seeing similar things like that right now. For example, Americans writ large publicly say they think unions are good for the economy. In private they don't believe it,"" Rose said.

""The good news is this -- when you get past what we're saying publicly, to what we privately believe. I was shocked at the extent of the common ground we have as Americans,"" Rose continued. ""On two thirds of those issues, almost every single demographic in the country agrees -- is on the same side of it.""

Rose found it ""wild"" that so many Americans agreed on significant issues, at least privately, when the nation feels so divided.

""What I'm most excited about is not just that we agree, but it's what we agree on. There is an incredible private preference for meritocracy in America, whether we're talking about college admissions, hiring decisions, promotion decisions, who gets to be in the C-suite, to the way we treat different groups,"" Rose said.

""Three fourths of Americans across all demographics prefer to live in a meritocracy than the things we've been doing recently,"" he continued. ""And I think that's really good news for the future of the country.""

However, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows as many respondents are deeply concerned about the economy.

""One of the things that we found that cut across a bunch of different issues was deep-seeded pessimism about the economy and the direction of the country,"" Rose said.

The study found that Democrats are the most likely to privately suggest the economy is flourishing.

""Consistently, upwards of three out of four Americans say the economy is not good. And we asked a lot of different ways. We asked about their personal finances as they are now. We asked about the state of the economy as it is now. We asked it about whether the economy was better now or worse now than it was five years ago. We asked whether their personal finances were better or worse. We asked in a bunch of ways,"" Rise said.

""Without fail, what you see is that most people recognize in private that the economy's not doing very well. Not surprisingly, the only group that privately will say something different are registered Democrats,"" he continued. ""They pretty consistently are like, 'I think the economy's great.'""

CNN STUDY FINDS DEMOCRAT-LEANING KIDS 5 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SAY THEY WOULDN'T VISIT PRO-TRUMP FAMILY'S HOUSE

Rose said that many of the Democrats who insist the economy is thriving under the Biden-Harris administration admit their personal finances are ""not so good.""

""When we asked about the country headed in the wrong direction, you're getting an overwhelming super majority of Americans, across all demographics, acknowledging that things aren't good for the country,"" Rose said.

The other thing that surprised Rose is how Americans feel about institutions overall.

""So, we all know when it comes to the government, that even in public opinion there's lot there's a lot of distrust of the government, even publicly. We asked the statement about whether you trusted the government to tell you the truth. And that's a kind of low bar, right? Not like, to do everything right, just to tell me the truth. In private, only 4% of Americans trust the government to tell them the truth,"" Rose said.

""What's really funny about that is, Democrats in public have the highest rate of saying they trust the government, 36%. In private, it's only 5%. Even they don't trust the government to tell the truth,"" Rose continued. ""When you extend that to the media, we see something similar. Only 7% of the public privately trusts the media to tell the truth.""

The Social Pressure Index can be seen here.

As to how the data was determined, the abstract for the study explains: ""The primary methodology of the study was a list experiment (also known as the item count technique), a survey technique designed to maximize respondents' privacy. Rather than directly asking respondents their opinion on a series of sensitive topics, list experiments conceal respondents' answers as part of the methodological design by aggregating responses to sensitive items with other items, minimizing the biases introduced by social desirability and nonresponse.""

""If tolerance of dissenting views and the courage to participate in the open, free exchange of ideas are markers of a healthy democracy, then America's epidemic of self-silencing should be seen as a five-alarm fire engulfing the key pillars of representative governance. Most Americans are hesitant to share their honest opinions, not because they're afraid of disagreement, but because they're afraid of judgment,"" Rose said in a statement prior to his Fox News Digital interview.

""When nearly two in three Americans admit that they don't feel comfortable sharing their opinions, that collective silence can create a dangerous illusion of a country more fractured and polarized than it truly is,"" Rose added. ""The truth is we are not as divided as we seem. We're increasingly just too afraid to speak up.""

According to Populace, ""The survey was conducted from May 16, 2024, to June 24, 2024, and was fielded by YouGov."""
Bank Of Japan's Job Just Got Even Harder,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2024/09/30/bank-of-japans-job-just-got-even-harder/,2024-09-30T08:21:24Z,"No one was arguably more surprised by Shigeru Ishiba being named Japan's prime minister than the head of the nation's central bank.

That news Friday surely left Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda with seriously mixed feelings. On the one hand, Ueda now has an ally in Ishiba, who wants the BOJ to continue hiking interest rates. This is rather at odds with much of the rest of the Japanese political establishment.

Ishiba's worry is that holding rates at zero for so long has left the yen chronically undervalued. That, over time, has damaged household confidence and warped corporate incentives in dangerous ways

And he's absolutely right. Since the late 1990s, the most constant policy from government to government was keeping the yen weak for trade advantage. Then, in 2012, Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party retook power and turbocharged the weak exchange-rate policy.

At the time, Japan's then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hired Haruhiko Kuroda to supersize the BOJ's balance sheet in fateful ways. From 2013 to 2023, Ueda's predecessor gorged on bonds and stocks as never before. By 2018, the BOJ's balance sheet topped Japan's entire annual GDP.

Since April 2023, it's fallen to Ueda to normalize interest rates. On July 31, Ueda's team hiked benchmark rates to the highest since 2008. Global markets reacted in wildly negative fashion, a sell-off that spooked Ueda.

Earlier this month, Ueda was summoned to the parliament by anxious lawmakers. They recall that last time the BOJ tried to end quantitative easing and get rates as far away from zero as possible. It resulted in a recession and the BOJ backtracking. By 2008, QE and zero rates were being restored.

Since the July 31 decision to hike rates to 0.25%, Ueda seemed to scale back on this hawkish rhetoric. One issue was the Ministry of Finance suggesting that deflation might not be dead after all.

Ishiba's premiership, on paper, might seem a gift to Ueda's normalization plans. Along with worrying about inflation -- which is well above the BOJ's 2% target -- Ishiba loathes the developing-nation vibe that accompanies Tokyo's beggar-thy-neighbor policies.

Ueda, it seems, now has political cover to hike rates without strong blowback from the ruling LDP. What could be better than Japan's new prime minister having your back?

The problem is, though, Ueda might be having cold feet all his own about Japan Inc.'s readiness for tighter monetary policy. For one thing, the economy is losing altitude as China's slows.

The latest indicator of that is industrial production, which disappointed investors considerably in August. The 3.3% drop from the previous month was much deeper than feared. Production is now more than 10% below 2017 and 2018, before the Covid-19 pandemic. Nor do business forecasts going forward offer much optimism.

""The bleak data poses a dilemma for the Bank of Japan and the government,"" says Stefan Angrick at Moody's Analytics. ""The central bank is determined to raise interest rates. And Ishiba ... has signaled a preference for tighter fiscal policy. But the poor run of data complicates these plans.""

In Angrick's view, the ""sharp drop"" in production is a bad omen for third-quarter GDP, while household finances are ""stretched,"" bankruptcies are up and external demand is ""weak."" Given the subdued backdrop, he says, ""a premature turn towards tighter monetary and fiscal policy would be an added drag on the economy. At worst, they could precipitate a broader downturn.""

Ishiba is also a proponent of fiscal restraint, including tax increases. That could bode ill for corporate confidence, which is hardly what Tokyo wants amid efforts to boost wages. The whole idea behind the BOJ's reflation efforts these last 11 years was kicking off a ""virtuous cycle"" of wages gains. Higher pay, it was hoped, would boost corporate profits and lead to even fatter paychecks.

All bets could be off if Ishiba is tightening fiscal policy. The BOJ is left with a daunting dilemma. Does Ueda push on with higher rates, unsure how those steps might reverberate through the economy? Or does he pause rate hikes for now, possibly drawing the ire of Japan's rather outspoken new leader?

Most central bankers would love a scenario where their nation's top leader runs interference for rate moves that might enrage many politicians, investors and households alike.

Yet given the times in which he's presiding over the BOJ, and the unique range of challenges on the horizon, it's not clear Ueda is happy about this political turn of events. And a fast-moving narrative, too. On Monday, Ishiba said he plans to call a general election on October 27.

It's quite a quandary, one that reminds us why Ueda has what's arguably the least enviable job in global economics."
Chinese Stocks Soar As Investors Hope For Bigger Economic Reforms,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2024/09/30/chinese-stocks-soar-as-investors-hope-for-bigger-economic-reforms/,2024-09-30T05:40:26Z,"China's stock markets are staging a strong turnaround as investors anticipate a major policy shift in the world's second-largest economy -- although some analysts caution that the sustainability of the rally depends on significant reforms.

The benchmark CSI 300 index, which tracks the performance of 300 Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed companies, soared as much as 6.5% on Monday, all but erasing this year's losses as officials keep announcing stimulus measures for the economy and its ailing property market. In a sign of frenzied buying, turnover on both bourses reached over 1 trillion yuan ($142.6 billion) in just 30 minutes after today's trading session started. Investors rushed to buy stocks before markets close for a 7-day National Day holiday week starting Oct 1. The enthusiasm extended to Hong Kong where the Hang Seng Index was up 2.6% Monday morning.

Analysts say investors are encouraged by Beijing's announcement of greater-than-expected support for the economy, which now faces the risk of missing this year's GDP growth target of about 5% amid weak consumer confidence and a protracted real estate crisis. Since last week, policies announced include cuts in outstanding mortgage interest rates, further removal of home-buying restrictions in major cities, more cash for banks to lend, and plans for a stock market stabilization fund.

What was even more significant was a rare shift of topic in a meeting convened last week by the top leadership. While China's Politburo of top leaders led by President Xi Jinping usually discuss economic issues only in their April, July and December gatherings, they broke from the norm and pledged more support for the economy in their monthly meeting in September. In a summary published by the official Xinhua News Agency, the leadership vowed for the first time to ""reverse the downturn of and stabilize the real estate market."" Xi also called on officials to fulfill this year's economic development goals.

""The market is now expecting a shift in China's policy direction,"" says Kenny Ng, a Hong Kong-based securities strategist at Everbright Securities International. ""The economy can only meet its growth targets if there is a rebound in the fourth quarter, so the announcement of support measures is now more determined and forceful.""

Analysts say the rally depends on broader reforms. Harry Murphy Cruise, a Canberra-based economist at Moody's Analytics, wrote in a Sept. 27 research note that the recent stimulus measures should help lift growth by 0.2 to 0.3% this year, but weakness in the economy can only be addressed by expanding social safety spending, promoting private business investment and broadening the revenue sources of local governments, which have historically relied on land sales to replenish their coffers, but can't do so amid the real estate downturn.

Meantime, there hasn't been a notable improvement in China's economic fundamentals, says Shen Meng, a Beijing-based managing director at boutique investment bank Chanson &Co., adding that the rally might fizzle out. In September, both China's factory and service activities contracted again, suggesting the need for more stimulus.

Nomura economists led by Lu Ting wrote in a Sept. 27 research note that various local governments might introduce more support measures in the coming months to boost confidence, but they called on the central government to directly provide funding to pre-sold residential projects that have run out of money to be completed. ""The strategy could be meant to jumpstart the markets and boost confidence,"" the economists wrote. ""But eventually it is still necessary for Beijing to introduce well thought policies to address those deep-rooted problems, particularly regarding how to stabilize the property sector."""
The Financial Crisis Hitting Regional Public Colleges,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrismuller/2024/09/29/the-financial-crisis-hitting-regional-public-colleges/,2024-09-30T03:30:42Z,"In the world of higher education, a storm has been brewing for years. Now, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, that storm has intensified into a full-blown crisis for many regional public colleges across the United States. As a parent planning for your child's future or a student weighing your college options, understanding this landscape is extremely important for making informed decisions about your next steps in continuing your eduction.

Regional public colleges were, at one point, considered the backbone of affordable higher education. But now, many are facing a double whammy of challenges. On one side, there's the ""demographic cliff"" - a sharp decline in the number of high school graduates (particularly in the midwest and northeast). This suddenly shrinking pool of potential students is exacerbated by increased competition from well-known state universities and private colleges - both of which are casting wider nets just to maintain their own enrollment numbers.

On the other hand, state funding for higher education has been on a downward trajectory since 2008. This leaves these regional public universities particularly vulnerable during economic downturns. Despite the economy recovering in other sectors, many states never fully restored their higher education budgets. The result of this became a much greater burden on students and families to cover the cost of their continuing education.

When COVID-19 hit, it seemed like a lifeline had been thrown to struggling colleges and universities in the form of federal relief funds. Unfortunately it was more of a band-aid, as this influx of cash may have simply delayed the inevitable for many schools. Western Illinois University is a good example. They used roughly $42 million in federal aid to offset revenue losses and cover COVID-related expenses. But now, those funds have dried up, and the university is facing a $3.5 million budget deficit.

This scenario is playing out at many other regional public colleges across the country. The federal aid most of these schools received had allowed them to postpone difficult decisions. But now the bill has come due.

So, what are these colleges and universities trying to do to stay afloat? Unfortunately, many are resorting to drastic measures, including layoffs of staff and faculty, and cutting (sometimes key) programs just to balance their budgets. This trend has become more widespread, too, with more colleges announcing budget cuts due to significant financial challenges:

The future for regional public colleges isn't quite clear, but what is clear is that adapting and being flexible is probably the most important thing to survival. Here are some strategies these schools are already needing to embrace:

If you're a parent or student who's considering a regional public college, these challenges don't necessarily mean you should avoid these institutions. Many of them still offer excellent education at a fraction of the cost of the big-name universities or sought-after private colleges. However, it does mean you'll need to do a bit more homework, such as:

The landscape of higher education is changing quite rapidly, and regional public colleges are at the forefront of this change. By staying informed and asking the right (and often tough) questions, you will be better equipped to navigate these changes and make the best decision for your educational future.

Remember, while the challenges are significant, many regional public colleges are taking the necessary steps to meet these challenges with innovative solutions. The key thing to remember is that you need to approach your college decision with an open mind (and I'd even argue a critical mind). This way, you'll be able to better balance the potential risks with the often major benefits these colleges can offer."
"Biden, Bloomberg, Other Leaders Discuss What's Being Done About The Climate Crisis",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/09/29/biden-bloomberg-other-leaders-discuss-whats-being-done-about-the-climate-crisis/,2024-09-30T00:48:39Z,"On Tuesday at the Bloomberg Philanthropies Global Business Forum in New York City, managing director of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva took a moment to sing the line ""This is how we do it"" from the 1995 hip hop hit ""This is How We Do It."" She did this while on stage with president of the World Bank Group Ajay Banga and United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance Mark Carney.

Although Banga did immediately point out Georgieva's important omission of the word ""baby"" at the end, two other words -- ""we"" and ""do"" -- in what Georgieva sang did echo what was emphasized throughout the forum, which was concluded by a speech from U.S. President Joe Biden. Everyone there agreed about a need for more collective (hence the word ""we"") action (hence the word ""do"") against climate change. The ongoing climate crisis has become one of the biggest threats to human health and well-being.

Michael R. Bloomberg, the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy on Climate Ambition and founder of Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg Philanthropies, opened the forum by explaining its purpose: ""We created this forum to offer leaders a chance to have conversations across the private and public sectors, and to build new partnerships on some of the toughest challenges we face."" He continued by saying, ""Today, climate change is the special focus of our conversations, because no single issue presents bigger threats to peace and prosperity or greater opportunities to spur economic growth.""

The forum then proceeded through a series of four discussions featuring various business leaders and policy makers including Georgieva, Banga, Carney, CEO of ALTÉRRA Majid Al Suwaidi, CEO of CDP Sherry Madera, President and Chief Investment Officer of Alphabet and Google Ruth Porat, CEO of LSEG David Schwimmer, Chair of the Board for IOSCO Jean-Paul Servais, Managing Director & CEO of the Macquarie Group Shemara Wikramanayake and Group Chief Executive of Standard Chartered Bill Winters. Actor and activist Jane Fonda then came on stage to make some remarks, followed by Bloomberg, who then set the stage for a speech from Biden, who had addressed the UN General Assembly earlier that day.

The other active participant on stage throughout the forum was a healthy respect for science. No one went against the abundant evidence that climate change is real and a big-time threat to human well-being. There was no need for anyone to convince anyone else that human-generated pollution has contributed to climate change. There was no talk of space lasers causing the California wildfires or other such unscientific claims. Although Biden did at one point during his speech, lean closer to the microphone and say in a deeper voice, ""By the way, windmills do not cause cancer."" Yeah, no real tilting at windmills in this forum.

No, the forum was oriented towards discussing what has been done and what more should be done about human activity contributing to climate change. For example, during the first panel discussion entitled ""Multiplying Impact and Improving Lives Through Partnerships"" and moderated by Carney, Georgieva and Banga reviewed the actions that the IMF and World Bank have been taking, including what the two organizations have been doing in concert. ""We look at green growth opportunities for our members,"" said Georgieva. ""As a financial institution, people look at us and say, 'You think climate is important? Put money where your mouth is.'"" She continued by saying, ""So, we created the Resilience and Sustainability Trust and injected $1 trillion in liquidity and reserves to help the economy overcome shocks.""

Georgieva added, ""The IMF creates fiscal space and then World Bank can bring powerful investments."" It was around this time that Georgieva invoked the lyrics of ""This is How We Do It"" to emphasize the need for cooperation against the common threat of climate change. She did assure everyone, ""The majority of people are kind and good and helpful of each other.""

What gets attention these days, though, isn't necessarily what a majority of people want, say and do. Earlier in the day, during the third Earthshot Prize Innovation Summit, co-hosted by the Earthshot Prize and Bloomberg Philanthropies, former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had warned that political leaders often do not represent what the majority of the population want and that polls have shown that the majority of people around the world do want more action to address the climate crisis. Combine these observations with evidence of the climate crisis getting progressively worse, and it wouldn't be surprising for a lot of people to be skeptical about what will be done about climate change. To all this, Georgieva did offer the following: ""History is a zig zag, up and down, but the trajectory is upwards [when it comes to taking more action against climate change]."" Carney also lent the following thoughts: ""[People tend to] over-rationalize the past, over-dramatize the present and underestimate the future.""

The forum did highlight other actions that have been taken, including new hot-off-the-press ones. In the second panel discussion ""Unlocking the Power of Climate Reporting: A New Frontier of Open Data,"" Madera talked about plans for CDB and the Net-Zero Public Data Utility (NXDPU) to expand their existing partnership, which will make more reliable climate-related data available globally. Additionally, at the forum, the Global Capacity Building Coalition (GCBC) announced the launch of a beta version of a new digital platform to make climate finance capacity-building resources and programs more available to financial institutions, finance professionals, and others.

Once the four discussions were completed, Fonda got up and mentioned how addressing climate change would be her life's work as long as the Earth would continue to have her. She had some choice words for the fossil fuel industry and credited Bloomberg for bringing people together to do more about climate change, calling his convening ability a ""superpower."" Fonda then yielded the podium to Bloomberg, who then in paving the way for Biden's appearance praised the President's climate change policies and said, ""Starting on Joe's first day in office, when he brought the U.S. back into the Paris Agreement. He has wisely put fighting climate change at the center of his work strengthening the economy - showing how the two go hand in hand.""

When the President made it to the stage, Biden began by emphasizing the severity and urgency of the climate crisis. He talked of how he has ""seen more acreage burned down to the ground than the state of Maryland."" Biden declared, ""The climate is in crisis and one existential threat that faces all nations."" He then proceeded to recap the various climate-related policies that he put in place over the past four years. ""The United States has reasserted America's position as a global leader in climate,"" Biden asserted. ""We're leading an all-out effort to partner with nations to reduce global emissions to limit global warming to 1.5 °C."" He drew connections between addressing the climate crisis and economic growth such as saying, ""When I think of climate I think of jobs.""

Throughout his speech, he didn't mention former U.S. President Donald Trump by name but did mention the words ""my predecessor"" several times. This included Biden recalling how his ""predecessor"" had pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accords and asserting that ""all the historic change [in climate action that took place over the past four years] is in stark contrast to my predecessor."" Biden also said, ""When Kamala and I came into office, nothing was being done."" He emphasized too that ""[now] the market for clean energy is booming"" and ""it's time to go big.""

Three clear things emerged from this forum. One is that political discourse in general needs to take more of the tone echoed throughout this forum -- where everyone acknowledges the magnitude and severity of the climate crisis and focuses on solutions and taking action. Two is that key organizations have been taking actions to address the climate crisis. However, the third clear thing is that the current actions alone are not going to be enough. There are still too many political and business leaders trying to prevent more from being done to address this crisis, which in recent years has gone from urgent to really urgent to really, really urgent. Yet, still too many people remain apathetic to this crisis. And this definitely is not how we should do it, baby."

ABC News' Martha Raddatz and Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., clashed on Sunday over recent comments former President Trump made about Vice President Kamala Harris as the lawmaker argued repeatedly they should ""stick to the issues.""

""Do you think Kamala Harris is mentally disabled, do you approve of that kind of language?"" Raddatz said, repeating Trump's comments at a recent rally.

Trump told a crowd at a recent Wisconsin rally, ""Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way. She was born that way. And if you think about it only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country.""

Emmer argued that Harris was the ""wrong choice"" for America.

""Congressman, do you approve of that language?"" Raddatz interrupted, ""do you approve of that language, Donald Trump calling her mentally disabled, mentally impaired?""

""I think we should stick to the issues,"" Emmer responded.

Raddatz then turned the conversation to Trump and Vance's unsubstantiated claim about Haitian migrants eating cats and dogs in Springfield, Ohio.

""One of the issues is of course, migrants. I can't believe we're still talking about this, but the baseless claims elevated by Vance and Trump that Haitian migrants were eating their pets,"" Raddatz said. ""If the moderators in the debate ask Vance about this, should he finally make clear it is not true?""

Emmer said the question was ""such a distraction.""

""The people in the mainstream media want to put up these shiny objects to distract people from what they see happen every day,"" Emmer continued, before Raddatz pushed back and argued that Trump and Vance brought up the issue.

""I think they've got to focus on the issues. The issues are very clear. The economy works under Donald Trump. It doesn't work under Kamala Harris. The border is sealed under Donald Trump and crime is under control. And the border is wide open and Kamala Harris is going into Minnesota trying to bail out rioters and people who are attacking policemen with a bail fund. The list goes on and on. It will be a very clear contrast between JD Vance and Donald Trump's agenda versus what Kamala Harris is talking about. I don't know why you guys don't ask her about her price controls, I mean, she's been way to the left,"" Emmer said.

Raddatz argued that ABC does ask Harris about ""price controls,"" and asked if Emmer would support the policies Harris proposed during her border visit.

""Do we believe her now after she's had almost four years to solve the border crisis and all she did was made sure that it was wide open?"" Emmer responded. ""This is too little, too late. Nobody can believe her because her actions have said something completely different for four years."""

"With So Many CEO Exits, It's Time To Tap A Diversity Officer To Lead",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dougmelville/2024/09/29/with-so-many-ceo-exits-its-time-to-tap-a-diversity-officer-to-lead/,2024-09-29T20:16:59Z,"Having worked in the C-Suite for the past decade, I have seen many CFOs, COOs and CMOs become CEOs.

But I've never seen a chief diversity officer (CDO) step into that role.

I used to joke that the difference between being a CEO and CDO was only one letter. Yet after learning the numbers, I realized that the gap is much wider, and the problem much deeper.

In this fiscal quarter alone, Starbucks, Outback, Red Lobster, Nike, Boeing and Expedia each have new leaders in the top seat. CEO exits are up 50% from the same period last year.

I was recently speaking with my longtime friend Corey Smith. A 20-plus-year corporate executive, his career has spanned many areas of business across some of the world's most reputable companies. Today he sits in the C-suite as a head of diversity. After discussing the ever-evolving careers of our peers and ourselves, the conversation shifted to the wave of CEO departures and, more interestingly, who got the call to lead those organizations.

Almost simultaneously, we both asked, ""Why aren't CDOs or heads of diversity ever considered for the top role within a company?""

It was an aha moment.

To be fair, I don't know for certain if any CDOs have been considered, vetted, or interviewed for a corporation's top post. But one thing I do know is that none have been selected.

In fact, of all the diversity leads at Fortune 5000 companies, I haven't found not one example of a CDO ever being named CEO, either as a replacement or as an advancement into a vacancy. And after a bit more digging, I couldn't find an example of a CDO becoming a CMO, COO or CFO either.

Candidly, I'd welcome being proven wrong, if anyone has an example to share.

Is The CDO Role A One-Way Street?

The CDO position in corporate environments is a relatively new position. While CFO, COO and CMOs have been around for 100-plus years, the CDO has been in mainstream companies for about 20 years.

But in business today, it seems like the CDO role a one-way street.

Prior to becoming a corporate CDO, I sat on the executive team of Magic Johnson Enterprises and worked alongside Mr. Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson as the president of one of his companies. He was my mentor in business, teaching me how to show up and stand out -- as well as how to deliver, stay visible and do it all again tomorrow.

In 2012, Madison Ave tapped me to become a CDO, to ensure that the creative messages we were developing for clients hit the mark. It was a new position but an important role within the company, designed to monitor the pulse of domestic emerging markets that drive the US economy.

For me, becoming a CDO wasn't a demotion or a position that I perceived as less than. It was a position I was happy to help shape within our organization, so we could win business, secure future clients and empower our colleagues by boosting their cultural competency.

By 2045, America will be majority people of color. It is estimated that Black Americans' spending power sits between $1.4 and $1.8 trillion annually. When you add in Latinos' purchasing power, which in the US reached $3.4 trillion in 2021, and Asian Americans, with $1.3 trillion in buying power, that totals at least $6 trillion of spending power -- an economic bloc comparable to the combined gross domestic product of Mexico, Canada and Italy combined.

What Is Holding CDOs Back?

Today, the good news is that 59% of Fortune 500 companies have CDOs, which is much higher than in 2019.

The bad news? Their tenure is by far the shortest among C-suite executives. Recently, as many as 60% of CDOs left their jobs at S&P 500 companies. The average tenure for a CDOs is 2.9 years, compared to an average of seven for CEOs. After being CDO, 58% leave the company for outside opportunities, the highest percentage of any C-Suite role to do so.

Why? They aren't being offered, groomed, or positioned to take on other roles within the company.

In 2023, eight Black CEOs were running Fortune 500 companies (1.6%). It was the highest number since the list was first published in 1955. Compared to the representation of Black Americans in the labor force (13%), we still have some work to do.

All of this brings me back to the question: If CDOs are already in the C-suite, why aren't they getting placed in other C-Suite positions?

This issue involves five areas of concern I call ""P.O.E.M.S.""

I believe these issues are not only keeping CDOs out of top positions within companies but also limiting the promotions of people of color at scale throughout organizations.

1. Perceived Value. In a visual society, for better or worse, optics at times override intent. Perceived value of those in or around diversity roles has been diminished by politics, loud detractors and a social narrative of fear that has swung the pendulum 180 degrees from where it stood in 2020.

2. Opportunity. CEO roles send a message about the direction an organization wants to take going forward, and the changing of the guard arises infrequently. Due to diversity's perceived value, the opportunities for top spots often aren't shared. So diversity officers are unaware of the roles and are not asked to apply. This goes for key work assignments too.

3. Experience. Even though diversity leaders may have had many other executive roles within a company, somehow their previous experience isn't factored into their qualifications. I sometimes hear that CDOs don't manage a P&L, don't work with clients, aren't leading global business or don't have a proper direct reporting structure below them. Other roles may not have those duties either, yet they funnel into CEO positions with greater frequency.

4. Math. No one wants to be the first person to break the glass. It's unlikely the needle will move on this issue until statistics start showing that the CDO can generate greater value -- whether monetary or otherwise -- proving that they can be the CEO. I like to think we're close to getting that visible leader we can point to as the North Star for the undeniable value of CDOs.

5. Subjective Meritocracy. Many policymakers in both the private and public sectors believe that diversity is the opposite of meritocracy. The talking point is, If the best people always rise to the top, why do you need a diversity officer? As someone who knows firsthand the subjective nature of who does and doesn't get a chance within an organization, I can verify that this reasoning is flawed.

A collective understanding is necessary

Diversity officers, whose roles were originally intended to help companies carry on the important work of ensuring that everyone has a seat at the table, operate in a state of invisibility, with many of them being minimized, worked around, let go of or transferred out of their roles.

I want to challenge all boards of directors, C-suite executives, executive committees and leadership teams to ask: Is it time to eliminate the blind spot diversity leaders perpetually live in? Is it time to let them lead, by driving consumer and colleague messaging, marketing and more?

Diversity is at the forefront of American culture. It's critically important to business and society -- and, if we're being honest, the U.S. economy at large.

It's time we empower a CDO with the opportunity to be a CEO of a Fortune 5000 company. Executives like Corey, and so many others, have earned it. In many cases, they've worked twice as hard to secure the position they're in today. And that work ethic is a quality that every company should want in their top spot."
70 days: Kamala Harris has yet to do formal press conference since emerging as Democratic nominee,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/70-days-kamala-harris-has-yet-do-formal-press-conference-since-emerging-democratic-nominee,2024-09-29T17:26:24Z,"'The Five' co-hosts discuss Vice President Kamala Harris' media strategy heading into November.

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 70 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Under pressure to sit down for a substantive interview after weeks of stonewalling, Harris finally ended her interview drought last month in Georgia when she was joined by running mate Tim Walz for a pre-taped piece with CNN's Dana Bash that was a far cry from a traditional press conference.

Trump held his third news conference since the beginning of August earlier this month in California, taking the opportunity to roast his opponent's home state and hold forth on a number of topics, including crime, immigration and inflation.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey earlier this month at a star-studded campaign event.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

The CCP Reforms The Business Practices Of Local Governments,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2024/09/29/the-ccp-reforms-the-business-practices-of-local-governments/,2024-09-29T17:10:48Z,"A near standstill in new capital spending has begun to worry the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It should. Without capital spending by business, China's productive capacities will stagnate, and the economy will struggle even more than it already is. Government orders to state-owned businesses has increased their capital spending, but that is not enough. China needs an expansion of the private business sector - about 60% of the economy -- as well as foreign investment inflows. Private capital spending from domestic sources is barely above zero, while foreigners are largely avoiding China.

To help remedy these shortfalls, the CCP has issued new guidelines to radically reform the way local authorities deal with businesses. The new rules will certainly alter the behavior of local governments, but it is not at all sure whether the new approach will achieve the goals set by the party.

Local authorities in China have long used a wide range of benefits to encourage capital investment by Chinese-based and foreign-based businesses. These included tax exemptions and tax reductions in the early years of production. Some local governments have offered rent free space for offices and production. Some have offered subsidies to prospective companies or loans payable over sometimes very long periods. Some localities through local sourcing laws have offered protection from competition by firms in other regions or overseas. These practices, the party planners have asserted, open too many opportunities for corruption, create what the planners describe as ""market fragmentation,"" and are an impediment to ""high quality economic development.""

Speaking for the authorities in Beijing, the government-owned publication, Economic Daily, has demanded an end all selective and differentiated financial rewards, especially tax incentives and subsidies. Ridding the investment environment of such practices, the party planners assert, will foster a ""unified domestic market"" and curtail the investment impediments imposed by uncertainty. Amid the usual feel-good language of such missives, references to ""new horizons"" and the like, the new guidelines want ""standardized tax incentives."" They insist, not unreasonably, that the best way for localities to foster capital investment spending is by providing better government services and a fair, transparent, and predictable business environment.

The reforms possess several virtues. Giving local authorities less discretion on matters of subsidies and taxes will close many avenues for corruption. Insisting on a transparent and predictable business environment can only reduce business risk and so encourage business to spend on expansion and modernization. Other aspects of these reforms, however, raise questions. Uniform practices across all regions could impede the ability of local governments to create business clusters to which the planners allude that are best suited to their region and by nature are different from other regions. Strictures against the protections of buy-local laws may force these local authorities to go back on earlier promises and in so doing undermine the trust between these local governments and the broad business community.

Whatever the effect on China-based producers, these reforms are not likely to have much impact on foreign-based business. The foreign reluctance to invest in China has little to do with the practices of local governments. Rather it reflects a determination of western and Japanese business to improve the security of their supply chains by diversifying away from what had been an almost exclusive reliance on Chinese sources. Separately, this reluctance also has something to do with staffing costs in China that are rising faster than elsewhere in Asia. Also having effect is the rise of uncertainties stemming from Beijing's seeming obsession with security as well as the anti-China hostility in Washington, Tokyo, London, and Brussels. Even the most effective reforms at the local level can have little effect on these considerations.

These reforms are certainly worth a try. Since the old practices have long since lost their effectiveness, the planners have little to lose with a new approach. As a broad remedy for China's deep financial and economic problems, however, local government reforms offer a small part of what is needed."

They had remained at that level since August 2023 having undergone 14 consecutive rises from December 2021, when they stood at just 0.1%. The next interest rate announcement will be on 7 November.

Steading interest rates, and August's fall, have been made possible by continued cooling inflation.

The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that annual inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in August. It had edged up to 2.2% in July but for the two preceding months had met the Bank's of England's target of 2%. The rise had been largely due to household energy costs falling at a slower rate compared to the previous year.

A year ago in September 2023, the annual inflation figure was 6.7%.

Cooling and steady inflation has triggered lenders to lower mortgage costs with a growing number of high street lenders now offering five-year fixes at under 4%, for example. It remains to be seen what effect the Labour Government will have on rates as well as the wider economy. We will know more in its Autumn Budget on 30 October.

But how much can borrowers expect to pay right now?

Rates vary according to lender and deposit size, but according to our mortgage partner Better.co.uk, the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, across all borrower types* today, stands at 4.61%. The average cost of three- and five-year deals is 4.33% and 4.26% respectively.

The best two-year fix is currently priced at 3.73%, while the best three- and five-year deals at 3.94% and 3.71% respectively.

The average two-year tracker rate mortgage is priced at 5.48%, with the best in this category priced at 5.14%.

The typical standard variable rate (SVR) stand at 7.22% today, according to Better.co.uk. The SVR is usually what borrowers revert to once their deal, such as a fix or tracker, has expired.

In terms of mortgage availability, as of 1 September there were 6,460 residential mortgage deals on the market according to data provider, Moneyfacts. This compares to 6,657 last month. But the number has largely grown. On 1 February for example it stood at 5,787.

Below is a live table of the mortgage deals available today. You'll find guidance on how to use the table underneath it.

When the Bank Rate rises or falls, it has an effect on the cost of mortgages.

There are more than a million homeowners (according to trade body, UK Finance) on variable rate deals, such as trackers, whose payment will immediately either rise or fall when Bank Rate is adjusted.

If Bank Rate fell by 0.25 percentage points for example, a tracker deal priced at 5.50% would be repriced to 5.25%. This would slice £30 a month off the cost of a £200,000 loan taken over 25 years, with monthly repayments falling from £1,258 to £1,128.

Borrowers on fixed-rate deals, where the interest rate is locked in, would not see the benefit of a fall in the Bank Rate. However, nor would their rate rise if Bank Rate was pegged upwards.

Around 700,000 borrowers will come to the end of their fixed rate deals over the second half of 2024 according to figures from UK Finance - and, despite the August fall in Bank Rate, new available deals will be considerably more expensive.

You can work out the monthly cost of a mortgage against various interest rates with our Mortgage Calculator.

The most recent data is pointing towards an increasingly buoyant property market, following the August fall in interest rates and continued stable inflation.

The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) report (published 18 September) which uses Land Registry data on sold properties, found that average house prices for July were 2.2% higher compared to 12 months before. It marks the fifth consecutive month of rises. On a monthly basis, the rise was a nominal 0.6%. The ONS puts the cost of an average home in July at £290,000.

Halifax's house price report (published 6 September) reported that average property values in August were 4.3% higher than the previous year. It marks the strongest annual house price growth since 2022. On a monthly basis, the rise was 0.3% when compared to July. Halifax, which bases its index on mortgage data, puts the cost of the average home in August at £292,505 - up from £291,268 in July.

Rightmove, which measures asking prices, reported a rise of 0.8% in September on the previous month. On an annual basis prices rose by 1.2%. The average home listed for sale on the property portal was priced at £370,759 in September compared to £367,785 in August.

Interest rates underwent 14 consecutive rises between December 2021 and August 2023 as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) used hikes to cool the economy and tame soaring inflation.

Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. By May 2024 it had fallen to 2%, which is the Bank's official target. It remained at 2% in June before rising slightly to 2.2% in July where is remained in August.

One of the main drivers behind runaway inflation had been the rising cost of energy bills. Energy regulator Ofgem's energy price cap, which dictates the nation's energy bills, was as high as £4,279 in the first quarter of 2023 (although government intervention had applied a temporary ceiling of £2,500).

The cap has since fallen to its current £1,568 (effective from 1 July to 1 September 2024). From 1 October, bills will rise again by 10% when Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,717 a year - or £149 in cash terms. However, this will still mean that bills are cheaper than last winter.

Ofgem's energy price cap is the quarterly figure that represents the annual bill of a typical household paying monthly by direct debit (although actual bills are always determined by consumption).

Keeping track of mortgage costs can challenging - especially when rates can change on a daily basis. One simple way is use our mortgage tables, powered by Better.co.uk.

To find out what deals are available at today's rates for the kind of mortgage you're after, enter your personal criteria into our mortgage table (above). Here's what to do:

Mortgage deals offering the cheapest rates usually come with fees attached. You can opt to pay these upfront or add them to the loan. To factor in the cost of the fee, order your the results by 'initial period cost' (in the 'sorted by' dropdown).

Alternatively, you can order results by initial rate, lowest fee or monthly repayment - even by the lender's 'follow on' rate that the deal will revert to at the end of the term.

The very cheapest are reserved for bigger deposit amounts, usually of 60% of the property value or more. And, in all cases, you will need a sufficient income and clean credit history to be accepted for a mortgage.

If you want to see what your monthly mortgage payments might look like in different scenarios while overlaid with household bills, our Mortgage Calculator will crunch the numbers.

Once issued, mortgage offers tend to be valid for six months, although some lenders honour offers for up to 12 months. If you are looking to remortgage your current home, this means you can lock in a rate today - at no cost and with no strings attached.

*Average mortgage costs can vary between sources depending on how the data is gathered. Better.co.uk's data refers to the average cost of a fixed rate mortgage recommendation that is created and issued to applicants over the last seven days from its panel of over 100 lenders.

The data counts remortgage and purchase loans but excludes SVRs, adverse credit, self-build and shared ownership. Data is collected at the end of each business day.

Better.co.uk targets applicants with a good credit history. Lower loan-to-values (under 85%) account for a significant portion of its business which can translate into cheaper loan rates."
Austrians Vote In General Election Dominated By Migration,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/freylindsay/2024/09/29/austrians-vote-in-general-election-dominated-by-migration/,2024-09-29T15:10:58Z,"Parliamentary elections are taking place in Austria, with migration issues dominating the electoral cycle, along others such as the economy and war in Ukraine. The country's far-right party has a chance to win the most votes for the first time, though may struggle to form a government.

The anti-migration Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) is running against the currently reigning Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), as well as the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ), New Austria and Liberal Forum (NEOS) and several other smaller parties. While the FPÖ has risen in voter polling since the last election, they currently enjoy just a slight lead over the ÖVP. The SPÖ trails a few points further behind. If the FPÖ were to win the most votes, it would be the first time in the party's history.

The FPÖ, led by Herbert Kickl, has put migration issues front and center of their campaign. Their campaign slogan is 'Fortress Austria,' appropriating the critical phrase 'Fortress Europe' often used by migration advocates to describe restrictive European Union policies in recent years.

""For months the FPÖ has warned of a renewed rise in the number of asylum seekers, and the consequences of this mass migration,"" reads the intro text on the FPÖ campaign website. ""What is needed now is Fortress Austria.""

The party has repeatedly attacked the governing coalition led by the ÖVP on its record on asylum and migration, and framed migration as an existential issue for Austrian society.

For those familiar with anti-immigration rhetoric, the FPÖ's stance will be familiar. According to the party's campaign materials, asylum seekers ""import"" violence when they seek shelter in Austria, endangering ordinary citizens and abusing the social and welfare systems.

""The protection of our women and children must be more important than the right of asylum seekers to safety,"" reads the campaign website.

While the FPÖ might be the most strident in its anti-immigrant rhetoric, the party's main general election contenders have also positioned themselves to the right on migration issues. Chancellor Karl Nehammer of the ÖVP is a long-time hardliner on immigration. Earlier in 2024 he praised the United Kingdom's now-scrapped plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda. He has also called for the EU to strike more deals with third countries to stop people trying to reach Europe via their territory.

Similarly, the nominally center-left SPÖ party, currently projected third in voter polls for this general election, sits on the right when it comes to migration. Party leader Andreas Babler has said he wants to cut asylum applications by 75% and has spoken out against 'economic migrants' claiming asylum in Austria. Babler himself only narrowly beat out the stridently anti-irregular migration Hans Peter Doskozil for the leadership of the SPÖ in 2023. Doskozil had previously called for asylum seekers to be barred from entering the EU's territory at all - in direct contravention of international refugee conventions to which Austria is a signatory.

Whether or not the FPÖ wins the most votes in Sunday's general election, it is unclear what coalition will form the next government in Austria. No party is projected to win anywhere near an outright majority, so likely a two-party coalition will have to be negotiated. The current government is a tense coalition between the ÖVP and Greens. With support for the Greens having waned considerably, the most likely contenders to form the next government are the FPÖ and ÖVP. Chancellor Nehammer has said he is open to forming a government with the FPÖ - who are aligned with them on a number of economic policies - but not if Herbert Kickl remains leader. Depending on the outcome of Sunday's vote, however, he may be faced with little choice."
Fed Rate Cuts Breathe New Life Into These High-Yield Stocks,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/09/29/fed-rate-cuts-breathe-new-life-into-these-high-yield-stocks/,2024-09-29T15:03:19Z,"Real estate is great, except for the heavy time commitment, which makes it a non-starter for me. ""Brett, can you come over and change my lightbulb?""

No thanks. Tickers only, please.

Which is fine. Enter real estate investment trusts (REITs), which let us invest in not one or two buildings, but usually dozens or even hundreds, for as little as $20 per share or so. Plus the yields can be even better than the fourplex that would ruin my life down the street.

Dividends of 7%, 12% and even 16%. All with a simple ticker that we can tap in from our phones. Now we're talking. Part of retiring on dividends is never having to field a phone call!

Believe it or not we have Congress to thank. Our fearless lawmakers wrote REITs into existence in 1960. In true D.C. style, they shoved it into an amendment in the Cigar Excise Tax Extension. But we won't complain about the pork when it is served to us retirees!

The law that brought REITs to life also declared that these businesses would receive a massive federal tax break if they dished big dividends. The loophole? REITs would be tax advantaged so long as they paid out at least 90% of their taxable income to us, the shareholders.

As great as REITs are, however, they don't go up in a straight line. I pointed out a few months ago that REITs had simply refused to join 2024's rally, thanks at least in some part to the Federal Reserve refusing to cut rates as quickly as Wall Street expected.

Since then, of course, the economy showed enough signs of cooling that a Fed cut practically became a given -- and indeed, in September, our central bank kicked off its cutting cycle with a weighty half-point reduction.

That's a fantastic turn of events for anyone who used REITs' prolonged slumber to buy in earlier this year. But I also said:

That's great news for contrarians who still have some cash to put to work. We want to buy before the Fed finally triggers a stampede in REITs -- not after.

So, are we out of time? Are would-be buyers who didn't pull the trigger doomed to sit on the outside looking in?

Not necessarily.

We need to be a little more discerning, especially where value is concerned -- we can't just blindly throw a dart and hit a bargain like we could a few months ago. And yields in the REIT sector have indeed come down.

But as the following five picks show, we can still lock in phenomenal yields of between 6.9% and 16.2% today.

Let's start with Armada Hoffler Properties (AHH, 6.9% yield), the only sub-7% dividend of the group. This diversified REIT owns 73 properties -- 48 retail, 14 office and 11 multifamily -- throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. But that belies the importance of office to the portfolio. While office real estate makes up just 19% of AHH's property account, it accounts for 33% of property net operating income (NOI).

So it should be little surprise that this REIT's shares have been unable to recover to pre-pandemic levels.

But AHH isn't entirely unattractive. Armada boasts mid-90s occupancy across all three of its segments. It has been growing same-store cash NOI. The dividend -- which Armada admittedly had to hack in half by 2020 -- only needs to grow by another 7% to return to pre-COVID levels, and it's decently covered at less than 90% of estimates for adjusted funds from operations (AFFO).

It's only fairly priced, however, at roughly 13 times those same AFFO estimates. And higher-than-average leverage is expected to weigh on both Armada's ability to deploy capital, as well as the company's earnings. It's not an ideal situation at the moment, but I'll keep my eye on this one for better opportunities in the future.

Speaking of office properties, let's move on to Alexander's (ALX, 7.5% yield), which has one of the sparsest real estate portfolios I've ever seen. This hyper-niche office REIT owns a scant five properties in the NYC metropolitan area. It's also managed by Vornado Realty Trust (VNO), which takes annual management fees from several of the properties and is entitled to a development fee, when applicable -- money that basically comes out of your pocket.

ALX has also struggled since COVID, but to its credit, it has recently been able to reclaim pre-pandemic levels.

Rather than break down Alexander's properties, I'll simply point out that Bloomberg, as a tenant, accounts for a little more than half of rental revenues. Yes, Bloomberg has signed on to remain at 731 Lexington Avenue through 2040, but that's a worrisome business concentration that should give any investor pause. Indeed, Alexander's is compelled to warn investors that ""if we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.""

Alexander's dividend coverage is also problematic. In 2023, the company's $15.80 in FFO per share was much less than the $18 per share in dividends it paid out. So far in 2024, it has brought in $8.29 in FFO per share but paid out $9.

I've previously highlighted Alexander's as one of Wall Street's more hated stocks. The analyst crowd sometimes takes a ""if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all"" tack with stocks, and that's the case with ALX, which has a single covering analyst right now. I think I'll do the same and move on to the next stock.

Easterly Government Properties (DEA, 7.7% yield) is a refreshing change of pace. OK, yes, this is an office-heavy portfolio, too, but it's not your average cubicle farm. This REIT owns 93 properties that it leases out to U.S. government agencies such as Veterans Affairs, the FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, among others. And its buildings go beyond offices, spanning outpatient facilities, warehouses, courthouses, labs, even built-to-purpose properties.

On paper, Easterly is a dividend hunter's dream. It has one of the best clients you could ask for in the U.S. government. It's not just diversified by property type, but it has a tenant and property breakdown that no other REIT comes close to replicating. It yields nearly 8%. It's even trading at a mild discount right now.

Yet for years, DEA shares have given investors little more than heartburn.

Easterly's biggest problem is that it hasn't been able to prove it can grow FFO with any regularity. The government might be a reliable tenant, that it's also not the best tenant to have for growth purposes. And as I've mentioned previously when examining DEA:

Many of its properties are 'build to suit' -- the buildings are exactly what the government needs, but not exactly attractive to outside tenants, either. That means decent bargaining power for the government, and capped upside for Easterly.

The biggest black mark -- one that's almost impossible to ignore -- is DEA's dividend coverage. In a way, the dividend is lucky to have remained flat at 27 cents quarterly since mid-2021. That's because Q2 marked the seventh straight quarter in which Easterly earned less in cash available for distribution (CAD, a non-GAAP cash flow metric some REITs use to illustrate their ability to cover the dividend) than it paid out in dividends.

That's not nearly as glaring a dividend problem as the one at Global Net Lease (GNL, 12.6%).

Global Net Lease is a commercial REIT operator with assets in 11 countries. The U.S. accounts for roughly 80% of straight-line rents, though it also has a presence in Canada and western European nations including the U.K., the Netherlands and Germany. It boasts nearly 1,300 properties leased out to 755 tenants spanning more than 90 industries.

And it pays a double-digit yield despite the fact that management has taken a hatchet to the payout multiple times in recent years.

I struggle to trust a company with a dividend policy so tight, it's basically forced to cut back on the distribution anytime management is in a pinch. But there are a few signs of hope that are keeping this stock on my radar.

The big one is that GNL is working to get on more solid financial ground. The company has been selling off assets like crazy (163 properties worth ~$730 million so far in 2024) to bring down its leverage. Midway through the year, net debt to leverage sat at 8.1x. It's working to get that number as low as 7.4x by the end of this year, and eventually closer to the net-lease industry's median, which sits below 6.0x. In the meantime, it's projected to actually grow FFO in each of the next two years.

Plenty must go right for Global Net Lease to right the ship and build trust with dividend investors again. But a still-low P/AFFO of less than 7 right now adds a little curb appeal to this gamble.

Near the end of 2023, I said that patience was a must with Service Properties Trust (SVC, 16.2% yield) -- an unusual but intriguing REIT that invests in both hotels and service-focused retail net-lease properties.

But with shares now trading for just 4 times FFO estimates, is the time finally ripe to hop into this mind-blowing yield?

Service Properties Trust, as I said, has a dual focus: hotels and retail. The former involves some 220 hotels with more than 37,000 guest rooms in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. The latter involves nearly 750 service-focused retail net lease properties in the U.S. And importantly, that retail arm is heavily dependent on TravelCenters of America / Petro Stopping Centers, which make up more than two-thirds of the division's annualized minimum rent. (The next-closest is The Great Escape at a mere 2%.)

A major drag on SVC has been a massive upgrade project to its Sonestra and Hyatt (H) hotels; while upgrades will continue throughout 2024, its Hyatt renovations are almost finished, which should provide a tailwind to RevPAR (revenue per available room, a vital hotel performance metric). I also previously mentioned that Service Properties Trust had some $1 billion in debt maturities to address in each of the next two years -- it has managed to repay those and now has no debt maturities due until 2026.

Service Properties Trust, like many other REITs, kneecapped its dividend in 2020, from 54 cents per share to a penny. Unlike GNL, SVC has managed to raise it back somewhat, to 20 cents per share. But dividend investors might have cause to be nervous again. The second quarter's CAD fell from 47 cents per share in 2023 to 29 cents per share in 2024, bringing the REIT's trailing 12-month CAD to 73 cents per share. Service Properties Trust pays 80 cents annually, meaning the dividend is no longer covered by CAD."
Opinion | The problem with Harris' 'pragmatic' economic approach,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-economic-policies-republicans-rcna173019,2024-09-29T14:11:43Z,"Kamala Harris said she won't be ""constrained by ideology"" when looking for ""practical solutions to problems."" Good luck with that.

Vice President Kamala Harris has begun rolling out the economic policies her administration would enact should she take office next year. In her big speech on Wednesday at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, she promised to be ""pragmatic"" in her economic approach. Harris added, ""I believe we shouldn't be constrained by ideology and should instead seek practical solutions to problems.""

It's a seemingly noble sentiment as these things go. Harris' pitch is one that tries to toe the line between populist and moderate in hopes of triumphing over former President Donald Trump. What better way to do so than by promising to give serious consideration to ideas that come from the other side of the aisle? But looking at the proposals her campaign has put forward so far, it's hard to see just what solutions she intends to lift from conservative ideology -- or if there are even any GOP ideas left that are worth appropriating as her own.

In one of the most frustrating misconceptions that refuses to die, and despite ample evidence to the contrary, many polls still show voters think Trump would have an edge over Harris on handling the economy. We can chalk that up at least in part to short-term memory loss of the Trump administration's chaos, along with frustration with the inflation that skyrocketed post-pandemic and has only now tapered off. Accordingly, Harris has tried to keep her distance from President Joe Biden, even as large parts of the policy document her team dropped on Thursday are carryovers from his ""Bidenomics"" proposals.

In promising to be pragmatic and listen to ideas from all comers, Harris is trying to tamp down on the perennial false claims from Republicans that she's a secret socialist. The easiest way that past Democrats have found to do this has been to find the most palatable conservative policies that could appeal to a broad swath of the country and claim them for their own. (It's a process that you never see go the other direction, absent a few of Trump's wilder swings that have zero backup from the rest of his party.)

But that was an easier task for previous Democratic presidents, who had more options for centrist compromises given where the Republicans were starting from. When crafting the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama eschewed more progressive policies like a single-payer system in favor of ripping off GOP Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts. The ""Romneycare"" hybrid market model for health care was itself first put forward by the Heritage Foundation of all places, long before Republicans turned on it in 2008.

The prior Democratic president, Bill Clinton, was especially keen to undercut GOP talking points by swiping their most popular ideas in the process of ""triangulation."" Of course, ""popular"" doesn't always mean ""good."" Yes, Clinton's welfare reforms were a compromise, one that moved the country to the right economically without fully dismantling government assistance like many conservatives would have preferred. But it came at the cost of adding needless hurdles for millions of Americans to jump over to access vital assistance.

In contrast, it's not clear what big ideas Harris thinks she'll be able to import from the right in her term. There's surely not anything in the pages of Heritage's Project 2025 that will become the same kind of major policy focus for her. The closest to that may be the pitch for a new kind of universal savings account that my colleague Ryan Teague Beckwith identified as one of the few suggestions in the giant document worth giving serious consideration.

There are a few smaller things that could be on the agenda. Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania issued an executive order removing requirements for a four-year college degree from most state jobs, which has been held up as a potential example for Harris to crib from. In her speech on Wednesday, Harris touched on changing up permitting and ""cutting red tape"" for new small businesses. Both have a certain conservative flavor, but aren't necessarily coded as wholesale right-wing propositions.

If anything, the closest example of taking on a conservative economic idea as her own would be the proposal to end taxes on tips that Trump floated this summer. Her team has worked to try to refine the concept from a naked ploy to win over service workers in Nevada into an actual policy. It's still not exactly a sure winner, though, politically or economically speaking.

It could be then that Harris' promise to be open to ideas from all ideologies is less about her administration's policy than election-year politics. As a bit of rhetoric, it likely sounds great to those few remaining undecided swing voters that she will have an open mind and not be beholden to left-wing economic models. But if she gets into office and finds that the GOP's ideas would all either raise prices for consumers, require giving the wealthy even more money, or turn out to be just plain impractical? Well, you won't be able say she didn't try to find some wheat among the chaff at least."
Are Stocks Overvalued?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/09/29/are-stocks-overvalued/,2024-09-29T11:04:50Z,"Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve recently delivered a larger-than-expected half-percentage point decrease in short-term interest rates, igniting another leg of the stock rally. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, markets have priced in a higher likelihood of avoiding recession and sent stocks to new highs.

Stocks and the Magnificent 7 continued their march higher this week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the S&P 500 on the week and are now only 5.1% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 is almost 22% higher year-to-date, while the S&P 500 technology sector is nearly 30% higher.

With the backdrop of the Fed rate cut cycle, resilient economic growth, and stocks closing at highs this week, are stocks overvalued?

Trying to value the stock market is simple on the surface but is never easy. Since shareholders own a piece of an operating company, not just a piece of paper, stocks are valued based on the expected future cash flows accruing to shareholders. Complicating the process and providing the occasional opportunity for investors, prices are also impacted by human emotion.

Based on a multiple of next year's estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies produce profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Though ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average and argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable.

Warren Buffett has said, ""The value of a business is the cash it's going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present."" Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business, providing a good measure of the money accruing to us as owners.

Free cash flow yield is the free cash flow divided by the stock price. Consistent with price-to-earnings, cash flow yield points to a stock market that is not cheap, though it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as investors having more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow.

As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and, as will be illustrated, the superior fundamentals of the group.

Like the exceptional return on equity noted earlier and supporting the rich stock valuations, profit margins are elevated relative to history. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that become bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are close to double the market as a whole, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield.

As noted, free cash flow yields look in the rearview mirror and don't explicitly consider growth. Over the last five years, the S&P 500 has grown free cash flow per share at a 5.1% annualized rate, while the technology sector has grown at a much faster 8.6% annualized rate. Both are impressive growth rates considering that this timeframe includes the COVID-19 economic shutdown, which saw the U.S. economy shrink at a 32.9% annualized rate in the second quarter of 2020. Technology's superior free cash flow growth further reinforces why those stocks have been dominant, and their valuation is above the S&P 500.

As Buffett noted, the last piece of the puzzle is to discount those future owner's cash flows to the present using an interest rate. All other things being equal, valuations should be lower for the same stream of profits when yields are higher and vice versa.

Now that the Federal Reserve has begun reducing short-term interest rates, the expectation is that yields for longer-maturity bonds will also decline. Indeed, an analysis of past monetary easing cycles shows that stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started.

If one looks at how the more economically sensitive cyclical companies are performing versus the less sensitive defensives, stocks currently assign a lower risk of recession. In addition, consensus S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2025 call for 15% growth, according to FactSet. The soft landing does seem like how things should play out, but it is far from a certainty. Warren Buffett spoke to the situation when he said, ""It's been an ideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend. Those who invest only when commentators are upbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance."" In other words, prices are usually high when the majority are optimistic.

So, where does this leave us in our answer to the question of stock valuation? It isn't an easy or straightforward answer. As a means of defense, even Warren Buffett has said, ""In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield.""

Investors have rightly sent stocks higher, particularly technology stocks, based on improving fundamentals, but that is the past. If one believes that the economy continues to chug along and free cash flow, perhaps driven by artificial intelligence, continues to grow at a robust pace, then stocks could be underpriced. Further, the leading technology companies have dominant competitive positions, and delivering intangible goods allows for profit margins and earnings growth rates that were not previously possible. There are reasonable arguments that artificial intelligence can lift profits across many industries, not just the technology sector.

The challenging part is the current starting line of exceptional profit margins and above-average valuations, which leaves less margin for error since the future free cash flows matter to the valuation of businesses. In addition, the COVID-impacted economic cycle likely leaves our typical economic indicators less effective, so confidence in forecasts should be less than usual.

Though it doesn't feel that way, the risk of eventual disappointment is higher in stocks when valuations are above average, and forecasts are rosy. For long-term investors who can withstand the inevitable volatility, the discussion of overvaluation is moot since stocks have provided the highest after-inflation returns of any asset class despite the ups and downs throughout history.

Since the short-term path of stocks is always unknown and subject to human emotion, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and risk tolerance. It is an excellent time to consider rebalancing to an appropriate risk level after the robust stock gains, especially in light of possible higher capital gains tax rates next year. In addition, owning some high-quality and less economically sensitive defensive stocks is analogous to buying an umbrella when it is sunny. The purchases are cheaper than when it rains, and investors will be happy to have them if it storms. Because some dominant technology companies have exceptional fundamentals and long-term outlooks, abandoning them altogether, barring evidence to the contrary, is unwise."
"Bold Ideas, Big Impact: Lisa Zarzeczny On Building Your Vision",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissahouston/2024/09/29/bold-ideas-big-impact-lisa-zarzeczny-on-building-your-vision/,2024-09-29T10:03:20Z,"Entrepreneurs today face a rapidly changing landscape filled with both opportunities and challenges. As inflation rises, economies shift, and ecosystems evolve, the pressure to succeed can feel overwhelming. Yet amid this uncertainty, boldness and innovation remain critical to building something lasting.

One place that encourages these values is the Elevate Festival, where entrepreneurs and innovators come together to inspire one another.

Lisa Zarzeczny, cofounder and CEO of Elevate, is a testament to the power of bold ideas and the drive to turn vision into reality. Her story offers inspiration for anyone with a dream, especially entrepreneurs navigating today's challenging landscape.

Lisa's early days with Elevate were far from glamorous. With only four employees in the first year, the organization started small. But from the outset, the vision was anything but. ""We shot for the stars from the very beginning,"" Lisa recalls.

Her experience teaches an important lesson for anyone starting out: you don't need everything figured out from day one. Instead, focus on the long-term vision, and take bold steps toward it, even when the resources are limited. It's about knowing where you want to go and having the courage to move forward, even when the path isn't fully clear.

The key to turning big ideas into reality lies in ambition. ""Fortune really does favor the bold,"" Lisa says. Amid uncertainty, whether it's economic instability or the challenges unique to 2024, having the ambition to pursue large, transformative goals is crucial.

While the challenges of today's entrepreneurial landscape are real, Lisa encourages founders to trust their gut and stick to their vision. ""It's difficult to be a founder right now with inflation, the economy, and a shifting ecosystem,"" she acknowledges. But the path to success is rarely straightforward. ""You have to be patient with the process, and above all, stay bold in your vision.""

Lisa is passionate about empowering women to take on leadership roles, especially in industries where they have historically been underrepresented. ""A country and world that continues to thrive is one where women are in leadership positions,"" she explains. For Lisa, this isn't just about gender equality. It's about ensuring that the best ideas are at the table, and those often come from diverse leadership.

Her message to women entrepreneurs is clear. Lead with confidence, take risks, and pursue your boldest ideas. The journey may come with challenges, but by stepping into leadership, women are reshaping the future of innovation.

Lisa's advice to anyone with a bold idea is simple. Take the leap. ""You'll never regret trying it,"" she says. While it's easy to get stuck in fear or overthink the risks, not trying is the real regret. Whether the idea works or not, the act of pursuing it can open doors and change lives in ways you never expected.

Her experience serves as a reminder that the scariest ideas are often the ones worth pursuing. It's through embracing fear, taking risks, and learning from both successes and failures that real progress happens.

Lisa's story is not just about building a successful platform for innovation; it's about the power of dreaming big and staying bold, even when the odds are uncertain. Her boldness allowed her to attract huge impact to the stage at Elevate, securing guests like Michelle Obama. The presence of such influential figures reflects the power of vision in making a global impact.

Ultimately, the Elevate Festival is a place where entrepreneurs can come together to be inspired. It's designed to provide founders with the confidence and knowledge they need to build amazing companies. ""We want Elevate to be a place where people can come, be inspired, and leave with the tools they need to turn their bold ideas into successful businesses,"" Lisa explains.

Through the festival's talks, panels, and community-building opportunities, Elevate continues to inspire entrepreneurs to think bigger, act bolder, and make their visions a reality. Whether you're just starting out or scaling a business, Elevate is about igniting that boldness and pushing entrepreneurs to take their next big leap."
Pennsylvania's Latinos could be key to deciding who wins the presidency,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/26/nx-s1-5124621/latinos-pennsylvania-election-trump-harris,2024-09-29T09:03:50Z,"PHILADELPHIA -- Rafael Collazo has been working in Pennsylvania politics for a long time. In that time, he's tried to elevate the importance of a key voting bloc that he says is often ignored in national politics: the state's growing Latino population.

This year, he feels like campaigns are finally getting the message.

""I was telling some people the other day that I'm going to be 50 years old in two months, and it took almost 50 years for the Latino vote of Pennsylvania to be sexy,"" said Collazo, the executive director of the UnidosUS Action Fund and Action PAC, which seeks to boost Latino interests.

""You know, it's clear the Latino vote of Pennsylvania is going to determine who wins this election,"" he said.

According to some estimates, there are roughly 580,000 Latinos who will be eligible to vote in this year's presidential election. That's about seven times President Biden's margin of victory in the state in 2020.

And that means even a fraction of this swing state's Latino voters could be decisive in what's expected to be a close election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.

One positive for Democrats: The overwhelming majority of Pennsylvania's Latino population is Puerto Rican, according to Rodrigo Dominguez-Villegas, the director of research at UCLA's Latino Policy and Politics Institute.

""Puerto Rican voters across elections have shown to be much more supportive of Democratic candidates,"" he said.

Collazo explained the party's deep ties in the community this way: ""The initial families that came here [to Philadelphia] were with labor unions. They were big city Democrats. So, the orientation for the Latino voters at that time was more homogenous and more Democrat.""

Dominguez-Villegas said even as Trump and the GOP have started to see more support in the Latino population writ large, the Puerto Rican vote has stayed pretty consistent in its support for Democrats.

""They've shown to be some of the voters that have shifted the least towards the Republican Party,"" he said.

But Philadelphia and other Pennsylvania cities have seen an influx of Latino voters from other countries -- and they aren't as tied to the Democratic Party.

Latino men especially seem more amenable to Republicans' pitch -- a trend that follows a broader gender gap in polling this year.

Angel Alvarez is a Dominican who co-owns a barbershop in Hunting Park, a predominantly Latino neighborhood in North Philadelphia. He supported Democrats for many years but lately shifted to Republicans -- particularly Trump.

""I am going to vote for Donald Trump because when he was president ... he was able to fix a lot of problems and give a lot of opportunities to Hispanic people,"" he said in Spanish.

David Rodriguez, a ward leader for the Republican Party in Philadelphia, said he also used to be a Democrat but has been supporting Trump for the past few elections.

Rodriguez said he's knocked on doors in both Black and Latino neighborhoods in his ward and he hears a lot of support for Trump, particularly when it comes to the economy.

""People at the end of the day, they're going to vote with their pocket,"" he said. ""There's a hole in their pocket now and they want things to get better. And they feel that in the Trump years, things were a bit better.""

These are voters that would be hard for Democrats to convince. Monica Parrilla owns an auto body shop in the neighborhood. She has worked in Democratic politics and mostly tries to engage Latino men in politics because of her line of work.

She said that culturally a lot of Latino men that she comes across are socially conservative. But they also are likely to sit out elections.

""You know, it's difficult to engage male voters,"" she said. ""There has to be something said about earning men in general, that it's not that they don't want to vote. Sometimes the candidate needs to really earn their vote.""

Edward Bonilla, who is Dominican, owns a grocery store in Hunting Park. He said he was leaning toward Trump because he felt ""the economy was better"" during his presidency. But he said he was now undecided and leaning toward not voting at all, after the former president denigrated Haitian immigrants during the debate earlier this month.

""You know, I'm close to Haiti,"" he said. ""I'm from the Dominican Republic. And I don't think it's fair that he be talking like that about human beings.""

While shopping at Bonilla's grocery store, Sonia Concepcion said she is definitely going to vote -- and she's going to vote for Harris.

""She represents a lot of growth, a lot of positive things,"" she said. ""Things that I think will get America back on track. Where Trump ... his actions speak louder than words. What he's done, what he's been guilty of and he's gotten away with because he has money, I guess, or he's crooked like that.""

Concepcion, who is Puerto Rican, said she hears a lot of women in her community excited to vote for Harris.

This is something that Philadelphia City Councilor Quetcy Lozada hears among her constituents, too.

""There's an interest now because they can identify with the candidate at the top of the ticket,"" she said, ""because there are issues on her agenda that touch Latina women every day. That women's health, as one of the key components of her agenda, is important to women.""

Lozado said the Harris campaign has to ""speak to Latino voters directly,"" and that's best done by groups that already have ties to the community.

This past weekend, Spanish-speaking members of the SEIU chapter in the region held a canvassing effort in some of Philadelphia's Latino neighborhoods.

Eneida Rivera, a local housekeeper, gave one Puerto Rican voter a pitch in support of Harris that was tailor-made for Puerto Ricans.

""You know that Trump... didn't help anyone in Puerto Rico when that all happened,"" Rivera said in Spanish to Noreima Paulina, in reference to Hurricane Maria, which caused massive destruction on the island in 2017.

""He threw toilet paper at people, which was a disgrace,"" Rivera told Paulina.

Paulina responded that she understood what she was saying and also felt that Puerto Ricans should be ""respected.""

To Rivera, this was a successful exchange, even though Paulina didn't commit to voting for Harris.

""You see she's undecided but she's still leaning towards us,"" Rivera said later.

Collazo, the Unidos official, said though there is more attention on the state's Latino vote, he hasn't seen that translate into significant investment.

""I think there's been an underinvestment in engaging Latinos,"" he said.

But the Harris campaign recently announced it planned to spend $3 million on Spanish-language radio ads throughout the state.

And Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, recently visited Bethlehem and Allentown -- cities that are part of what is known as the state's ""Latino Corridor,"" along Route 222 North, which also includes Reading.

While in the area Walz also taped an interview with a well-known Latino radio personality, Victor Martinez on La Mega Radio, whose show reaches Latino markets across the corridor.

But Mike Toledo, president and CEO of El Centro Hispano in Reading, said more needs to be done on the ground level to reach these voters, especially in his city.

""There is a huge missed opportunity in central PA,"" he said. ""There are more Latinos along that corridor in central PA than there are Latinos in Philadelphia or Pittsburgh. So, I've been trying to, you know, shout that out, you know, from the mountaintops, 'Hey, you can forget about central PA.'""

Angel Figueroa, a Latino activist in the area, said Democrats should be more focused on these communities.

""You know, typically at this time we would have typical Caribbean-style elections -- caravanas, sound trucks,"" he said. ""You know, everything we think of to have this, this consistency and this and sort of like heading toward a celebration, and that's how Latinos come out to vote.""

Months ago, the Trump campaign set up an office in downtown Reading in a space that used to be used by Democratic campaigns.

Figueroa, who's backing Harris, said consistent community-level engagement is key in getting Latino voters to the polls. But he said that work needs to start soon.

""I'm a little concerned,"" he said. ""It's been a little too quiet ... because Reading and Allentown will determine who's going to be the next president of the United States."""
Pennsylvania leaders in both parties talk ground game as GOP seeks to undo Dem gains: 'Massive shift',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-leaders-talk-very-exciting-ground-game-gop-seeks-undo-dem-gains-a-massive-shift,2024-09-29T08:13:56Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Pennsylvania Republican leaders said they are optimistic about their chances to make the Keystone State the one that puts former President Donald Trump over the finish line, while a top Democrat suggested otherwise, laying out how his party is on a path to victory.

State Sen. Cris Dush, a Brookville Republican, who noted he represents seven of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, was asked about the one big blue swath in his district - Centre County, home to Penn State University.

Dush's district covers all-or-parts-of Jefferson, Elk, Cameron, Centre, Clinton, McKean and Potter counties in Pennsylvania's lush northwestern forests.

With Republican activist Scott Presler targeting Centre as part of his statewide GOP voter registration push, Dush said the prospect of flipping Centre County is ""actually getting very exciting.""

Dush noted neighboring Clinton County, home to Lock Haven, was solidly Democratic until the Trump era. ""They just went over 3-to-1 Republican.""

CRISS-CROSSING PA TO REGISTER VOTERS, SCOTT PRESLER SAYS HE'S MOVING THE NEEDLE TO FLIP KEY COUNTIES RED

""This is a massive shift that's coming in rural Pennsylvania... and part of it is that my working class, middle-age and senior constituents are seeing what's happening to their jobs and with inflation and this craziness,"" he said.

""With a man now being able to be called a woman: that kind of stuff too. They've just finally had enough.""

At a recent fair in his district, Dush said he was heckled by a young Democrat while speaking to a crowd that included many Gen-Z people. Instead of engaging, he told the crowd the reason the man was upset was that he is one of many who cannot afford to own a home, a car or other ""American Dream"" mainstays.

""And I'm getting applause from the kids,"" he remarked.

In several of Dush's redder counties, Democrats like Sen. John Fetterman performed better than most last cycle - while GOP nominee Dr. Mehmet Oz still won the areas outright.

In that regard, Dush was asked if that was an aberration or if the areas are truly trending toward the Democrats.

""The fact that they're putting such restrictions on the development of businesses in the northern tier and western Pennsylvania: There's not a state in the United States that doesn't have a Steelers bar in it, and that's because working-class kids have become our best export. I want them back,"" he said.

Farther east, near the New Jersey border, the Lehigh Valley was once home to a booming steel industry immortalized by Billy Joel's 1981 hit ""Allentown.""

PA TOWN ROILED BY TALK OF MIGRANT HOUSING IN CIVIL-WAR-ERA ORPHANAGE BUILDING

Since then, the area has been through several years of transition after the mills and some shopping districts closed. Slowly, it has regained some footing as a warehousing hub, with its vicinity to New York and Philadelphia.

State Sen. Jarrett Coleman, R-Parkland, represents the western half of the Valley, centered around Lehigh County - where Republicans have come within a razor's edge several times of flipping the congressional seat currently held by Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa.

For many years, the seat was held by anti-Trump moderate Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., and before that, then-Rep. Pat Toomey, and before him, moderate Democrats.

Coleman said he predicts a good year for Republicans in Lehigh County, noting how neighboring Bucks County - part of which he also represents - flipped to majority-GOP registrants through the work of people like Presler.

The economy is a major issue in the district, he noted, as Fox News Digital discussed its industrial past.

""I think that's because I believe the GOP has done a better job connecting with folks over those kitchen table issues,"" Coleman said.

""The one that's kind of come up a lot lately has been homeownership,"" he said.

He noted Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed assistance for homebuyers, while at the same time floating taxation on unrealized gains.

""So on one hand, she'll help you buy the house, and of course, that will just be [via] tax dollars to help subsidize the down payment... then the administration will tax you out of [it] as the house grows in value.""

""That's not a solution. That's another example of the government creating a problem and then trying to swoop in and say they've saved the day.""

In a statement, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Marinella added that the GOP is ""on offense in Pennsylvania.""

""The Keystone State is a deep GOP well of flippable seats and ground zero to grow our House majority,"" he said, adding several vulnerable Democrats running for re-election do not speak truthfully of their records on the border, inflation and crime.

While he believes Philadelphia and Pittsburgh will ""play well"" for Harris, Coleman said he has never seen such enthusiasm for the GOP ticket in areas like the Lehigh Valley and key mid-state areas.

""Can the rural vote come back, and can we make up for the votes of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh -- and will there be enough folks in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia who are waking up? But I think it's going to be a question of whether everywhere else can get motivated enough.""

One man who believed otherwise is Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman Sharif Street.

Street, a state senator and son of popular former Philadelphia Mayor John Street, suggested Democrats are the ones whose ground game has been unmatched.

""We've had over 40,000 volunteers signed up since Kamala became our nominee for president. Vice President Harris has inspired people. We've had we've had people knocking on doors, canvass launches, over 50 offices opened [in PA],"" Street said.

""People are just super excited about supporting Vice President Harris. So yeah, we're seeing lots of energy, lots of engagement, and the vice president has sort of set the world on fire,"" he quipped.

When asked about the candidates appearing to focus in recent weeks on key areas of the state, Street said Harris has been all over the Commonwealth.

When asked about both candidates frequenting Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Street noted there is a key congressional race there between Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., and Republican Rob Bresnahan.

""It's also hometown territory for Senator Casey,"" he added.

When asked about Republicans claiming they are making inroads in Centre, Bucks, Luzerne and the Lehigh Valley, Street said he has not seen such evidence.

He noted that in Centre - the Penn State county - Democrats added a second state representative in Paul Takac, and that Northampton County is now as Democratically-controlled as its bluer-counterpart, Lehigh.

However, Street said that shift may not be because there are more Democrats in those areas, but because the Republicans have departed from their longtime moderation.

He contrasted Trump-type politicians with past Republicans who have performed well statewide, like Sen. Arlen Specter and Gov. Tom Ridge.

Pennsylvanians of both stripes also largely supported moderate Democratic Govs. Ed Rendell and Robert Casey - the incumbent U.S. senator's father, he said.

""Our Republicans and Democrats statewide have never been that far apart from each other. Democrats are still pretty much where we always were,"" Street said.

Fox News Digital also reached out to the Harris campaign for an interview."
"Trump, Harris blasted for ignoring exploding budget deficit, as economists plead with both to 'get real'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-harris-blasted-ignoring-exploding-budget-deficit-economists-plead-both-get-real,2024-09-29T08:13:48Z,"Vice President Harris discusses her tax plan with MSNBC host noting how she rarely directly answers questions.

Economists told Fox News Digital that the economic proposals former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have put forward would continue to increase the nation's already ballooning budget deficit, noting that neither candidate seems particularly concerned with fiscal responsibility.

Neither Trump nor Harris has released dedicated policy plans for addressing the nation's deficit. Trump's 16-point policy plan on his website mentions the word ""deficit"" once.

Meanwhile, Harris' economic platform does mention the deficit several times and says Harris is ""committed"" to fiscal responsibility, but only suggests increasing taxes on the wealthy and corporations as a solution.

""I think the reason neither candidate is really talking about fiscal responsibility is because neither candidate is fiscally responsible,"" said Tax Foundation senior economist Erica York. ""Both have left a lot of details unspecified, so there's questions still about how Harris's spending policies would stack up. Would Trump really repeal all of the green energy tax credits? Would he really impose all of the tariffs he's promised?""

When asked what message York had for Trump and Harris when it comes to the deficit, she told them to ""get real.""

HARRIS CALLS TRUMP 'ONE OF THE BIGGEST LOSERS EVER' DURING ECONOMY SPEECH IN KEY BATTLEGROUND

""We face several challenges on the fiscal policy front, from debt and deficits to the need to compete with China, to the need to encourage entrepreneurship and work, and neither of the tax policy visions being outlined right now really come close to providing an answer to those challenges,"" York said.

Meanwhile, Kimberly Clausing, an economist with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, echoed York's concerns, adding that she ""does not think there's been enough attention on the deficit this campaign season.""

""I don't know whether to blame the candidates or the American attention span,"" Clausing said. ""Candidates have an incentive to cater to what the population wants to listen to, but there doesn't seem to be a big drumbeat in favor of fiscal responsibility. And that's a big contrast from some prior elections in at least my lifetime, where that issue was much more prominent.""

So far, in fiscal year 2024, the government is running a cumulative deficit of $1.9 trillion, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center's ""Deficit Tracker.""

Revenues, meanwhile, have increased 11% through last month. The revenue increase, according to the deficit tracker, is largely the result of an increase in individual and corporate taxes, higher interest rates and a 20% decrease in individual income tax refunds. Trump's economic proposals include extending tax cuts, reducing the corporate tax rate and exempting tips, overtime pay and social security benefits from one's taxable income. Despite his plan to generate revenue through tariffs and repealing green energy tax credits, economists say it will not be enough to balance out the lost revenues from Trump's tax cuts and other economic proposals.

Research from the Tax Foundation, a tax policy nonprofit in the nation's capital, estimated that Trump's deficit impact would be roughly a $4 trillion increase over ten years.

TRUMP, HARRIS SPENDING PLANS COULD WEIGH ON THE US ECONOMY, ANALYSIS SHOWS

However, according to Heritage Foundation economist Richard Stern, it is government spending and not tax cuts that are the real culprit when it comes to the ballooning deficit.

""Though tax cuts can increase the deficit, it returns that money to the people that earned it. Deficit increases from more spending, on the other hand, means that the government is stealing even more and suppressing growth even more intensely,"" Stern said. ""Deficits created by way of tax cuts and spending increases are not the same. Tax cuts grow the economy and shrink deficits as a share of the economy, whereas more spending strangles the economy and stunts growth.""

The Biden-Harris administration's fiscal year 2024 budget proposed the highest sustained levels of spending in U.S. history, according to Republicans on the House Budget Committee. The committee also pointed out that the administration's plan to add $82.2 trillion in spending over ten years, is 18% more than the historical average of the past half century.

Since becoming the Democratic Party's official nominee for president, Harris has said she will provide $25,000 housing subsidies for first-generation home buyers, implement $100 billion in tax credits for the manufacturing sector and increase small business tax credits by tenfold. She has also suggested support for increasing government spending to support families' child care needs, while also expanding the child tax credit, among other proposals.

Overall, the Tax Foundation calculated that Harris would grow the deficit by roughly $1.5 trillion over ten years.

BIDEN PLEDGES $7.3B IN 'CLEAN ENERGY' SPENDING WITH NATIONAL DEBT AT $35T

Among the deleterious downstream effects of an ever-growing deficit, according to Clausing, are increased interest rates and reduced creditworthiness for the country, which can be problematic at a time when global tensions are on edge.

""If a new crisis comes along, whether it's a pandemic or a national security crisis or a big recession, which are sometimes caused by things beyond our control. You know, those kinds of crises are really difficult to respond to without fiscal space,"" Clausing said. ""If you're starting from a point where you're kind of maxing out the credit card, it's a little harder to respond to these emergencies.""

Currently, China and Japan are the United States' two largest foreign creditors.

When reached by Fox News Digital, the Harris campaign declined to comment.

The vice president was endorsed this week by more than 400 left-leaning economists and former policymakers who served under Democrats. Additionally, Andrew Ross Sorkin, a financial columnist with the New York Times, insisted this week that Harris will be able to get much closer to balancing the national budget than Trump.

When it comes to the electorate, voters have usually told pollsters they have more confidence in Trump than Harris when it comes to the economy, but reports have indicated Harris is gaining some of that ground back more recently. Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only five points in a recent Fox News poll, and just two points in an AP/NORC survey.

""Dangerously Liberal Kamala Harris' budget would add $17 trillion to the national debt by 2034 and also includes a $4.9 trillion tax hike -- the largest in history -- which would cost every American family nearly $40,000 per year, on top of the costs of record-high inflation,"" Trump Campaign National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital. ""Thanks to Kamalanomics, families are already struggling to afford gas and groceries, and President Trump will continue to highlight how Harris' budget will compound these difficulties on hardworking Americans."""
Film of motorcade driving JFK to hospital after Dallas shooting sells at auction,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/film-motorcade-driving-jfk-hospital-after-dallas-shooting-sells-auction,2024-09-29T07:12:46Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Newly emerged film video of former President John F. Kennedy's motorcade driving down a freeway in Dallas, Texas, toward a hospital after he was fatally shot on Nov. 22, 1963, sold on Saturday for $137,500 at an auction.

The home film was offered by RR Auction in Boston, Massachusetts, The Associated Press reported. The buyer wishes to remain anonymous, according to the auction house.

The auction house's executive vice president, Bobby Livingston, said in a news release that the film offers ""a gripping sense of urgency and heartbreak.""

The film has been held by the family of Dale Carpenter Sr., the man who recorded it, since the day of the assassination. Carpenter died in 1991 at the age of 77.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

In the footage, Carpenter just misses the limousine carrying the president and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy but records other vehicles in the motorcade driving down Lemmon Avenue toward downtown Dallas. The video then shows that the president has been shot, and captures the motorcade as it races down Interstate 35 towards Parkland Memorial Hospital, where the president was pronounced dead.

The shots were fired as the motorcade passed through Dealey Plaza in front of the Texas School Book Depository, where assassin Lee Harvey Oswald had positioned himself on the sixth floor.

The assassination itself was captured on film by Abraham Zapruder.

Carpenter's footage from I-35 lasts about 10 seconds and shows Secret Service Agent Clint Hill jumping onto the back of the limousine as the shots were fired, hovering in a standing position over the president and first lady.

According to Carpenter's grandson, James Gates, it was known in his family that his grandfather had film from the day of the shooting, but it was not often discussed.

When the film, which had been stored along with other family films in a milk crate, was eventually passed on to him, Gates said he was unsure what his grandfather had captured.

Gates was initially underwhelmed by the footage from Lemmon Avenue when he projected it onto his bedroom wall around 2010 until he observed the footage from I-35.

""That was shocking,"" he said.

The auction house has released still photos from the portion of the film showing the motorcade speeding down I-35, but it is not making video of that part publicly available."
The Intelligent Age: How It Can Accelerate Progress On The SDGs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/worldeconomicforum/2024/09/28/the-intelligent-age-how-it-can-accelerate-progress-on-the-sdgs/,2024-09-29T00:26:52Z,"Mirek Dušek, Managing Director, World Economic Forum

Why the SDGs Are Failing: The Tepid Twenties

With just five full years left to meet the 169 targets of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), progress is - even to the most optimistic - falling far short. Just 17% of the goals are on track, almost one-half show minimal or moderate progress, and one-third are stalling or regressing. To have a real chance at hitting these targets, progress must be dramatically accelerated.

The lack of progress on meeting the SDGs has been exacerbated by economic headwinds worldwide. Global economic growth has failed to restart in any meaningful way since the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a situation that has prompted the International Monetary Fund's Kristalina Georgieva to describe the decade as risking becoming the Tepid Twenties. Following the pandemic, annual productivity growth has plummeted, standing at just 0.4% in advanced economies, 0.8% in emerging economies and a grim 0% in low-income countries.

Entering the Intelligent Age: A Game-Changer for Growth

Historically, technology has offered a path to growth and productivity, and the situation is no different today, albeit with an unprecedented pace of change. In particular, the simultaneous and exponential innovation and deployment of whole sets of interconnected technologies are leading the transition into the Intelligent Age.

The Intelligent Age represents a seismic shift in the drivers of socioeconomic change and growth. It is anchored in deep, multifaceted transformations that emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), the bioeconomy, climate and energy transition-related technologies, quantum, robotics, space and more, are driving within societies, economies and industries.

But this is not simply a technological shift - the Intelligent Age has the potential to far exceed the scope and speed of change of previous industrial revolutions, accelerating progress by transforming many facets of society through the judicious, open and inclusive use of technology to deliver solutions for the people and planet. This is the type of game-changing situation that is required to reverse the current course of the SDGs.

However, the potential of the Intelligent Age is unfolding in an era of heightened fragmentation in which we face societal divides, geo-economic splintering and increasing planetary fragility. These two contradictory forces - one characterized by fragmentation, the other by a technological renaissance - are roughly equal in force, underscoring the need to quickly seize, realize and capitalize on the benefits of the opportunity to build more productive, inclusive and sustainable economies, while minimizing its risks.

Three Ways Technology Can Transform the SDGs

Let me share some concrete examples of how the Intelligent Age could help us achieve progress on the SDGs:

The digital economy indicates how technology can underpin global growth. Although a relatively nascent sector, the value of digitally delivered services has in the past 20 years, grown at more than 8% annually, accounting for more than 15.5% of global GDP. At the same time, digital access is one of the few areas of progress noted in the UN's latest report, increasing globally by approximately 70% between 2015 and 2023 and expanding the market for the digital economy overall.

Another bright spot is the profound impact of green technologies. High levels of investment into technologies like solar panels in the past decade have generated rapid advancements, driving down their price, making them accessible and advancing progress on renewable energy deployment.

With its wide range of applications, AI could play a vital role in unlocking growth. It holds vast economic potential and could add the equivalent of $2.6-$4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. If deployed effectively, it could assist with a wide array of specific issues, including managing scarce resources and optimizing soil productivity, enhancing financial inclusion and literacy, democratizing education and much more.

The Need for Collaboration to Accelerate Progress

To ensure that the new Intelligent Age propels the SDGs forward and helps build sustainable, resilient and inclusive societies, innovation should be open, affordable and accessible to all across the globe. Equal access to new technologies provides an opportunity for emerging economies to leapfrog, giving them the tools to exponentially scale up and democratize innovative solutions, while at the same time valuably contributing to the technological development and ultimately to global growth.

The interconnectivity of the SDGs demands solutions that involve multiple stakeholders and points to the very real need for cooperation and collaboration to address today's challenges. Recognizing such a need, the World Economic Forum is placing collaboration at the heart of its Sustainable Development Impact Meetings, which coincide with the UN high-level week. Here, it is bringing together more than 60 communities of purpose to inclusively tackle key areas of the SDGs.

How to Move From Fragmentation to Flourishing

As world leaders gather in New York, it is critical that we use this moment to find ways to mitigate the drag of fragmentation on the global economy and unlock the full potential of the Intelligent Age. This can accelerate SDG progress by both supporting and boosting overall economic growth and providing technological solutions to specific challenges.

Now is the time to crowd out the Age of Fragmentation and to embrace the opportunities of the Intelligent Age because, if we do, we can realize a more sustainable, equitable and just world."
"World's Best Airline Rewards Programs Of 2024, According To New Report",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonisweet/2024/09/28/worlds-best-airline-rewards-programs-of-2024-according-to-new-report/,2024-09-28T23:19:30Z,"Joining the best airline rewards programs can be a game-changer for travelers looking to unlock extraordinary experiences, score elusive first-class upgrades, and make the most of every trip. But figuring out which program to focus on can be tricky. Each one has its own set of complicated rules and perks, leaving travelers to question whether it's worth the hassle. How do you know which airline rewards program will make it easy to stack up and redeem your hard-earned miles?

A new report on the world's best airline rewards programs from Point.me, a search and booking engine that helps travelers use their points and miles, can point you in the right direction.

Its research team partnered with 55 top points and miles experts to analyze extensive data on 62 global airline rewards programs easily accessible to U.S. travelers. Each one could earn a maximum of 100 points based on nine criteria, including the ease of earning miles, redemption rates, and rewards availability on partner airlines.

Here's what the analysis of the world's best airline rewards program from Point.me revealed.

Air France and KLM's Flying Blue is the world's best airline rewards program of 2024, according to Point.me. It earned a whopping 93.06 out of 100 possible points. To put that into perspective, that's 16 points higher than the score of the second-best airline rewards program, Air Canada's Aeroplan.

Point.me noted that Flying Blue had exceptional performance across the board, earning top marks in nearly every category and offering great redemption rates. The program also allows travelers to transfer points from all of the major credit card points currencies, which makes it easy to earn enough for a reward flight on Air France, KLM, or more than 40 other airline partners.

Air Canada Aeroplan also performed well in the report on the world's best airline rewards programs, earning enough points to clinch second place. While it missed out on some points due to difficulty booking reward flights online and long customer service hold times, the report gave Aeroplan kudos for having wide availability on partner airlines, generous routing rules to make it easy for travelers to use miles outside of Air Canada's hub cities, and lots of points transfer partners.

""Of all the frequent flyer programs in the world, I think Air Canada Aeroplan is the single most valuable for redeeming points,"" said Ben Schlappig, airline loyalty program expert and founder of One Mile at a Time, in the report. ""The pricing is fair and consistent across the board, and the passion of the people running Aeroplan shows in how well-designed and balanced the program is.""

With a score of 72.22 points, United MileagePlus took third place in the ranking of the world's best airline rewards program. Point.me acknowledged that the program has recently received negative attention for devaluing its mileage and increasing the number of miles required to book award flights to certain destinations. However, its overall structure still proved to be among the best for those who aren't loyal to United or don't travel very frequently. It accepts transfer points from Bilt, Chase, and Marriott Bonvoy and makes it easy to earn miles through a variety of partner and co-branded credit cards.

""With the recent introduction of miles pooling, United has made it easier than ever before for families and friends to create priceless memories together. If there is anywhere in the world you wish to visit, chances are strong that your United miles can take you there,"" said Matthew Klint, frequent flyer program expert and founder of Live and Let's Fly, in the report.

Virgin Atlantic Flying Club and British Airways Executive Club tied for fourth place with 69.10 points each. Virgin's airline rewards program had some of the best economy redemption rates of all the programs the researchers evaluated, but had extremely high carrier-imposed fuel surcharges in premium cabins. British Airways Executive Club offers attractive rates on some long-haul flights and offers a very compelling airline-specific credit card, per the report. However, the program was less competitive when booking itineraries that included a connection.

Here's a look at the world's best airline rewards programs of 2024, according to Point.me.

Just because Flying Blue (or any other program) was named one of the best airline rewards programs doesn't necessarily mean it will provide the most value for you. Every traveler's situation and preferences are different -- and your miles may vary.

Here are some factors to consider when choosing the right airline rewards program for you:"
Independent Watches Auction For Preserving Japan's Cultural Heritage,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bhanuchopra/2024/09/28/independent-watches-auction-for-preserving-japans-cultural-heritage/,2024-09-28T19:59:51Z,"In a homage to Japan's profound influence on global horology, Phillips in Association with Bacs & Russo is poised to unveil a groundbreaking thematic auction, Toki: Watch Auction. Scheduled for November 22nd in Hong Kong, this extraordinary event will showcase an array of exceptional timepieces, each a testament to the nation's rich watchmaking legacy and the unwavering passion of its connoisseurs.

As part of this thematic auction, independent watchmakers Hajime Asaoka and Jiro Katayama have created unique pieces to benefit the Noto Charity. In response to the devastating 7.6-magnitude earthquake that struck Japan's Noto Peninsula in January 2024, they have pledged to contribute to the revival of Wajima-nuri, a distinguished example of Japanese lacquerware facing the threat of extinction.

The earthquake wreaked considerable havoc on the local economy and cultural heritage, notably affecting the historic craft of Wajima-nuri. Wajima City, situated within Ishikawa Prefecture, is celebrated for this traditional lacquerware, which has been a cornerstone of the area's cultural identity and economic activity. Tragically, the disaster damaged roughly 80% of the 400 businesses dedicated to this artisan craft, leading to either partial or total destruction of their facilities. This has not only led to economic stagnation but also to a cultural void, given the significance of the craft to the community's heritage.

In a commendable response to this cultural and economic crisis, popular Japanese independent watchmakers Hajime Asaoka and Jiro Katayama have stepped forward. Understanding the gravity of the situation and the risk of losing this invaluable craft to oblivion, they have initiated a charitable effort through their professional platforms. They are offering exclusive timepieces for auction, pledging to donate 100% of the proceeds towards the recovery and revitalization of Wajima-nuri.

Founded in Nagoya in 1899, Takano initially specialized in clockmaking before producing wristwatches from 1957 to 1962. Today, while the Takano trademark is owned by Ricoh Corporation, Hajime Asaoka's company Precision Watch Tokyo Co. has signed a license agreement to revive the brand. The current Chateau Nouvel Chronometer is a testament to this revival, notable for being the first Japanese watch to receive chronometer certification from the Besancon Observatory in France in the 21st century.

For the watch auction, Phillips Watches has partnered with Hajime Asaoka to create a unique piece with a mesmerizing traditional Japanese hue known as ""toki iro"" (the color of the Asian Crested Ibis). This auspicious bird, with feathers reminiscent of a rising sun, symbolizes happiness and good fortune in Japanese culture, making it the perfect choice for the brand's auction debut.

As part of this noble initiative, the auction will feature a one-of-a-kind piece crafted by independent watchmaker Jiro Katayama, known for his ""Otsuka Lotec"" brand. Inspired by mid-20th century industrial aesthetics, the present No.6 timepiece, named ""SHINONOME"" (referring to the sky just before dawn), boasts a striking semi-skeletonized dial and a blackened stainless-steel case.

With imaginative engineering and scrupulous finishing, this analog-inspired timepiece revives mid-century aesthetics within a refined contemporary frame. Currently available exclusively in Japan, this auction presents a rare opportunity for collectors worldwide to acquire a unique piece made by Mr. Katayama.

Kurono Tokyo's ""Grand"" series pays homage to traditional Asian craftsmanship with its incredible Urushi lacquered dials. This ancient lacquer technique utilizes the filtered sap of the lacquer tree, a miraculous substance that absorbs moisture from the air as it hardens, resulting in a perpetually shiny and slick surface. The present Grand Niji ""虹"" is a unique piece made for the watch auction, elegantly crafted in 18K pink gold.

The dial is a marvel to behold, featuring layers of rainbow-colored Urushi crafted by Megumi Shimamoto, who has previously worked on Kurono's Urushi dials. Over time, the Urushi dial may change color, creating a unique piece of its own, a testament to the living nature of this traditional Japanese art form."
"Yes, The US Trade Deficit Is A Problem. But Not For The Reason You Think.",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesbroughel/2024/09/28/yes-the-us-trade-deficit-is-a-problem-but-not-for-the-reason-you-think/,2024-09-28T18:30:24Z,"A debate over US trade deficits has been raging online, especially in the wake of the ongoing discourse about tariffs. Much of the conversation has focused on whether tariffs are a suitable tool for managing trade imbalances, with notable contributions from commentators like Oren Cass. In a recent article for The Atlantic, Cass defended tariffs on the grounds that unquantified benefits from domestic production justify some form of protectionism -- a position that, he argues, addresses market failures often overlooked by mainstream economists. While I disagree with Cass's conclusion, there is more to his argument than meets the eye, and many of his critics have gone off on tangents that miss the broader issue.

One of the most prominent -- and, frankly, distracting -- threads of criticism concerns the way MAGA advocates and others interpret the national income accounts. Many on social media have argued that protectionist supporters are making a mistake by believing that tariffs can boost GDP simply by reducing imports. It's true that imports are subtracted from GDP, but this subtraction is merely an accounting adjustment to avoid double counting, as GDP accounts for domestic production only and some government spending, investment and consumption expenditures are spent on goods and services produced abroad. Taxing imports with tariffs will therefore not miraculously lead to higher GDP.

But focusing solely on this logical error (which may or may not be influential among MAGA proponents) is not a sufficient rebuttal to the real issues with the US trade deficit. In fact, many online commentators ignore a key problem at the heart of the debate, namely that the persistence of the US trade deficit is symptomatic of deeper structural issues in the economy. These issues are not easily remedied by tariffs, yet still deserve serious attention. In a way, MAGA supporters and Cass have a point: trade deficits can indeed be a problem. The critical question is why.

The Trade Deficit: Borrowing to Consume

A trade deficit, at its core, means that a country is importing more goods and services than it is exporting, effectively spending more than it is earning. From a national accounting perspective, this is akin to a household spending beyond its income. Imagine earning $100,000 a year while spending $120,000. The gap between income and spending must be financed through borrowing or by depleting savings.

There is nothing inherently wrong with borrowing. In many instances, borrowing can be productive. Consider a business owner who takes out a loan to buy new equipment that boosts productivity, leading to higher future income. Similarly, there have been times in the history of the United States when borrowing has led to significant economic growth. However, the current nature of US borrowing is less encouraging. When borrowing is used for consumption -- analogous to taking out a loan for a vacation rather than investing in education or business expansion -- it becomes problematic. The vacation offers no future return, so the loan must be repaid through other sources of income.

This is where the US runs into trouble. The trade deficit is essentially the flip side of the financial account surplus. This means that foreign capital is flowing into the United States, largely in the form of investments in US Treasury bonds and other financial assets. These funds are used to finance federal government spending, which usually exceeds revenue, leading to large budget deficits. The trade deficit and the budget deficit are related -- economists call this a ""twin deficit.""

The nature of these twin deficits in this particular instance is that the US is borrowing not to invest in future growth but, in large part, to fund current consumption, much of which is driven by federal spending. This is the ""bad"" kind of borrowing, similar to borrowing for a vacation, and it underscores an underlying vulnerability in the US economy.

Why Tariffs Don't Work

Given these dynamics, it's tempting for policymakers to reach for simple, seemingly intuitive solutions -- such as tariffs. The rationale is straightforward: if the country has a large trade deficit, simply make imports more expensive and reduce the volume. But this approach misses the bigger picture.

The evidence is clear that tariffs are not an effective means of reducing trade deficits. During the Trump administration, substantial tariffs were placed on a wide range of imported goods, with the explicit goal of reducing the trade imbalance. Yet, instead of shrinking, the trade deficit expanded. Part of this was due to the underlying macroeconomic environment, which included a significant increase in government spending and corresponding budget deficits. Tariffs may have reduced imports in certain sectors, but they did nothing to address the broader economic forces that were driving the trade deficit. In fact, tariffs often lead to retaliation, reducing exports, and ultimately worsening the balance of trade.

This points to a fundamental truth: trade deficits are not just about trade policy. They are about the broader economic context, particularly fiscal policy. As long as the US continues to run large budget deficits, financed in part by foreign capital, the trade deficit is unlikely to shrink in a meaningful way.

What's the Solution?

If tariffs aren't the answer, what can be done about the trade deficit? The most effective solution would be to address the root cause: excessive government spending. By reducing the budget deficit, the need for foreign capital inflows would diminish, and the trade deficit would likely follow. However, cutting government spending is easier said than done, especially in a political environment where both parties have shown a preference for fiscal expansion.

Another potential solution is to change the way foreign capital is utilized. Currently, much of the foreign capital flowing into the United States ends up in Treasury bonds, effectively financing government consumption. An alternative approach would be to channel these funds into productive investments. For example, the US could establish a sovereign wealth fund that invests capital in assets abroad, similar to the approach taken by countries like Norway. This would help ensure that the inflows are not only converted into outflows, but also used in a way that contributes to future income, rather than merely funding current consumption.

The Need for Nuance

The debate over trade deficits and tariffs is often framed in simplistic, binary terms: either trade deficits are harmless, or they are disastrous and must be addressed with protectionist measures. The reality is more complex. The MAGA movement is right to point out that persistent trade deficits can be a problem, but wrong in thinking that tariffs are the solution. Critics of this view, on the other hand, are wrong to dismiss the issue entirely, failing to recognize the broader macroeconomic imbalances at play.

What is needed is a more subtle understanding of the current U.S. trade deficit -- one that recognizes it as a symptom of deeper fiscal imbalances rather than a problem that can be solved through trade policy alone. Addressing the trade deficit will require addressing the budget deficit, reducing excessive consumption, and finding ways to channel foreign capital into productive investments. Until then, we are likely to see the same mistakes repeated, with neither side of the debate fully grappling with the real issues at hand."
Iran's options dwindle as it prepares retaliation for death of Nasrallah,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/irans-options-dwindle-prepares-retaliation-death-nasrallah,2024-09-28T16:23:34Z,"Fox News' Nate Foy discusses the latest as Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has been confirmed dead following an Israeli strike.

As the death of Hezbollah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah is confirmed, the immediate question is not whether Iran will respond, but how.

Hezbollah is a creation of the Islamic Republic, built on decades of effort, and billions of dollars of support. Formed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in 1982, Hezbollah remains the regime's primary proxy.

ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS HEZBOLLAH LEADER HASSAN NASRALLAH KILLED IN BEIRUT STRIKE

The relationship between Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and Hezbollah's secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, was almost familial - akin to that of father and son. But Nasrallah's recent missteps, including intelligence failures and the assassinations of senior commanders, had left Khamenei to manage the fallout. His death now compounds that.

Iran's leadership cannot simply sit back while Hezbollah endures these levels of humiliation and harm. To do so would not only result in the weakening or loss of its most important proxy, but could signal the start of the unraveling of its entire regional strategy of eradicating the state of Israel, empowering Islamist groups, and expelling U.S. forces from the Middle East.

Given that this unraveling cannot be allowed, Khamenei and his regime have three options to consider.

Iran's leadership cannot simply sit back while Hezbollah endures these levels of humiliation and harm.

First, provide logistical advisory and propaganda support, as in 2006, the last time there was a direct war between Hezbollah and Israel. Ismail Qaani, the commander of the IRGC's Quds Force - specialists in unconventional warfare and military intelligence - and his team, would be dispatched to what is now left of Hezbollah's underground war rooms to command and control the Iranian proxy's militants, just as Qaani's predecessor, the late Qassem Soleimani, did almost two decades ago. This time, Qaani would also coordinate proxy attacks against Israel from Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, although unlike in 2006, it is doubtful that it will change the mindset of a post-October 7 Israeli government whose actions in recent weeks have hit Hezbollah hard.

The second option is to escalate the conflict via its proxies to set the region on fire. Based on the idea of escalating to de-escalate, this means that the IRGC and its proxies will target the interests of the U.S., Europe, and Arab states in the Middle East in the hope of triggering external pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to back down. Targets would include oil refineries, commercial shipping, and Western military positions across the region.

Beyond the Middle East, the IRGC would double down on its attempts to wage a campaign of terror against the international Jewish community. They did this in the 2010s in Thailand, India, Cyprus, and Bulgaria and, since October 7, Mossad has reportedly thwarted over 50 Iran-backed attacks against Jews abroad. The regime may calculate that targeting Jewish civilians overseas could be enough to cause a reaction that could force Netanyahu's hand.

The third option is to target Israel with direct strikes. This would certainly satisfy the IRGC and its proxies' most radical constituencies, already critical of Tehran's reluctance to hit Tel Aviv directly. New intelligence from Israel and the U.S. has suggested that Hezbollah has urged Iran to intervene directly, but if Khamenei and the IRGC opt for direct attacks, they would need to be far more significant than the symbolic strikes of April this year. Whether the IRGC can penetrate Israel's defense systems is another matter, but direct retaliation from Israel against IRGC positions in Iran would be almost certain and is an outcome the regime wants to avoid.

Which way will the ayatollah's thumb point? The IRGC's asymmetric doctrine and military infrastructure suggests that the likeliest scenario is a combination of the first two options: providing logistical support while destabilizing and causing chaos in the region and beyond.

However, as Khamenei weighs his options, he does so against a background of economic crises and a deeply unhappy population. Any weakening of Iran's economy - including hits to its crippling $500 billion infrastructure deficit - could stoke further rage among Iranians against their deeply unpopular rulers. Knocks to the regime are welcomed by many domestically, as evidenced by recent reactions to the assassination of senior IRGC commanders, and further dissent arising from bad foreign policy choices could spark further internal protests and heap pressure on the supreme leader.

A combination of the domestic and international pressure that would undoubtedly come with a strategy of destabilization and chaos - particularly under a Donald Trump presidency - could cost the Ayatollah and his regime dearly. With Nasrallah already lost, no matter which path he chooses, Khamenei stands to lose even more."
10 Years Of KPMG's CEO Outlook Report Show Changed Feelings On Talent,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lindsaykohler/2024/09/28/10-years-of-kpmgs-ceo-outlook-report-show-changed-feelings-on-talent/,2024-09-28T11:30:23Z,"The statistic from KPMG's 2024 CEO Outlook report making the social media rounds is that 83% of CEOs expect a full return to the office over the next 3 years, up from just 63% in 2023. That widely reported statistic may have drowned out other key findings from the report; namely, CEOs have a lot of optimism regarding both their company and economic growth prospects. To fuel that growth, they know they have to have a keen focus on talent.

""One of the things that stood out to me in the report is that CEOs are concerned about a shifting labor market,"" says Nhlamu Dlomu, global head of people at KPMG International. ""They wonder if they will have enough skilled people. They've got experienced people ready to retire, so they need to diversify their talent pool appropriately."" Whether it's the impact of generative AI, retirees wanting to stay involved in work part-time, or Gen Z questioning the current work system and structure, companies need to get ahead on their talent strategy. ""It's not easy, but we will need to experiment with different models and diversify the way we've been thinking about our talent,"" says Dlomu.

Companies know this. According to the report, 92% of CEOs expect their headcount to increase over the next three years. But to do that means businesses have to be intentional in who and how they recruit, and they have to treat their people well regardless of the economy or job market. ""It's tempting to ignore the important retention drivers when there is talent availability and businesses feel like they are in the driver's seat,"" says Dlomu. She's right; we're in a climate of businesses behaving badly because they currently hold more bargaining power. When that shifts, those who chose not to treat their people well will miss out on growth opportunities because top talent will leave.

Speaking of growth, 75% of CEOs are confident in the future of their company, and 70% are confident in the global economy. But looking at that trend over time is illuminating. ""Our findings on confidence in the growth prospects of the global economy over the next three years are quite interesting this year,"" says Regina Mayor, global head of clients & markets at KPMG International. ""Nearly three-quarters of CEOs told us they remain optimistic, which is a pretty solid figure, but if you compare it to our first ever CEO Outlook survey back in 2015, when the figure was 93%, you can see that there's been a steady decline in confidence, mirroring the growing uncertainty in the world right now.""

Mayor expands on the point. ""While the statistic might be on a downward trend, the fact that so many senior execs remain optimistic, I believe, is a sign of their resilience and agility.""

Talent is one key factor fueling this optimistic view on growth. In fact, the importance of the employee value proposition was identified as the number two priority to drive growth, and 63% say a lack of the right talent will negatively impact their organization's growth over the next three years. ""It's about providing a deal that you are proud of and that you maintain,"" says Dlomu. This begs the question of if the focus on talent has changed since the first report came out 10 years ago. ""CEOs have always valued their talent, but whether the conversation has been happening in the board room as much is what the question is,"" says Dlomu. She acknowledges that the pandemic accelerated this change, ""but it's also highlighted the need to put the talent conversation right in the center of the boardroom conversation.""

Another factor in retaining talent that Dlomu calls out is internal training. ""CEOs are talking about the concern that they'll have their most experienced people leave -- and they aren't sure they'll have the right talent. A more thoughtful and intentional medium and long-term plan about how you provide upskilling opportunities for your people given business aspirations is needed.""

What are the perils of getting your talent strategy wrong? ""The first one is reputation. We become attractive or unattractive to people based on how we manage our talent,"" says Dlomu. ""Another risk is high employee turnover. Of course, we can replace talent, but it's quite expensive. The cost and reputational risks of getting this wrong are high."""
Woman caught smuggling more than 700 pounds of bologna at southern border: CBP,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/woman-caught-smuggling-more-than-700-pounds-bologna-southern-border-cbp,2024-09-28T09:25:08Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

A woman was busted in Presidio, Texas, for smuggling more than 700 pounds of prohibited Mexican bologna and more than 280 boxes of undeclared prescription medications through the Southern Border.

The suspect, a 43-year-old U.S. citizen, was caught at about 4 p.m. on Monday at the Presidio Port of Entry, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

She was arriving from Mexico driving a 2023 GMC Yukon when she was stopped, and she declared only a cooked meal during the initial inspection, CBP said.

CBP agriculture specialists initiated a secondary inspection and discovered several suitcases in the vehicle that appeared heavier than expected.

OVER 13K IMMIGRANTS CONVICTED OF MURDER HAVE BEEN RELEASED INTO US

The specialists opened a suitcase and found several rolls of Mexican bologna inside. A total of 40 rolls were found in the suitcases, which ended up as 748 pounds of the illegal meat.

Mexican bologna is prohibited because it is made from pork and could bring foreign animal diseases to the U.S. pork industry, CBP said.

""We stress that it is important that travelers educate themselves on what products are allowed to be legally entered from abroad,"" CBP Presidio Port Director Benito Reyes, Jr. said in a statement. ""And even if they believe an item is allowed travelers should still declare all items they are transporting to the U.S. to avoid fines and penalties.""

""The concern with pork products is that they have the potential to introduce foreign animal diseases that can have devastating effects to the U.S. economy and to our agriculture industry,"" he continued.

More than 280 boxes of undeclared medication were also found hidden inside various panels of the vehicle. These medications include Tramadol, which is a schedule IV controlled substance, as well as Fentermina, Alprazolam, Clonazapam, Diazapam, Farmapram, Ampigran and Sulfamethoxazole.

The bologna was seized and destroyed by the CBP agriculture specialists.

Markets May Start To Focus More On Trade,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2024/09/28/markets-may-start-to-focus-more-on-trade/,2024-09-28T07:24:05Z,"The Boston Tea Party is an early example of how a trade dispute can reshape an economy (Boston) and foment political change. It is iconic enough that the first presidency of Donald Trump was prefigured by the rise of the Tea Party as a disruptive force in Republican politics.

With the presidential election not far off now, tariffs form the spear-end of Donald Trump's economic strategy, potentially because he can implement them unilaterally (without the approval of the Senate). In addition, many of his acolytes, from Robert Lighthizer to Peter Navarro, are 'trade' obsessed, and have recently published books like 'No Trade is Free' to underline the ways in which they would re-order the international trade system.

In addition, other members of the Trump entourage such as Robert O'Brien, the National Security Adviser (2019-21) has in the July edition of Foreign Affairs Journal invoked the idea that American can bring peace to a disordered world through 'strength'. In this vision, strength comes in the form of 60% tariffs on Chinese goods and export controls, a message that has repeatedly been emphasised by Trump himself.

In that context, a second Trump presidency could begin with a trade war, and a verbal assault on the currencies of ostensible allies that have weakened in recent years, such as the yen. American consumers and potentially the bond market might pay the price of tariffs (we wrote last week that Trump wanted to fund the development of a sovereign wealth fund with revenues from tariffs).

Trade wars are generally not successful, and while Trump may have in mind America's trade spats with Japan (1987), the weight of past trade disputes going back to the Smooth Hawley Act suggest that there are better ways to guard American economic power. China could respond with measures that cripple supply chains for at least a couple of years. In this scenario, a trade confrontation between the US and China would decisively shatter the axis of globalisation as we know it, and finally render the WTO (World Trade Organisation) obsolete.

A US-China trade war might have many other consequences.

One might be the rise of populous south Asian (and southeast Asian) from India to Bangladesh to Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, with Singapore as their organising locus. Many of these countries are urbanising and rolling out infrastructure, most of them need but distrust China, and in most cases aspire to closer commercial ties to the USA. Tariffs on China by the USA will accelerate supply chain de-risking by Western multinationals towards these countries, though this could well complicate their relationship with China.

A second consideration is Europe. The EU has been caught by surprise by the consequences of several Biden administration policies - the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act - which illustrates that US international trade policy is usually made with a view to domestic politics. A second Trump presidency should be no surprise to Brussels, and there is a small but important team of officials working on a policy response to a potential trade war on Europe by Trump. Europe's trump card may lie in its role as a partner with the US against China. It will be difficult for Washington to reshape trade relations with China, Europe and potentially Japan by taking each one on. Stymieing China is better done in collaboration with Japan and Europe, and Trump should really see the constraints of the policy situation that faces him.

A second Trump presidency will be different to the first in the sense that he has had time to prepare for it, and crucially, his supporters have had four years to concoct a policy strategy ('2025' seems to have dropped out of headlines). In the same way, a Harris presidency comes with deeper reserves of policy experts, and to a large sense on the international trade and economic outlook, the Harris case represents 'more of the same' in terms of the techn0-strategic economic policy that is currently pursued by the White House.

An idealised, and though I like the idea a lot, too lofty rendition of this policy is Walter Russell's Mead's September Foreign Affairs essay entitled 'The Return of Hamiltonian Statecraft' which argues for the notion of 'enlightened patriotism'.

In this context, a Harris White House would use trade and investment policy to laser focus on America's race with China for global supremacy. Driving Chinese economic and investment activity further inwards might be one goal, and ironically anything Washington can do to make Chinese public life more closed and repressive, the better (because it curbs innovation and wealth creation).

At the same time, the US and Europe, would both pursue parallel strategies of 'strategic autonomy' or what Trump refers to as 'strategic national manufacturing' focused on sectors like defence, new computing power (quantum, AI, data storage and management), batteries and new power sources and revolutionary medicine. Europe's challenge is to find a way of reducing long-term energy costs.

Kamala Harris, who has trialled a few incoherent policies (taxes on unrealised capital gains, price controls) is likely to be more constrained in her fiscal policy - because her government is likely to instinctively focus more on tax and spending changes, for which she will need the help of the Senate (which in turn could tilt towards the Republicans). As such her fiscal policy will focus on not increasing the national debt, and like many other governments, encouraging the private sector to work with government to build out strategic technologies.

I am so far surprised that markets do not seem to price in uncertainty over trade policy, possibly because they are more focused on falling interest rates in the US, Europe and China. However, the next month will start to reveal how seriously financial markets take economic rhetoric of each of the presidential candidates."
"VP Harris outlines 'orderly and secure' immigration plan, rips Trump in first border stop since nomination",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vp-harris-outlines-orderly-secure-immigration-plan-rips-trump-first-border-stop-since-nomination,2024-09-28T01:47:40Z,"DOUGLAS, Ariz. -- Vice President Harris made her first appearance Friday at the southern border since becoming the Democratic nominee for president, and delivered a speech pledging to crack down on illegal immigration while blasting former President Trump.

""Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from reentering for five years,"" Harris told an enthusiastic crowd inside the gymnasium of the Cochise County College Douglas Campus located roughly two miles from the southern border.

""We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators and if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States. Our system must be orderly and secure.""

HARRIS VISITS CRUCIAL BORDER STATE AS IMMIGRATION RECORD SPARKS SCRUTINY: A TIMELINE

Harris, who touted her record as a border state attorney general, claimed that Trump ""tanked"" the ""strongest border security bill we have seen in decades"" earlier this year and argued that if it were law today, it would be producing ""results"" for the country.

""It is my pledge to you that as President of the United States I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law,"" she said.

Harris also pledged to ""understand how solutions get formed"" and to ""reach across the aisle and I will embrace common sense approaches and new techniques to get the job done.""

""Because I know transnational gangs coming across the border, trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings could[n't] care less who somebody voted for in the last election,"" she said.

Harris added, ""I will surge support to law enforcement agencies on the front lines, more personnel, more training and more technology, including 100 new inspection systems that can detect fentanyl hidden in vehicles.""

Fentanyl was a common message in Harris' speech, which she delivered after being introduced by Theresa Guerrero, whose son, Jacob, was killed by fentanyl poisoning at age 31.

""We will make sure that our ports of entry, including airports and seaports, have additional state-of-the-art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it,"" Harris said. ""I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels.""

Harris added, ""The United States is a sovereign nation, and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them. And I take that responsibility very seriously. We are also a nation of immigrants. The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story.""

MARK CUBAN SPARS WITH RILEY GAINES OVER HARRIS' HANDLING OF THE BORDER CRISIS

Harris claimed during her speech that Trump did ""nothing"" to fix our ""broken immigration"" system during his four years as president.

""He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges,"" Harris said. ""He did not solve the shortage of border agents. He did not create lawful pathways into our nation. He did nothing to address an outdated asylum system and did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what clearly is also a regional challenge.

""He separated families. He ripped toddlers out of their mothers arms, put children in cages, and tried to end protections for Dreamers. He made the challenges at the border worse. And he is still. And he is still fanning the flames of fear and division. And let me be clear, that is not the work of a leader. That is not the work of a leader. And that is, in fact, I think we all believe an abdication of leadership.""

Harris signaled that she will find a pathway to citizenship for ""Dreamers"" who she said are ""American in every way.""

Harris told the crowd she will work with Democrats and Republicans to fix the border issue and said she rejects the ""false choice"" between securing the border and ""creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly, and humane.""

""We can, and we must do both. We must do both.""

Shortly before the speech, Harris walked the southern border with two border patrol officials who the White House says briefed her on ""their efforts to combat traffickers and transnational criminal organizations.""

Following that briefing, Harris traveled by motorcade to the Raul H. Castro Port of Entry in Douglas where she was briefed on efforts to stem the flow of fentanyl at the border.

Harris' speech outlining how she will tackle illegal immigration comes under the backdrop of millions of illegal immigrants overwhelming the southern border during her tenure as vice president, which has sparked frequent criticism from Trump, Republicans, and the Border Patrol union.

""After years of not just ignoring the problem, but helping create it, Vice President Kamala is finally headed down to the border,"" the National Border Patrol Council said in a statement leading up to Harris' visit. ""This is nothing more than for her to check the box, but what it is in reality, is a slap in the face towards the men and women that put their lives on the line every day, and also a slap in the face to the American public. Where has she been?""

BORDER-DISTRICT REPUBLICANS HAMMER HARRIS, DEMAND 'AN APOLOGY' OVER 'PHOTO OP' CAMPAIGN STOP IN ARIZONA

Fox News Digital reported earlier this year that at least 7.2 million illegal immigrants entered the United States under President Biden, an amount greater than the populations of 36 states.

Harris faced criticism just hours before her speech after Immigration and Customs Enforcement released data showing that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants with sex offenses and homicide convictions are currently loose on the streets in the U.S.

Fox News polling released this week showed Trump with a 3 point lead in Arizona after Harris was in the lead by a point last month.

The 3-point shift among registered voters is mainly due to movement among young voters, women and Hispanics.

Polling has also shown that the vast majority of Americans believe the southern border is a ""problem"" after almost four years of the Biden-Harris administration and recent Fox News polling shows Americans trust Trump on the economy over Harris by 10 points."
Wimbledon Expansion Receives Grand Slam Game Changing Approval,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/timellis/2024/09/27/wimbledon-expansion-receives-grand-slam-game-changing-approval/,2024-09-28T00:29:13Z,"The All England Club have been granted permission to build 39 new courts, including a new 8,000 seater show court, on the site of the former Wimbledon Park Golf Club that sits across the road from the current Grand Slam grounds in SW19. After three hours of heated discussion at London's City Hall, Wimbledon now has the go-ahead to almost triple in size.

The battle between supporters and objectors has revolved around economic, environmental and community benefits. The endgame could still be fought through a judicial review, although Friday's development has cleared some significant hurdles for the AELTC. CEO Sally Bolton outlined the advantages of a three-week Wimbledon tournament on one site, opening up closer access to the players for fans while improving facilities for players.

""These plans for the site of a former private golf course will bring significant benefits to the local area, the wider capital and the UK economy, providing increased access to open green space and sport, new parkland and a host of new jobs,"" said Jules Pipe, the deputy mayor who passed the project after a fractious few hours on the south bank of the River Thames.

""Hosting qualifying events on the same site as the Championships will put Wimbledon on a global footing with other Grand Slam tournaments and ensure it remains one of the world's top sporting events"" he continued. Pipe was making the final call as the Mayor, Sadiq Khan, had already withdrawn from the process having declared positive backing for the scheme previously.

This landmark decision has been three years in the making since the AELTC proposed the original plan in 2021. Angela Rayner, the Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, had already dropped a holding notice on Friday morning meaning that she would not be calling in the proposals. The obstacles for the AELTC will now come through purely legal challenges.

There was a general expectation that the AELTC would get the nod for approval, especially in the light of the Greater London Authority's verdict on 19 September which found that were ""no material considerations that are considered to justify the refusal of consent"". The GLA report acknowledged that there would be a loss of open space and harm to Open Metropolitan Land but this was more than counterbalanced by the significant benefits, such as $450 million of annual benefits and job creation.

Deborah Jeavons, the Chair of the All England Club, was keen to highlight the positive overall benefits of the decision: ""Our proposals will deliver 27 acres of newly accessible parkland for the community and enable us to bring the Qualifying Competition for The Championships onsite, with all of the substantial economic and employment opportunities this presents. Every stage of this project will be delivered with a meticulous attention to detail and the utmost respect for both our neighbors and the environment,"" she said.

This didn't salve the ire of the campaigners and those who are not convinced by the sustainability claims of the proposals. The campaign group Save Wimbledon Park have rejected many aspects of the GLA's report, saying it has ""shallow and poorly thought-out planning analysis, "" CPRE London, the countryside charity working for greener cities tweeted views that summarized the major reservations by campaign groups: ""A park gone forever. Unrecognisable. The public's rights completely ignored, the natural surface ripped out, replaced with engineered surface, roads, pathways and buildings; heritage and trees trashed.""

The application had reached City Hall after Merton -where the vast majority of the designated development and the existing tennis complex lies - accepted the plans but the neighboring Wandsworth Council rejected it, citing ""the loss of green open space at Wimbledon Park and the loss of mature trees that was at the heart of this application.""

Opponents have argued that there will be a loss of about 300 mature trees with a negative effect on the local habitat and nature. However, Alison King, a landscape architect engaged by the AELTC, stated that the most mature tress would be preserved while only 300 out of 1,000 trees would be removed, and most of those being of a lower-grade category.

The MP for Wimbledon, Paul Kohler, wrote a letter to the deputy mayor just before the decision was announced, reminding him that when Merton Council sold the freehold of the Wimbledon Golf Club site to the AELTC both parties gave assurances they would not build on the land. Christopher Coombe from the Save Wimbledon Park group added: ""Approval at this stage would be really shocking. The land has been protected forever.""

The All England Club has previously stated that ""a mix of the special and unique cultural, sporting and socioeconomic interest and value of the AELTC and The Championships"" would provide the special circumstances to build on protected land. Should legal challenges fail to reverse the current schedule, completion is expected in 2030 with an increase of capacity from 42,000 to 50,000."
MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle defends Harris' non-answers in solo interview: 'She's a politician',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbcs-stephanie-ruhle-defends-harris-non-answers-solo-interview-shes-politician,2024-09-27T23:37:33Z,"MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle excused Vice President Kamala Harris for repeatedly dodging questions Friday, arguing she is just like any other politician.

After months of being criticized for a lack of unscripted media appearances, Harris did a solo interview with Ruhle on MSNBC on Wednesday. The interview was slammed by a variety of sources, including the New York Times, which said, ""Ms. Harris responded to the fairly basic and predictable questions with roundabout responses that did not provide a substantive answer.""

Ruhle defended her interview and Harris' performance in it when she appeared on ""Morning Joe.""

""Obviously, for anybody who watched the interview I did with Vice President Harris, we sat down for 25 minutes and we talked about one single topic: the economy,"" she said. ""It is the number one issue for voters.""

MSNBC HOST DEFENDS HARRIS AVOIDING POLICY QUESTIONS: SHE'S 'NOT RUNNING FOR PERFECT'

""I think it's hugely important, and it's a vulnerability for both candidates, but it's really tricky, Joe, because, you know, you obviously want to cover all of these topics, but to just do it with one candidate, it's hard, because many people feel like she's speaking in platitudes,"" Ruhle said. ""She's speaking about an economic vision, and she's not giving details - She's got an 80-page detailed policy proposal.""

While she admitted Harris is dodging questions with ""platitudes,"" Ruhle explained it away as simply being the typical behavior of a politician.

""And do I think that she answers every single question and gives people exactly what they want? She doesn't. You know why? Because she's a politician, and none of them do. They all speak in platitudes,"" she said.

Ruhle also criticized former President Trump, and expressed shock that he is favored over the Biden-Harris administration's economic record.

KAMALA HARRIS CONFRONTED ON NOT EARNING TEAMSTERS ENDORSEMENT: 'WHAT WAS THEIR REASONING?'

""She needs to solve for why he still polls better on economic issues with voters, because that, to me, is mind-boggling,"" she said.

Ruhle likewise threw down the gauntlet for Trump to do an interview with her as well, ""If Donald Trump would like to sit down and have that same conversation, I'm ready for you."""
"Fox News Poll: Harris, Trump in close race in North Carolina",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-harris-trump-close-race-north-carolina,2024-09-27T22:07:39Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Harris has a 2 percentage-point edge over former President Trump in the latest Fox News survey of North Carolina registered voters (50% Harris, 48% Trump). Last month, Trump was ahead by 1 point (50% to 49%), for a 3-point shift in the presidential race.

Among likely voters, the race flips with Trump on top by just a single point, 50% to 49%.

When third-party candidates are included, Harris is up 1 point among registered voters (3% support third party), while Trump is up 2 points among likely voters (3% to others).

NORTH CAROLINA GOP FOCUSING ON 'HAND-TO-HAND POLITICAL COMBAT' TO RAMP UP GROUND GAME IN BATTLEGROUND STATE

The results among both registered and likely voters are within the margin of error.

Harris's strongest support comes from Black voters, urban voters, and college-educated women, while for Trump it is Whites without a college degree (particularly men without degrees), rural voters, and White evangelicals.

Most Democrats (98%) and Republicans (96%) back their party's candidate, while the small group of independents favors Harris by 7 points.

Slightly more Harris supporters (92%) than Trump supporters (89%) are certain of their choice.

Harris is viewed more positively than Trump among Tar Heel voters -- 50% have a favorable view of her vs. 49% unfavorable for a +1 net positive rating. Trump's rating is negative by 7 points (46% favorable, 53% unfavorable).

Just 30% say the economy is in either excellent (7%) or good (23%) condition, while another 70% say either fair (30%) or poor (40%). This negativity is a far cry from November 2019 (late into Trump's term as president) when 54% were positive and 44% negative.

By 7 points, voters are more likely to think Trump can better handle the economy and about the same number give him the edge on making the country safe (+6). He does best on immigration and border security, where he leads Harris by 15 points, down from a 19-point lead in August.

4 MARK ROBINSON CAMPAIGN STAFFERS RESIGN IN WAKE OF REPORT ON PORN WEBSITE POSTS

Harris does best on the issue of abortion, where she is preferred by 16 points. Voters also give her the edge on helping the middle class (+7), protecting democracy (+6), and fighting for people like you (+5).

The candidates tie on who can bring needed change.

""The race here will be close, but Trump still holds the edge on the issues that matter most to North Carolina voters,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""So long as they think Trump is more likely to make the country more prosperous and safer, he's the odds-on favorite.""

At least 8 in 10 Black voters think Harris is better equipped to handle these issues and actions, except when it comes to immigration, where Trump eats into Harris' lead with 25% saying he would better handle immigration vs. 73% for Harris.

The survey also finds the gap in the gubernatorial race in North Carolina has widened. Democrat Josh Stein (56%) has a 16-point lead over Republican Mark Robinson (40%), a 5-point increase since last month (54% Stein, 43% Robinson).

The survey was conducted after news of alleged inflammatory comments Robinson made on a porn website.

""It is unlikely the toxic nature of the Republican gubernatorial candidate will cause Trump voters to switch to Harris, but it could affect turnout,"" says Anderson. ""It complicates things for the Trump campaign to have to actively avoid the GOP candidate, and there could be some Trump-leaning independents who are so turned off by Robinson they decide it's not worth voting.""

Trump endorsed Robinson in March but has yet to comment on whether he'll pull his support.

Some 14% of Stein supporters split their ticket and back Trump in the presidential race, while just 4% of Robinson supporters back Harris.

A few more things...

-- By 17 points, those who say they will vote early in North Carolina back Harris. Among the smaller group of Election Day voters, Trump leads by 20 points.

--The views of the vice-presidential candidates play out the same as the presidential, with Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz receiving a net positive rating of 5 (46% favorable vs. 41% unfavorable) and Ohio Republican Sen. JD Vance net negative by 6 (41-47%).

--Views of President Joe Biden are net negative by 15 points (42% favorable, 57% unfavorable).

Conducted September 20-24, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 991 North Carolina registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (138) and cellphones (615) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (238). Results based on the registered voter sample have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points and for the subsample of 787 likely voters it is ±3.5 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population.

"Fox News Poll: Harris, Trump locked in tight race in battleground Pennsylvania",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-harris-trump-locked-tight-race-battleground-pennsylvania,2024-09-27T22:07:19Z,"Fox News contributor Joe Concha on the media pressing Vice President Harris on her lack of interviews and Sen. Joe Manchin refusing to endorse Harris due to her support for ending the filibuster.

Vice President Harris and former President Trump are locked in a tight race in Pennsylvania, mostly unchanged since July. This despite the array of newsworthy events since then, including the Democratic National Convention, a presidential debate, and a second Trump assassination attempt.

The new Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters finds Harris narrowly ahead of Trump by 2 points (50-48%) among registered voters, while the race is tied at 49% each among likely voters.

The July results, conducted shortly after President Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris, but before she was conclusively the nominee, were deadlocked at 49% each. But even in March, when Biden was the presumed nominee, the contest was close to even.

WORKING CLASS WILL COME HOME TO HARRIS, RALLYGOERS IN POSTINDUSTRIAL PENNSYLVANIANS SAY

Since July, Harris has widened her lead among women (by 9 points), nonwhite voters (+8), and voters under age 30 (+17). Her support has held steady among two other sources of strength: college graduates and urban voters.

Ninety-two percent of Harris supporters are certain of their vote versus 86% of Trump supporters.

Trump's best groups include men, Whites without a college degree, independents, and rural voters. He has nearly doubled his lead among men and the small group of independents since July.

'ABUSE OF POWER': HOUSE GOP OPENS PROBE INTO UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

Another reason the race is close is Trump has minimized Harris' edge among suburban voters (+2). This is mostly due to the large gender gap among suburban voters: suburban men support Trump by 14 points (suburban women go for Harris by 17). Meanwhile, Harris has successfully peeled off disaffected Republicans: she has 1 in 4 non-MAGA Republicans backing her.

In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton by less than a point in the Keystone State, while Biden's victory was by just over a point in 2020.

In the expanded ballot (includes third-party candidates) Harris has a 2-point edge among registered voters while Trump is ahead by 1 point among likely voters.

All results for the Harris-Trump head-to-heads and expanded ballot are within the error margin .

""Pennsylvania is not breaking open and shouldn't be expected to,"" says Democratic Pollster Chris Anderson who conducts Fox News surveys alongside Republican Daron Shaw. ""Both candidates have a little way to go to consolidate their bases and whoever does a better job there could determine who wins the state.""

The economy is the top issue for voters this election and most Pennsylvanians have a negative view of the economy (71%).

More voters think Trump can better handle the economy than Harris by 6 points. Still, that's half the advantage he had on the issue in April (+12 points over Biden).

Trump does best on immigration and border security (+17) and is also more trusted to make the country safer (+5).

Harris is seen as better able to handle abortion by 21 points. She also gets the nod on helping the middle class (by 8 points), protecting Democracy (+7), and fighting for people like you (+5).

Neither has a clear edge in bringing needed change (Harris +3)

Harris enjoys better favorable ratings than the former president -- 48% favorable vs. 51% unfavorable for a 3-point net negative rating. Trump is underwater by 9 points (45% vs. 54%). It plays out the same way among the vice-presidential candidates: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's rating is even (44% vs. 44%) while Ohio Sen. JD Vance is in negative territory by 13 points (39% vs. 52%).

Biden's favorable rating is underwater by 16 points (42% vs. 58%).

In the Pennsylvania Senate race, Democratic candidate Bob Casey has a 9-point lead over Republican challenger David McCormick (53% to 44% among both registered and likely voters). McCormick has narrowed the gap by 4 points since July when he was down by 13 (55-42%).

The reversal can mostly be attributed to a 13-point shift among men and a decrease in support for Casey among independents. In July, men supported Casey by 6 points while today they back McCormick by 7 points, while independents supported Casey by 18 points in the summer and it's a 5-point spread now.

Some 10% of Casey backers split their ticket and back Trump in the presidential race while just 4% of McCormick supporters go for Harris.

A few more things...

-- Gov. Josh Shapiro is popular, as 62% approve of the job he's doing while a third disapprove (36%). Most Democrats (92%) and over half of independents (53%) approve of him while two-thirds of Republicans (65%) disapprove.

-- A majority of Pennsylvanians favor the use of fracking for oil and gas production, including 8 in 10 Republicans, 6 in 10 independents, and 4 in 10 Democrats.

China Rate Cuts Ignite Casino Stocks That Hold Macau Properties,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnavin/2024/09/27/china-rate-cuts-ignite-casino-stocks-that-hold-macau-properties/,2024-09-27T21:46:40Z,"U. S. casino/resort companies rallied like crazy this week after China announced interest rate cuts and other measures designed to stimulate the economy. Investors took this to mean that major stocks in the gambling industry with operations in Macau would stand to benefit.

The CPC Central Committe, with President Xi overseeing it, described further actions such as a ""one time allowance for disadvantaged people"" to hit just before a national holiday next week. This type of monetary ""stimulation"" is quickly bringing Wall Street money back into those casino/resorts with China-based gambling spots.

The sense is that big players in Asia (and perhaps the disadvantaged as well) will now be showing up to gamble in Macau more often with even more money. Whether this plays out as imagined is another question, but investors were not waiting to go ahead and buy these stocks.

WYNN Resorts (NYSE: WYNN), with a $10.83 billion market cap, operates Wynn Tower and Encore Tower in Macau, with 1010 guest rooms, a few restaurants, many gambling activities and the Moon Jelly Aquarium. Inside the resort is similar to the insides of the Las Vegas resorts but a look outside the windows here sees China, not Nevada.

On the daily price chart below, note how the price is now back above the 200-day moving average and quickly. The heaviness of the buying volume tends to offer confirmation of the up move. Morgan Stanly just upgraded Wynn Resorts from ""equal weight"" to ""overweight"" with a price target of $104.

Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS) owns and operates five integrated resorts in China tourist destination: The Venetian Macao with 2905 suites, the Sands Macao with 289 suites, The Londoner Macao with 6022 suites and The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao with 379 rooms and suites.

Market capitalization is $37.65 billion.

Miriam Adelson, the wife of the late CEO Sheldon Adelson, owns 56% of the shares in the company. She's been making big donations to the campaign of former President Donald Trump. There's no word, however, on the availability of Trump Shoes or Trump Watches at the resort's Macao gift shops.

The daily price chart (below) shows the sudden dramatic rise in the price of Las Vegas Sands. Now trading well above the 200-day moving average, for the first time since April, it's clear that investors definitely like the news about stimulus from Chinese government officials.

MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) has a market cap of $12.04 billion, trades with a price-earnings ratio of 14 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 9.88. MGM Macau contains 580 rooms and suites along with the casino and restaurants.

It's not as big a presence in the town as the Wynn and the Las Vegas Sands presence, so the stock, while having a good day Friday, failed to make it back above the 200-day moving average. Here's the daily price chart:

Melco Resorts & Entertainment (NASDAQ: MLCO) operates Altira Macao, a 38-story casino resort with 230 guest rooms including 24 VIP suites and eight villas. Market capitalization for the company is $3.39 billion. JP Morgan in July had downgraded Melco from ""overweight"" to ""neutral"" with a price target of $7.

The stock's price took off Friday to its second closing session above the 200-day moving average.

FTC Social Media Report Needs A Rewrite,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/aldenabbott/2024/09/27/ftc-social-media-report-needs-a-rewrite/,2024-09-27T21:27:03Z,"On September 19, 2024, the FTC voted 5-0 to release a staff report on the data collection and use practices of major social media and video streaming services.

The report assessed information collected by FTC staff from nine companies, including some of the largest social media and video streaming services: Amazon.com, Inc., which owns the gaming platform Twitch; Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms, Inc.); YouTube LLC; Twitter, Inc. (now X Corp.); Snap Inc.; ByteDance Ltd., which owns the video-sharing platform TikTok; Discord Inc.; Reddit, Inc.; and WhatsApp Inc.

The orders asked for information about how the companies collect, track and use personal and demographic information, how they determine which ads and other content are shown to consumers, whether and how they apply algorithms or data analytics to personal and demographic information, and how their practices impact children and teens.

According to FTC Chair Lina Khan:

""The report lays out how social media and video streaming companies harvest an enormous amount of Americans' personal data and monetize it to the tune of billions of dollars a year. While lucrative for the companies, these surveillance practices can endanger people's privacy, threaten their freedoms, and expose them to a host of harms, from identity theft to stalking. Several firms' failure to adequately protect kids and teens online is especially troubling. The Report's findings are timely, particularly as state and federal policymakers consider legislation to protect people from abusive data practices.""

The report described specific staff concerns with media and video streaming services actions, including:

· ""Woefully inadequate"" collection and indefinite retention of troves of data, including information from data brokers, and about both users and non-users of their platforms;

· Company business models that incentivized mass collection of user data to monetize data, especially through targeted advertising, posing risks to users' privacy;

· Inadequate company monitoring of automated systems that were fed data, and obstacles to third parties' opting out of the use of their data;

· A failure to adequately protect children and teens who accessed media and video streaming sites; and

· The risk that companies that amass significant amounts of user data may be in a position to achieve anticompetitive market dominance, potentially leading to harmful company prioritization of data acquisition at the expense of user privacy.

Key report recommendations included:

· Congress should pass comprehensive federal privacy legislation to limit surveillance, address baseline protections, and grant consumers data rights;

· Congress should enact additional legislative privacy protections for children and for teens over the age of 13;

· Companies should limit data collection, implement concrete and enforceable data minimization and retention policies, limit data sharing with third parties and affiliates, delete consumer data when it is no longer needed, and adopt consumer-friendly privacy policies that are clear, simple, and easily understood;

· Companies should not collect sensitive information through privacy-invasive ad tracking technologies; and

· Companies should carefully examine their policies and practices regarding ad targeting based on sensitive categories.

Problems With The Staff Report

FTC staff could have presented a neutral description and analysis of data collection practices by major streaming service companies. Instead, the staff report sounds primarily like a litany of concerns about theoretical (not actually shown) consumer harms. The report also essentially ignores the substantial economic benefits stemming from the companies' data use.

Notably, although they concurred in releasing the report, two FTC Commissioners, Melissa Holyoak and Andrew Feguson, released separate statements dissenting from important aspects of the report's analysis.

Commissioner Holyoak's Three Key Concerns

Noting that ""companies pay close attention to what the Commission votes to put forward,"" Commissioner Holyoak highlighted three concerns:

""First, the [r]eport may affect free speech online. Where the [r]eport's analysis relates to protecting children and teens online or to clearly harmful content (e.g., promoting self-harm), I am deeply sympathetic. And as noted earlier, the [r]eport says it does not ""endorse any attempt to censor or moderate content based on political views."" But because some of the [r]eport relates to how social media companies design or modify their algorithms and AI in ways that may affect their content recommendations or moderation, I have grave concerns.

Second, the [r]eport's so-called ""recommendations"" effectively seek to regulate private conduct through a sub-regulatory guidance document, and, at times, incorporate mischaracterizations of what current law requires. We should not dictate or otherwise seek to reshape private-sector conduct in a guidance document.

Third, I note that -- notwithstanding many descriptive contributions this Report makes -- there are pivotal factual and policy questions that must still be explored. Before we can conclude the [r]eport's unqualified recommendations would ultimately lead to good outcomes for consumers or competition, more analysis is essential. Indeed, it is particularly troubling that these recommendations overlap with the Commission's [2022] contemplated rulemaking [on commercial surveillance and data privacy] and appear created in part to provide support part to provide support for such rulemaking, circumventing and potentially subverting the public-comment process.""

Commissioner Ferguson's Concerns

Commissioner Ferguson's criticisms of the report centered on its treatment of targeted advertising and artificial intelligence, and noted its omission of any discussion of political censorship:

""The [r]eport's claim that consumers can be 'profoundly threat[ened]' and suffer 'extreme harm[]' by being shown a targeted advertisement is unjustified, a gratuitous attack on the online economy made with the goal of justifying heavy-handed regulation.

The [r]eport also calls for the expansion of AI safety departments within these companies, and for the bureaucrats who staff them to have binding authority over the engineers and business leaders who actually innovate and create new products. It conveniently fails to mention the stunningly bad decisions made by such AI safety bureaucracies where they already exert their harmful influence.

Just as disappointing is what the [r]eport omits. The . . . [FTC] orders [requesting information] asked about the companies' content moderation policies, but the [r]eport says nothing about the pervasive political censorship and election interference carried out by the studied companies under the guise of 'content moderation.' The [r]eport says nothing about the banning of politicians (including Donald Trump while he was serving as President of the United States), about the removal and demonetization of users who challenge the Silicon Valley political consensus, nor about one of the most brazen acts of election interference in recent history: the coordinated suppression by social media companies of the Hunter Biden laptop story in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election.""

The Report's Flaws: An Overall Assessment

The staff report provides new information on data collection and usage practices by media companies that may be of interest to future researchers and Congress. This is beneficial.

The report fails, however, in making highly critical subjective characterizations of business practices and in putting forth recommendations reflecting those characterizations. The report provides no empirical support for its findings. It also ignores economic analysis that points to positive aspects of the practices it criticizes.

In particular, the report largely ignores the substantial benefits of data retention and, in particular, targeted advertising. More efficient targeted advertising and data retention for monetization purposes enables digital firms to enhance the efficiency and qualify of platform services, benefiting consumer and business users.

In addition, language in the staff report that calls into question data retention without focusing on particular case-specific harms may discourage efficient and profitable platform data usage. This slows digital platform-adjacent innovation and economic growth.

The report overall reflects the unjustified belief that benevolent government knows better than successful digital firms and can ""perfect"" their platform practices, an example of what the eminent economist Harold Demsetz called the ""Nirvana Fallacy.""

Finally, it is ironic that the staff report focuses on the risk of data sharing, without noting that many antitrust interventionists implicitly support data sharing by promoting platform interoperability as a means of enhancing competition.

The Next Step For the FTC

The pointed critiques of the staff report's analysis by 2 of the 5 FTC Commissioners, coupled with the report's lack of rigor, subjectivity, and analytic deficiencies, severely restrict its utility. In its current form, it reflects poorly on the FTC. The Commission should have staff rewrite it, to eliminate its subjective conclusions and recommendations. A new report should also include economic analysis that discusses the welfare benefits as well as costs of data retention and usage."
Stephanie Ruhle: The American people deserve to know Donald Trump's economic plans,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/harris-trump-interview-economy-criticism-rcna173065,2024-09-27T20:25:01Z,"After my exclusive sit-down with Vice President Kamala Harris, criticism from conservative media quickly poured in, with some dismissing the conversation as a ""softball"" interview.

As I learned from Donald Trump, all press is good press. So I am thrilled to be all over the airwaves all day long. But in all seriousness, that criticism is nonsense. Anybody who watched my interview with Harris knows we sat down for 25 minutes and talked about one single topic: the economy. It's the number one issue for voters. And if Trump would like to sit down and have the same conversation I had with Harris, I'm ready for him.

The economy is a huge vulnerability for both candidates. Did I think Harris answered every single question perfectly and gave people exactly what they wanted? No. Many people felt like she was speaking in platitudes. Harris laid out her economic vision but she didn't give much detail. Those details are in an 80-page policy proposal on her website.

On the other side, Trump has given voters absolutely nothing about his plans for the economy, other than going on and on about how he gave America ""the best economy ever"" during his first administration, how he'll impose blanket tariffs next time around, and his promise of mass deportations -- which would cause huge issues for our economy.

But despite that, and all of the Biden-Harris economic wins over the last four years, Trump is still the candidate who's emotionally connected with blue-collar workers and he's still the one voters seem to trust more when it comes to economic issues. If Harris wants to win, she needs to figure out why that is."
"Here We Go Again, Uncertainty Rises Like In 2020",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamdunkelberg/2024/09/27/here-we-go-again-uncertainty-rises-like-in-2020/,2024-09-27T19:02:56Z,"The 2024 election is one of the most confusing in recent history, with candidates confirmed just a few months before the election. With a very short period of time for campaigns, there is less information available to base decisions on. With a little over a month before the election is over, uncertainty has become more widespread. For over 50 years, NFIB has measured uncertainty by examining the percent of owners who cannot give a directional (up or down) response to six questions about their business environment in its monthly Small Business Economic Trends survey. NFIB asks a series of forward-looking questions, all of which have a ""don't know"" or ""uncertain"" option for the owner to choose. These are listed below:

In the monthly surveys, the Uncertainty Index peaked at 100 in November 2016 (Chart 2). Quarterly (the first month in each quarter with larger samples), the record high was 98, reached in October 2020. The current reading of 92 (August) is one of the highest recorded, up 19 points since January of this year. This illustrates how uncertainty hurts economic growth. The rise in uncertainty coincides with a slowing of the economy, less hiring and spending.

The election will resolve a lot of uncertainty as owners will know which political party will be in charge of spending, taxation, and regulation. These government activities are critical to small businesses. With more certainty, more owners can make decisions about hiring and spending and the projected course of the economy. If they like the outcome, more owners will spend and hire, moving the economy forward. With nearly 15 million firms with fewer than 5 workers (NAICS), even small changes can add up to big numbers."
Amazon Killed Remote Work.  Is RTO The New Normal?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonwingard/2024/09/27/amazon-killed-remote-work--is-rto-the-new-normal/,2024-09-27T18:11:10Z,"When COVID-19 shut down offices worldwide, the shift to remote work was fast and complete. Homes were quickly reorganized and retrofitted for workspace and privacy, desks and ring lights were purchased, and everyone learned how to increase their bandwidth and navigate Zoom. Life and work, as we knew it, no longer existed -- and it was incredibly difficult. But, after the chaos subsided, and some normalcy resumed, people got comfortable...and got to work.

In 2024, four years after that initial shutdown, 98 percent of workers say they want the option to work from home, at least some of the time.

And for good reasons. By eliminating commutes, people had more time to spend with their family and friends. They could walk their dog or start a load of laundry on their lunch break. They could work in sweatpants. Life was good.

Companies aligned with the positive response -- and many of them developed more permanent work-from-home policies. In August of 2023, one in five Americans was working remotely.

Now, some say the post-pandemic remote work era is coming to a close. Amazon recently announced that all corporate employees must return to the office five days a week starting in January. Goldman Sachs, Boeing, UPS, and Tesla also announced full-time return to office (RTO) mandates this year.

Several leading Fortune 500 CEOs cite concerns over culture, productivity, and innovation when employees work from home. They say RTO mandates will fix these issues.

But are their claims legitimate, or is something else going on here?

After all the time and energy that went into the adjustment to remote work -- and the benefits of reducing overhead costs and attracting top talent with WFH perks -- why are they now choosing to reverse course on popular policy?

And, if companies refuse to listen to their employees concerns around these policies, what message are they really sending?

In a message to employees on September 16, Andy Jassy notes Amazon's ""unique culture,"" and that ""keeping your culture strong is not a birthright. You have to work at it all the time."" He goes on to announce the company is returning to a pre-COVID policy that requires corporate employees to report to the office five days a week.

Culture comes up a lot in these announcements and in criticisms of remote work.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, has said ""There are huge weaknesses to the Zoom world, so it's hard to inculcate culture and character and all those things.""

Company culture is a difficult thing to build and to measure. Anyone who's sat through a Zoom call with muted speakers and stuttering connections can attest to the limitations of collaborating online. It's also a surmountable challenge -- and one that managers can overcome by properly training their teams on remote work technology and processes.

Jassy says to his employees that ""the last 15 months we've been back in the office at least three days a week has strengthened our conviction about the benefits.""

But it's hard to believe those remaining two days at home really hindered company culture. It seems that if productivity is also a goal, then workers could easily connect with teammates on in-office days and focus on head-down work at home.

There is, indeed, evidence that productivity suffers in fully remote companies, with a 10% reduction compared to fully on-site operations. But in hybrid environments, where workers have the option to work from home for part of the week, there is no impact to productivity and retention rates dramatically improve.

Research shows a 13% increase in productivity when workers are happy at work. Amazon workers have made their discontent clear. In an employee-commissioned survey, the new five-days-in-office policy received an average rating of 1.4 on a scale of one to five, with one being strongly dissatisfied.

If CEOs are genuinely making this decision to improve productivity and profits, they should consider that in 2023, unhappy, disengaged employees cost the world economy $8.9 trillion.

""Any leader who ever had teams scattered in remote offices will tell you that org culture is unrelated to location,"" Chris Williams, a leadership consultant and former vice president of human resources at Microsoft, wrote on Linkedin last week. ""RTO as a culture change is BS.""

The data seems to agree.

Research from the University of Pittsburgh shows that RTO mandates are more likely to come from companies with poor stock performance. The research did not find any improvement on stock returns or profitability, after those RTO mandates were implemented.

Additionally, ""We found that return-to-office mandates are more common among male and more powerful CEOs,"" said Mark Ma, an associate professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh, in an interview with NPR.

Sadly, these full-time RTO mandates seem to signal a refusal to prioritize employees' work-life balance over profit -- even when there's no evidence that profit will increase with employees back at the office.

It seems the greater challenge here is not workplace culture or profit but workplace trust. Do managers trust their employees to get their work done when they can't see how many hours a day they're at their desk? If not, that's a hiring problem -- or a managerial one.

In order to build trust, both parties must be willing to listen. And with an overwhelming number of employees expressing frustration at full-time RTO mandates, it's clear who's not.

Gen-Z and Millennials have made their desires known: they want flexibility. By next year, Millennials will make up 75% of the workforce. If employers want to attract the best employees, they're going to have to listen -- or lose them and the war on talent.

These RTO mandates will hurt employees who have rearranged their lives for the last four years of remote work. People have made home and family decisions based on the ability to work remotely. To take that away for the supposed sake of company culture is to say that work-life balance and employee well-being is not part of that culture.

In order to retain their best workers, companies must demonstrate how they can strike a balance between everyone's best interests. If it's easier for managers to manage in the office, but it's easier for their employees to work from home, hybrid schedules are the obvious answer.

These leading companies implementing inflexible RTO mandates are the exception, not the norm. The remote work era isn't over, because, for so many people, it's still working.

Leaders who refuse to value the significance of employee satisfaction will eventually realize the impact to their bottom line -- lost top talent and lost trust. Turnover is expensive.

The new era of remote work will have to be responsive to workers at every level of an organization. If CEOs want to increase innovation, they should apply that creativity to better policies that reflect the wide range of needs and preferences of the people on whom they depend."
The Singularity Is Coming Soon. What Will The World Look Like In 2035?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertbtucker/2024/09/27/the-singularity-is-coming-soon-what-will-the-world-look-like-in-2035/,2024-09-27T18:00:43Z,"Futurist Ray Kurzweil likes to make predictions about technology. Indeed, he's been making them since 1963 and has amassed a following in the millions. In his 2005 book The Singularity Is Near, he predicted that by 2045, machines would become as smart as humans. Due to advancing technology, he's moved the expected arrival date up to as soon as 2029.

When, or if, machine intelligence eventually does surpass human intelligence, it will trigger rapid and unprecedented progress in all fields. But whether or not we reach the Singularity, as Kurzweil describes, it's clear that the rapid advance of generative AI, and the imminent arrival of artificial general intelligence, will continue to be major forces of disruption headed to 2035.

As futurist Langdon Morris points out in Hello, Future: The World in 2035, AI is a driving force of change and disruption, but the unanswered question is: will it also be a destructive force, killing jobs by the millions and forcing society into some tough choices?

Indeed, AI is already fomenting profound and unprecedented changes across human civilization, as the benefits and threats from this technology spool out daily. On the productivity side, AI is answering emails, setting up meetings, and making travel plans. It recognizes images, translates languages, transcribes speech, and plays games like chess and Go at the highest levels of proficiency.

More significantly, important scientific and medical breakthroughs are already being developed using AI, and more exciting breakthroughs are just around the corner. So are 3D-printed houses and clothing, Waymo's autonomous vehicles are spreading from Phoenix and San Francisco to Austin and other cities, all powered by AI capabilities.

And soon we may have digital companions, coaches, motivators and task-mastering robots that will accompany us everywhere. ""These are advanced AI agents designed to replicate and emulate our unique decision-making processes,"" notes futurist Amy Webb in a Wall Street Journal roundup of futurist perspectives on AI in 2030.

But some futurists, myself included, are wary on a lot of fronts. McKinsey estimates that 30 percent of the world's workforce could lose their jobs to AI within a decade, as many as 400 to 800 million people, possibly a worst-case scenario whose negative consequences would be immense. I'm also concerned about the dehumanizing power of AI, as it has the potential to undermine (or possibly overwhelm) the complexity and dignity of human consciousness while it also exacerbates societal inequalities, compromises individual autonomy, and erodes moral and spiritual values.

We already know that AI systems, driven by large language models and recommendation algorithms, can manipulate human behavior on a massive scale. It's used to affect public opinion, spread misinformation, and even nudge people toward destructive and self-destructive actions, all without their awareness that machines are influencing their behaviors.

As AI systems become more advanced, they will have the capacity to exert even greater control over our choices, reducing human agency and potentially undermining the democratic process. Perhaps this is why historian Yuval Noah Harari suggests that we're at the end of human history. ""Not the end of history,"" he emphasized in a recent interview with The Economist, ""but the end of human history, as control is shifting to non-humans.""

As AI has come to dominate discussion around shaping the future, some futurists sense that no one in the conversation is talking about the simultaneous revolutions now occurring - in science, economics, climate, energy, demographics, geopolitics, politics, and culture and their vitally important impacts on what life will be like in 2035.

""It isn't just AI that we should be concerned about,"" notes Morris, in a recent Navigating the Future interview. ""During the next ten years, the world will go through numerous massive and highly unsettling shifts that will affect every aspect of society. The global economy will be transformed, radical new technologies will be disrupted, and the damage caused by climate change will worsen. The geopolitical situation will continue to be turbulent, with war and the threat of war. And politics everywhere will continue to be highly polarized. The significance of this can hardly be overstated, because just about everything is unchanging.""

Morris sees signals all around that suggest people are at the end of their tolerance of the pace of change today, much less tomorrow, when futurists suggest there will be more change over the next decade alone than during the prior 100 years. ""The whole MAGA movement is essentially an expression of millions of people who are experiencing anxiety because of too much change. ""They're afraid, they're angry, they're upset, they want to go back to how it was 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago. The symptoms that Alvin Toffler describes in his 1970 book, Future Shock are what we're living out in a very public way in society today.""

He noted that while AI has come to dominate so many discussions around the shape of the future, he suggests that we need to engage in a much broader conversation. ""It isn't just AI that we should be concerned about,"" he advises. ""During the next ten years, the world will go through numerous massive and highly unsettling shifts that will affect every aspect of society. The global economy is being completely transformed, and the damage caused by climate change will worsen. As a consequence of the climate, we've already begun shifting the global energy system.""

In his book Morris examines the social consequences of all this change, and observes that many people have already reached the limits of their tolerance for today's pace of change, much less tomorrow's. And yet we know that there will be more change over the next decade than during the prior 100 years.

""The whole MAGA movement is essentially an expression of millions of people who are experiencing anxiety because of too much change. They're afraid, they're angry, they're upset, they want to go back to how it was 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago. The symptoms that Alvin Toffler describes in his 1970 book, Future Shock are what we're living out in a very public way in society today.""

But change is not going to slow down so we can catch up. ""How organizations operate, the course of industries, and even the very social structures of nations and regions are being, and will continue to be altered,"" Morris observes. ""Looked at from a global perspective, geopolitics, politics, the climate, regional wars, the state of the human population, continuing urbanization, and the transformation of the global economy are all critically important, and just as fundamental as technology.""

As an organizational futurist, Morris works at the highest levels to help companies prepare for the different world of tomorrow. He helped France-based oil company Total to understand the future of the energy industry, which soon led to major shifts in corporate strategy. The company even renamed itself ""Total Energies"" to reflect the eventual decline of the oil business and the shift to alternative fuel sources. He has also led similar projects for the US Coast Guard, L'Oréal, Kaiser Permanente, and India's leading corporation, Reliance, among others.

And how does he work with clients to help them prepare when so much about the future is uncertain?

""You need a clear strategy, and the ability to pivot when conditions change, which they undoubtedly will,"" he responds. ""You need to plan investments, develop your staff, create innovations, grow your markets, and adapt to change. And doing all this well, of course, requires attention to developing strategic foresight."" All this change is coming fast, and you need to be prepared."" And so he asks the pressing question, ""Are you ready? And is your team ready?""

And as we do so, we must not become distracted by technology and lulled into thinking that when and if the Singularity arrives, it will bring abundance and heightened intelligence. As Morris points out, if we delegate clear thinking and judgment and decision making to technology, we're most likely not going to be happy with how things turn out.

""As inhabitants of this modern era, we should think about the unique place to which we have arrived. Now that human activity achieves impact on a global scale, there is great value and significant importance to thinking about the future. Human actions are responsible for what happens in and to society, and now to an increasing degree what happens to the Earth. Thus, we understand that today's choices influence not only what happens to us, but also what happens to Us."""
Kamala The Capitalist: The Vice President's New Way Forward,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rhettbuttle/2024/09/27/kamala-the-capitalist-the-vice-presidents-new-way-forward/,2024-09-27T18:00:37Z,"On Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz unveiled their New Way Forward plan, which offers their economic vision for the country. During a speech in Pittsburgh, the Vice President proclaimed, ""Look, I am a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets. I believe in consistent and transparent rules of the road to create a stable business environment.""

The policy proposals are designed to create opportunities for both small and large businesses, lower costs, stimulate innovation, and invest in the workforce. It is also important to note that Vice President Harris' plan also clearly embraces a belief in the power of the free market.

Vice President Harris' plan prioritizes the ingenuity and perseverance of all Americans and lays the groundwork for an economy that rewards ambition, hard work, and innovation. Here are five reasons why her policies are rooted in capitalism in expanding opportunity and driving growth.

1. Supporting Entrepreneurs from the Ground Up

Earlier this month, Vice President Harris unveiled some of her small business policy proposals in the New Way Forward plan, including setting a goal of 25 million new small-business applications during her first term. One way she plans to achieve this milestone is by increasing the tax deduction from business start-up expenses from $5,000 to $50,000 for new small businesses. It takes on average about $40,000 to launch a small business for items that include market surveys, advertisements, equipment, and salaries for workers in training. This 10-fold increase in the deduction amount will allow them to cover more of these costs and provide more flexibility on when and how they can claim it. Small businesses account for the majority of net new job creation so supporting entrepreneurs from the ground up is a fundamental capitalist value.

2. Fostering Competition

Capitalism depends on fair competition to keep prices fair and drive innovation. Vice President Harris's plan promotes this by breaking up price-gouging schemes in certain industries to lower grocery, health care, and energy costs, as well as protect consumers from hidden fees and fraud. This increased purchasing power can boost overall market demand and allow small and medium-sized businesses to compete on a level playing field.

3. Investing in Innovation

Competition also requires innovation and as the plan states, ""American manufacturing is essential to rebuilding the middle class. Disinvestment in manufacturing communities, policy choices that facilitated outsourcing, and corporate decisions to deprioritize long-term supply chain resilience hollowed out American manufacturing leading the U.S. share of global manufacturing to decline from 25% in 1997 to 17% in 2021."" While the Biden-Harris Administration's Investing in America Agenda has taken steps to reverse this course, Vice President Harris' plan is designed to go further. It proposes investments in industries that are vital to the country's future, such as AI, modernizing and reducing emissions in steel and iron production, and developing biotechnology for producing critical medicines and sustainable materials. This can help build up American industrial strength and create more jobs in communities across the country.

4. Strengthening Supply Chain Resilience

Covid-19 showed that you can be a capitalist, but if the supply chains are weak, you still may not be able to find toilet paper. Vice President Harris's plan invests in strengthening supply chains for food, pharmaceuticals, and other critical sectors by making them more diverse and competitive with local suppliers and small businesses. This can not only drive down prices, but make the market function more efficiently with fewer disruptions.

5. Promoting Homeownership and Wealth Creation

A cornerstone of capitalism is the ability to build personal wealth, and the New Way Forward plan prioritizes this by expanding homeownership opportunities. It proposes building 3 million additional affordable homes and offering down-payment assistance of up to $25,000 for first-time buyers. In turn, a strengthened housing market can lead to more stable communities, helping ensure that businesses can retain talent and reduce the financial pressure on employees.

Perhaps most importantly, the numbers also indicate that Vice President Harris embraces the core tenets of capitalism: entrepreneurship, competition, access to capital, market efficiency, and wealth creation. The global investment bank Goldman Sachs, which is run by capitalists, estimates the bigger boost to the U.S. economy will happen if Vice President Harris is elected over her opponent. In addition, Moody's Analytics projects that more than a million new jobs would be added to the economy and household disposable income would increase if she wins in November. This may be why nearly 100 business leaders and more than 400 economists are supporting her candidacy."
Coming Soon: 'AI-Ifying' The Most Painful Parts Of White-Collar Jobs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2024/09/27/coming-soon-ai-ifying-the-most-painful-parts-of-white-collar-jobs/,2024-09-27T16:53:13Z,"The jury's out in how many white-collar office or professional jobs will be displaced by artificial intelligence. But one thing is certain: many of these jobs are being supplemented or augmented by AI copilots and agents.

That's the word from Angela Strange and James da Costa, partners with Andreessen Horowitz, in a recent note on emerging opportunities in the AI economy. ""Every white-collar role will have an AI copilot,"" they state. ""Then an AI agent.""

What does this mean? Their implication is that while AI won't necessarily replace a lot of office and professional jobs, it will certainly handle a lot of these workers' tasks. In many cases, at least half of their tasks are open to automation. Left unsaid is the freeing up of workers' time means those that can move forward are those that take on a more activist role within their businesses -- advising, teaming up, and even identifying other areas open for AI assistance.

Strange and da Costa point to last year's study out of OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania to illustrate their point how many professionals are ripe for AI copilots and agents. The study showed that with access to a large language model, ""about 15% of all worker tasks in the U.S. could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47% and 56% of all tasks.""

Inspired by the OpenAI-University of Pennsylvania research, Strange and da Costa pulled employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2023 and identified the top 50 roles in which 50% or more of tasks could be performed by AI. These roles include architects, financial analysts, meeting planners, insurance underwriters, HR assistants, and customer service representatives.

While Strange and da Costa are targeting their observations at startups willing to market AI-based solutions for these purposes, these are directions managers, professionals, and companies at all stages need to consider.

""The most natural place for these copilots and agents to live is the incumbent workflow or system of record -- such as sales agents launched from Salesforce,"" they point out. ""The system of record is where the data agents need to complete specialized tasks lives, and it's also a natural launchpad for any new user interface to reside -- prompting the agent.""

Here's where copilots and agents seem destined to take on more of the heavy lifting:

Data collection. ""Data for loans or insurance policies is still often collected via email and PDFs,"" Strange and da Costa stated. The key is to ""AI-ify this workflow and own the data before it gets to the incumbent SOR.""

For example, they continued, ""a virtual loan officer or insurance agent could own the initial back-and-forth customer document collection and appointment scheduling. Similarly, virtual sales development representatives (SDRs) can gather all the information about a potential customer and own the initial correspondence before a record is even created in the incumbent SOR.""

""Painful workflows"" being slowed by requirements for outside information. ""There are few things more tedious than the Know Your Business (KYB) onboarding process in banking, which involves document checking, internet searching, and back-and-forth correspondence between businesses and financial institutions,"" Strange and da Costa observed. AI providers or platforms ""will auto-parse every document that's uploaded, extract the needed information, and follow up with the customer for missing information.""

Healthcare, another industry with painful workflows, is also ripe for AI-ifying, they continued. AI systems could ""take in every medical document hitting a fax machine, extract patient and diagnosis details, and even run insurance pre-qualification to streamline patient visits to medical practices.""

Integrating the right data. Disparate data sources need to be converged ""to create a new multimodal system of record,"" the VC partners urged. ""Significantly more data exists and is relevant to the job to be done than what is currently held within incumbent systems of record. For example, sales data doesn't just exist in Salesforce or Hubspot: there are also emails and Slack messages, sales enablement materials, product usage data, customer support records, news and financial reports.""

Integrating these unstructured data sources can lead to new systems of record that will fuel AI copilots and assistants, Strange and da Costa concluded. This data -- text, image, voice, and video data -- forms the foundation of today's white-collar work."

Harris has faced frequent attacks from her Republican opponent, former President Trump, and the Border Patrol Union who argue that she is weak on border security, an issue that many Republicans see as the vice president's political Achilles' heel.

""After years of not just ignoring the problem, but helping create it, Vice President Kamala is finally headed down to the border,"" the National Border Patrol Council said in a statement. ""This is nothing more than for her to check the box, but what it is in reality, is a slap in the face towards the men and women that put their lives on the line every day, and also a slap in the face to the American public. Where has she been?""

HARRIS HEADS TO SOUTHERN BORDER LOOKING TO FLIP SCRIPT ON IMMIGRATION CRITICISMS

Harris' campaign has pointed to her past as a prosecutor, taking on transnational criminal gangs, and says she is the candidate to secure the border as she backs a bipartisan funding bill.

But Harris has a lengthy history on immigration at the national level.

Harris, as a California senator, was on the far-left of the Democratic Party on immigration, and in 2018 she pushed her colleagues in the Senate to reject a request by the Trump administration for more funding for immigration detention beds and Border Patrol agents.

In a letter to senators on the Senate Appropriations Committee in 2018, Harris and other senators called for them to ""reject President Trump's FY 19 funding request for a costly and ineffective border wall, new Border Patrol agents, and a large increase in U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel and detention beds.""

""We urge you to reduce funding for the administration's reckless immigration enforcement operations that are tearing families apart and harming our economy.""

HARRIS LEANS IN ON BORDER SECURITY AND TRUMP RELISHES THE FIGHT

She also grilled Ronald Vitiello, who was former President Trump's nominee to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whether he was ""aware of the perception"" of parallels between ICE and the KKK.

""Are you aware that there is a perception that ICE is administering its power in a way that is causing fear and intimidation, particularly among immigrants and specifically among immigrants coming from Mexico and Central America?"" she asked again.

In recently revealed footage, Harris is seen at a rally chanting ""Up, up with education, down, down with deportation"" at a rally which also featured now-disgraced actor Jussie Smollett.

Harris launched a bid for the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 2019. Her campaign included a promise to expand the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) by executive order, which gives protection to illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors.

She said that she would eliminate age requirements on applications and use parole authority to create a ""parole in place"" program to put those illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship.

Also she promised to shield illegal immigrant parents of American citizens and green card holders from deportation by executive order. Overall, her plan was predicted to protect over six million illegal immigrants from deportation.

Harris became vice president in 2021 and the administration immediately rolled back a number of Trump-era initiatives and attempted to place a moratorium on deportations.

Migrant numbers skyrocketed, and Biden told reporters in March that Harris would be put in charge of tackling root causes, issues like climate change, poverty and violence that the administration believes was driving migrants north.

It quickly led to Harris being dubbed by media outlets and Republicans as the ""border czar."" The White House rejected that title, but it has stuck with her ever since and made her a figurehead along with DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for the crisis.

After the assignment by Biden, and with numbers skyrocketing through subsequent months to record highs, Harris immediately came under pressure to visit the border as the White House said her role was more diplomatic than related to the border directly. She instead went to Mexico and Guatemala and had a stern message for migrants that upset immigrant activists.

""Do not come. Do not come. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our borders,"" she said. ""If you come to our border, you will be turned back.""

The pressure kept rising for her to go to the U.S. border.

""You haven't been to the border,"" NBC's Lester Holt told her, after she claimed she had been to the border.

""And I haven't been to Europe,"" Harris quipped.

Later that month, she went to the border in El Paso, Texas, where she received a briefing and toured a processing center while meeting with advocates and providers.

Harris would largely be unseen through the rest of 2021 and 2022 on the root causes strategy, although a private sector initiative to draw investment to tackle those root causes would continue.

In June 2022, she traveled to the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles and met with other leaders to discuss ways to handle the crisis. During that summit, she announced that $3.2 billion in commitments from private sector companies had been secured.

She also came under fire for declaring the border was secure despite the ongoing crisis and mass releases into the interior.

""The border is secure, but we also have a broken immigration system, in particular over the last four years before we came in, and it needs to be fixed,"" Harris said on NBC.

Harris made few appearances in 2023 relating to the border crisis, although her private investment strategy continued to bring in additional commitments from companies.

But the crisis did not stay out of the news, and 2023 broke new records for enormous amounts of migrant encounters and a number of chaotic scenes at the border.

Fiscal year 2023 broke the record for encounters with over 2.4 million, while December had nearly 250,000 encounters in a single month.

While the White House continued to reject the ""border czar"" narrative, Harris put her support behind a bipartisan Senate agreement to provide more funding to the border and reduce migrant crossings when they reach a certain level.

She also backed a number of executive orders by President Biden, who would implement a limit on asylum and efforts to provide a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who are spouses of U.S. citizens.

She has sought to portray herself as tougher on the border than former President Trump.

Now, with a stop in Douglas, Arizona, she aims to show that she is better prepared than Trump to tackle the combustible issue of immigration and what Republicans have spotlighted as the crisis at the southern border.

""We need a comprehensive plan,"" Harris said Wednesday in an interview with MSNBC. ""That includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship.""

Along with the border stop, the Harris campaign is launching a new ad that will play in Arizona and other battleground states that spotlights her past border efforts and plans.

""She put cartel members and drug traffickers behind bars, and she will secure our border,"" the narrator in the commercial says.

"Fastenal: Strong Business Model, But Little Margin Of Safety",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/09/27/fastenal-strong-business-model-but-little-margin-of-safety/,2024-09-27T15:51:11Z,"While Fastenal maintains a strong dividend track record, its premium price diminishes the margin of safety, affecting future returns for investors.

Generally, when investing in stocks we look for companies with strong brand power, differentiation and significant barriers to entry. This is not the case with Fastenal Co. (FAST, Financial). As the company operates in the industrial supplies distribution sector, there is little differentiation and a low barrier to entry.

The company makes up for this, however, by being very efficient in executing its business model, offering diversified solutions, inventory solutions and has a large distribution network, which guarantees it some moats.

As a result, Fastenal has an enviable track record, gradually improving its financials and consequently the distribution of shareholder value.

Despite being a very solid and attractive company, though, there are two main risks that need to be monitored. First, the cyclicality of its market. And second, its valuation, which is ""only"" reasonable in a base case scenario.

Strategic evolution drives consistent growth and operational efficiency

Fastenal is a distributor of wide-ranging industrial and construction products, including safety materials, screws and other tools and equipment. It also helps its customers with stock management, cost reduction and more.

One of the interesting strategies that Fastenal has been expanding in recent years is its onsite participation, through initiatives such as FastBin and FastVEnd. This practice turns out to be good for both sides. For Fastenal, it expands and builds customer loyalty (improving relationships), increases operational efficiency with automatic sales and better logistics and also makes revenue more recurrent. On the customer's side, it optimizes inventory costs and makes management simpler and more efficient, as well as gives them quick access to the materials they need.

In recent years, the company has been reducing its branch locations and expanding its onsite locations. In 2014, the company had 214 onsite locations with onsite revenue of $387.70 million, which represented close to 10% of total net revenue. In 2023, the number of onsite locations grew to 1,822 (1,934 in the second quarter) with around 40% of revenue.

Note that this business model combined with good execution translates into good financials for the company. Even in industries that are cyclical, good management has allowed for a consistent advancement in net revenue as well as an evolution in net margin. Focusing only on the last few quarters, a slightly slower growth rate and greater difficulties in margins have been observed. Management mentioned customer sentiment was still challenging, along with other data such as the U.S. Purchasing Managers' Index at 48.80 in the second quarter, but this was partly mitigated by better customer acquisitions and contract growth.

Thus, even with the greater representation of onsite operations, the challenging scenario, together with other factors such as short-term inefficiencies in the supply chain, caused the gross margin to shrink by 0.40 percentage points year over year to 45.10%, while the operating income margin fell from 21% to 20.20%, impacted by the advance in selling, general and administrative costs. Despite this, Fastenal stressed it remains prudent and for the third quarter, it intends to remain tight with costs.

From a long-term perspective, this slightly more challenging moment is almost unnoticeable, especially if we focus on the dividend per share, which continues to increase gradually and consistently, as well as being very well supported by the growth in earnings per share. On the other hand, we can already see a certain stagnation caused by the factors mentioned in the diluted earnings per share.

In general, these earnings are converted into cash generation and consequently sustain this good return to shareholders, both in terms of dividend growth and any buybacks. Note that in relation to the amount of cash generated, there is no great need for capital expenditures, which also makes the distribution to shareholders healthier and more predictable.

Finally, its capital structure is quite comfortable. In addition to generating consistent cash, its debt is low at just over $500 million, while cash and equivalents are just over $250 million. Since its leverage is very low, there is no need for large principal payments or interest expenses.

In summary, Fastenal has a solid track record of execution. Its good management with efficient strategies and cost reduction have proven capable of making a cyclical company in a market with no apparent barriers to entry able to present a consistent and sustainable return.

Valuation concerns

The main problem with the thesis is the market already rewards the stock. This premium is even higher at an unfavorable time for Fastenal since, despite the rate cuts and some statements about the resilience of the economy, there is still some cloudiness about the growth of economic activity in the short term and, consequently, uncertainty about its growth in the coming quarters.

Breaking down Fastenal's valuation multiples a little, the forward price-earnings ratio is 33.30, while the forward enterprise value-to-Ebitda ratio is 23.20 and the price-to-operating cash flow ratio is 29.80. All of these multiples are considerably above their medians.

However, multiples are always relative. For a company with high quality and predictable accelerated growth in its fundamentals, 33 times forward earnings may not be enough. But I do not think this is exactly the case with Fastenal. As I explained earlier, its business model and track record of execution are very good, but analysts' forecast for the next few years do not predict such strong growth. By 2026, the consensus expectation is that Fastenal will reach earnings per share of $2.40 - a sustainable and reasonable growth based on 2023's earnings of $2.02 - but even so, this figure implies a price-earnings of more than 29 by 2026.

Paying this premium compromises shareholder returns since the dividend yield ends up being low compared to the higher payout. With the estimated earnings per share for 2026, if the company distributes 80%, the yield based on the current stock price would be 2.70%, still below its average of the last 10 years, which is a dividend yield of 3.15%, and that's thinking of something that will still take two years to obtain.

As the company is not in a favorable cycle, it is normal for earnings to be a little more pressured and a resumption in this cycle could benefit it, especially if combined with some internal cost optimization initiatives, a better mix of revenue with more onsite operations, which could lead not only to a resumption of revenue growth, but also to the net income margin continuing to gradually advance.

Even in this scenario, you still have to believe the company will advance its free cash flow at an accelerated pace and discount this cash flow at a very low rate. In a discounted cash flow model, we find a fair price of just $60 for Fastenal when we consider growth of 11% for the next two decades and discount it at a rate of 7%. In other words, this valuation is reasonable, but I don't consider it attractive. As much as I believe the outlook for the company is positive and reliable, the 11% per year already incorporates this optimism well, eroding the margin of safety.

Final thoughts

Fastenal is an excellent company that is worth keeping on the radar as it is a solid option for compounding. Its efficient management allows it to generate good shareholder value, with good prospects of maintaining sustainable growth in cash generation and being a good dividend payer, ideal for those investors looking for alternative companies with quality income.

On the other hand, the current share price is a little stretched, even with the company's more timid results, which is why, in my opinion, a more cautious approach is needed in order to enter stocks or increase positions when there is a greater margin of safety.

I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and have no plans to buy any new positions in the stocks mentioned within the next 72 hours."
Here's What The Interest Rate Cut Means For Retirees,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevevernon/2024/09/27/what-the-interest-rate-cuts-mean-for-retirees/,2024-09-27T15:38:51Z,"If you're retired or soon-to-be retired, how could the recent cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve affect your finances? Unfortunately, there's not a simple answer, because it depends on your financial circumstances, investments, and sources of retirement income. And if you're like many retirees, there could be both positive and negative effects on your finances.

Let's see how your finances might be affected by the recent interest rate cut.

On September 18, the Federal Reserve cut its target federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%, a reduction of 0.5%. The federal funds rate reflects the interest rate that banks charge other banks to borrow money. A lower rate helps consumer banks charge lower interest rates on consumer loans, such as mortgages and credit cards. The theory is that consumers will pay less to borrow money, which could stimulate their spending and the economy.

It's important to note that it might take some time for the Fed rate cut to work its way to interest rates charged to consumers. A few financial institutions quickly reduced mortgage interest rates and credit card rates in response to the recent rate cut, but the impact hasn't fully worked its way through the financial system. And keep in mind that some rates, such as the interest charged on credit cards, often exceeds 20% per year, which is far higher than the federal funds rate.

In its announcement, the Fed hinted at the possibility of future rate cuts to further stimulate the economy.

It's important to note that the Federal Reserve generally reduces interest rates to stimulate and improve the nation's economy. As a result, if you have a direct stake in the economy, sooner or later you should realize a positive gain from the interest rate reduction.

Here are situations when lower interest rates could improve your finances:

Lastly, we all have a stake in the national debt, since interest on the federal debt is one of the fastest-growing segments of the federal government's annual budget. Lower interest rates could slow the growth of interest we pay on the national debt.

If you rely significantly on interest income from CDs, passbook savings accounts, and money market funds, you'll most likely see a drop in your interest income. Also, once bond investments price in the impact of the reduction in interest rates, your bond investments will yield lower amounts going forward.

Another potential negative impact comes into play if you decide to buy a traditional income annuity, which pays a fixed monthly amount for the rest of your life. The prices of traditional annuities move in the opposite direction of interest rates, so the prices of these annuities will increase in the near future.

While there can be several factors that influence retirees' decision to pay off their mortgage, one factor is whether your mortgage interest rate will exceed the rate you can earn on CDs, money market funds, and bonds. Lower interest rates on these investments can tilt that decision factor in favor of paying off your mortgage.

Interest rate fluctuations are one good reason to diversify your sources of retirement income. Ideally, you'll have significant sources of retirement income that aren't influenced by interest rates. This is one good reason to optimize your Social Security benefits and other sources of guaranteed retirement income, such as pensions and annuities.

In addition, it's a good idea to reexamine any outstanding loans you have. For instance, it's always a good idea to reduce credit card debt, since the rates credit card companies charge far exceed other consumer loan rates, even with the recent rate cut.

You may also want to examine whether lower interest rates can make it worthwhile for you to refinance your mortgage or take out a reverse mortgage. However, if you believe that future rate cuts are in the cards, you might decide that you'd reap more money by waiting.

Part of your retirement job is to continually monitor key economic events and consider how they might affect your finances. By doing so, and making the right changes to your finances, you could improve your finances by many thousands of dollars."
4 Leadership Lessons From Disruptive Businesses,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sallypercy/2024/09/27/4-leadership-lessons-from-disruptive-businesses/,2024-09-27T15:05:18Z,"Disruptive businesses change the world by inventing game-changing products and services that transform how we live, work and connect with each other. So, it's no surprise that the most successful business disruptors - Amazon, Apple and Google among them - are household names and some of the most valuable companies on Earth.

For my book, The Disruptors: How 15 Successful Businesses Defied the Norm, I studied 15 other disruptive and groundbreaking businesses of our time, from film company A24 through to social media platform TikTok. They all had valuable lessons to teach leaders looking to disrupt their own marketplace. Here are four of those lessons:

Disruptors aren't afraid of challenges. In fact, they positively welcome them. That's why many disruptive businesses are wrestling with some of society's biggest problems, including climate change. A good example is U.K.-based Octopus Energy, which has scaled at speed by delivering cheaper, greener energy to customers around the world.

Another disruptor that is helping to mitigate climate change is electric car maker Tesla. Tesla has helped to accelerate the shift to a low-carbon economy by building fast, attractive and high-performance electric cars. Nearly half of all battery-powered vehicles sold in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2024 were manufactured by Tesla.

German meal kit provider HelloFresh has built its brand on taking the pain out of mealtimes. In fact, it makes dinnertime super easy for busy people by sending them all the fresh and pre-measured ingredients they need to whip up a tasty and nutritious meal.

HelloFresh doesn't just offer its customers convenience, however. It offers them customization as well. Thanks to the simple online ordering system, customers can choose what goes in their food box and when they will receive it, while the available recipes cater to a wide range of diets, from vegetarian through to high protein. By offering a tailored service, HelloFresh has established itself as the world's most popular meal kit.

Home-sharing platform Airbnb was not the first website in the US to offer short-term property rentals. Yet it overtook competitors by developing a better platform and a more distinctive brand. In particular, Airbnb prioritized the creation of a user-friendly online experience, and it applied sophisticated algorithms to help guests locate their ideal accommodation. It also grounded its brand in the concept of community: a community of like-minded hosts and travelers all around the world.

Another effective executor is TikTok. Founded in China in 2016, the entertainment app was a comparatively late arrival to the social media market. Nevertheless, its short-form video content was so wildly popular that the app boasted 100 million users within a year of its launch. Before long, TikTok was a global phenomenon and today it boasts more than one billion monthly active users. TikTok's success can be attributed to its addictive and captivating content - which is created by its users - and its highly effective recommendation engine. This recommendation engine learns users' interests from their viewing habits and makes compelling, personalized recommendations that keep them hooked.

Deciem, the Toronto-based umbrella company behind beauty brands The Ordinary and NIOD, aims to be a force for good within the beauty industry. From the outset, it positioned itself as an incubator of innovative and effective beauty brands that deliver results to consumers - without necessarily bearing a high price tag.

In addition, Deciem is transparent about its product formulations, ingredients and pricing. It wants to educate people so that they understand exactly what they are putting on their skin and whether they are overpaying for products that just feature generic ingredients. ""We don't promise what isn't there,"" is the verdict of Deciem CEO Nicola Kilner."
Dockworkers are on the verge of a strike. Here's what you need to know,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5124956/dockworkers-strike-shipping-east-gulf-coast-ports,2024-09-27T14:39:04Z,"Some 25,000 dockworkers at East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, from Boston to Houston, could strike as early as October 1.

Their union, the International Longshoremen's Association, has been in contract talks with the United States Maritime Alliance, representing ocean carriers and port operators, for months. But the two sides have not met face-to-face since June.

The alliance this week filed charges with federal labor officials, arguing that the union is refusing to bargain. The union says the two sides have had multiple communications in recent weeks.

More than 170 industry groups, from the National Association of Manufacturers to the U.S. Dairy Export Council to the Fashion and Jewelry Trade Association, have urged the Biden administration to intervene, warning that a strike would have a devastating impact on the economy.

What's the stalemate about?

Two major sticking points are wages and automation. On wages, neither side has made their demands or offers public.

A statement from union president Harold Daggett suggested the union may be seeking a $5-an-hour increase in each year of a six-year agreement, raising the top hourly wage from $39 to $69 by the end of the contract.

The U.S. Maritime Alliance says its current offer includes ""industry leading wage increases."" West Coast dockworkers got 32% raises in their contract negotiations last year.

On automation, Daggett has been warning dockworkers that the foreign companies that operate the marine terminals are seeking to replace them with machines.

At ports around the world and even on the West Coast, advanced technology is already being used to move shipping containers.

The U.S. Maritime Alliance has said it's offered to keep the current ban on fully automated equipment and the requirement that any use of semi-automated equipment be negotiated.

In fact, the effect of automation on dockworkers isn't a completely settled matter. The shipping industry, backed by researchers at UC Berkeley, has made the argument that automation is helping ports stay competitive and handle more goods, which in turn creates demand for highly skilled workers.

The International Longshoremen's Association remains staunchly opposed.

Which ports would be affected?

There are 14 ports where dockworkers could strike, according to the U.S. Maritime Alliance. They are the Ports of Boston, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Norfolk, Wilmington, Charleston, Savannah, Jacksonville, Miami, Tampa, Mobile, New Orleans and Houston.

Dockworkers at West Coast ports are represented by a different union. They reached a new contract agreement last year after a prolonged negotiation.

What does this mean for goods coming from overseas?

It depends on the goods.

A lot of stuff flows through the East and Gulf Coast ports, everything from agricultural products to pharmaceuticals to heavy machinery to clothes, shoes and toys.

Those ports account for more than half of containerized imports, according to the National Association of Manufacturers.

With the labor dispute brewing, some retailers starting shipping goods earlier and have been diverting some shipments to the West Coast, says Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chains and customs for the National Retail Federation.

""We certainly hope there won't be empty store shelves,"" says Gold, noting the upcoming holidays. ""I think retailers are doing everything they can to ensure that won't happen.""

But a work stoppage could wreak immediate havoc for other businesses, including manufacturers who rely on ""just-in-time"" inventories for production of goods, and agricultural exporters who have a short window of time to get their products overseas.

And Gold notes, even a one-day shutdown would be damaging, as it would likely take several days to get operations up and running again.

What has the White House said?

The Biden administration says it's encouraged all parties to keep negotiating and to do so in good faith.

But the White House has made clear President Biden is not considering invoking the Taft-Hartley Act. Under the 1947 law, the President can ask a court to order an 80-day cooling off period when the nation's public health or safety is at risk.

In 2022, Biden was criticized for signing a measure that imposed a contract on freight rail workers, ending the possibility of a nationwide rail strike.

Ahead of the presidential election, the administration would likely not want to risk such blowback from labor groups, one of its key constituencies."
Vulnerable Dem senator ripped for votes on key 2024 Rust Belt issue: 'Lockstep' with Harris,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vulnerable-dem-senator-ripped-vote-key-rust-belt-issue-2024-lockstep-harris,2024-09-27T14:28:45Z,"Ohio GOP Senate candidate Bernie Moreno spoke to Fox News Digital about the migrant crisis in Springfield, Ohio, and why he believes Democrats have let residents down.

As fracking continues to be a key issue in many of the Rust Belt swing states that could decide the 2024 presidential election, incumbent Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing increased criticism from his GOP opponent for previously held positions on the matter.

In 2021, Brown was one of 43 senators to vote against a bill to ""establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to prohibiting the Council on Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency from promulgating rules or guidance that bans hydraulic fracturing in the United States.""

Brown also voted no on a motion in the Senate in 2022 giving states ""sole authority"" to permit and enforce fracking regulations.

While speaking to CNN in 2020, Brown suggested that most of the fracking jobs in Ohio go to ""out of state"" workers and that ""there just aren't that many jobs in fracking or, unfortunately, even coal in Ohio now"" when answering a question about his level of concern about Ohio workers losing their jobs in the fracking industry.

VULNERABLE DEM SENATOR RIPPED FOR IGNORING QUESTIONS ABOUT BIDEN'S PUSH TO 'BAN' GAS-POWERED CARS

Some estimates have suggested that fracking supports over 300,000 jobs in Ohio and contributed $55 billion to the state's economy in 2021.

When confronted by Fox News reporter Hillary Vaughn on the issue of fracking and VP Harris backing away from her position to ban fracking, Brown declined to call Harris out for changing positions and said he believes in an ""all of the above strategy.""

VULNERABLE DEM SENATOR FLIP-FLOPS ON SUPPLYING ENERGY TO CHINA IN MIDDLE OF RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN

Brown, who has been criticized for supporting the Biden administration's policies nearly 100% of the time according to the VoteView database maintained by UCLA political scientists, has bucked the Biden administration on certain issues related to climate change. However, his critics say he is more in line with the progressive ""Green New Deal,"" than he is the oil and gas industry in Ohio.

""Sherrod Brown is in lockstep with San Francisco liberal Kamala Harris on all of her radical policies, including a complete ban on fracking. Brown and Harris would rather rely on our adversaries for energy instead of using our resources here at home,"" Brown's GOP opponent, businessman Bernie Moreno, told Fox News Digital in a statement.

""In November, Ohioans will reject their radical, anti-energy agenda.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, a Brown campaign spokesperson said the senator ""supports fracking"" when it's ""done right.""

""Bernie Moreno is lying and trying to distract from his long record only looking out for himself -- from refusing to pay his employees the overtime they were owed and shredding the evidence to get out of it to selling the Chinese-made Buick Envision, which shipped Ohio jobs overseas,"" the spokesperson said.

""Sherrod has been clear that he supports fracking and shale development when it's done right and supports Ohio workers, has led legislation to connect Ohio workers with jobs in the shale and fracking industry, and has stood up to his own party to protect Ohio jobs.""

The campaign also pointed to a 2012 press release where Brown said, ""Shale development has tremendous potential to bring new economic development and new jobs to our state. Not only do we have to protect our public safety and health, but we must make sure that these new jobs are going to Ohioans -- not out-of-staters.""

The Ohio Senate race will be one of the most highly watched in the country as Republicans view the Buckeye State as a prime location to take back control of the Senate in a state that Trump won by eight points in 2020.

Spain Builds World's First High-Speed Hydrail Train,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariannelehnis/2024/09/27/spain-builds-worlds-first-high-speed-hydrail-train/,2024-09-27T13:42:07Z,"Hydrogen-powered railway technology began around 20 years ago with Japanese experiments and a tiny U.S. underground mining locomotive that used a fuel cell so it did not have to be taken out of service to charge its batteries. Since then, hydrogen electrochemical railway traction has progressed to trams, commuter and intercity trains, and switcher and freight locomotives.

Earlier this year, Spanish train building giant, Patentes Talgo S.L. or just ""Talgo,"" undertook to move hydrail -- hydrogen power railway traction -- over the finish line. Spain's Talgo is set to build the first-ever high-speed hydrail trains, named Europe's most efficient high-speed rail network last November in a report by engineering consultancy, Ineco. This will be another feather in the cap for Spain. Could this be the start of a more widespread transition to hydrogen-powered railway? And what are the cogs that need to turn to make this a reality?

Talgo is not Spain's first foray into hydrail. In 2006 Dr. Carlos Navas, then Chief Technical Officer of hydrail startup, NTDA Energìa, attended the Second International Hydrail Conference in Denmark. Soon after, he opened an NTDA Energìa office in Raleigh, North Carolina. Later, in Brussels, he headed the European Community's Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking. In 2008 Dr. Navas organized the Fourth International Hydrail Conference in Valencia. One of the first hydrail trams was demonstrated in Northern Spain by FEVE narrow gauge railways in 2011.

Talgo's undertaking will showcase the capability of hydrogen-powered transport. In the hydrail world, ""high‑speed"" marks the equivalent of evolving from hand-wired transistor devices to integrated chips.

""Most hydrail pioneers in academia and the rail industry didn't expect to see high-speed hydrail emerge anywhere near this soon,"" explains Stan Thompson, Co-founder of the Mooresville Hydrail Initiative. ""The scale limiting factor with hydrail is the amount of hydrogen that can be carried aboard to make the electric energy that powers the vehicle. The heavier and faster a rail vehicle or train is, the harder it is to store enough hydrogen onboard to move it fast enough and far enough.""

The gold standard in ""fast"" and ""far"" is high-speed rail. Until Talgo's hydrail breakthrough, the answer has been to leave the electric source stationary and have trains drag an electric contact along a fixed overhead wire (OHC) or a hot ""third rail"" beside the track to tap the grid's power.

OHC was invented in St. Petersburg, Russia, in the early 1880s. Now 144 years old, its been in use about twenty years longer than American steam rail's entire history.

OHC is proven and durable. Where it is already deployed, it's likely to continue in place until either the capital cost of refurbishing it, or the high labor cost of maintenance, justifies replacing it with wireless hydrail.

But there are two big reasons why OHC, with its advantages, isn't everywhere: it's ugly and it's very expensive.

""In cities, where billions have been spent to bury electrical and communications out of sight, OHC poles, guys and catenary wire are archaic eyesores,"" explains Thompson.

""The main factor limiting OHC deployment is its high capital and maintenance cost. OHC rolling stock actually costs a little less than self-powered diesel or hydrail equipment,"" he says. ""But the cost of the stationary plant needed to get power to the vehicle's onboard traction motors is huge.""

By comparison, a trackside hydrogen filling station can cost two million dollars; that's a lot -- but it powers the whole line. That same expenditure for OHC electrifies only about 900 feet of track. And, once installed, OHC maintenance runs to about $150,000 per mile every year.

So electrification requires a lot of traffic and revenue to be affordable. That translates to high population density, which is why most of Europe's rail network can justify electrification.

China also has a high population density and, until recently, had a booming economy that let them spring for 37,900 kilometers of OHC high‑speed rail. But if Talgo's high-speed hydrail lets the New World ""go wireless,"" it could act as a catalyst for further adoption of hydrogen-powered trains.

With just 90 people per square killometerSpain is the least densely populated country in Western Europe, except for Ireland. Compare Spain's 90 people/Km with 233 people/Km for Germany, with 277 people/Km for the United Kingdom or with 121/Km for France, and it's not surprising that Spain and Talgo would seek to be the first in Europe to develop a zero-carbon, high-speed hydrail service.

But with only 90/Km Spain's population is positively dense when compared with the USA's 37 people per Km or with Canada's 4.2 per Km. Spain's willingness to tackle the daunting volumetric H density engineering problem could totally change the electrification game for America's and Canada's comparatively wide-open spaces.

At its peak in 1930, US track electrification topped-out at about 3,100 miles of track. Today, that's down to about 1,778 miles. But the total amount of US track is also significantly reduced: roughly 140,000 miles, versus 249,000 miles back in 1930 when trains -- not airlines or interstate highways -- were the primary mode of intercity travel.

Growing population; climate concerns; airport terminal congestion; resistance to airport sprawl; diminished interest in driving; and sprouting interurban communities all increase the attractiveness of an interconnected American high-speed and regional hydrail network.

The U.S.'s first hydrogen fuel cell powered train opened this year between San Bernardino and Redlands, California. Swiss hydrail train maker Stadler's San Bernardino FLIRT train achieved a world-record of 3,000km without refuelling.

""If OHC can be supplanted by onboard power, high-speed rail should happen sooner and be much more widely deployed,"" says Thompson of the Mooresville Hydrail Initiative, which began integrating efforts of international hydrogen railway pioneers back in 2005. ""Talgo's about to take hydrail across the finish line.""

""For years,"" says Thompson, ""rail experts thought freight hydrail was beyond reach because not enough H could be squeezed onboard. Now Canadian Pacific Kansas City and CSX Railway have announced they'll sell other railroads kits for diesel-to-hydrogen locomotive conversion.""

Thompson coined the term-of-art ""hydrail"" in 2003 to demonstrate that introduction of hydrogen in the railway industry was a paradigm shift comparable to replacement of steam by diesel during the 1920s -- 40s."
Inflation Continues To Ease,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/09/27/inflation-continues-to-ease/,2024-09-27T13:22:49Z,"Stocks closed higher on Thursday as the S&P 500 set yet another new high, making the total count 42. The S&P 500 closed higher by 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6% while the Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 and 0.6%, respectively. We'll see if markets can hit their 43rd new high of year following this morning's Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report.

Ahead of this morning's PCE report, forecasts called for core PCE to be up 0.2% month-over-month and 2.7% year-over-year. While the annual number came in as expected, the monthly number was just 0.1%. This would seemingly suggest inflation is well under control, giving the Fed room with respect to lowering interest rates. Prior to the PCE report, the CME Fed Watch Tool was evenly split on a rate cut of 25 or 50 basis points in November. Following the economic news, those odds were unchanged.

Some individual stock performances from Thursday worth noting include Coinbase. Shares of Coinbase jumped 7% on Thursday. That company's stock is very closely correlated with bitcoin which has been flirting with $65 thousand after falling to just above $45 thousand back in August. Micron shares soared nearly 15% Thursday after the chip maker reported strong earnings. Shares of Super Micro Computer fell 12% after it was learned the server maker is being investigated for accounting fraud.

Also, Chinese stocks had another strong outing. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF gained 8% as additional stimulus measures were announced by China. This time, it was a lowering of bank reserve requirements to encourage greater lending that boosted stocks. Chinese stocks are up nearly 16% this week following massive stimulus plans. This has the feeling of the government throwing everything, including the kitchen sink, at the economy. While the impact has been positive for stocks thus far, I think it's worth questioning what else the government can do if these measures fall short.

Among the stocks I'm watching today is Costco. The company beat on revenues: however, same store sales were soft, and that stock is trading lower by 1.4% in premarket. DirectTV is in talks to buy Dish. Dish is owned by EchoStar, while DirectTV is owned by AT&T. Both companies have seen their subscriber numbers fall, losing customers to competitors such as Google's YouTube TV. A merger could open opportunities for more competitive pricing and would also include Dish's Sling TV service.

Another potentially major story that hasn't been getting much coverage is a looming strike at ports stretching from Maine to Texas. The current contract under which laborers are working is set to expire Monday. If a new contract isn't reached by then, around 45 thousand workers could strike. The financial impact of a strike is estimated to cost the U.S. economy $5 billion per day according to an analyst at JPMorgan. Automakers could be among the industries particularly hard hit.

One other item of interest that I'm watching is market volatility. The VIX is sitting just below 16 at the moment. With the market making new highs, you might expect volatility to be much lower. But I think what you see happening is a lot of demand for protection in the form of option put buying. When that type of demand is prevalent, it often tends to be a contrarian indicator and bullish for stocks. It's when the demand subsides, and investors are less fearful that stocks may fall.

Following this week's PCE data, next week will be a big week of economic data with the latest employment figures scheduled for release next Friday. Then, two weeks from today, earnings season will kick off and we'll hear from, among others, JPMorgan. Therefore, we are heading into a period of heavy economic data and earnings news. I'll have more on both of those next week, but for now, it may be a good time to take inventory of existing positions and how you want to be positioned.

For today, I want to see how the market digests the PCE data. As I've mentioned, we have set 42 record highs in the S&P 500 this year and the recent strength has come despite the fact that market darling Nvidia is relatively unchanged for the quarter. In fact, as of Thursday's close 80% of the stocks in the S&P 500 are trading above their 50-day moving average and nearly the same number are trading above their 200-day moving average, suggesting the rally is quite broad-based. Let's see if we can continue moving higher with broad market participation. As always, I would stick with your investing plan and long-term objectives."
30% Gains Left For BP Stock?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/27/30-gains-left-for-bp-stock/,2024-09-27T13:10:59Z,"With the stock down 7% so far this year, at the current price of around $32 per share, we believe BP plc stock (NYSE: BP), a European integrated energy major, could go higher in the long term. BP's underlying replacement cost profit (used as a proxy for net profit) was up 4% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $2.8 billion in Q2 2024. Its Q2 revenue declined 3% y-o-y to $47 billion, mainly due to lower product and crude prices, and its adjusted EPADS (Earnings per American Depository Share) grew 12% y-o-y to $1.00. BP has disclosed plans to implement an additional $3.5 billion share buyback program for the second half of 2024, supplementing its initial $3.5 billion commitment for the first half of the fiscal year. This incremental program represents approximately 3.5% of the company's current market capitalization, potentially providing support to the stock price. The company has also reaffirmed its intention to repurchase shares worth at least $14 billion by 2025, potentially yielding further benefits for shareholders. Concurrently, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per ADS, marking a 10% increase from the previous dividend payout.

BP reduced its net debt by $1.4 billion (from Q1 2024) to $22.6 billion, largely driven by strong operating cash flows (up 30% y-o-y to $8.1 billion). Its debt level was $23.7 billion at the end of Q2 2023 (a year ago level). It is worth mentioning that OPEC+ has decided to extend cutbacks on oil production through 2025 to support prices by warding off a surplus. Given the weaker global demand, and going by the expected slowdown in the U.S. economy and China's weaker-than-expected post-pandemic recovery, the cutback on production will likely persist. BP also expects its EBITDA to grow across oil and gas, and refining - underpinning the delivery of its 2025 target of $46 billion to $49 billion.

BP is one of a handful of stocks that have increased their value in each of the last 3 years, but that still wasn't enough for it to consistently beat the market Returns for the stock were 36% in 2021, 39% in 2022, and 6% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period.

Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BP face a similar situation as it did in 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

For the full year 2024, BP expects both reported and underlying upstream production to be slightly higher compared with 2023. Within this, BP expects underlying production from oil production & operations to be higher and production from gas & low-carbon energy to be lower. It also expects capital expenditure, including inorganic capital expenditure, to be around $16 billion in 2024 - and continues to expect the phasing to be split broadly evenly between the first half and the second half. BP continues to expect divestment and other proceeds of $2-3 billion in 2024, weighted toward the second half. BP also continues to expect to reach $25 billion of divestment and other proceeds between the second half of 2020 and 2025.

We forecast BP revenues to be $212 billion for the fiscal year 2024, up marginally y-o-y. Looking at the bottom line, we now forecast earnings per share to come in at $4.26. Given our revenues and EPS forecast changes, we have revised BP Valuation to $41 per share, based on a $4.26 expected EPS and a 9.6x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2024. That said, the company's stock appears cheap at the current levels, with our valuation at a 29% premium from the current market price.

Beyond oil and gas production, BP also invests heavily in charging stations, biofuels, hydrogen fuels, and fueling stations. As of 2023, more than 30% of its total spending was allocated to these businesses, up from 3% in 2019. Initially, the company demonstrated leadership in the energy sector by pledging to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier. However, in a revised commitment, the organization has now set a target to reduce its overall emissions by 35% to 40% by the end of the current decade. This adjustment reflects a recalibration of the company's climate strategy, acknowledging the necessity to continue investing in oil and gas operations to meet ongoing demand.

Hydrogen is an integral part of the company's strategy, and it plans to capture 10% of the hydrogen market in its core business areas. Consequently, it pushes for hydrogen projects across the U.K., Europe, the U.S., and Australia. As a whole, the European oil major has invested more in non-hydrocarbon energy than other U.S. oil majors have. BP acquired Archaea Energy (a renewable natural gas production company based in the U.S.) in late 2022 to expand its bioenergy business. The company also agreed to acquire TravelCenters of America, a leading travel center operator, in early 2023. As part of its heavy investment in renewable energy, BP hopes to build 20 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2025 and 50 GW by 2030. Currently, it has a joint venture with Equinor to build offshore wind energy facilities in the U.S.

SAP BrandVoice: The Future Of Packaging: 4 Ways Businesses Unwrap Opportunities,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2024/09/27/the-future-of-packaging-4-ways-businesses-unwrap-opportunities/,2024-09-27T12:33:58Z,"Modern-day packaging is a benefit and a burden. Without it, medicine, food and countless other products would be unavailable for mass consumption. At the same time, waste from packaging has given rise to one of the biggest environmental crises of our time.

Over 400 million metric tons of plastic was produced in 2022. Its versatility, affordability and convenience has made it the preferred product of the packaging industry, which accounts for 31% of global plastic consumption. Most is designed for single use and has contributed to an excess of 350 million metric tons of plastic waste each year. If the world continues on this trajectory, plastic waste could triple by 2060.

The environmental effects of plastic can be measured by the carbon emissions it generates (1.8 billion tons in 2019 equating to 3.3% of global emissions) and its impact to land and oceans. While images of plastic washing up on beaches is certainly alarming, it's only half the story. Plastics block waterways, contribute to the spreading of disease and suffocate entire ecosystems.

How can we reimagine the future of packaging?

Governments are already introducing plastic taxes and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations to incentivize sustainable practices and hold businesses accountable for the lifecycle impacts of their products. These measures are designed to start internalizing the environmental costs associated with the production, use and disposal of packaging, taking responsibility away from consumers and municipalities.

These two types of regulation will encourage the adoption of less harmful alternative materials such as bioplastics and stimulate businesses to embrace circular solutions to minimize waste and keep finite resources in circulation. They will force companies to reimagine their product packaging, supply chain and waste management strategies.

EPR rules require companies to design products for durability, reparability and recyclability and meet performance targets related to waste reduction, recycling rates and environmental impact mitigation. Companies will be required to report against the targets for their jurisdiction and will be monitored for compliance. Failure to comply may result in penalties, fines or other sanctions.

Plastic taxes, on the other hand, are financial measures implemented by governments to discourage the use of plastic products and encourage the use of more sustainable alternatives. Taxes can take different forms and can be applied to different stages of the plastic product lifecycle.

In order to comply with these new regulations, it is clear companies will need to take their data collection, analysis and exchange capabilities to the next level.

According to a recent survey conducted by SAP in Italy, Portugal and Spain, most businesses (74% of respondents) are aware of upcoming packaging regulation, however the majority (68% of respondents) still need to make 'moderate' to 'significant' changes in order to comply. While most businesses intend to increase the use of recycled materials, and the ability to recycle packaging, very few are tracking data for compliance reporting.

This is perhaps unsurprising when individual countries are charting their own course to address the challenges presented by plastic waste. The result is a baffling landscape of policies which vary in scope, stringency and focus which makes determining strategy difficult for companies that span various jurisdictions.

Such companies may welcome the much-anticipated global treaty to end plastic pollution which is due to be agreed later this year. The UN Plastics Treaty could be instrumental in eliminating some of the complexity and regional inconsistencies.

While new regulation may pose operational, financial and reporting challenges, it also offers opportunities for companies like Vytal to innovate, unlock efficiencies, build stronger relationships with customers and differentiate themselves from their competitors.

Vytal provides reusable food and drink containers. Through the use of RFID technology on each item they supply, companies can track every movement of every item. This granular level of tracking brings value chain players closer together and provides an opportunity for companies to build customer relationships thanks to QR codes linking them to games, competitions, surveys and other experiences.

""Leveraging data can not only help businesses access efficiencies and minimize costs but also create value where it didn't exist before,"" said Tim Breker, Founder of Vytal.

SAP has identified four priority strategies companies can employ to manage plastic taxes and EPR regulations:

1. Establish the data infrastructure needed for reporting and tax compliance

While most businesses collect some data related to environmental performance and waste management, data gaps and challenges remain. The main areas of difficulty relate to material composition and classification (particularly for composite materials), supply chain transparency, trade flows across different jurisdictions, and data integration for lifecycle analysis.

To address these challenges, companies must invest in data infrastructure as well as establish standardized processes for data collection. Two other requirements are interoperability standards and data exchange protocols to allow data integration across the packaging supply chain.

2. Promote a circular supply chain

To reduce their reliance on finite resources companies must embrace circular economy strategies such as recycling, part-harvesting, remanufacturing, repair, refurbishment and re-commerce. This involves retaining control over the entire lifecycle of their products, materials and components.

There are a plethora of ways a company can embrace the circular economy in packaging from investing in technologies to improving recycling rates to moving to closed loop supply chain models where products are continuously reused.

3. Collaborate for compliance and circularity

Isolated efforts will not win the war on plastic pollution. Collaboration is required both internally, across departments, and externally with partners up and down the value chain. With collaboration comes the opportunity to share knowledge and data which leads to innovation and the co-creation of solutions.

By joining industry coalitions designed to boost the circular economy, companies can be involved in driving collective action across their sector.

4. Prepare now for a truly circular economy going forward

To guarantee long-term success on a resource constrained planet, companies should not wait to embrace circular models. By starting now, they can benefit from resource efficiencies and cost savings, tap into new revenue streams and market opportunities, mitigate risks and build more business resilience and gain a competitive advantage..

For businesses to take a responsible approach to packaging and embark on a sustainable future they must embrace a strategic mindset that includes:

Is your business ready to re-imagine the future of packaging?"

A boost to Chinese stocks helped lift American markets Thursday.

The rally stemmed from Beijing's indication that it is willing to deploy hundreds of billions in economic stimulus, plus the country's central bank said Wednesday it would slash interest rates by the steepest amount ever.

The 20 largest Chinese companies dually listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq tacked on $71 billion of market capitalization in the U.S., led by e-commerce giants Alibaba and Temu parent Pinduoduo.

It marks a shift as the Chinese government brings out the ""big guns"" to spur growth, hedge fund billionaire David Tepper told CNBC's Squawk Box.

Hurricane Helene made landfall southeast of Tallahassee as a Category 4 storm late Thursday, with maximum sustained wind speeds of 140 mph -- the most powerful storm to strike the Florida Big Bend region. The storm barrelled into Georgia early on Friday as a Category 1, as authorities warned of life-threatening winds, heavy rains and catastrophic storm surges. More than 2 million homes and businesses are without power.

Healthcare software company Epic Systems is facing an antitrust lawsuit from startup Particle Health, which helps retrieve and analyze medical records, alleging it is a ""monopolist"" in the electronic health records market. Epic, which generated $4.9 billion in revenue in 2023, is the dominant player in the hospital EHR market, still, experts say it's a hard case to win and there won't be a ""smoking gun.""

Bettencourt Meyers overtook Walmart scion Alice Walton, who landed in the No. 1 spot about three weeks ago.

The cofounder of failed robotruck startup TuSimple is making a comeback attempt, raising $20 million for his new company, Bot Auto. The company plans to begin commercial trucking operations in 2025, and unlike TuSimple, which delisted shares early this year after a major implosion, Bot Auto will own and operate its trucks directly.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams was charged with bribery and fraud after allegedly receiving illegal campaign donations from the Turkish government, according to an indictment unsealed Thursday. The charges follow a monthslong investigation, but Adams rejected calls for him to resign, saying, ""I will continue to do the job that I was elected to do.""

MORE: Still, Adams can be forcibly removed from office, either by New York Governor Kathy Hochul or an ""inability committee,"" and the city's Public Advocate Jumaane Williams is next in the line.

TOPLINE When a recall rocks the food industry as much as the deadly listeria outbreak linked to a Boar's Head factory in Jarratt, Virginia has, the CEO or owners typically get in front of the news and try to instill a sense of calm. But the families behind the 119-year-old deli meat purveyor have been oddly silent, underscoring how secretive Boar's Head has become.

A letter about the recall of more than 7 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat products posted on the company website -- ""This is a dark moment in our company's history but we intend to use this as an opportunity to enhance food safety programs not just for our company, but for the entire industry."" -- is signed simply from ""Boar's Head."" A lone company spokesperson has been cited in media reports, and the company refuses to even confirm who the current CEO or chairman is.

Now, in the aftermath of the deaths of at least 10 people and with nearly 60 hospitalized across some 19 states, according to the CDC, the company that took a century to become the biggest deli meat brand in America is facing an existential threat -- with multiple civil lawsuits, and talks of a congressional hearing as well as a Department of Justice investigation that could come with criminal charges.

But the warring families who founded Boar's Head seem more concerned about a series of petty legal battles over the billion-dollar brand.

""All of this was completely preventable,"" says lawyer Bill Marler, whose Seattle law firm, Marler Clark, specializes in claims for food recall victims and filed a lawsuit against Boar's Head on behalf of a survivor. ""They were better at growing listeria than they were at making food for human consumption.""

WHY IT MATTERS ""This is one of the deadliest recalls due to listeria in years -- and lawyers claim it was easily prevented,"" says Forbes staff writer Chloe Sorvino. ""The families of victims want to see Boar's Head held accountable.""

What's Happening With BUD Stock?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/27/why-is-anheuser-busch-inbev-stock-down-10/,2024-09-27T12:08:40Z,"Anheuser-Busch InBev stock (NYSE: BUD) has barely seen a 10% rise in value since early January 2023 - rising from levels of $58 then to $63 now - vs. an increase of 50% for the S&P 500 over this period. In comparison, its peer - Diageo stock (NYSE: DEO) - has seen a 20% fall over this period. The rise in BUD stock can primarily be attributed to an 8% rise in its revenue per share, while the company's P/S ratio has remained stable at around 2.1x revenues over this period.

Notably, the performance of BUD stock with respect to the index in recent years has been quite volatile. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. But how could BUD stock possibly regain its footing and rise again? Let's delve into the company's revenue prospects to begin with.

Anheuser-Busch InBev's revenue has risen 3.7% from $57.8 billion in 2022 to $59.9 billion in the last twelve months. This can largely be attributed to a 9% fall in sales in North America, while Middle Americas, Latin America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific saw sales rise. The decline in North America can primarily be attributed to the backlash to its brief partnership with a transgender influencer to promote Bud Light beer. On the positive side, its adjusted net income margin has remained stable around 10% since 2022, aiding its earnings growth.

The company has seen some rebound in North America lately, with sales declining at a moderate pace, down 1.3% in Q2 this year, compared to around a 9% fall in the prior-year quarter. Its volumes have also trended marginally lower in the previous quarter, down 0.8% y-o-y. Although the company posted revenue growth, it fell short of the street estimates. However, the company managed to beat on earnings with better profit margins.

Looking forward, we expect the sales to rise at a mid-single-digit average annual growth rate over the next three years. With the interest rate cut cycle underway, the consumer sentiment is expected to improve in the U.S. and China. While the impact of lower rates to flow through the economy may take some time, the consumer confidence should improve going forward owing to controlled inflation. This should bode well for Anheuser-Busch InBev. Still, its stock is already trading at around 18x forward earnings, versus its average P/E ratio of 19x over the last two years, we think there is only a little room left for growth. We estimate Anheuser-Busch InBev's valuation to be $70 per share, reflecting just 10% upside from its current levels of $63.

While BUD stock looks like it has little room for growth, it is helpful to see how Anheuser-Busch InBev peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons."
"Will Disney Stock Recover To $200, Embracing Netflix's Playbook?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/27/will-disney-stock-recover-to-200-embracing-netflixs-playbook/,2024-09-27T11:02:20Z,"Disney stock currently trades at $93 per share, about 53% below its pre-inflation peak of about $200, seen on March 8, 2021. Several factors have driven the sell-off. Disney's streaming business has been experiencing slower subscriber growth and increasing competition. The linear TV business has also underperformed recently due to lower advertising and declining affiliate revenues in the domestic market. There are concerns in the theme park business as well. Although the business has been a solid performer post-Covid-19 reopening, the near-term outlook appears mixed as Disney anticipates higher costs and a normalization in attendance levels. Over Q3 FY'24, the parks business saw revenue increase by a mere 2% year-over-year to $8.4 billion, while operating profit fell 3%. While Disney stock hit a low of about $80 in October 2023, it has since recovered slightly after experiencing considerable volatility, as the streaming business - which Disney has invested considerably into in recent years - approaches profitability.

Looking over the last three years, DIS stock has performed worse than the broader market. Returns for the stock were -15% in 2021, -44% in 2022, and 4% in 2023.

In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could DIS face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?

Now, the stock could have considerable potential for gains if it recovers to 2021 levels. Returning to the pre-inflation shock level means that Disney stock will have to gain about 113% if the stock recovers from $93 currently to its pre-shock highs of about $200 per share. A couple of factors could drive Disney stock higher. Disney has been increasingly focusing on boosting profitability for its streaming business. Over Q3, Disney's three flagship streaming services Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ reported about $47 million in operating profits, versus a loss of $512 million in the year-ago period. Given the largely fixed costs and limited marginal costs, streaming can become a big cash cow for Disney. Although subscriber growth has been moderating, with U.S. and Canada subscriber adds for the last quarter coming in at just about 1 million, Disney is looking at ways to make more money off its existing subscriber base. Disney has been consistently increasing pricing for its services including Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus. While Disney+ launched at $6.99 per month back in 2016, prices stand at $14 currently and are set to rise to $16. Disney has also embraced ad-supported plans, which could deliver higher average per-customer revenues, while also starting to crack down on password sharing. The company says that users who wish to share an account with someone outside of their household can add an extra member for $9.99 on the ad-free plan. This is very similar to the playbook that Netflix has used over the past two years, to considerable success. Netflix stock has grown almost 2.5x over the last two years.

However, we presently estimate Disney valuation to be around $116 per share, which is about 23% ahead of the current market price. While Disney stock is undervalued, we think that the upside for the company in the near term could be limited by a mixed economy and weaker consumer confidence which are likely to impact its parks business, which has been a big profit driver in recent years. Disney's Experiences reporting segment, which includes theme parks and cruise liners, accounted for about 70% of the company's total operating profit last year. Our detailed analysis of Disney's upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company's stock during the turbulent market conditions seen recently. It compares these trends to the stock's performance during the 2008 recession.

In contrast, here's how DIS stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.

DIS stock declined from nearly $29 in October 2007 to $17 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying that the stock lost over 40% of its value through the drawdown. However, the stock rebounded strongly to over $32 by early 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach 1,124.

Disney Fundamentals Over Recent Years

Disney's revenues have risen from around $65 billion in 2020 to about $89 billion over the last 12 months, as the company's theme park business saw footfalls and average spending rebound as Covid-19 lockdowns were eased. Higher revenues from the streaming business have also contributed to top line growth. While the company posted a net loss of about $2.9 billion in 2020, as the theme park operations struggled amid the Covid-19 surge, net income picked up to $2.35 billion by FY'23.

Conclusion

With the Fed's monetary easing now underway, and Disney's streaming business turning around, the stock has the potential for gains.

Opinion | Black women voters' top issue shouldn't surprise anyone,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/black-women-voters-economy-harris-rcna172851,2024-09-27T10:50:19Z,"Over the past few weeks, MSNBC legal analyst Melissa Murray and I traveled across the country to explore what Black women from the cities to the suburbs are thinking about in the upcoming election. In every conversation, the economy came up as their top concern. They want to know the person they support has a plan to address their needs.

In this election, Vice President Kamala Harris is the only candidate who fits that bill.

On Wednesday, the vice president detailed her economic agenda with a speech and an interview with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle in Pittsburgh. From a campaign perspective, she hit all the marks one would want from a candidate in appearances like these. She was personable. Though she rarely speaks publicly about caring for her mother after her cancer diagnosis, she went into details that anyone who has had to care for a loved one could identify with.

Importantly, Harris also spoke in great detail about her plans, but one didn't need to be an economist to follow the conversation. Her explanation of how her plan to provide $25,000 in down-payment assistance to first-time homeowners would serve as a path forward to build intergenerational wealth was reasonable. When she spoke of her plan to boost a tax deduction for small businesses to $50,000, she made the connection to how that helps startups get off the ground. This level of accessibility is crucial and could make a difference among undecided voters.

In Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, Melissa and I spoke with a young voter named Clarke who just finished her master's degree. She told us that out of 20 classmates, just four were able to land jobs after graduation and that many young people are at a moment when they are being crushed by inflation. Voters like Clarke understand the stakes in this election and are searching for real solutions to ease their economic pain.

Blue Bell is an affluent suburb of Philadelphia that both presidential candidates have targeted. Democrats have made gains there, netting 40,000 more votes in 2020 than they did in 2016 -- a big reason Joe Biden carried the state in the last election. This is a suburb where the margins will matter, and how Black voters and younger voters overall show up to the polls could determine not only the winner of the state, but possibly the entire election.

On the campaign trail, Harris has been building the framework to help voters like Clarke. Harris calls it her ""opportunity economy."" Notably, she doesn't just say the phrase; she explains what it means for people in their lives. Her plan is to increase financial security for all Americans, no matter their backgrounds. In her speech this week to the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, Harris focused on growing America's workforce. She connected her vision to her own middle-class upbringing, effortlessly delivering her plans for practical goals that would push America into a brighter tomorrow.

While Harris laid out her economic policies, she also didn't miss an opportunity to needle her opponent. During her MSNBC interview, Harris said former President Donald Trump is ""just not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues. And one must be serious and have a plan, and a real plan, that's not just about some talking point ending in an exclamation at a political rally.""

Harris and Trump have very different visions of how to run the most powerful economy in the world. Frankly, when it comes to Trump's economic vision, it isn't hard to flush out. He is, as The New York Times' Jim Tankersley puts it, using a ""hammer and bullhorn"" approach. He wants to force companies to lower prices, without a clear understanding of how the markets work, and then somehow tariff his way to economic prosperity. The small-government conservatives where I grew up in Nebraska will tell you that isn't likely to work.

Trump's economic pitch is so disconnected from reality that even Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blasted Trump's tariff proposals as a price hike for American consumers.

Earlier this month, Trump was asked what he would do to tackle the high cost of child care. His response was an incoherent rant about tariffs on China -- a nonsensical answer that didn't list a single solution. He has shown to voters he doesn't understand the realities of child care in America, one of the biggest costs for families. In contrast, Harris' plan is clear and simple to understand: Expand the child tax credit.

And we all know Trump doesn't have a plan to lower costs of health care. Instead, he claims to have a concept of a plan. Dii, a North Carolina voter Melissa and I spoke with in Washington, D.C., said a plan for affordable health care will be on her mind when she casts her ballot. Voters are paying attention.

I think voters tend to give Republicans the benefit of the doubt on the economy because for years they have just claimed to be better, although they were never good at backing it up with actual policy. This November, unspecified ""concepts"" just won't cut it with Black women.

Harris and Trump aren't the only candidates on the ballot this November. Eleven states will select new governors, control of the U.S. Senate is on the line, and every member of the U.S. House of Representatives is up for re-election. For candidates up and down the ballot, strong turnout from Black women could make the difference in victory or defeat.

Black women are often spoken of as the backbone of the Democratic Party. They are definitely consistent when it comes to showing up to vote, but their vote isn't owned by one political party. It needs to be earned. And for Black women concerned about the economy, Harris has done a lot to earn it."
Blocking The Nippon-US Steel Deal Would Undermine National Security,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/beltway/2024/09/27/blocking-the-nippon-us-steel-deal-would-undermine-national-security/,2024-09-27T10:42:43Z,"After months of signaling disapproval of Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel, President Biden deferred his decision on the fate of that deal until after the election. Hopefully that buys him time to appreciate the enormous economic and geopolitical costs of blocking that transaction on national security grounds. An honest assessment will find the proposed acquisition does not threaten national security, but the president's rejection of the deal definitely would.

One need not be hawkishly predisposed to notice that threats to U.S. critical infrastructure and our commercial and strategic interests are proliferating. It should also be obvious that those threats do not come from Japan, but predominantly from China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The governments in those countries are intent on undermining U.S. power and influence, and the institutions and alliances that reinforce that power and influence. It would be a colossal mistake to assist our adversaries in their efforts by carelessly poisoning our own relationship with Japan.

There is no national security threat from the proposed steel deal. There is a long-struggling, iconic U.S. steel company that made a series of bad investment decisions over the years, fell behind other domestic steel producers in terms of productivity, profitability, and the capacity to innovate and meet increasingly rigorous environmental standards. Once the world's largest steel producer, U.S. Steel today ranks 24 in terms of production volume.

Fortunately for U.S. Steel's shareholders and employees, there is a knight in shining armor. The world's fourth largest producer, Nippon Steel, is offering a significant premium over market value to purchase the struggling company in order to produce, finish, and sell steel in the U.S. market, employing U.S. labor, paying U.S. taxes, and making capital improvements and greenfield investments in a variety of U.S. states.

These investments will generate business activity up and down domestic supply chains and reduce input costs for U.S. steel-consuming industries. Meanwhile, Nippon's successful business practices, technological knowhow, and green steel production capabilities will be adapted to the domestic environment for the benefit of the U.S. economy. What is so threatening about all that?

Bogus national security rationalizations for economic interventions have become more common since 2017, when the Trump administration imposed across-the-board tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. The administration justified those trade barriers as imperative to national security because - it claimed - the U.S. economy had become too reliant on imported steel and aluminum and their solution was to incentivize domestic production by raising the cost of imports.

The like-minded Biden administration adopted that logic when it continued the tariffs it inherited, so it should be applauding Nippon's offer. Instead, the deal has been under scrutiny as a possible risk to national security. Responsibility for such determinations falls to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which is composed of nine cabinet secretaries and chaired by the Treasury Secretary and was established by executive order in the 1970s before being codified as law under the Defense Production Act in 1988.

The transactions that typically come to the attention of CFIUS are those with narrow sets of concerns about protecting the defense industrial base and preventing adversaries or malicious actors from gaining control of critical infrastructure or accessing advanced technology with military applications. For example, in 2007, when the September 11 terrorist attacks were fresh in mind, the statute was strengthened after security concerns were raised when a company associated with a Middle Eastern country tried to purchase and operate certain port services in New York City. The law was revised again in 2018 amid worsening relations with China in order to counter Beijing's evolving techniques for acquiring critical U.S. technologies.

A CFIUS review is a blunt instrument for a transaction as obviously benign as a close ally's proposed investment in the domestic steel industry. Japan is a major trading partner and steadfast ally of the United States in a world where U.S. commitment to the rules-based trading system and its willingness to continue its traditional global leadership role are increasingly in doubt.

Blocking the deal would reinforce perceptions that the United States is turning inward and trigger contingency plans. It would further weaken incentives abroad to continue to honor the rules and maintain open markets. It would undermine already eroding trust in U.S. leadership. And it would invite discriminatory treatment of U.S. companies and investments abroad. As the world's largest outbound foreign investor, its top destination for inbound investment, and a major importer and exporter, the United States (and its businesses) has much to lose economically.

Most concerning, that loss of trust would frustrate US-led efforts to counter China's predatory, mercantilist practices by discouraging Japan and other allies in Asia from diversifying critical supply chains away from China's coercive influence. Indeed, Washington may find that after several years of subtly (and not so subtly) pressuring third countries into choosing between the United States and China, it doesn't like the choices they made.

Opposition to this steel industry transaction has nothing to do with national security and everything to do with domestic politics. Those fleeting politics put long-standing U.S. alliances and U.S. security at risk. Let's hope the Biden administration connects these dots and comes to its senses."
"Yellow Gold Is Hot, Diamonds Are Not At Hong Kong Jewelry Trade Show",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonydemarco/2024/09/27/yellow-gold-is-hot-diamonds-are-not-at-hong-kong-jewelry-trade-show/,2024-09-27T10:32:57Z,"The pulse of the jewelry industry and its relationship with the constantly changing world is reflected each year at Jewellery & Gem World Hong Kong (JGWHK).

This year the annual jewelry trade show attracted more than 3,300 exhibitors, a 5% decline from 2023, according to Informa Markets, which owns and operates the fair. Although final buyer numbers aren't available, walking the floors on the first four days, it's easy to see that foot traffic was down as well. Still the show is expected to attract about 50,000 visitors.

More important than the numbers themselves is what they represent. A major typhoon in the Shanghai area a few days before the show began meant many exhibitors and buyers from the area could not immediately make the trip to Hong Kong. Obviously, war in Ukraine and in Gaza has kept people in these regions from attending. After years of exponential growth, the U.S. jewelry market has softened, partly due to the upcoming presidential election. The China market has softened as well, reflecting the country's overall economic challenges. These are the two largest markets in the world for jewelry. Then for the first time in memory, the fair coincided with the Mid-Autumn Festival on September 18, which further reduced overall attendance, at least temporarily.

For a fair that has been held during trade wars, citywide political protests and a once-in-a-century typhoon, these distractions were mild by comparison. Through it all JGWHK remains, by far, the largest jewelry trade fair in the world, and for good reason.

This is the first time I've attended the fair since the COVID pandemic and much of it seems to be the same as prior years. This is a fair where people come to do business and everything else is secondary. There are no celebrities promoting brands. New product releases are far and few. Instead, the marketplace was in full effect.

The trade show is so large it is held at two convention facilities with staggered dates: AWE September 16 - 20 for jewelry-making materials and the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC), September 18 - 22, in the center of Hong Kong for finished jewelry. I attended the first two days at each facility.

At the AWE, the colored gem, diamond, and pearl dealers were out in force, making deals with large manufacturers, designers and high jewelry artists. On any given moment, you may see Swiss high jewelers talking sapphires with gem dealers from Sri Lanka, Aussie black opal dealers selling their material to French manufacturers, and Japanese pearl dealers selling to Indian manufacturers.

On the first day of the show, French high jewelry artist, Lydia Courteille, was looking for gemstones for her large elaborate pieces. She is one of several high jewelry artists, such as Christian Hemmerle of German high jewelry house, Hemmerle, and Indian high jeweler, Neha Dani, regularly attend the fair. I later learned that Chinese high jewelry artist, Feng J, and Hong Kong high jewelry, Wallace Chan, were in the AWE looking for material.

One change since I last attended were areas dedicated to lab-grown diamonds, which despite the natural diamond industry's best efforts, has become part of the fabric of a diverse jewelry industry.

Fuli Gemstones was most likely one of the only exhibitors at AWE not selling its material. The company owns a peridot mine in central China. Peridot is a gemstone with a transparent electric green-yellow color. It's one of the few gems that occur in just one color. It's well-known in the industry but not highly used. It's rarer than most gemstones and can be used as a featured gem or to add highlights to jewels.

Fuli Gemstones CEO, Pia Tonna, and her team were showing some of the material from the mine to prospective buyers, including a bright 301-carat rough, useful secondary materials such as olivine that the mine produces, two new proprietary gem shapes the company created, and two jewelry watches with its dials and bezels topped with peridot mele (gems that typically weight less than 0.15 carats). While the mine is in the geological research phase of development, Tonna, a veteran mine executive, has been tirelessly promoting its gems around the world.

""This is the largest deposit of peridot in the world, and when it gets around full capacity it will account to around 64% of the market share, which is huge,"" Tonna says. ""It's distinctive. It's got this amazing green color, it's clean, (so) it doesn't need any treatment (a rarity among gems). It's an interesting gemstone. It's been in history for over 1,000 years but people forgot about it.""

She says based on the geological surveys about 10% will result in rough stones of hundreds of carats each, about 30% will be three to five carats, another 30% of five to ten carats. The remainder are smaller pieces of less than a carat. Several are even smaller and can be cut for mele. Because of its bright green sparkle, it can be used as an affordable alternative to diamond mele.

""This mine produces literally a pyramid of production, so we can supply all the high jewelry brands if we want. We can supply the bit market, we can support the young designers, and we can do calibrated goods,"" she said. ""It's really versatile.""

At the HKCEC, exhibitors of finished jewels range from inexpensive mass-produced fashion items to some of the most impressive high jewels you will see at any trade fair of this scale. Buyers are retailers (large and small) from all over the world looking to stock their stores with pieces that will appeal to their customers.

The most crowded area of the fair for the first two days was the section for vintage and antique jewels, and according to exhibitors, retailers from China and other countries were buying, except for diamonds, which is being hit by mine overproduction and competition from less expensive lab-grown diamonds.

Ioannis Alexandris, owner of Gemolithos, which specializes in antique and period jewels, had a crowded booth throughout the first two days. On the second day he said he made a few big sales to some of his important Asian clients. The more common merchandise is a more difficult sell and there's no demand for loose diamonds, no matter the quality, he added. He showed me an approximate 9.99-carat Asscher-cut diamond with high quality color and clarity that he can't sell. On the other hand, 18-to-22-karat yellow gold is in demand.

""For the private VIP customers, if you find something that they like, they will buy it. The money is there. With the shops in the middle price segment, it's very difficult,"" he said.

""The people who have the money, they're here. They're very demanding. They know the market. They're buying from everywhere. But if you bring them what they want, they will buy.""

In addition to his exhaustive collection of important gems, and antique and vintage jewels, Alexandris was promoting his book, ""Antique Jewelry from 1800 to 1939: Appreciating the Dreams."" Seven years in the making, the self-published book is for professionals and enthusiasts. It combines scholarly research with personal stories behind many of the gems. It contains all the design periods in the 139 years that the book represents, including Victorian, Art Nouveau and Belle Epoque and Art Deco. In the book, he discusses the jewel's relationship with the style of the times. The book also demonstrates how to determine authentic period pieces.

For U.S. vintage and antique dealer, Steve Neckman, if it's wearable, it is selling, particularly yellow gold and signed pieces.

""Platinum and diamond, what we used to call cocktail jewelry, is very slow,"" he said. He pointed to a yellow gold Bulgari necklace and a diamond and platinum Harry Winston necklace side-by-side in his case. ""I would sell the Bulgari necklace before I would sell this diamond Harry Winston. The first one you can wear anywhere, the second one you won't wear on a Thursday night. That's just wearability.""

He continued, ""Are hanging earrings better than buttons? Yes. Are hoops still hot? Yes. Are big rings in? Yes. Are wood and natural materials hot? Yes.""

The Fine Design Pavilion is where the high jewelry companies are located. Unlike the antique and estate jewelry section, foot traffic was slow during the first two days.

Ephraim Zion, founder of the House of Dehres, one of the premier high jewelry firms in Hong Kong, said the first two days are what he expected.

""It's too early to tell but generally speaking, based on the one and a half days, it's a little quiet,"" he said. ""We didn't come here with great expectations but we still have another three days.""

Dehres specializes in creating jewels with exceptional diamonds and colored gems; and for selling loose diamonds and colored gems of exceptional quality. He lamented about the difficult state of the diamond industry and the difficult economy for dealers.

""We have the negative economic environment. We have very high interest rates. That's all over the world, especially in the Western world. Since Hong Kong is tied up to the U.S. dollar, (local) rates are also high.""

He continued, ""The market is very, very quiet right now with this environment of falling prices, especially in, white diamonds,"" he said. ""People are extremely careful, and they really don't want to buy anything, which is understandable.""

As far as white diamonds go, he says interest is limited to 15-to-30 carat gems with exceptional color and clarity.

He said there's more interest in colored gems, particularly the ""big three"" as they are known: rubies, emeralds and sapphires, as well as rare Paraiba tourmaline from the original mine in Brazil. But again, he says people want the best and there isn't that much of the best material available. He also noted that colored diamonds are still strong.

""Colored diamonds are not as bad as the white diamonds. There's a little bit of softening but prices are quite stable, I'm happy to say.""

Alexander Laut, based in Portugal, was once again in the Fine Design Pavilion showing his unique high jewelry creations made with a variety of high-quality colored gems, including a ring created with an important Paraiba tourmaline from the original mine in Brazil, the rarest and most valuable of this type of gem.

""My observation is there are fewer people than before. It may have something to do with the Full Moon Festival, but yesterday, it was quite slow,"" Laut said on the second day. ""But let's see. It always helps when the airport side (AWE) closes and people move here.""

Laut has been exhibiting at fair for about a dozen years, and he says those who come to his both know his creations. ""People appreciate that everything is one of a kind, and are rare, collectible pieces,"" he said. ""This fair is important for us because we can meet with auction houses who come here.""

He added, ""We're optimistic, and we always believe that there are no gray days."""
Micron Stock Leaps 16%  --  More To Come?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/27/micron-stock-leaps-16---more-to-come/,2024-09-27T10:06:57Z,"Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) stock surged by about 16% in pre-market trading on Thursday, following a stronger-than-expected Q4 earnings report. Revenue rose 93% year-over-year to $7.75 billion, with adjusted earnings at $1.18 per share. The company is experiencing robust demand for its DRAM memory products and high bandwidth memory, primarily driven by AI data centers. Additionally, its NAND business achieved record revenue, surpassing $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time, led by data center SSD sales. Looking ahead, Micron projects Q1 FY'25 revenue (quarter ending November) to be $8.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, reflecting an 85% plus increase year-over-year at the mid-point. The company also anticipates a Q1 gross margin of 39.5%, a significant improvement from around 1% in the same quarter last year.

MU stock has increased considerably over the last 3-year period. However, the gains have been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 24% in 2021, -46% in 2022, and 72% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could MU face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

Micron is the first of the semiconductor giants to publish this earnings season and is seen as a bellwether of sorts for the sector, given its exposure to the PC, smartphone, and server markets. The positive earnings report could drive gains for the likes of Nvidia and Super Micro Computer as well. See our upside scenarios on how Nvidia Stock Can Surge To $200 and Super Micro stock can rise over 2x to $1,000.

The broader memory market has stabilized slightly following the post-Covid decline, driven by reduced capital spending by general DRAM producers. The surge in generative AI deployments has been the primary driver of demand for memory products. Why is that? Generative AI models require substantial storage, fueling demand for DRAM, while faster memory, such as HBM, is essential for running large language models efficiently. Nvidia, for example, has integrated 33% more content into its latest Blackwell AI systems. As AI models get more sophisticated, moving from just working on text - like the first version of ChatGPT - toward multimedia such as images and video, we could see demand rise even further. However, HBM supply may be constrained as it requires three times more wafers than fifth-generation DRAM to produce the same number of bits. Micron has indicated that its HBM capacity for 2024 and 2025 is fully sold out. HBM memory is also likely to be much more lucrative. Research firm Gartner estimates that the average price of HBM and standard DRAM is about $10.60 and $2.90 per gigabyte respectively, or roughly 3.5x. Margins for HBM are also likely to be significantly thicker. For instance, Micron says that its Q1 2025 gross margins would improve by approximately 300 basis points to 39.5% driven in part by a higher mix of HBM shipments. Although Micron hasn't spelled out its forecasts for HBM memory sales, it expects the total addressable market for HBM to grow from about $4 billion in 2023 to about $25 billion by 2025.

However, the general-purpose DRAM market is seeing a slowdown. Smartphone sales growth has cooled, and Apple's latest flagship iPhone 16 devices appear to be receiving a lukewarm response, which could weigh on memory prices. The PC market is also expected to experience only low single-digit growth this year. Although the generative AI trend was expected to drive higher demand from the client side of the market, with consumers opting for high-end PCs and smartphones with AI capabilities, this may take time to materialize.

Micron stock trades at about $111 per share based on the pre-market price. This translates into less than 13x forward earnings. We currently have a $114 price estimate for Micron stock, which is slightly ahead of the current market price. See our analysis of Micron's valuation: Expensive or cheap for more details.

Harris heads to southern border looking to flip script on immigration criticisms,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-heads-southern-border-looking-flip-script-immigration-criticisms,2024-09-27T10:05:57Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Harris stops in battleground Arizona on Friday to hold a campaign event along the U.S. southern border with Mexico as the Democrat presidential nominee works to turn the issue of immigration and border security from a negative into a positive.

Harris has faced frequent attacks from her Republican opponent, former President Trump, and his allies who argue she's weak on border security, an issue that many Republicans see as the vice president's political Achilles' heel. Harris has faced intense criticism over the surge of migrants across the nation's southern border during the first three years of President Biden's administration.

The Trump campaign, on the eve of Harris' first border visit as a presidential nominee, called it a ""political ploy.""

But Harris, with a stop in Douglas, Arizona, aims to show that she's better prepared than Trump to tackle the combustible issue of immigration and what Republicans have spotlighted as the crisis at the southern border.

HARRIS LEANS IN ON BORDER SECURITY AND TRUMP RELISHES THE FIGHT

The vice president is expected to speak about how she is pushing what she describes as the toughest bipartisan border security plan in a generation, a measure that includes new border agents and technologies to stop fentanyl trafficking.

And she's expected to reiterate her argument that Trump ""has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk.""

CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION

She has repeatedly pointed to a border security bill with some bipartisan support that had been making its way through Congress this year before Republicans turned against the measure after prompting from Trump.

Harris has said that the former president ""tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election"" and has pledged that ""as the president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed.""

Since replacing Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket more than two months ago, Harris has described herself as a former ""border state prosecutor"" who took on international gangs and criminal organizations behind illegal drug, gun and human trafficking across the border.

The description comes as Harris and her campaign have also spotlighted a tougher stance on border security while still pushing for a pathway to citizenship for some migrants.

""We need a comprehensive plan,"" Harris said Wednesday in an interview with MSNBC. ""That includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship.""

Biden tasked Harris in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the ""root causes"" of migration in Central American countries. It led to her being dubbed the ""border czar"" both by the media and some Republicans, although the White House has rejected that description. And the vice president has been pilloried over her role as ""Biden's border czar"" by Trump and his allies.

Trump, as he runs to win back his old job in the White House, is calling for a major crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border and has suggested using police and the military to carry out mass deportations of undocumented migrants.

Speaking at a campaign event in North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump said Harris was traveling to the southern border for ""political reasons.""

""When Kamala speaks about the border, her credibility is less than zero,"" Trump said. ""I hope you're going to remember that on Friday. When she tells you about the border, ask her just one simple question: 'Why didn't you do it four years ago?'""

And Trump has said the policies of the Biden-Harris administration have allowed millions of people to enter the U.S. illegally.

In June, after the collapse of the bipartisan border security bill, Biden announced rules that bar migrants from being granted asylum when U.S. officials say the U.S.-Mexico border is overwhelmed. Following the implementation of the new rules through executive orders, arrests for illegal border crossings have plummeted.

Polls indicate that immigration and abortion are two of the top issues on the minds of American voters, following the economy and inflation.

And public opinion surveys, including those from Fox News, indicate that by double digits Americans believe Trump would do a better job than Harris handling the issue.

Trump last visited the border during a stop last month in Arizona, which is one of the seven crucial battleground states that will likely determine the winner of the presidential election.

""Events, dear boy, events."" That's what the late British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan said remain the greatest challenge facing a political campaign. Back in January 2023, I wrote that the 2024 campaign would likely hinge less on the actual campaigns than on a set of ""Known-Unknowns,"" - the economy, Ukraine, and the Middle East wind up playing out.

At the time, it seemed that President Joe Biden would be running and the GOP nominee wasn't known. Two years later, Biden has been replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump easily sailed to the nomination - but those Known-Unknowns remain, even as polls show minimal shifts in public opinion.

There are four that are likely to change voter's behavior - or not - in the coming weeks.

THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE: TEAMSTERS IN KEY BATTLEGROUNDS SUPPORT TRUMP OVER HARRIS

Will further actions by the Federal Reserve change views of the economy? The Fed just announced a 0.5% cut in interest rates, which helped cause Wall Street to achieve an all-time high, and suggested that the economy has done better than many thought just a few months ago. Polls that had recently given Trump the edge in who the voters trust more on the economy now suggest that Harris and Trump are at parity.

In the coming weeks, more data will come out on whether the economy is growing and whether wages are keeping up with inflation. Any bad news on that front may help Trump regain the advantage on the economy - which some believe is the key factor in undecided voters making their vote choice.

Does Israel's multi-front war further deteriorate and make the Biden-Harris administration look feckless? Following the October 7th massacre of 1,200 Israelis, the Biden administration has sought to facilitate a deal to free the hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza - and prevent the war from fully engulfing Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as Iran, which funds both Hamas and Hezbollah.

Despite multiple trips by U.S. representatives in the region, the U.S. has failed to achieve a ceasefire, nor has it been able to achieve the release of the remaining hostages. A negotiated end to the current war would possibly help Harris, but that seems highly unlikely at this late date. Conversely, if the conflict expands to a full-scale war with Hezbollah, it would give Trump an opportunity to highlight the incumbent administration's inability to control the situation.

Does the Ukraine War look to be better than a stalemate and a war of attrition with Russia? In recent weeks, Ukraine's decision - without the U.S. blessing - to invade and capture territory in Russia seems to have allowed Ukraine to appear more like the plucky successful defenders that initially pushed Russia back in 2022. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been visiting Biden and Harris at the White House.

Given that Trump has claimed that he could end the war quickly, and given that he pointedly chooses not to say that he wants Ukraine to win the war, and given that polls continue to show that most Americans support the Ukrainian war effort, any signs that the Biden-Harris administration is having an impact in helping them achieve that could redound to Harris's benefit.

Appalachian Aggression vs. Minnesota Knice™ on October 1. The conventional wisdom is that vice presidents don't matter. That's the conventional wisdom, but in three of the last six elections - 2000, 2012, and 2016 - the Vice Presidential Debate actually changed the trajectory of the election.

Republican Dick Cheney (2000) decisively won his debate against Democrat Joe Lieberman; then-vice President Joe Biden (2012) was able to arrest Obama's falls after his bad first debate; and similarly, Republican VP candidate Mike Pence was able to change Trump's polling trajectory after his bad performance in the first debate against Hillary Clinton.

This year, while GOP Candidate JD Vance seems to be polling poorly, he's proven himself highly effective in many interviews, his legal background may help him make the case against Democrat Tim Walz, and he knows how to embody the grievances that have fueled the MAGA movement.

In the coming weeks, more data will come out on whether the economy is growing and whether wages are keeping up with inflation. Any bad news on that front may help Trump regain the advantage on the economy - which some believe is the key factor in undecided voters making their vote choice.

That said, Walz may appear folksy, but he knows how to throw a populist punch as well (How often does he mention Vance and Yale in the same sentence?). Both these Midwesterners are shrewd - and they'll be armed to try to affect the trajectory of the race.

Those are just the Four ""Known-Unknowns."" Then there's always the possibility of ""Unknown-Unknowns"" - for example a terrorist act that might bring into focus the sense of the different approaches to terrorism that Trump and Harris appear to represent. One has no idea how it - or something else - may play out.

Political analysts like to focus on the dynamics of campaigns: fundraising, digital and television ad spending, press conferences, and so-called ""Get-Out-The-Vote"" efforts. But, if one really wants to know what's going to happen in an election, it's usually worth looking outside the campaign and study what the voters are experiencing."
'He has a way of connecting with our people': Southside Chicago resident believes Trump is gaining support,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/he-has-way-connecting-our-people-southside-chicago-native-says-about-trump-gaining-support,2024-09-27T09:06:01Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A resident from the south side of Chicago told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that a lot of voters from his neighborhood are supporting former President Trump.

""I think a lot of people from my neighborhood are riding with Trump honestly,"" said Eric Boyds, a native of South Side Chicago and Trump supporter.

""I think he has just a way of connecting with our people,"" he added.

Chicago's South Side is predominantly made up of Black residents. Approximately 75% of the community is Black and 19% is hispanic, according to data from the city's census figures.

Another resident from the South Side of Chicago echoed Boyd's sentiments.

""A lot of the people that I do talk to on the South Side are kind of sort of leaning ... toward Trump,"" Demetrius told Fox News Digital.

Demetrius explained that the growing support for Trump from South Side Chicago residents is due to the former president's aid of ""people living in poverty.""

""To those people-his contributions I guess really helped them out a bit in their minds ... he helped change the economy for them in the moment,"" he said before revealing that he would support Vice President Kamala Harris.

""In my opinion, I can't agree with it,"" he said.

On the other hand, other natives of Chicago's South Side said that everyone she knows is ""going for Kamala.""

""I don't think nobody I know going for Trump,"" Brittany said.

Trump lost Illinois to President Biden by a 17 point margin in the 2020 election. Chicago overwhelmingly went for Biden, with him winning over 90% in some wards.

FBI'S 'FLAWED' CRIME DATA HIGHLIGHTED BY CHICAGO'S 118 'MISSING MURDERS': EXPERT

The latest Fox News national survey shows Harris beating Trump by two points.

The new Fox News national survey finds a 3 percentage-point shift among registered voters in the 2024 presidential contest since mid-August. Trump had a 1-point advantage last month, while Harris is ahead by 2 points today: 50%-48%. For reference, in July, Trump was ahead by 1 point over President Biden. Each of those differences falls within the margin of error.

Quentin, a Harris supporter, said that the Democratic nominee has ""gained a lot of ground over the last week"" with residents of Chicago's suburbs and its South Side neighborhood.

""I think right now, she's looking a little more stronger-just how she answers the questions-how she responds to people ... she's showing she can be a trusted candidate.""

""Trump helped the people the most when he was in office,"" he said. ""That's just the honest truth.""

Ben, who lived in Chicago for four years, said he's leaning toward Kamala. He added that Trump seemed too old.

""Just not someone I feel too crazy about or too excited about being in office,"" Ben said."
Can Starbucks' Pecan Crunch Oatmeal Latte Help Grow Its Stock By 2x?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/27/can-starbucks-pecan-crunch-oatmeal-latte-help-grow-its-stock-by-2x/,2024-09-27T09:02:53Z,"[Note: Starbucks' fiscal year 2024 will be ending in September]

Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is adding a new beverage The Pecan Crunch Oatmilk latte to its lineup, and it has been garnering good reviews. What makes this drink different from other seasonal favorites? This beverage boasts a pecan pie-inspired flavor, evoking the nostalgia of Thanksgiving. It aims to bridge the gap between the everyday routines of the fall season and the festive indulgences of the upcoming holiday season. This beverage has the potential to become a landmark product for the company, illustrating the impact a single, game-changing offering can have on a brand's trajectory. As exemplified by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), whose iconic products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, etc, have cultivated a devoted following and solidified the company's market position. Starbucks can also replicate this success, establishing a signature offering that resonates with consumers, fosters brand loyalty, and drives business growth.

Could Starbucks stock grow to $190 in the next few years from the roughly $95 level it is at currently? Does this sound a bit ridiculous? Consider this - Starbucks' stock was trading at around $126 per share, almost 1.3x the current value in July 2021. Below we examine a scenario where SBUX stock doubles from current levels, considering three key metrics: revenues, net margins, and price-to-earnings multiple.

Overall, the performance of SBUX stock versus the index over the last 3-year period has been lackluster. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -13% in 2022, and -1% in 2023. Meaning it underperformed the S&P500 index in 2021 and 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could SBUX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? We have revised our Starbucks' Valuation to $97 per share, based on a $3.58 expected EPS and a 27.1x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2024 - almost in line with the current market price.

Starbucks Revenues and Margins Could Strengthen In Coming Years

Starbucks' Revenues grew from $29 billion in 2021 to $36 billion in 2023 as the company's strength in digital orders helped it rebound quickly from the pandemic setback. The company saw strength in both U.S. business and growth in the International segment during this period. However, the company's sales have been taking a hit in FY 2024 so far. The company's total sales, inclusive of new stores, were down 1% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $9.1 billion in the third quarter (ended June 30), while its global comparable sales declined 3%. It should be noted that the U.S. comparable transactions were down 6%, taking the blame for a large chunk of this decline. Inflationary pressures also played a big role in the company's weak results this year.

Starbucks' net margins (net income, or profits after expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) fell from levels of over 14% in 2021 to about 10% in 2022 amid increasing operating costs and increased promotional activities. Nevertheless, the company's net margins grew to about 11.5% in 2023 due to sales growth and in-store operational efficiencies. Its Q3 net margins came in at 11.6% (down 90 basis points y-o-y), and earnings per share dropped 6% y-o-y to $0.93. The markets are likely betting that Starbucks' margins could eventually recover and then expand to historical levels as the company has its turnaround plans in order.

Why?

Starbucks is the world's largest coffee chain. It has nearly 39,500 stores worldwide, including over 18,000 stores in North America, and continues to open new ones rapidly. A total of 526 net new stores were opened in the company's fiscal third quarter, and the company sees plenty of opportunities for expansion in the future. The company expects to have 55,000 Starbucks locations across 100 different markets by the year 2030 - with 75% of this expansion outside the U.S. market. Almost 18% of the company's stores are located in China, making it the most important geography internationally.

The coffee business is lucrative as it lends itself to repeat purchases, which puts Starbucks in a strong position. The coffee products offered by Starbucks involve no significant technological disruptions, and the industry's slow pace of progress should help Starbucks make it through the long term. Starbucks is a company with several competitive advantages. These include its brand, a successful rewards program, a wide range of in-store experiences, and ready-to-drink beverages in stores. Starbucks reported 33.8 million 90-day active rewards members in the U.S. as of June 30, an increase of 7% y-o-y (also up 2% quarter-over-quarter from Q2 2024). Consumers are also willing to pay for the products they deem premium, based on Starbucks' high gross margin (~67%) which gives the business room to absorb higher input costs while still being profitable. Starbucks has consistently been able to raise prices throughout the inflationary environment in the U.S. - and most loyal customers still come in despite higher pricing and inflationary pressures - demonstrating the strength of its business.

Former Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol took over as Starbucks' new CEO earlier this month and has highlighted four main areas for improvement in his turnaround plan. His initial plan is to concentrate on its U.S. business. The focus is on providing the baristas with the tools they need to consistently make great drinks in a personal way. Next, he mentioned delivering high-quality food and drinks on time, every time. Third, he wants Starbucks to go back to being a community coffee house by elevating the customer experience. And finally, he wants Starbucks to go back to telling its story. The company owns its coffee farm in Costa Rica, which serves as its base for research and innovation in coffee. However, Niccol noted that the company rarely discusses it.

All said, high expectations are already banked in post-Niccol's appointment, with the SBUX stock now trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of ~26x. However, we believe that with a forward P/E ratio of 24.2x based on 2025 EPS estimates of $3.95, the stock is still trading below where it has often traded over the past few years (P/E in the range of ~high 20s).

How Does This Impact Starbucks' Valuation?

If we assume revenue growth of roughly 1.26x between 2023 and 2027 with margins growing from 11.5% in 2023 to about 21% in 2026, a roughly 2x increase, this would mean that its net income could grow from about $4.1 billion in 2023 ($3.58 per share) to about $9.5 billion (about 8.29 per share). Good times make it easier to imagine even better times - and when that happens, investors could begin to see Starbucks in a more favorable light, re-assessing the company's recovery path. For example, if Starbucks' investors assign a multiple of 23x following its stronger growth trajectory, this could translate into a stock price of about $190 per share by the end of 2027, assuming earnings of $8.29 per share.

What about the time horizon for this positive-return scenario? While our example illustrates this for a 2027 timeline, in practice, it won't make much difference whether it takes three years or four. If the turnaround takes hold, with Starbucks improving its key metrics, we could see meaningful gains in the stock. This is a huge business and Starbucks has valuable know-how in a competitive market. Our analysis suggests that a win will be at hand - it just may not be quick and may require patience.

Of course, there are possibilities that the company could have a hard time training its huge worker base in new types of equipment or the company might misidentify the branding. Overall, it could be a bumpy ride for a while. There is certainly a case to be made for sizable long-term gains from Starbucks stock, but the Trefis High Quality Portfolio could be right up your alley if consistent outperformance is at the top of your list.

It is helpful to see how its peers stack up. SBUX Peers shows how Starbucks' stock compares against peers on metrics that matter. You will find other useful comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

AOC's 'red light' district overrun with prostitutes as locals call out MIA 'Squad' member,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/aocs-red-light-district-overrun-prostitutes-locals-call-out-mia-squad-member,2024-09-27T08:28:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In ""Squad"" member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's district in New York City, those who are described as scantily dressed migrant prostitutes line blocks of a long commercial strip during all hours of the day and night, brazenly soliciting sex to passersby while their pimps strike fear into local business owners, one of whom told Fox News Digital he's been threatened for speaking out and is on the verge of closing his store.

The trash-filled streets of Roosevelt Avenue in Queens, which encompasses the migrant-heavy communities of Corona, Jackson Heights and Elmhurst, has become a veritable hotbed for one of the world's oldest professions, and residents say that most elected officials and police are turning a blind eye to the neighborhood nightmare, which looks more like the famed brothel-filled red-light district streets of Bangkok than one of America's biggest cities.

Illegal vendors also overrun the sidewalks, plying their hustle in what residents have likened to ""Third World"" conditions, cooking hot food out in the open devoid of any health certifications or inspections as hungry birds swoop down in search of leftovers and leaving their droppings along the way.

AOC DISTRICT NEIGHBORHOOD LABELED 'THIRD WORLD' AS MIGRANTS CLOG STREETS AND PROSTITUTES OVERRUN EVERY BLOCK

Known to locals as the ""Avenue of the Sweethearts,"" this epicenter of vice is not some desolate area on the outskirts of a city but rather the heart of the borough of Queens underneath the area's main subway track that serves as a vital cog connecting Manhattan and its local schools to families, many of whom stream down the subway steps and are then inescapably met by armies of prowling solicitors.

Fox News Digital even recorded a man pushing his young son in a stroller past a group of five sex workers.

Residents say that students pass prostitutes every day on their way to school or on their way to local taekwondo centers situated along the busy strip and that the situation has become the norm for their youthful eyes with the alleged sex workers, mostly composed of Asian and Hispanic women, filling the sidewalks.

On Sept. 18, the NYPD raided a brothel just off Roosevelt Avenue and arrested three people. The following evening, Fox News Digital was conducting an interview in front of the raided premises when an alleged sex worker and her reported john casually walked out of the same building.

On one block along Roosevelt Avenue, Fox News Digital cameras recorded a line of no less than 19 alleged sex workers on the sidewalk. Around the corner, there were at least seven more, and a woman on the next block was witnessed soliciting sex for $60.

Nearby, vendors sell everything from used clothes to pots and pans or tools. More recently, female vendors have begun cutting hair and painting nails under canopies on the cluttered sidewalks, with all of these illegal vendors operating feet from legitimate brick-and-mortar stores whose owners rage they are being undercut in prices while also having to pay taxes, unlike the illegal vendors.

Shoplifting and pick-pocketing is also widespread, business owners say, and there's a sense here that lawlessness is breeding more lawlessness.

NYPD SWEEPS VENDORS OVERRUNNING AOC'S DISTRICT -- BUT SELLERS SWARM THE STREETS AGAIN, SELLING GOODS

On Sept. 19, the day after the raid, Fox News Digital witnessed a man being arrested for allegedly groping a 17-year-old girl as she walked down the subway steps.

In police handcuffs, he denied the accusations to onlookers. The girl, who was being comforted by adults, looked visibly shaken.

Ramses Frías, a local resident turned activist, is furious with the deterioration of his neighborhood and says ""it feels like Bangkok with women outside locations and pulling men off the street.""

""This area has been run rampant with prostitution,"" he told Fox News Digital outside the raided brothel. ""It's just been out of control and the lawlessness continues to happen.""

""This doesn't feel like my home. I've been here my whole life, and this feels like I'm a tourist in a Third World country. This is not how this is supposed to look, this is not how it's supposed to feel,"" he insisted. ""This is a neighborhood and a community full of hardworking individuals, immigrants and second-generation Americans that worked really hard to be here and are facing all this evil and all these bad things. ... And it's just causing more issues daily and our quality of life just continues to drop.""

Seconds later, an alleged sex worker and her client emerged from the brothel.

A neighboring business owner then ushered Fox News Digital into his store, warning that ""pimps"" were watching via CCTV. The store owner did not want to be named but said he had reported the cathouse to police and had been threatened by those involved with the brothel.

""I'm so scared, this is my business,"" he said, adding that his business is suffering because customers are avoiding the area and will likely have to close because of it.

Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels and a Republican candidate for mayor, says prostitution has exploded in the neighborhood after the pimps and sex workers were driven out of the nearby area of Flushing, well known for its Asian population.

""It was never like this. It was a family area with a lot of retail,"" Sliwa told Fox News Digital of Roosevelt Avenue. ""The Chinese community pushed it out [of Flushing] and Asian cops were getting busted because they were on the take, so they just decided, the madams, bring the girls over here ... and its open prostitution, 24/7. [It's] lawless. Anarchy. You get to do what you want when you want.""

Two NYPD officers were busted in 2006 on bribery charges relating to the protection of a brothel in Flushing, and there are similar cases stretching back further.

Sliwa says the police and New York City Mayor Eric Adams are not doing enough to clamp down on the racket. In January, the NYPD raided six establishments allegedly engaged in prostitution, which were issued closing orders. The raid was well publicized, with Adams and local Democrat City Council member Francisco Moya present. However, it appears to have done little to curb the problem.

Sliwa slammed it as a ""show raid"" and said there were no arrests.

""They didn't arrest the johns, prostitutes, madams; they never went after the landlords, and they were back in business the next day,"" said Sliwa, who joined Fox News Digital and Frías on a walking tour of the area.

The Queens District Attorney's Office confirmed that no arrests were made, saying it was strictly carried out to serve court closure orders of nuisance abatement over which the NYPD has jurisdiction.

""This would never be tolerated in Manhattan. They tolerate it because it's ... a poor and impoverished area in the eyes of many New Yorkers, but that doesn't give you a reason to allow this to exist,"" Sliwa said. ""This is so unfair ... and the mayor is allowing a culture of corruption to exist. These police officers are on the take. It's the only way they could operate openly. They'll say, 'We deny that.' Well, that's what happened in Flushing and that's why they pushed it over here.""

Adams' office did not respond to a request for comment. The NYPD confirmed the three arrests after the Sept. 18 raid but did not respond to a request for further comment.

No police officers have been charged for being involved in prostitution in recent years. In 2018, seven NYPD officers -- three sergeants, two detectives and two officers -- were indicted in connection with an illegal prostitution and gambling ring in Brooklyn and Queens, which encompassed Roosevelt Avenue.

Separately, NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell told Fox News that it suspects members of the brutal Tren de Aragua are linked to prostitution in the area, trafficking women into the industry to pay off the debts the gang is owed for smuggling them into the country.

Meanwhile, the Queens District Attorney's Office says it is working hard to stamp out prostitution and crime in the area, noting the office has ""evicted 13 prostitution locations this year being used for illegal activity on or near Roosevelt Avenue."" The office says it's in the process of permanently shutting down the raided brothel.

Of Ocasio-Cortez, Frías said the socialist lawmaker has not been seen in the neighborhood since she took part in a rally there in August 2023, where she condemned a city crackdown on illegally operating vendors and called for the city to issue more permits to those vendors.

""She does not visit this area; this is actually an area where she campaigned the hardest and a lot of people went out [to vote] for her, and she doesn't come over here. She has totally neglected us,"" Frías said, noting that other local elected officials are rarely seen in the area, which is only represented by Democrats.

""So, we're totally neglected, we're here to fend for ourselves and this is what we have to do now. We're going to organize. We're going to have a rally coming up on Sept. 29, and we're going to let our voices be heard and make sure that the city understands that they need to come over here and do their job,"" he adds.

Ocasio-Cortez's office did not respond to repeated requests for comment on this story or on a March story in which Fox News Digital brought attention to the neighborhood's plight, featuring the additional publication of a now-viral video provided by Frías showing an almost endless stream of vendors with piles of clothes stacked along the streets.

Police swept the area days later and Frías - a former Democrat who is running for City Council as a Republican next year - said vendors have simply set up shop there again.

Rep. Grace Meng, whose district also encompasses Roosevelt Avenue, said in a one-line statement, ""Quality of life and safety issues need to always be addressed, and I remain in contact with the 110th precinct, Councilman Moya, our local community board and other local elected officials.""

'SHARK TANK'S' KEVIN O'LEARY SHREDS AOC OVER HER DISTRICT LOOKING LIKE A 'THIRD WORLD COUNTRY'

Frías also took aim at state Sen. Jessica Ramos, a Democrat who represents the area and is running for mayor. She has previously labeled prostitution on the strip as ""survival work"" and in 2019 co-sponsored a series of bills that would have decriminalized sex work and vacated the records of people arrested or charged with prostitution or related offenses.

Ramos told Fox News Digital she was happy to see the recent raid take place and pitted blame on the mayor for the unsavory situation, saying Adams' office has been sidetracked by scandals rather than addressing the concerns of the community.

""No one wants to see people selling sex, especially when they're being coerced by traffickers. It's unclear what took so long,"" Ramos said in a statement.

""The underground economy has spiraled out of control,"" she added, referencing the illegal vendors. ""Without work permits from the 'feds,' migrants need honest work to provide for themselves. The fact is the migrants are here, and they want to work.""

Meanwhile, Moya, who attended the January raid and has rallied alongside so-called ""clean streets"" advocates like Frías, said that his fellow Democrats are impeding efforts to shut down the brothels and illegal vendors.

""I've lived my entire life in this district, and I've never seen it this bad,"" Moya said of the prostitution. ""After COVID, the situation has worsened significantly. The influx of migrants plays a part in this issue, as many have no other means of survival. The federal government has turned a blind eye to the situation and there's only so much the city can do, since we don't have the authority to grant work permits or legal status to those in need.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Moya said other elected officials have been calling up city agencies demanding that all enforcement stop.

""Some elected officials don't see this as a problem, suggesting that 'work is work' and we should let it be. I believe that if a state representative wants to legalize prostitution, it should be done with strict rules and regulations, in designated areas like the city of Amsterdam - not in our community, especially near schools where children pass by and witness these activities daily,"" he insisted.

""I'm doing everything in my power to mitigate this issue, as you can see many have been investigated and shutdown - but what I have been doing is being undermined by these leaders who don't recognize the urgent need for change. Yet, I assure you, I will not stop until significant change is made."""
Trump-endorsed House candidate sounds alarm on China's growing influence in battleground state,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-endorsed-house-candidate-sounds-alarm-chinas-growing-influence-battleground-state,2024-09-27T08:15:54Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

China's growing influence in Michigan has brewed into a ""huge issue of concern"" for voters in the key battleground state, according to a Trump-backed House candidate sounding the alarm on ""failed Democratic"" policies in the Great Lakes State.

""This is a huge issue of concern both from national security and economic security standpoint,"" Republican House candidate to represent Michigan's Tom Barrett told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview this week. ""Here in Michigan, the Democrats are giving nearly $200 million of state tax money to a Chinese-backed, Communist Party affiliated company that's going to come to Michigan to build a battery plant. They've already purchased a bunch of rural farmland to go out and build a Chinese Communist Party-backed battery plant in Michigan, not far from a military installation where I trained for countless hours during my career in the Army.""

Barrett is an Army veteran who previously served in Michigan's state House and state Senate before launching his race to represent the 7th District in the U.S. House. Barrett earned Trump's ""complete and total endorsement"" for the House seat earlier this year, and spoke to Fox News Digital about the top issues he's highlighting from the campaign trail, including spiraling inflation, border policies, fentanyl overdose deaths, as well as China's growing influence in the state.

""While families are struggling in Michigan to make ends meet and just buy groceries, pay for their home heating costs, our state government, backed by my opponent, is sending nearly $200 million of their state tax money to a Chinese communist company just so they can come here and spy on us. This is rotten to the core,"" Barrett said.

MICHIGAN REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO SPAR WITH DEMS OVER DEAL WITH CHINESE EV COMPANY IN KEY HOUSE RACE

In 2022, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Gotion, a China-based manufacturer, would construct a $2.4 billion electric vehicle battery plant in a rural area of the state near Big Rapids. The announcement was met with outrage from residents, including local leaders working to reverse a water supply agreement that would have crippled the plant's construction. Gotion sued the township, Green Charter, and notched a legal victory last month when a federal judge upheld a preliminary injunction allowing construction to continue.

Barrett's competitor this cycle, Curtis Hertel, worked as Whitmer's director of legislative affairs from 2015 to 2023, before serving in the state Senate.

""My opponent signed a nondisclosure agreement to negotiate sending this money to this Chinese company while he was a member of the state Senate and then later went to work as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's chief lobbyist. He's listed in the Foreign Agents Registries Act filings with having secret conversations with this Chinese company about maneuvering through the legislature to get their funding approved,"" Barrett said of his competitor and Democrats in the state.

Hertell's campaign and Whitmer's office did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for contact.

Barrett pointed to remarks from former Obama administration CIA director Leon Panetta, who warned earlier this year that China would likely use the battery plant for espionage purposes.

""I don't think there's any question that they're going to take advantage of that situation,"" Panetta warned in January when asked about the plant during a House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party hearing. ""And I think we have to be very vigilant about what the hell is going on. That's just the way they operate. They'll establish a manufacturing unit, they'll establish whatever they can, and then they will use that for their own intelligence purposes. They will use that for their own economic purposes.""

Barrett said the deal is not only a national security threat, but also risks American jobs.

""It is all in the pursuit of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's electric vehicle mandate that will systematically replace and eliminate existing manufacturing jobs in Michigan that make up the very fabric of our economy here. So we have a Chinese company threatening with national security concerns to replace American jobs in traditional manufacturing with electric vehicle mandates that are borne by the Biden administration. So this has so many problems. It's an absolutely horrible deal,"" he said.

""Michiganders are stepping up. They're aware of this. It is terribly unpopular here. And we need to take this fight to the ballot box to make sure that we don't let this go forward.""

Trump joined farmers during a panel earlier this week in another battleground state, Pennsylvania, where they discussed China's recent purchases of American farmland and again enforcing a trade deal against China that benefits American farmers.

""My first call, I'm going to call up President Xi. I'm going to say, 'You have to honor the deal you made. We made a deal. You'd buy $50 billion worth of American farm product.' And I guarantee you he will buy it. 100% he will buy it,"" Trump said Monday during a campaign event in Smithton, Pennsylvania.

Trump struck a trade deal with China in 2020 that included Beijing's commitment to halt intellectual property theft, refrain from currency manipulation, cooperate in financial services and purchase an additional $200 billion of U.S. products over two years, including up to $50 billion of U.S. agriculture.

""Second thing I'm going to do is, I'm going to say you have to give the death penalty to your fentanyl dealers who are sending fentanyl. You know, in China, they give the death penalty. They don't have a drug problem because they give the death penalty,"" Trump said.

Fentanyl and overdose deaths are again one of the top concerns for Americans this election cycle, with Trump tying the fatal drug to the influx of illegal immigrants who have poured over the southern border under the Biden-Harris administration.

Barrett said his area and district are among the communities across the nation that have been rocked by the influx of the synthetic opioid from across the border.

TRUMP AND VANCE TO HOLD FIRST RALLY IN MICHIGAN

""Every single community in America, in every town, not just in the district where I'm running, but every town in America has been touched and affected and devastated by the outcomes of illegal immigration and lax border policies that have flooded every community with fentanyl. And now the leading cause of death of Americans my age is fentanyl overdose. It's a crippling and devastating tragedy. And we have to fix the problem,"" he said.

""We have to secure our border with more structures. We have to reinstate the remain in Mexico policy. We can't allow the exploitation of asylum claims to overwhelm our social welfare system, to overwhelm our border security. We need to put Border Patrol agents on the border instead of processing asylum claims all day as they're doing right now. And we need to get back to two policies that deter illegal border crossing,"" he continued.

Barrett is an Army veteran who signed his contract over the Christmas break of his senior year in high school. He spent 22 years in the Army, serving in the Iraq War, Guantanamo Bay, Kuwait, and at the DMZ separating North and South Korea.

Barrett pointed to his military career amid his calls to secure the border.

EARLY VOTING BEGINS IN ILLINOIS, NORTH DAKOTA, FLORIDA AND MICHIGAN

""I spent a year of my life deployed during Operation Enduring Freedom to Guantanomo Bay, Cuba, where there were terrorists that we were securing in that facility. And they told us straight to our face, that they wanted to come to America and kill Americans. I believe them. We need to keep them out of our country. We've had hundreds on the terror watch list that we already know have crossed into this country just during this administration. We need to remove them and we need to make sure that we don't allow any further terrorists into our country,"" he said.

Barrett is in the lead in his race against Hertell, but underscored he's not taking anything for granted while

""I think President Trump is very well poised to win Michigan. We know this is going to be a very close race and absolutely nothing we can take for granted. The seventh Congressional District in Michigan, where I'm running, is also highly competitive. And we also have a very competitive United States Senate race in Michigan,"" he said.

""This really is going to shape the direction of our country. And we can go down the same failed path we've been on already with the high cost of living and groceries that are unaffordable for families, and mortgage rates that don't allow a young couple to begin their own family. Or we can turn the corner. Secure our border. Get our costs of living under control, get crime under control, put our foreign adversaries back in check where they belong, and really forge a new path for America."""
800-plus bills left on Newsom's desk illustrate California's overregulation problem: experts,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/800-bills-left-newsoms-desk-illustrate-californias-overregulation-problem-experts,2024-09-27T08:11:17Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In a legislative session marked by a surge in activity, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has more than 800 bills on his docket to either sign into law or veto by next week. The sheer amount of potential new legislation is further evidence of the Golden State government's penchant for a heavy touch when it comes to governance, according to critics.

As California remains the most regulated state in the country, state lawmakers introduced over 4,400 bills for 2023-2024, eclipsing the 4,100 proposed in the 2020-2021 term, longtime Capitol lobbyist Chris Micheli noted.

California public policy expert Lance Christensen warned that many of the bills introduced serve as ""vanity projects"" for legislators. And with the governor signing the majority, the state's lawbook is expanding into a labyrinth of complexity that poses significant challenges for citizens and small businesses, driving up compliance costs.

NEWSOM VETOES BIPARTISAN ACCOUNTABILITY LEGISLATION AIMED AT STATE SPENDING ON HOMELESSNESS CRISIS

""Who has the capacity to read literally millions of pages worth of state law, let alone the millions of pages of regulations ... and the answer is zero,"" Christensen told Fox News Digital. ""Nobody ever reads all this stuff. Very few people really understand how complex it is, and because of that, most people are breaking the law every single day, and they have no idea.

""How can you manage that process without somebody else interpreting that for you? So, that increases the cost of knowledge, but it also increases the cost of compliance.""

Already, Newsom has signed a package of public safety bills aimed at reducing organized retail theft. He's also vetoed a number of progressive bills, including several that would have expanded aid to illegal immigrants through housing loans and permitted employment through the University of California (UC) system and a reparations package for Black residents.

Promising to tackle the mental health crisis among young people, the blue state governor also signed a historic bill restricting cellphones in schools.

NEWSOM VETOES BILL THAT WOULD LET NONCITIZEN STUDENTS WORK AT STATE'S PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES

Newsom often vetoes bills if they appear redundant or the cost would further burden the state's budget shortfall, according to a CalMatters analysis. Last year, Newsom vetoed 156 bills and signed 890, reflecting a veto rate of about 15%, similar to the previous year. His veto rate in 2021 was under 8%.

From start to finish, the creation of a bill in California costs roughly $30,000, which does not include more complex legislation that takes longer to draft.

Because of this, Christensen said, ""money (is) being sucked out of the economy for people just simply to understand -- not even comply with -- but just simply understand what the legislation is.""

NEWSOM'S DEEPFAKE ELECTION LAWS ARE ALREADY BEING CHALLENGED IN FEDERAL COURT

Newsom has signed dozens of packages meant to fast-track certain initiatives, like expanding housing development and environmental policies.

""The governor has repeatedly taken action to streamline government,"" Brandon Richards, deputy director of Newsom's rapid response team, told Fox News Digital. ""He is intentional with every measure he signs into law -- focusing on solving problems and supporting Californians -- while recognizing that not every problem warrants a new law."""
Gold Boom At Risk From Reliance On Derivatives And Weak Fundamentals,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/timtreadgold/2024/09/26/gold-boom-at-risk-from-reliance-on-derivatives-and-weak-fundamentals/,2024-09-27T02:33:54Z,"Doubts about the strength and longevity of the gold boom, because it appears to a financial markets event based on trading in derivatives, have been raised by one of the gold industries best placed observers, Ross Norman.

Chief executive of Metals Daily, a London-based website and gold trading forum, Norman has a history of asking provocative questions about the metal in which he specialises.

Earlier this year he was first to identify heavy-duty Chinese private sector buying as a gold-price driver, with individual traders picking up where their government left off.

Norman's latest assessment is that ""this is a most peculiar bull run, and even harder to explain,"" he wrote on his website.

The early rush by Chinese investors into gold started with physical buying and then shifted to speculative trading in over-the-counter forwards, future, and options.

""And they bought in massive size, confident that they were swimming with the tide,"" he wrote.

The view of the traders was that they would win when interest rates started falling or they crashed the U.S. economy ""so it was a question of when not if"".

""The idea that the market is derivatives led makes sense in many ways, why else would gold rally to an all-time high just as inflation falls and quickly, the dollar gains, treasury yields gain, all normal surefire leading indicators of the opposite.

""And that's the thing about a derivatives position, it can be largely agnostic (doubting) of market signals.""

Other signs about the gold market being driven by derivative trading is an end to a rally in India which followed a reduction in import duties, the absence of traditional buyers, Middle East gold buyers opting for reduced quality jewelry and reports from Chinese jewellers of a significant decline in trade.

""In the U.S. and Europe it is worse,"" Norman wrote.

""Physical (gold) dealers in Germany, often second only to China in size on gold coins and bars, has been worryingly thin"".

The speculative phase led by China has more recently been joined by U.S. traders with futures long positions at a near four-year high creating a market which is largely unswayed by normal drivers.

Norman is not forecasting a quick end to the boom which has seen gold rise by 45% over the past 12-months to its latest price of $2667 an ounce.

""Derivatives by their nature often have a long leg towards expiry and as such, no immediate price correction is in prospect,"" he wrote.

""That's a long way around saying that even though I don't believe this rally, I would certainly not short it.

""Gold will almost certainly go higher and I would not be surprised to see $3000/oz this side of Christmas.""

Next year, however, could be a different story and if a gold-price correction takes hold Norman will be able to say he was first to ring a warning bell."

Nation-State Game Theory: Bitcoin And Statecraft Meld Together,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/26/nation-state-game-theory-bitcoin-and-statecraft-meld-together/,2024-09-27T00:23:24Z,"As Bitcoin matures into an institutional force, the next plank is nation-state adoption. As nations jostle between one another in an increasingly polarized world, good writing on the topic of Bitcoin and statecraft can help inform the lines here. A new book, National Security In The Digital Age, serves that purpose. With individual chapters written by various experts on the bleeding edge of statecraft and Bitcoin, different elements are examined in a book perfect for legislators and policymakers to consider the unique advantages of Bitcoin.

Most writers refer to the dominant position the United States has had overseeing the US dollar system and its consequences. Since 1973, when President Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard, global demand for fiat-driven US dollars and US debt has been the cornerstone of the world economy. This has led to unanticipated consequences, however, perhaps the most significant being the migration outwards of the manufacturing base of the United States to a more globally distributed economy - with the chief beneficiary being China, which now has the capacity to manufacture military goods like ships at a very rapid pace and become a near-peer that can challenge US military supremacy. China and Russia are now working together in many ways, with China providing CBDC and M-Bridge coverage to create a hedge against US dollar sanctions, while Russia provides kinetic cover with primate military companies in Africa.

However, the world is pulling away from that system because of sanctions on Russia and other factors. The US dollar share of foreign reserves is at a low unseen for a few decades. Can Tether and US-dollar stablecoins provide some amount of cover as bottoms-up demand for the US dollar (eurodollar system) blossoms, as Matthew Pines brings up? Does Bitcoin play a role in wrestling away Middle Eastern countries from China, as Robert Malka wonders? What will happen in Africa, an emerging energy superpower documented by Ben Kincaid?

While the first chapter focuses on the Great Power Conflict, namely how China has bent the US monetary system to its advantage, the second focuses on Africa and the ""African village"" and the roots of bottoms-up adoption of Bitcoin vs. central bank digital currencies like the e-Naira. Fedimint offers a view of leveraging the democratic concepts of the ""African village"" through groups of peers transacting with one another in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin mining can accelerate the escalating growth of energy across the continent (seen, for example, through projects like Gridless). This global conflict comes to the Middle East as the energy superpowers of the 20th century aim to welcome new technologies like Bitcoin while maintaining political control. China's export of technical standards for the mobile Internet, central bank digital currencies, and digital authoritarianism worldwide are cited in detail.

But the United States still has a dollar advantage, and the book argues through the use of many experts - with the shift to electricity being the dominant force, it can employ Bitcoin mining, a renewed look at nuclear power, and the right policy towards grid management to create an alternative. The ability to leverage freedomtech like Bitcoin just as the United States embraced neutral cryptography, email and Internet standards (eventually) could serve national security interests.

The most interesting thread is how Bitcoin and adjacent technology like Nostr have pools of bottoms-up demand resistant to top-down force from those looking to hedge against CBDCs to merchants looking for lower transaction fees. As China's Bitcoin mining ban fails to dent Bitcoin's effect, which is detailed in an entire chapter, it's clear this discussion is ongoing.

The book seems intended for policymakers mostly - it weaves sophisticated arguments about geopolitics into an accessible introduction to the energy dynamics of Bitcoin mining with very specific examples of how it works with ERCOT, the Texas grid, and how it can stabilize the grid with expert advice from Pierre Rochard, VP of Research at Riot. An entire chapter is devoted to ""illicit finance"" and the tradeoffs between Bitcoin existing with the traditional financial world and a place where nation-states move money for nefarious reasons contrary to American interests, as well as the anonymity of cash versus the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin.

The beginning of the book dives deeply into the geopolitics of Bitcoin - the middle is more technical and is meant to explain different facets of Bitcoin, Bitcoin mining, and the Lightning Network to people, along with various use cases such as creating and stabilizing energy grids. Towards the latter end, we see the real power of Bitcoin - creating a neutral platform that can redress the lack of trust after generations of racial bias (per Ian Gaines), a lower transaction cost for remittances, and navigating healthcare, inflation, and corrupt officials in Africa.

The book makes it clear throughout that it's about Bitcoin, not ""crypto."" This comes out in the very first page of the foreword by Dr. Julia Nesheiwat. Its detailed explanation of proof-of-work versus the proof-of-stake model favored by Ethereum, how the Lightning Network works, and how it can be interpreted policy-wise. It stands in stark contrast to the instinct of many policymakers to conflate Bitcoin and cryptocurrency together.

This book dives deep into Bitcoin, geopolitics, technology, and the stakes at the heart of the 21st century: who determines innovation and who will benefit as we shift from an oil-driven age to a new electricity and computing age. Those who want to live at the edge of the intersection between Bitcoin and geopolitics are well-suited to join with a reference like National Security in The Digital Age."

Tammy Baldwin as Republicans work to win the state by focusing on the economy.

A Wisconsin district attorney is set to investigate a mayor for removing an official voting drop box.

Mayor Doug Diny of Wausau recently made a spectacle of removing a voter drop box from outside City Hall.

He posted a photo of himself on social media on Sunday, showing him carting away the metal ballot receptacle while dressed in a hard hat and gloves.

WISCONSIN REPUBLICAN DEMANDS PROBE AFTER MADISON SENDS OUT OVER 2,000 DUPLICATE ABSENTEE BALLOTS

County Clerk Kaitlyn Bernarde reported Diny to Marathon County District Attorney Theresa Wetzsteon, who is now pursuing an investigation via the state's Department of Justice.

The voting drop box was empty and not in use when it was removed, according to local reports.

""This is no different than the maintenance guy moving it out there,"" Diny said Wednesday. ""I'm a member of [the] staff. There's nothing nefarious going on here. I'm hoping for a good result.""

WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT NEW LIBERAL MAJORITY REVERSES RULING THAT BANNED MOST BALLOT DROP BOXES IN SWING STATE

Democrat Gov. Tony Evers called the drop box removal wrong and insisted that it be reinstated outside City Hall.

""Drop box voting is safe, secure, and legal,"" Evers said on social media. ""As elected officials, we should be working to make it easier -- not harder -- for every eligible Wisconsinite to cast their ballot. That's democracy.""

The state's Supreme Court ruled in July 2022 that absentee drop boxes - such as those used in the 2020 presidential election - are not authorized under state statutes.

The court ruled that the Wisconsin Elections Commission guidance encouraging their use was unlawful, but the ruling was overturned by the court's new liberal majority in July 2024.

The move, which sparked a protest in the city Tuesday night and anger among drop box advocates, is the latest example in swing state Wisconsin of the fight over whether communities will allow absentee ballot drop boxes.

More than 60 towns, villages and cities in nine counties have opted out of using absentee ballot drop boxes for the presidential election in November, according to a tally by the group All Voting is Local. Drop boxes are being embraced in heavily Democrat cities, including Milwaukee and Madison. Wisconsin has a total of 72 counties.

We Still Can't Measure Employee Engagement. This Is Why.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanlamotte/2024/09/26/we-still-cant-measure-employee-engagement-this-is-why/,2024-09-26T22:07:14Z,"In modern organizations, data drives decisions, but when it comes to employees, the real challenge may not be the decision, but the data used (or not used) to make it.

If it seems like labor trends are changing faster than the weather, it's because they are. In one breath, leaders are focused on attracting talent, and in another, how to right size when the economy turns. The only constant is talent strategy whiplash where people leaders get caught reacting to one issue after another.

For years, organizations have been relying on engagement surveys as a key indicator of employee sentiment and productivity. According to McKinsey research, ""employee disengagement could cost a median-size S&P 500 company between $228 million and $355 million per year in lost productivity.""

The lost productivity fear has driven organizations to measure engagement at record rates, making it an almost billion dollar industry in 2024. But do these measures actually make a difference? Researchers have been asking this question for years, and yet leaders still struggle with what to measure.

The concept of an annual employee engagement survey is antiquated,"" says Anna Lyons, Chief Talent Officer for Alegeus, a Boston-based fintech company. ""Employee sentiment changes by the minute, not by the year. For employee engagement surveys to be valuable, they need to provide continuous, real-time data and, more importantly, insights.""

Lyons is not alone in her assessment. Over the past few years, HR technology companies have been responding with in-the-moment pulse survey options adding to the mountain of data and dashboards companies already have to make sense of on a regular basis.

Is the answer more data, or as Lyons suggests, the insights? HR and company leaders are drowning in data - from HRIS demographics to dashboards tracking candidate career site clicks and pulse survey responses to employee sentiment. As leaders add to their stacks there is no shortage of automated and AI-driven promises for real-time data in just a click.

But more data doesn't solve business problems. And that may mean simply answering the question 'are my employees engaged?' may be all wrong.

Here are five questions your organization should be asking instead:

1) Are we getting the right data?

Most organizations use a survey approach because it's easy to get critical mass, and report back in numerical fashion. Percentages make for great sound bytes and may offer more immediate intelligence. But they don't tell the whole story.

""The concept of a survey being a substitute for a conversation is ridiculous and should never be the case,"" says Jeffrey Lackey, CEO of JKL Advisors. Lackey, the former Vice President of Talent Acquisition for CVS Health, is an advocate for a holistic data set. ""Leaders should take the time to have listening tours and focus groups as a regular part of their management routine.""

Beyond just the comments on a survey, qualitative methods like focus groups and diaries allow leaders to understand why employees feel a certain way. Just like academic researchers dive deeper to understand the root cause, so should people leaders.

2) Are we measuring the right thing?

Engagement surveys can solicit a vast amount of data, but they're confused in purpose: measuring employee sentiment or manager performance? This can be very confusing to leaders who are left with determining how performance management and engagement relate.

Additionally, most organizations have distinct performance management processes so managers get measured in multiple, incongruent ways, and may not be consistently evaluated or rewarded as a result. Engagement scores are often broken down by function, department or team, and managers can be rewarded or penalized for things they can't control or impact.

""They are the same questions year after year so that managers can get a ""grade"" and encourage their leaders to 'hit their numbers,' says Lackey who says this is the wrong attitude for leaders.

If you're measuring engagement, you should focus on the relationship employees have with work and how the manager relationship impacts that, rather than how the manager is performing vis a vis engagement.

3) Are we accounting for business reality?

In consumer market research, customer sentiment is measured constantly. Companies like Apple are collecting data on user experience all the time. There's a reason for this - the world, and our reaction to it - are constantly changing.

Jesper Sørensen, Senior Associate Dean at Stanford talks about this challenge of research versus reality: ""one of the hallmarks of research is trying to isolate particular mechanisms through various kinds of control. Scientists live in the world where it's a vacuum: and so we just watch the leaf fall and we can then time it and then tell you what the answer is. And managers live in a world where the wind is blowing and there's all these kinds of forces getting in the way.""

Employment is a relationship. How engaged or happy employees are can change every day based on what's happening around them and annual measures can be outdated in the weeks and months after they are collected. Because of this, the antidote to the annual survey as a lagging indicator became real time feedback in the form of pulse surveys for many firms.

But fast and frequent methods of data collection have their downfall too. Quick data sets provide real-time, regular outputs but don't have room to ask employees why they feel a certain way and then probe into their answers. They don't allow for qualitative insights and they leave the 'why' up to leaders to assume.

Imagine if marketing leaders didn't find out why customers weren't buying their latest product, or worse, didn't have a way to triangulate that data with what's happening in the world around their customers.

4) Are we relying too much on technology?

Those real time outputs and the accompanying dashboards are really attractive to leaders looking to be more nimble and efficient. Technology is more advanced than ever in its ability to collect data at lighting speed and display it in ways we could never do ourselves. And artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are game-changing for leaders seeking real-time data and insights.

Like many leaders, Anna Lyons of Alegeus sees the potential. ""AI /ML is positioned to derive insights, connect the dots, and allow leaders to respond with speed to what matters."" says Lyons.

But are our tech stacks too bloated with the promises of business-changing technology? Beyond extensive cost, platform integrations, and implementation time, it's important to consider what we're really missing in understanding employees when we rely so heavily on digital intelligence: feeling.

""Humans tend to be superior to AI in contexts and at tasks that require empathy,"" according to Michael Bennett at The Institute for Experiential Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University. ""Human intelligence encompasses the ability to understand and relate to the feelings of fellow humans, a capacity that AI systems struggle to emulate.""

So while faster data and the promise of insights on demand seems attractive, we may be missing a crucial element to the employment relationship: feeling. Understanding the relationship between engagement and productivity requires an ability to relate to the challenges or obstacles that may get in the way of employees' success. And even for leaders who started on the front line, they're not there now and can't relate to employees' current feelings in the current climate.

5) Are we making any business impact?

In all of the discussion and debate around the value of measuring employee engagement, one thing is clear: we have to be able to drive change in our businesses.

At Virgin Voyages, Head of People, Michael Peterman is looking for just that. Peterman also feels like engagement surveys are too focused on a high or low score.

""Leaders can applaud or cry over their results, but rarely does it drive a company toward a true culture of engagement,"" he says. ""While understanding sentiment is helpful, I need more actionable guidance. What are the most impactful systemic changes I can implement in our organization to significantly improve our relationship with crew members?""

This kind of improvement only comes with a nuanced or custom approach to measurement. And that starts with going beyond engagement to measure the whole of the employment relationship. This means collecting real-time insights, but also tracking those over time to see how what happens in the business changes the strength of that relationship.

The custom piece is also crucial. When we measure towards arbitrary benchmarks or ask employees the same questions as every other company (because a survey platform requires us to do so), it strays from a company's individual business strategy and needs.

Finally, let's not forget that even in the age of AI, we still need humans to work. And understanding what makes them engaged and productive, requires the empathy that only comes from a deep dive into how employees feel and why, understanding what has changed their perspective or behavior now, and how those feelings may change their decision to stay or leave the organization.

The best part? This approach doesn't require extensive technology, a year-long plan for survey deployment, or a massive investment. It just requires a new mental model for how we think about employee engagement.

After all, if your colleagues in marketing are measuring the customer relationship this way, why shouldn't we be doing it with our people?"
Fox News Poll: Voters' choice has flipped in Arizona since last month,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-voters-choice-flipped-arizona-since-last-month,2024-09-26T22:06:37Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former President Donald Trump is narrowly ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential contest in Arizona, as the Democratic nominee loses ground among women, Hispanics, and young voters.

A new Fox News survey of Arizona voters finds Harris trails Trump by 3 percentage points among likely voters in both the two-way matchup (48-51%) and the expanded ballot that includes third-party candidates (47-50%, with 3% backing other candidates). While 9 in 10 say their vote choice is locked in, both Harris and Trump have a handful of supporters saying they may change their mind.

In August, Harris was up by 1 point in the horserace among registered voters (50-49%), while she's down by 2 points today (48-50%). All of these matchups are within the margin of error.

The 3-point shift among registered voters is mainly due to movement among young voters, women, and Hispanics.

Since August, Harris' 18-point lead among Hispanics has narrowed to 11 points and her 14-point edge among women is down to 8 points. What was a 13-point advantage for Harris among voters under age 30 is now a 12-point deficit, a 25-point shift. These changes are notable, even given that estimates among subgroups are more volatile.

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE

Trump tops Harris among Whites without a college degree, rural voters, and independents. He has a narrow edge among suburbanites because more suburban men back him than suburban women favor Harris. And, by just a touch, more of his 2020 voters stick with him than Biden's 2020 voters back Harris.

Harris has strong support among those ages 65 and over, voters with a college degree, and urban voters, and still receives majority backing among women and Hispanics. Plus, one in four non-MAGA Republicans favors Harris over Trump.

By a 51-46% margin, Trump leads among new voters, defined as those who haven't voted in the four most recent elections.

""Arizona is looking tougher for Harris than a month ago,"" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw. ""If young voters and Hispanics don't make a U-turn, it's hard to see how she walks away with a win.""

More Arizona voters trust Trump than Harris to handle immigration (by 15 points) and the economy (+8). Those are significant leads, and they match where things stood last month -- but compared to his June leads over President Joe Biden, Trump's advantage is down 5 points on immigration and down 7 points on the economy.

Trump is also seen as being better at making the country safe by 7 points.

There's little difference between the candidates on who will better protect democracy (Harris +3), help the middle class (Harris +2), fight for people like you (Harris +2), and bring needed change (Trump +1).

Harris leads Trump by 15 points on handling abortion, down from her 22-point lead last month.

More than 7 in 10 Arizona voters favor the state's proposed constitutional amendment establishing the right to an abortion, including more than two-thirds of independents and half of Republicans.

The two candidates are about equal in personal favorable ratings. Harris gets net negative marks by 3 points (48% favorable, 51% unfavorable), while Trump's are negative by 5 points (47%-52%). For the vice-presidential candidates, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's ratings are negative by just 1 point (42-43%) with 15% unable to rate him. Ohio Sen. JD Vance's favorable rating is underwater by 7 points (40-47%) and 12% have no opinion.

Trump won Arizona in 2016 by about 3.5 percentage points, while Biden's 2020 victory was by less than half a percentage point.

In the Senate race, Democrat Ruben Gallego tops Republican Kari Lake by more than 10 percentage points: 55-42% among likely voters and 56-42% among registered voters. Gallego is preferred across most demographic groups, but women voters are a big part of what gives him the advantage as they back him over Lake by a 23-point margin. He also receives the support of 6 in 10 independents and nearly 2 in 10 Republicans.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Some 15% of Gallego supporters split their ticket and back Trump in the presidential race. Some of the biggest ticket splitting is among independents, who are 16 points more likely to back Gallego than Harris, and Republicans (10 points more for Gallego). Among those voters favoring Lake, only 3% go for Harris.

Poll-pourri

Early voters are more likely to back Harris by 11 points, while Trump is favored by 30 points among the smaller group of Election Day voters.

Biden's personal favorability is negative by 21 points, 39% favorable vs. 60% unfavorable. That's a big decline from four years ago when his ratings were positive by 2 points (June 2020).

Fox News Poll: Harris is ahead of Trump by 3 points in Georgia,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-harris-ahead-trump-3-points-georgia,2024-09-26T22:06:31Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

In a head-to-head matchup, Vice President Kamala Harris tops former President Donald Trump by three percentage points in a Fox News survey of Georgia voters.

Harris receives 51% support to Trump's 48% among both registered and likely voters. While her advantage may be narrow (inside the margin of error), it is steady. Last month, she was up 50-48% among registered voters.

Roughly 1 in 10 of each candidate's supporters say they may change their mind.

More Georgians see Harris as the candidate who will help the middle class and protect democracy by a 7-point margin on each. She is also seen as the candidate more likely to fight ""for people like you"" by 6 points. Harris' largest lead is on handling the issue of abortion, where she is favored by 18 points.

Trump's largest lead is on handling immigration (+15 points).

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE

The two candidates are rated more closely on bringing needed change (Harris by 4 points), making the country safe (Trump +3), and handling the economy (Trump +4). His advantage on the economy today is half what it was last month.

Large majorities of Black voters trust Harris over Trump on each issue and trait, with as many as 85% saying she will ""fight for people like you.""

Among independents, 6 in 10 see Harris as helping the middle class, while nearly as many say Trump is better able to handle the economy.

""Georgia is looking like a true battleground with a slight lean toward Harris,"" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News polls with Republican Daron Shaw. ""More voters see her fighting for them and standing up for the middle class, and she has almost neutralized Trump's advantage on the economy.""

Party loyalty is also a factor. By a 4-percentage point margin, more Democrats back Harris than Republicans back Trump. One in five non-MAGA Republicans supports Harris.

Independents favor Harris over Trump by 13 points.

Trump won Georgia by 5 percentage points in 2016, but Biden took the state in 2020 by less than half a point.

By a wide 30-point margin, Georgia voters like the job Gov. Brian Kemp is doing, 64% approve vs. 34% disapprove (August 2024).

""The pathway for Trump is pretty obvious,"" says Shaw. ""He has to make nice with Governor Kemp and non-MAGA Republicans -- and if he does that, he probably has the edge.""

Harris gets her best numbers from Black voters, urban voters, those under age 30, and women.

Majorities of Whites without a college degree, rural voters, men, and voters ages 65 and over support Trump.

New voters split 50-50% (those who haven't voted in the four most recent general elections).

Married voters go for Trump by 15 points, while those who are unmarried favor Harris by 21.

Most voters who say they will cast their ballot early prefer Harris, while Trump is favored among those planning to vote on Election Day.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Meanwhile, Harris is generally more popular than Trump. By a 3-point margin the vice president receives net positive ratings, as 51% have a favorable view of her and 48% unfavorable. Trump's ratings are net negative by 6 points (47% vs. 53%).

The same goes for the vice-presidential candidates. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is in positive territory by 1 point (43-42%), while Ohio Sen. JD Vance is underwater by 3 (43-46%).

Trump's Tariffs: What Every American Should Know,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2024/09/26/trumps-tariffs-what-every-american-should-know/,2024-09-26T21:43:15Z,"Tariffs are essentially a tax on imported goods and are designed to protect American businesses from the threat of lower prices on imports. Tariffs may be broad or narrow. While consumers will pay more on imports subject to tariffs, the issue is much more complex.

Tariffs have been used to protect American industry for over 300 years. Here's an example of how they work. Assume XYZ Co makes widgets in the U.S. and sells them for $100 each. Further assume China can manufacture and sell them for $65 each. Even when shipping costs are factored in, let's say the final cost of Chinese widgets rises to $75 each. Using these facts, U.S. consumers can buy the imported widget from China at $75 or pay $100 for one made in the U.S.A. Many consumers will opt for the low-cost China widget, which hurts the sales of U.S.-based widget manufacturers. If the federal government levied a tariff of say 33% on the China-made widget, the price on the Chinese-made widget would be about the same as the U.S. made widget, and Americans may prefer the one made in America. Simple right? Not exactly.

What would happen if there was no tariff in this case? American business would seek to produce widgets at a lower cost to garner more sales. To lower production costs, they might have them manufactured in China, which would also reduce U.S. jobs as the company would no longer be making widgets in the U.S. This is partially the reason for the decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs, which peaked in July 1979. To be clear, manufacturing jobs rose slightly under Trump, until the pandemic hit. These jobs also rose slightly under Biden until mid-2022 but have been flat since then. Thus, the main purpose of tariffs is to protect domestic businesses from cheap overseas labor and help stabilize the U.S. labor force.

Former President Trump has mentioned tariffs on several occasions. He even suggested we could replace the income tax with tariffs. More recently, he has mentioned targeted tariffs, such as a 100% tariff on automobile imports from Mexico. When I consider his personality and his penchant for hyperbole, I doubt he would institute tariffs on all imports but do believe he would use specific Tariffs to support American businesses. Why? When you examine his speech and personality - including his negative traits, it may be wise not to take everything he says literally. Think of his comments during the pandemic on injecting bleach to kill Covid. I must presume he is aware that bleach is a poison and that injecting it can be deadly. What's the bottom line? I expect, if elected, Trump would use specific tariffs to push foreign governments into more favorable trade agreements with the U.S.

Do tariffs help companies more than consumers? At first glance, the answer is yes. Businesses do experience a direct benefit when tariffs are levied against a foreign competitor. However, it's important to note that we need American business to prosper so they can provide jobs to consumers. In the absence of tariffs, American businesses would be less competitive, resulting in fewer U.S. jobs and, as Ross Perot once said, there would be ""a giant sucking sound"" as these jobs moved to foreign countries.

What will Trump do if elected? Beyond tariffs, he has said he would reduce regulations and lower tax rates, which would stimulate economic growth. Trump continues to lead Harris in polls on who Americans trust more on the economy. However, Harris is gaining ground and the result in November is anything but certain."
Are Those Guaranteed Cash Offers A Scam?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/amandalauren/2024/09/26/are-those-guaranteed-cash-offers-a-scam/,2024-09-26T21:21:50Z,"Perhaps you've seen those signs on the side of the road that read ""Cash For Distressed Homes"" and wondered if it was a scam. Or maybe you've seen billboards from legitimate brokers/investors like Kris Lindahl or even his Super Bowl ad and wondered if this was a real thing.

Can you just sell your house for cash quickly? The answer is surprisingly yes. And while this method of selling a home might not be for everyone, it is definitely for a specific segment of the market. It's also making brokers like Lindahl incredibly successful. Here's what you need to know about selling your home for fast cash.

No matter what market you're in, selling your home isn't like selling anything else. It's a major process. You need to find a broker to list it, potentially stage it, and then leave your house during showings -- all while you probably still live there and are searching for a new place to live. If the house is in particularly bad shape, it may even need renovations. Then, there's the contract and negotiation part. So, what if you could just fast-forward to depositing a check and moving on with your life? That's exactly what Minnesota-based mega broker Lindahl does.

""With the uncertainty in the economy around inflation, jobs, housing, student loans, and so much more, we are seeing that homeowners want to trade in their house to guarantee that it's sold so they can secure housing in the next chapter of their life,"" he tells me.

Lindahl offers cash to anyone willing to sell quickly. Sometimes he keeps the properties and other times he renovates them. His approach, however, is a bit different from most brokers. While it's certainly unorthodox, it makes him more approachable and simplifies the process, which can often be complicated and frustrating.

""Trading in your house is an easy concept to understand because everyone knows how to trade in their car and the benefits. It's the homeowner's choice of the direction. Once homeowners understand they have to do nothing to their house to trade it in and they can move stress-free, that's when the lightbulb goes off,"" he explains. ""Most homeowners don't want to gamble and take the risk on the traditional open market, especially in an economy like this. Getting a house ready for the open market is costly, time-consuming, and full of risk if they don't get it right.""

Selling a home for cash can be a better strategy for certain segments of the population such as those downsizing, moving into assisted living, or selling an aging relative's home. Cash buyers may also be necessary for homes that are in an extreme level of distress.

But there are other reasons why some sellers want to get out of their homes as fast as possible such as a pending divorce. This also means their neighbors won't see a ""For Sale"" outside their homes. ""The average home is currently on the market for around 45 to 50 days. That number is going up. In the open market, homeowners have to wait for showings to happen and hope the market doesn't change while they are listed, or that another house comes on the market for less and impacts their price. There are so many risks to the open market with rising days on the market."" According to Lindahl, he can close in as little as three days.

This has also changed how the broker does business. ""The program really started booming four or five years ago as more and more people wanted convenience in every area of their life. Most people sell their house around a life-changing event, and usually, that means they want to sell fast and have confidence it will close. The open market has a bunch of speed bumps (inspections, buyers' financing, macro condition changes) that the Guaranteed Cash Offer doesn't have.""

So, could this be a smart alternative to the traditional listing process? Lindahl has certainly convinced people it is. In the past three years, he's closed over 8000 properties, which is a huge volume for a broker in any market.

Lindahl tells me other companies have tried to copy his strategies, but they've not been as successful, at least in his segment of the market. ""We are able to execute because of the high level of trust homeowners have for our brand and the billions of dollars in real estate transactions we have closed.""

Selling your house for quick cash has also even become popular in warmer and more expensive areas like Southern California, on the outskirts of Los Angles including Riverside and San Bernardino counties, according to Sean Kershaw of SJO Investments. ""The thought behind this from a business standpoint is to acquire a property to renovate and list the property on the market so a family can purchase or rent this property creating a ROI or cash flow. Again these transactions are typically for potential sellers who have a need to sell but lack the resources or the house lacks the qualifications to sell on the market.""

However, most sellers in higher markets like Los Angeles proper, where the median sold home price is $1 million, according to Realtor.com, would rather go through the traditional listing process, even if the house is a bit of a fixer upper. ""We're not seeing a ton of investors buying single-family homes because I think LA is just too expensive of a market,"" broker Lori Levine Harris of Brock & Lori tells me.

However, she says there is no shortage of cash buyers, especially for the prime properties she sells in trendy neighborhoods such as Los Feliz and Silver Lake. ""What we are seeing is parents buying houses for their kids, all cash. A lot of them."""
Three Waves Of Innovation And Three Harbingers Of AI,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2024/09/26/three-waves-of-innovation-and-three-harbingers-of-ai/,2024-09-26T20:05:20Z,"As I talk to people from all walks of life about the reality of our new AI age, we keep looking for new ways to explain the exponential technology.

I came across one which is pretty instructive, that comes from none other than Cathie Wood's Ark Invest outfit and gives us a survey of convergent technologies across the last 300 or so years.

Actually, this was being showcased by none other than Dave Blundin in his presentation of where we are now and what's to come.

In any case, when you look at this visual layout of economic impact of technology, you have a couple of small hills for the steam engine, and then for railroads and telegraph lines, around the time of the American Civil War.

Then there is a great single wave around the turn of the millennium where we had things like electricity, refrigeration, radio and the internal combustion engine - of course all of them were huge impacts, and you could argue that one of them, the vehicle engine, is still a pillar of the global economy.

But if you look a little closer to the present, you have three technology waves ramping up in quick succession. The first one has the following label - PCs - Biotech - fiberoptics.

Then there is a larger wave around the new turn of the millennium, encompassing the dot-com era, where we had Internet, cell phones, GPS and everything that came with those technologies.

But it's the third wave there that really shows us what we're up against now.

Combining things like cryptocurrencies and smart contracts with AI, cloud and robotics, you have something that's double, in terms of relative impact, anything that we've ever had before. That's on the chart, but a lot of people would say it's also intuitive when you look around you.

Now, this current wave may not look like the one that happened around the Industrial Revolution. That was more of an analog age, where the conveniences and new technologies were based on conditioning physical systems.

Today's wave is largely about the power of digital entities and transformations - not something that goes on in the ""meatspace"" where humans live, but nevertheless something that we're going to be communicating with and using as the driver for practically everything that we do and say moving forward...

That's why it's so important to talk about the human in the loop, and assisted AI technologies. It's because we will have to be coexisting with the new nonbiological entities and their products. In other words, this new wave is less tangible, but more powerful, and very real.

So what's in this big wave?

Here are three of the standout AI capabilities that people seem most nervous about right now:

1. Imposter Syndrome

Simply speaking, AI can pretend to be a person. And it's pretty darn good at it! Not too many years ago, a chatbot was something we saw as a utility, a cute little way to fulfill simple conversation tasks, like transactions. Now, AI is able to convince us that we're talking to a real person. You don't have to look any further than your smartphone screen to see that.

Or check out tech media. ""Duplex sounded like a bona fide person, complete with pauses and ""ums"" for more human-like authenticity,"" wrote Emily Dreyfuss in Wired, of one such anecdote - and that was in 2018! The technology has only become more powerful in catfishing us from wherever we are. So watch out.

2. Being You

Then, too, AI can now perfectly use your voice, or the voice of a celebrity, which makes things even more confusing. Identity theft, anyone? Check out ""AI Voices Mimicking Loved Ones in Emergencies"" at Ars Tecnica from last year, or just watch Dave Blundin talking about Tailbox and demoing himself as an avatar!

3. Making Decisions

A third major landmark here is the use of AI to put systems on 'autopilot'. Maybe the most prominent example is Tesla. We've been seeing them work on this for years without it ever being really 'ready for prime time.' What's the endgame?

Anyway, there's a pretty wide consensus that AI, really, ""is here."" The chart bears that out in a visual way that I think is helpful. Stay tuned for more on IIA and everything else that's happening right now."
Blackstone To Invest $13 Billion In AI Data Center In U.K.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertolsen-1/2024/09/26/blackstone-to-invest-13-billion-in-ai-data-center-in-uk/,2024-09-26T20:05:13Z,"Blackstone has committed to investing £10 billion ($13.4 billion) in the U.K. to build one of Europe's largest artificial intelligence data centers, Britain's government has announced.

The investment promises to create 4,000 jobs at a site in Blyth, Northumberland. The land had been bought by Blackstone after the collapse of Britishvolt, which had intended to use the site for manufacturing batteries for electric vehicles. Construction on the data center is expected to begin next year.

Blackstone President and COO, Jonathan Gray, said, ""The U.K. is a top investment market for Blackstone because of its powerful combination of talent and innovation along with a highly transparent legal system.""

""We are making significant commitments to building social housing, facilitating the energy transition, growing life sciences companies and developing critical infrastructure needed to fuel the digital economy,"" he added.

Blackstone is the world's largest alternative asset manager with investments spanning private equity, real estate, credit and hedge funds. The group had $1.1 trillion in assets under management as of June this year. Its portfolio of commercial real estate was valued last year at $337 billion.

Britain's prime minister, Keir Starmer, welcomed the investment while on a visit to New York aimed at attracting investment to boost the U.K.'s ailing economy.

""New investment such as the one we've announced with Blackstone today is a huge vote of confidence in the UK and it proves that Britain is back as a major player on the global stage and we're open for business,"" Starmer said.

The plan for the data center was first revealed in April in when the local council published Blackstone's proposal for the site. The firm's data center business, QTS, acquired the land for about £20 million, followed by phased payments of up to £110 million to the council in exchange for long-term control of the site.

The rise of artificial intelligence is boosting demand for power-hungry data centers. Investment bank Goldman Sachs recently estimated that power demand from data centers will grow 160% by 2030. Data centers currently consume 1% to 2% of global energy use, but that figure could rise to 4% by the end of the decade."
"Millionaire Investors Prefer Harris To Trump, UBS Poll Says",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/26/millionaire-investors-prefer-harris-to-trump-ubs-poll-says/,2024-09-26T19:45:27Z,"A majority of high net worth Americans favor Vice President Kamala Harris over former President Donald Trump in November's election, according to a new survey, as the pair spar over the U.S. economy while it navigates a potential inflection point.

A similar poll of business owners from UBS released Thursday revealed a far more pro-Trump tilt, with 53% favoring the Republican candidate to Harris' 47%. About two-thirds of respondents said they were highly concerned about business tax rates increasing, the top worry spot identified in the survey of 500 business owners overseeing annual revenues of more than $1 million. The business owners preferred Trump on the economy at a 55% to 45% margin and on taxes at a 54% to 46% margin.

The millionaire group viewed healthcare, technology and sustainability-focused stocks as the most attractive sectors if Harris wins, and defense, energy and industrials as the most attractive sectors if Trump wins. Strategists have said tech stocks may be better suited under Harris due to Trump's hawkish trade stance with China and some big American tech companies' outsized reliance on Chinese business, while Trump's promise to lower regulatory obstacles are seen as a boon for regulation-heavy industries like energy.

Running a campaign largely targeting the U.S.' middle class, Harris backs several policies designed to rail against the country's wealthiest citizens, including a controversial tax on unrealized capital gains for individuals worth at least $100 million, which would consider stock market gains on already held stocks taxable income. Both Harris and Trump have courted business owners, with Harris floating a tenfold increase to the startup tax break and Trump proposing a major cut to the corporate tax rate for companies that produce products domestically. Polling of the broaderU.S. population mostly suggests a slight preference for Trump to oversee the economy. Though stock indexes continue to set new highs and economic growth remains robust, many Americans are dissatisfied with the state of the economy, with inflation at the core of the malcontent as price jumps raged to a four-decade high during the Biden administration."
Michael Steele: Harris pitches combo meal economic message to voters,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/-harris-solo-interview-economy-trump-populism-rcna172880,2024-09-26T19:18:10Z,"On Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle for her first solo broadcast interview as a presidential candidate. It was a great opportunity for the vice president to speak directly to the American people and explain her economic vision for a Harris administration.

Overall, I thought she did a very solid job but there was one theme, both in that interview and in her economic address in Pittsburgh earlier in the day, that stuck out to me the most. Harris, who frequently references her experience working at McDonald's as a student, presented herself to voters as this combo meal of ""I'm a capitalist, but I also support unions and workers."" That's a space we don't often see a candidate occupy these days. Harris wants to bridge together two sides that people frequently try to pit against each other.

Harris is trying to create an opportunity economy around fundamental ideas -- ideas that translate across party platforms. She's not strictly appealing to or excluding specific parts of the electorate. She's inviting voters to look at her proposals and ask themselves: How does this benefit my personal economy?

What also stuck out to me about the interview was that Harris didn't strike an absolute populist tone. Instead, there was a modicum of populism in her message. You could hear it when she talked about the American worker, when she talked about families who don't want their lives to be disrupted because the car broke down, and families who just want to be able to pay their bills. That's a form of populism, but it's not at the extremes.

She's touching on that center space and trying to appeal to a wider range of voters. It's what a lot of politicians on the Republican side did before the party wandered into Donald Trump's cray-cray land. Harris is following that lead and building her economic case around a central point -- one that can touch people who live in cities, in the suburbs and the exurbs and appeal to voters across the political and demographic spectrum."
Not Minnesota nice: GOP congressman playing Tim Walz in debate prep with JD Vance argues he's an 'empty suit',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/not-minnesota-nice-gop-congressman-playing-tim-walz-debate-prep-jd-vance-argues-hes-empty-suit,2024-09-26T19:16:46Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Ask House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer about Gov. Tim Walz, a fellow Minnesotan and Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, and the five-term Republican congressman jokingly takes a shot.

""I didn't realize that Tim Walz and I are around the same age. He looks so much older,"" the 63-year-old Emmer said about the 60-year-old Walz.

Emmer was answering a question during a Fox News Digital interview about whether Emmer was playing the role of the Minnesota governor in debate prep with GOP vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio because they're both from the same state and similar ages.

Emmer, a one-time college hockey player and attorney who serves as the No. 3 Republican in the U.S. House, shared that he and Vance had not yet [as of Thursday afternoon when he spoke to Fox News Digital) conducted a mock debate.

FOX NEWS TO SIMULCAST THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

""We're going to get together at some point,"" he said, declining to add any details or specifics on the mock session with Vance ahead of Tuesday's vice presidential debate in New York City.

But Emmer, who steered the House Republicans' campaign committee in the 2020 and 2022 cycles, had plenty of criticism of Harris and Walz.

WHICH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HOLDS THE EDGE ON THE ECONOMY?

""It's an honor to be asked to play a very small part in helping JD and President Trump expose the failures of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.""

Emmer argued ""the hardest part of playing Walz ... is trying to tell lies with a straight face, because that's what he does. He's good at the debate game, but there isn't substance there. There's a lot of air.""

Emmer and Walz overlapped for four years in the House before Walz won election in 2018 as Minnesota's governor.

""I do know him probably as well or better than most on the Republican side. And I can tell you that Minnesotans, people at home, know better than anyone that we can't afford four years of a Harris-Walz administration in the White House,"" Emmer emphasized.

And Emmer claimed ""it's very clear today that the Tim Walz that was here in Congress was literally, he was a fraud. He was playing the character of a Greater Minnesota ag-friendly outdoorsman who really cared about the people. Since then, he's made it very clear to people in Greater Minnesota that he has very little interest in them.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

""It doesn't get reported enough, but under Walz, Minnesota's taxes have skyrocketed. Violent crime is up all over, and our communities are worse off,"" Emmer said. ""No amount of Minnesota nice ... is going to make up for Tim Walz's failed policy record.""

Emmer claimed that ""Walz is an empty suit who has worked to turn Minnesota into Harris' home state of California. ... This guy is Gavin Newsom wearing a flannel shirt.""

A Republican hasn't carried Minnesota in a presidential election since President Richard Nixon's 1972 landslide re-election over a half century ago. It was the only state President Reagan lost in his 1984 re-election landslide.

Asked if Minnesota is in play in the presidential race, Emmer said, ""Are we going to be close enough that Donald Trump has a chance to be the first Republican presidential candidate to win Minnesota since 1972? I think the answer is yes.""

Emmer noted that polls suggest Harris' margin in Minnesota over Trump has dropped since she named Walz as her running mate early last month.

""He's not popular in Minnesota. I think by picking Tim Walz, they may have put Minnesota in play,"" Emmer argued."
Poland's Economic Growth Is Threatened By Severe Labor Shortages,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lidiakurasinska/2024/09/26/polands-economic-growth-is-threatened-by-severe-labor-shortages/,2024-09-26T19:09:10Z,"Despite boasting the fastest GDP growth in the European Union and a record-low unemployment rate, Poland is facing significant threats to its economic prosperity due to severe labor shortages.

More than 80% of small and medium-sized enterprises report struggling to find enough workers. In some industries -- such as construction, manufacturing, transportation, and logistics -- staffing shortages affect half or more of the companies.

In an effort to attract more foreign workers and fill labor market gaps, the government is developing its first comprehensive migration strategy, expected to be unveiled by the end of the year.

Until now, Poland's migration policies have been largely reactive and lacked clearly defined long-term objectives, reducing the country's attractiveness to foreign workers and hampering investment.

According to a June study by the Polish Economic Institute, half of the companies surveyed said that labor shortages were a significant barrier to their operations. The problem is particularly severe in the construction industry, where nearly seven out of ten businesses are affected.

According to data from the Central Statistical Office (GUS), in the first quarter of this year, Polish employers reported 112,000 job vacancies that could not be filled despite active recruitment efforts. Estimates suggest that Poland's labor shortage could reach up to 1.5 million workers by 2026.

Some of the reasons behind Poland's labor shortages include low fertility rates and an aging population. Over the past 30 years, the birth rate decreased by 40% and currently stands at 1.33. The country's statistical agency forecasts that the population will continue to shrink in the coming decades and that between 2023 and 2060, the number of people of working age will decrease by at least 7 million.

Yet businesses seeking to employ migrants face many bureaucratic hurdles. Andrii Arkaniuk, employment legalization specialist at Contrain Group, a recruitment agency, says it can take eight to 10 months for a worker from outside the EU to receive a permit.

In August, 11 business associations urged the government to adopt a ""favorable approach to legal, sustainable labor immigration."" Many entrepreneurs are concerned that strict immigration policies will make it harder to hire workers.

Katarzyna Dębkowska, head of the Economic Foresight Team at the Polish Economic Institute, says developing a comprehensive, responsible, and selective migration policy should be one of the government's most urgent priorities.

""This is particularly important given that, over the past decade, Poland has shifted from a country with a negative net migration balance to one with a positive balance,"" Dębkowska says.

Approximately one million foreigners are employed in Poland, making up 6.6% of the total workforce. Of these, 68.7% come from Ukraine, followed by 11.4% from Belarus and 2.5% from Georgia.

Up to a third of Ukrainians in Poland are considering leaving the country, as they are employed in roles beneath their qualifications and see limited opportunities for advancement. This poses a serious risk for industries such as construction, transport, and logistics, which heavily rely on Ukrainian labor.

Arkaniuk believes Ukrainian refugees could significantly benefit the Polish economy if they were employed in positions that match their skills. However, the main challenge they face is the language barrier, as many do not speak Polish.

He suggests the government consider offering support for Polish language education, possibly through tax breaks or subsidies, to help Ukrainian workers integrate more effectively and fully contribute to the workforce."
Where Is Amazon's Stock Price Heading In 2025?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/where-is-amazon-amzn-stock-price-heading-in-2025/,2024-09-26T18:57:17Z,"Where is Amazon's (AMZN) stock price heading next year? Let's formulate a prediction by running through the key factors, including the company's current position, primary growth drivers, potential challenges and strategic initiatives in play.

Amazon has leading market share in two industries, e-commerce retail and cloud computing, plus a third-place share in U.S. digital advertising. Here are the numbers, according to Statista:

Amazon has been a strong growth story for investors since 2010. In that period, AMZN stock grew from a split-adjusted $6 to nearly $200.

The climb has not been linear, however. Shareholders benefited from a big spike in late-2020, which largely held until 2022. Like several of its tech counterparts, AMZN shed value in that year, dipping enough to walk back two years of gains.

After falling to nearly $80 in December 2022, AMZN stock made a rocky climb to eclipse $200 in July of this year. Investors have since pulled back from that peak and the stock now trades at just over $190.

Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts.

Likely sources of growth for Amazon going forward include AWS, which will benefit from the AI boom, e-commerce sales and the rollout of advertising on Prime Video.

Amazon is working to establish AWS as the first platform of choice for AI computing. That initiative involves offering customers a range of hardware and software choices at different price points. To do that, Amazon developed its own AI training and inference chips, called Trainium and Inferentia, respectively. The first generation of the in-house chips has been well-received, and Amazon expects to release updated versions later this year.

As well, the company continues to enhance its software stack for AI developers. That stack includes machine-learning platforms Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock plus the generative AI coding assistant Amazon Q, among other things.

On the retail side, Amazon has been working to improve delivery speed, keep prices low and expand product selection. These initiatives are gaining traction, with more customers turning to Amazon for essential goods, such as deodorant and toilet paper. This category is important because customers buy these items repeatedly.

Going forward, the company is focused on reducing costs across its fulfillment network through automation and AI. Lower fulfillment costs support the three customer-oriented outcomes -- faster delivery, lower costs and broader selection -- that can fuel sales growth.

Amazon started showing ads on Prime Video content earlier this year. The change could be an ongoing source of advertising and subscription revenue growth.

The company says its ad technology can link Prime Video ad spending to sales and other outcomes, which has historically been challenging for TV advertisers. The same measurement technology can also reveal opportunities to optimize ad content for better performance.

Prime subscribers can upgrade to an ad-free experience for $2.99 monthly.

Risks to watch for Amazon include rising competition in retail and cloud computing, plus a pending antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Amazon was the first to offer free shipping with a subscription, but others have followed suit. The closest Prime competitor currently is Walmart+. This program includes free shipping and delivery from Walmart stores, plus discounts on gas, entertainment and fast food. The annual price of $98 undercuts Prime's yearly rate of $139.

Target also launched a paid membership product this year, called Target Circle 360. Members primarily get free two-day shipping.

There are additionally many other discount online retailers that compete with Amazon, either comprehensively or in specific categories. Examples include eBay, Temu and Flipkart plus Newegg for electronics and Shein for clothes.

Amazon holds the top spot in cloud computing now, but Microsoft has been moving closer. The AI boom is a strong motivation to close the gap.

Building out the best cloud offering for AI computing will require continued investments in infrastructure and innovation. All three of the top providers -- Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet -- have deep pockets, which sets the stage for an ongoing competitive battle.

In September 2023, the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general sued Amazon for illegal, anti-competitive actions in its e-commerce business. Amazon has publicly defended its practices as being in the customer's best interest.

The case could ultimately force Amazon to change its business practices or restructure. Fortunately, any damaging outcomes are likely years away, which means the process is more of a concern today than the result. If the case drags on for years, it could become an expensive distraction for Amazon.

According to Amazon's second quarter 2024 earnings call, strategic priorities for next year include:

Analyst predictions for Amazon characterize it as one of the best stocks to buy right now. Across 41 covering analysts, 24 rate AMZN stock a strong buy. The remaining 17 are buy ratings. There are no hold, sell or strong sell ratings.

The stock currently trades at about $193 per share. Analyst price targets range from $145 to $265, with a consensus of $220.59. The midpoint represents upside of about 14%.

In terms of financial results, analysts expect nearly 13% revenue growth and 66% EPS growth this year. The outlook for 2025 is about 11% revenue growth and 23% EPS growth.

Amazon stock has bounced back from a tough 2022, notching roughly 60% growth over the past two years. Investors have been largely positive on AMZN in 2024, except for a dip after a disappointing jobs report in early August. The S&P 500, Amazon's tech peers and many of the best ETFs followed similar trajectories.

The current stock price is about 4% below AMZN's July high point of $201.20.

Amazon has momentum in AWS and retail sales, which collectively provide much of its revenue and operating income. Assuming the Fed continues to lower interest rates and the U.S. economy responds well to those changes, AMZN stock could see a double-digit lift in 2025.

Additionally, several of Amazon's valuation metrics are below their five-year averages, which provides an extra margin of safety. The company's P/E ratio, for example, is 46.27. That compares favorably to the five-year average P/E of 75.63.

Amazon has a pesky lawsuit in play and potentially stiff competition for cloud computing and retail sales. Even so, the tech giant has business momentum that could drive double-digit appreciation over the next 12 months. Add in reasonable valuation ratios and it's easy to argue that now may be the time to add Amazon to your portfolio."
Republicans propose bill that would double tariffs on Chinese imports and end favored trade status,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tom-cotton-releases-bill-cease-all-normal-trade-relations-china-increase-tariffs-100,2024-09-26T18:25:19Z,"FIRST ON FOX: A group of Republican senators is unveiling a new bill that would cease all permanent normal trade relations with China and double the tariffs on Chinese Communist Party (CCP) goods.

The bill would, over five years, increase tariffs by 100% on imports deemed ""strategic"" to national security by the Biden administration in an effort to force the growth of the domestic market for national security-related goods.

It would boost tariffs on non-strategic goods by a minimum of 35%.

The bill, led by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and cosponsored by Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., would also grant the president the authority to institute further tariffs, quotas and bans on specific Chinese goods. It would end ""de minimis treatment"" for China, or the value threshold below which imports are not subject to customs duties.

The revenue generated from this, according to the bill, would go towards farmers and manufacturers injured by potential Chinese retaliation, the purchase of key munitions important to a Pacific conflict, and paying down the debt.

GOP SENATORS EYE COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO CURB CCP INFLUENCE

""This comprehensive repeal of China's PNTR [Permanent normal Trade Relations] status and reform of the U.S.-China trade relationship will protect American workers, enhance our national security, and end the Chinese Communists' leverage over our economy,"" Cotton said in a statement.

""Giving Communist China the same trade benefits that we give to our greatest allies was one of the most catastrophic decisions that our country has ever made,"" said Rubio.

Economists forecast that China's GDP is expected to grow by nearly 5% in 2024. The U.S.'s forecasted GDP growth is half that.

The legislation falls in line with one of Trump's top priorities: during the presidential debate this month, the former president said again that he would impose a 60% tariff on Chinese goods and a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods. Vice President Kamala Harris scoffed at that plan as a ""a sales tax on the American people.""

Earlier this month, China instituted new export controls on a batch of minerals that are critical to the U.S. defense industry, including antimony products.

The little-known flame-retardant metal is used in ammunition, infrared missiles, nuclear weapons and night vision goggles, as well as batteries and photovoltaic equipment. China produced nearly half of the world's antimony last year.

BIDEN ROLLS OUT NEW CHINA TARIFFS

In 2000, the U.S. Congress voted to grant China permanent normal trade relations. The designation fundamentally changed China-U.S. trade relations: American consumers gained access to low-priced Chinese imports and between 2001 and 2021, the value of goods imported from China quadrupled to $500 billion.

""More than two decades ago, Washington elites granted China most favored nation trading status, enabling Beijing to exploit our working class. Congress must revoke this sweetheart deal to protect American workers from our greatest adversary and to bring back the millions of manufacturing jobs shipped overseas,"" said Hawley.

The Biden administration earlier this month finalized plans to increase tariffs on certain Chinese-made products: the tariff rate would double for electric vehicles, go up 50% on solar cells and 25% on EV batteries, critical minerals, steel, aluminum, face masks and ship-to-shore cranes beginning September 27, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

Tariff hikes on other products, like semiconductor chips, are expected to go up over the next two years.

Trump implemented sweeping tariffs on about $300 billion worth of Chinese-made products. Biden kept those in place and slapped more tariffs on about $15 billion of Chinese imports.

China is widely expected to respond with tariffs on U.S.-made goods."

A Georgia voter told CNN during a recent interview that she was considering voting Republican for the first time in her life, as Vice President Kamala Harris attempts to duplicate President Biden's 2020 support in the state.

""I've been a Democrat my entire adult life,"" Chantá Villano-Willis, a resident of a majority Black community in Cobb County, told CNN. ""This has actually been the first year where I was considering voting Republican.""

She said of her mother, ""(She) never thought she'd see a Black person president in her life. She did. Now, Kamala Harris is (running) for president. My mother says she doesn't care what she does, let's just get her in there. And I simply don't feel the same.""

CNN's John King spoke to a group of voters throughout Georgia about their intentions in November. The state helped propel President Biden to victory in 2020.

MSNBC HOST DEFENDS HARRIS AVOIDING POLICY QUESTIONS: SHE'S 'NOT RUNNING FOR PERFECT'

However, Willis said that she agreed with Harris on abortion and argued that sometimes Trump talked down to Black people.

Kim Cavaliere, a Gwinnett County resident who leans Democrat but voted third party in the previous two elections, told CNN she wasn't pleased with either choice.

""But did she convince me she has what it takes? No,"" Cavaliere said of Harris, despite conceding the vice president won her debate against Trump. ""Right now, I am not settling and am not pleased with the choices.""

Christine Nguyen, who plans to vote for Harris and owns a small business in Decatur, told CNN that the economy could be a problem for Harris' chances.

""That comes up very often,"" she told King. ""I hear it a lot, even in my family of entrepreneurs, it comes up every now and then, right, that Trump just knows business better, that he's, you know, more savvy. ... But I think at the end of the day, it's what you value and, like, what your beliefs are in terms of your ethics.""

She said Harris' connection to the Biden administration could hurt her chances.

""It definitely has hurt our business in the past couple of months, seeing the prices go up for our supplies, and us not being able to adjust the prices accordingly,"" Nguyen said.

The Fed's Rate Cut:  A 'Soft Landing' - Or 'Fake News'?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2024/09/26/the-feds-rate-cut--a-soft-landing--or-fake-news/,2024-09-26T17:53:47Z,"On September 18, at precisely 2:00 pm, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve announced a reduction of 50 basis points (½ of 1%) in the Fed Funds target rate.

It was the first rate cut in 4 ½ years, finally reversing the most aggressive interest rate increase program in decades.

50 bps was said to be ""emphatic."" The Financial Times called it a ""jumbo cut."" The Wall Street Journal headlined ""Fed Goes Big.""

Chairman Powell called it ""an appropriate recalibration"" - and repeated that phrase nine times.

The announcement set the stock market ringing like a bell.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 300 points in the first 60 seconds after Powell began to speak. Then it fell back 300 points. Then it was up 200. And then down 280. Up again, and then down 400. In 2 hours, the supposedly staid Dow racked up almost 2500 points in round trip mileage - trillions of dollars of value sloshing around in the gold-plated bathtub known as the U.S. stock market.

The next day, turmoil gave way to relief. The market surged to a new record. ""A furious rally"" swept global markets. European stocks had their best day in a month. Japan's Nikkei average was up 2%. The announcement pushed all the other big stories of the day - the Presidential race, Gaza, Ukraine - to the sidelines.

A Chick-Fil-A sign in northeast Washington DC alerted customers to the big news: ""50 points."" A strange message from a fast food outlet. Was an update on monetary policy somehow more important than the price of a chicken sandwich? Or maybe it was a clever prompt - Come on in, let's celebrate!

Big, bold, jumbo, emphatic, furious, all that - however, this move was no surprise. It would be hard to even call it ""news."" Chairman Powell all but pre-announced the rate cut 27 days prior to the event - ""the time has come for policy to adjust"" - in his Jackson Hole address. The timing was known. The direction was known. The markets had ample opportunity to price it in. A believer in efficient markets would have said that very little new information was introduced on Wednesday.

(True, the exact size of the rate cut was not known. 25 basis points? or 50? It had become the focus of intense speculation. But does this small difference really matter? Not everyone thinks so. I'll come back to it below.)

The ragged price discovery path on Sept 18 exposed the clash of two opposing ""investment theses,"" battling it out in the market.

On the one hand, monetary easing usually bodes well for the stock market. Since 1974, on occasions where the Fed initiated a rate cutting cycle, the market has been up eight out of ten times the following year.

On the other hand, the last three rate cutting episodes have been less fortunate for investors. In those cases, the cut was followed by an economic downturn. If the economy today really needs a stimulus, maybe it means there's trouble ahead. According to Torsten Sløk of Apollo, the rates markets are already pricing in a recession. The Wall Street Journal was spooked in particular by the size of the reduction.

Still, on Thursday morning the Dow opened up 450 points, and maintained this level for several days now. The optimists' view has prevailed, for now.

But is this optimism justified? In all this sound and fury, what is the real news here? There are several layers of misinterpretation that have to be stripped away to get at the true significance of this event.

An adjustment of the Fed Funds Rate can be interpreted in two ways:

Some assume that lowering the Federal Funds Rate will have a direct positive effect on the economy, reducing the cost of credit, stimulating demand and spending, influencing banks' lending, even boosting the labor market and creating new jobs. But is this likely?

It is not clear.

First of all, what is the Fed Funds Rate (FFR), exactly? The way it's talked and written about, one might think the Fed is immediately mandating lower interest rates across the economy. But no - the FFR applies only to the interest rate target for overnight loans of a very specific type, involving transactions between banks.

The FFR comes into play when a bank finds itself with more cash on account with the Fed (its reserves) than it really needs - or not enough. If Bank A is short and wants to top off its reserves, it can borrow from Bank B which has a surplus - and Bank B can earn some interest. The actual FFR (different from the target FFR) is the interest rate that Banks A and B freely negotiate for this transaction. It is determined by the banks, not by the Fed.

That's a key point. The Fed doesn't actually set the rate; it only defines a target. Whether the FFR target has any effect on the credit markets depends on whether the banks go along.

The Fed is merely an ""influencer"" - albeit a powerful one, with various carrots and sticks to deploy for encouraging the private sector to play along.

[Note: The mechanisms for controlling the market's response to the FFR and reserve levels are quite complicated, involving other interest rates which the Fed can set and are not simply targets. Still, the system is not fully deterministic, and depends substantially on market responses from private sector participants (banks).]

So what is the effect of the Fed dropping the target by ½ of 1%? As noted, that ultimately depends on what the banks do, driven by market conditions and the real demand for credit. Actual market rates for interbank credit transactions that impact the economy are often significantly higher than the FFR target. The interbank offered rate - which was for decades the chief measure of the cost of credit in the market - is almost always higher than the FFR (partly due to the longer term, of course, but also partly due to the difference between ""market reality"" and ""policy goals"").

The shifts in the market rate also tend to lag the reversals in the central bank policy by several quarters.

It is hard to make the case that shaving a few basis points off the target for an overnight funding benchmark that only applies to banks lending to each other (not to consumers or businesses) would per se have an immediate impact on the real economy. The causal link is too attenuated, and the size of the adjustment is too small, to move the needle in a $100 Trillion credit market. For comparison, consider that the interest rate on 30-year home mortgages has fallen by over 100 basis points since May, and home sales have continued to decline, dropping by 12% in that period. Cheaper credit does not necessarily spur more borrowing.

But it is assumed - typically without question - that the reduction in the FFR will at least lead to a lowering of other interest rates. In fact, the rates (yields) on Treasurys actually rose after the announcement of the Fed Rate cut, as The Wall Street Journal reported:

Treasury Yields arguably influence credit markets much more than the FFR.

Over time, trends in short term rates like the FFR and in longer-term rates like 10-year Treasury yields do tend to align, but the relationship is quite noisy. It is neither automatic nor necessarily immediate. This suggests that the causal connection is not as solid as is usually supposed.

Fed rate policy is better understood as a messaging program. The FFR is a crucial signal. But what is it signaling?

The view of many economists and financial market analysts is that the current rate cut, relatively insignificant in itself, predicts the future trend in rate cuts which will eventually cumulate to produce a more substantial impact.

Some observers, including some at the Fed itself, now forecast rates reaching 3% by the end of 2026. The Federal Open Market Committee's dot plots project another ~200 bps reduction over the next two years. (Of course it must be acknowledged that the Fed is ""terrible at predicting what it will do."")

It is an article of faith that a changes in the FFR impact credit costs across the economy. This affects the real economy in certain ways. Changes in the growth rate of consumer loans are inversely correlated with the FFR after a lag of about 6 months - meaning lower rates will stimulate borrowing. But more fundamental measures of economic health - GDP growth, consumer spending, job creation - do not show the same pattern.

For those unfamiliar with the meaning of correlation statistics, all of these readings signal a very weak association, if any. Correlation doesn't prove causality, but lack of correlation is strong evidence for the absence of causality.

The lack of correlation with jobs growth is particularly striking, since Fed officials have explicitly tied the rate-change decision to the health of the labor market. Yet the FFR apparently has had no measurable effect on job creation over the last decade.

The FFR appears to be ineffectual with respect to impacting many measures of real economic performance in the following 1-2 years.

So, was the Fed's announcement, or the media's headline interpretation of it, ""fake news""?

Much of the coverage is misleading at least. The reduction in interest rates will not cure whatever ails the labor markets. Based on past experience, it will not directly spur job creation or economic growth, either immediately or over the next couple years.

The real message of this maneuver is quite different. It is has to do with public psychology, and public trust, which Jerome Powell as has said ""is really the Fed's and any central bank's most important asset.""

The Federal Reserve is a faith-based institution. Its effectiveness rests on the public confidence.

The surge of inflation in 2021-2022 (which trailed through the year-over-year statistics well into 2023) damaged the Fed's credibility enormously. In December 2022, the Washington Post wrote in a lead editorial:

This is strong language. But the danger is real. Confidence in the Fed touched an all-time low in 2023, and is up only slightly in 2024. The Fed's ""most important asset"" has been dangerously impaired.

The rate cut was really about repairing the Fed's credibility. ""Going big"" with 50 basis points is not about the economic impact. It is a psychological gambit, intended to convey decisiveness and self-confidence.

Powell used that interesting new word - ""recalibrating"" - nine times in the press conference. It is the next policy mantra, replacing ""transitory"" and ""higher for longer"" etc. ""Recalibration"" suggests a machine that is capable of precision, accuracy. The Fed needs the public to believe that it can fine-tune policy and control events once again.

This is misleading, however, if not outright deception (""fake news""?). When it comes to the real economy, the Federal Reserve is ineffectual, even helpless, to a degree far greater than it can afford to admit openly. The Central Bank neither caused nor cured the recent surge of price inflation. It can do nothing to affect the price of gasoline or eggs or used cars. It cannot ""create jobs."" It can barely influence the cost of bank credit. It can't even do very much to help the housing market, which is the sector of the economy where interest rates matter most. ""The Fed can cut rates but it can't fix the housing crisis"" headlined Fortune magazine (Sept 19, 2024).

The Fed is the Central Bank not just for the United States, but in effect for the entire world - and the world needs a Central Bank it can believe in. Credibility is crucial and the Fed is right to do what it can to try to recover it. But we should understand what the rate cut was really about. It should not be advertised as something it is not. The Fed shouldn't be selling ""growth."" And the Chick-Fil-A folks should stick to selling sandwiches rather than basis points."
Undecided voters could sway the election. Here are the issues that matter to them.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/alex-wagner-michigan-union-workers-swing-state-undecided-voters-rcna172727,2024-09-26T17:33:46Z,"Alex Wagner sat down with union workers in battleground Michigan to find out what's really going on in the minds of undecided voters.

On Tuesday, MSNBC host Alex Wagner hosted a live show from the critical battleground state of Michigan. With less than six weeks to go until Election Day, both Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have made the state a top priority.

Victory in the Great Lakes State is still within reach for both campaigns: A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll published this week found Harris narrowly leads Trump there, 48% to 45%, well within the poll's 4.4% margin of error.

Wagner sat down with voters from a key constituency being courted by Harris and Trump: union members. According to NBC News exit polls, 21% of people who cast a ballot in Michigan in 2020 came from a household with one or more union members.

Wagner described her conversations with the group as a ""fascinating, complicated snapshot from the frontlines of the 2024 election,"" and said their thoughts were ""critical at understanding why this race remains so very close.""

While some union members Wagner spoke with had already made up their minds on the candidates, many remained undecided. That same USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found 4% of voters in Michigan were still unsure whom they would vote for in November.

""I'm undecided because I haven't seen enough of it yet. I need to pay closer attention and kind of do more independent research before I make my judgment,"" one voter told Wagner.

Immigration was a top concern listed by several undecided voters, especially among those casting their ballot for the first time. Those voters told Wagner they were concerned about the southern border and believed immigrants were taking jobs away from U.S. citizens. (Studies have shown immigrants to the U.S. create more jobs than they take.) Housing and wages were also top issues among first-time, undecided voters.

But, as Wagner noted, perhaps what was just as interesting was what was not on the minds of these voters. The union workers expressed little interest in stories that have dominated media coverage of the campaign, like abortion or Trump's legal troubles.

""I'm not familiar with the charges that are being brought against him"" in connection to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, one voter told Wagner. ""I'm not following that.""

Only one voter in the crowd of nearly 60 raised their hand when asked if they were familiar with the Dobbs decision, the Supreme Court ruling that eliminated the constitutional right to abortion.

""What matters most and what may ultimately determine their votes this year are the conversations they have in their community,"" Wagner observed.

There was also a stark generational divide among the union members, with several older, veteran members throwing their support behind Harris. Younger members tended to be undecided or leaning toward Trump.

""We have to move our country forward,"" one Harris supporter told Wagner, adding: ""Donald Trump is pulling us backwards.""

Another Harris voter referred to his fellow union member's concern over the economy but argued that preserving democracy was a more important issue. ""I'm not going to lose my democracy over the price of a gallon of gas or the price of a loaf of bread,"" he said. ""Democracy is too fragile, and it's too important."""

MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle showered Vice President Kamala Harris with praise and repeatedly shrugged off her non-answers following their sit-down.

Appearing on ""Deadline: White House,"" Ruhle said that while Harris ""didn't want to go deep"" on her plans with tariffs, she claimed the VP had a ""serious plan as it relates to manufacturing.""

""If you think about the big economic legislation that has been passed in the last four years, we have actually seen billions of dollars being put to work, thousands of jobs being created, much of which are in red states and red counties, bringing manufacturing jobs back,"" Ruhle told her MSNBC colleague Nicolle Wallace.

""Now, they're not the old manufacturing jobs. They are new manufacturing and this friction, this period of change, doesn't just happen overnight, right? So Donald Trump, who really appealed to that blue collar, that union worker in 2016 kind of on a guttural, emotional level, we've seen the Biden administration appeal to that base on a policy level, but she knows she's not getting those votes overnight,"" Ruhle continued.

KAMALA HARRIS CONFRONTED ON NOT EARNING TEAMSTERS ENDORSEMENT: 'WHAT WAS THEIR REASONING?'

Ruhle, who also serves as a business analyst for NBC News, said Harris' ""challenge"" is to message to voters that her economic policies ""serve everyone,"" insisting that the VP wants to build ""an inclusive economy.""

""What I didn't hear from her was divisive language,"" Ruhle told Wallace. ""Imagine if I was sitting against Donald Trump, imagine the language he would be using, please! And just the fact that we were talking about collaborative inclusivity - I don't know. Vote for her or don't vote for her, but isn't it great to just have a positive conversation right now?""

The MSNBC host did go on to admit that Harris didn't answer a question about how she would get the funding for her ambitious economic agenda without Congress but quickly defended her by saying Trump would ""balloon"" the deficit ""significantly bigger than Vice President Harris will.""

MSNBC'S STEPHANIE RUHLE CALLS OUT HARRIS FOR DODGING HOW SHE'D RAISE TAXES: 'SHE DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION'

Ruhle later appeared on ""All In with Chris Hayes,"" which aired the interview in full.

She further shrugged off Harris' non-answers, referring to an exchange she had about the Democrat's criticisms of Trump's tariff proposals while also implementing their own tariffs under the Biden administration.

""It's complicated, right?"" Ruhle exclaimed. ""We're a country of 330 million people, our economy is complicated. In the same way - is the economy good or bad? It totally depends! So tariffs, if used in the right places, can work. And one could watch that and say, 'Well, she didn't give a clear, direct answer.' That's okay, because we are not talking about clear or direct issues.""

Ruhle rejected critics who panned Harris' price control plan as being ""socialist,"" turning to Trump's proposal of capping interest rates for credit card companies.

""When I call, like, ride or die capitalists about this. They're like 'Oh, it's nonsense. It was just talk and talk.' But when she says anything that even sniffs like it, they're like 'See, she's a socialist nutball.' So it's completely crazy,"" Ruhle complained.

MSNBC HOST DEFENDS HARRIS AVOIDING POLICY QUESTIONS: SHE'S 'NOT RUNNING FOR PERFECT'

Hayes complimented Harris as being ""quite adept"" on the issues and said it would benefit her campaign by doing more such media interviews, something Ruhle agreed with ""100%.""

""Because what's crazy is that Donald Trump gets so much credit and has for the last nine years of the fact that, you know, people have access to him when he says what he thinks, and he just lets it rip, but much of what he says either doesn't make sense or it's not true. She actually was perfectly reasonable,"" Ruhle said.

""And listen, there's some things she's not giving a direct answer on because she's a politician,"" she continued. ""But I agree with you that getting a chance to speak to her, getting the American people to hear from her more. What do you do with the fact, if you're her campaign, when people hear over and over, 'I don't really know what her policies are,' and they can say, 'Well, look, we have this book, and it has 82 pages.' I guarantee there are people who watched tonight who went, 'Oh, taxes only increased if you can make over $400,000?' because there's all sorts of people like 'Well, my tax cuts are gonna run out. Maybe my taxes are gonna go up next year.' They're not really reading the 82-page plan.""

Ruhle added, ""I mean, she's a great interview! I sat down with her for 25 minutes. You might not have liked all of her answers, but she had one for every single question.""

While Ruhle seemed to suggest that voters learned something new from her interview about Harris' economic policies by citing her intention to raise taxes for anyone making more than $400,000, President Biden touted that same policy proposal as a candidate in 2020, something Harris embraced as the 2024 nominee back in July."
This Week In Credit Card News: Justice Department Sues Visa For Illegal Debit Card Monopoly,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billhardekopf/2024/09/26/this-week-in-credit-card-news-justice-department-sues-visa-for-illegal-debit-card-monopoly/,2024-09-26T16:07:16Z,"U.S. Justice Department Accuses Visa of Illegal Monopoly that Adds to the Price of 'Nearly Everything'

The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit Tuesday accusing Visa of illegally monopolizing the debit card market. For more than a decade, the department alleges, Visa has abused its dominant position in the debit card market to force businesses to use Visa's network instead of competitors', and to stop new alternatives from entering the market. According to the new complaint against Visa, more than 60% of debit transactions in the country take place on Visa's debit network. Visa, in turn, is able to charge more than $7 billion in processing fees on those transactions, the department says. To keep that control, Visa imposes exclusivity agreements that penalize vendors and banks who want to run transactions through different systems, effectively insulating the company from competition.

American Airlines in Talks to Pick Citigroup over Rival Bank Barclays for Crucial Credit Card Deal

American Airlines is in talks to make Citigroup its exclusive credit card partner, dropping rival issuer Barclays from a partnership that dates back to the airline's 2013 takeover of US Airways, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations. American has been working with banks and card networks on a new long-term deal for months, hoping to consolidate its business with a single player to boost the revenue haul from its cards. Airlines make billions from their loyalty programs and co-brand credit card deals. [CNBC]

Klarna Partners with Fellow Fintech Adyen to Bring Buy Now, Pay Later into Physical Stores

Swedish firm Klarna is partnering up with Dutch payments fintech Adyen to bring its popular buy now, pay later service into physical retail stores. The company said it had entered into an agreement with Adyen to add its payments products as an option at physical payment machines used by the Amsterdam-based fintech's merchant partners. Klarna will be included as an option across more than 450,000 Adyen payment terminals in brick-and-mortar locations as a result of the deal, according to the companies. The partnership will initially launch in Europe, North America and Australia with a wider rollout planned later down the line. [CNBC]

Some Credit Card Companies Are Charging for Paper Statements

If you get a paper statement for your credit cards, you might want to check if you are being charged for it. Some credit card companies are now charging a fee to send paper statements in the mail. One consumer noticed she was getting charged $1.99 for the paper statement for her American Eagle credit card. The fee for paper statements is written in Synchrony Bank's fine print, which provides credit cards to retailers like American Eagle. There is no federal law banning paper statement fees, but states can pass their own laws banning it. So far, only New York and Pennsylvania have banned the fees. [Gray News]

JP Morgan Plots New UK Credit Card in Challenge to Barclaycard

America's biggest bank JP Morgan is plotting a new credit card for UK consumers in a looming challenge to Barclaycard. The lending giant is doing internal tests on a new credit card, which it has been planning for more than a year as part of its strategy to ramp up business in the UK. It will be the latest expansion for the bank's UK retail arm Chase, which JP Morgan launched three years ago and has rapidly become one of the biggest digital banks in the country. [The Telegraph]

A potential sign that consumers might be feeling strapped as they move toward the holidays: Shoppers are expected to spend a record $18.5 billion through buy now, pay later financing this year, according to Adobe's new forecast. That's up more than 11% year over year. Shoppers are now seeing buy now, pay later everywhere, especially online. Around three-quarters of this spending happens on a mobile device. It's also used more when peoples' wallets are strained. [Marketplace]

Canceling Subscriptions Will Be a 'One-Click' Snap in California Under New Law

A growing number of products and services are being sold by online subscription, offering more convenience and customization but also a new set of problems for consumers. Companies have been accused of signing people up for subscriptions without their consent, renewing their subscriptions without notice, and imposing a gantlet of obstacles to anyone seeking to unsubscribe. Californians will soon be getting more protection against these sorts of abuses, however, including the right to unsubscribe with one click of the mouse. On Tuesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 2863, which imposes a series of safeguards. [Los Angeles Times]

Mastercard Enters 'New Frontier' in Sensory Marketing: A Haptic Logo

From sonic branding to perfumes and restaurants in New York and São Paulo, Mastercard has leveraged almost every sense to engage and assure customers. Now, it's turning to touch. The brand is debuting a haptic logo, a distinctive series of vibrations that customers will ""feel"" via their phone when shopping online or using a payment terminal. The Mastercard chief marketing officer said the haptic logo is designed to increase trust, security, and satisfaction among shoppers. It is meant to reinforce the brand in that uncertain moment when a transaction is pending at checkout. [Adweek]

What Would A JPMorgan Apple Card Takeover Mean for The Banking-Fintech World?

JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to acquire the Apple Card credit card program from Goldman Sachs, a potential move that could reshape key dynamics in the banking sector, particularly for corporate treasury departments eyeing partnerships and operational efficiencies in an increasingly digital financial ecosystem. The deal highlights how partnerships between large financial institutions and tech giants are not only shaping consumer finance but are also impacting back-office processes and the operational models of large financial organizations. JPMorgan's potential acquisition of the Apple Card portfolio would further entrench the bank as a dominant player in the digital payments ecosystem, a space corporate treasurers increasingly rely on to optimize their cash management strategies and improve liquidity solutions.

Moms Nationwide Are Leaving Gift Cards in Diaper Boxes. Here's Why.

Moms across the country are anonymously buying gift cards or leaving cash in baby items at Target and Walmart stores because Denaesha Gonzalez saw a misplaced purse. The Nashville mom was with her 2-year-old son in her local Target this month when she noticed a familiar sight: a silver clutch handbag that retails for $20 misplaced on the shelf of the baby aisle. To the 28-year-old, this meant something deeper: A mom with a young child sacrificed something she wanted to buy something for her baby. She posted a 17-second video with the text: SHE DESERVED THE PURSE with the sound of a woman exhaling, in the hopes that maybe it would resonate with other mothers. Her video has since gone viral with more than 20 million views. It also has inspired people to hide money in diaper boxes and formula containers to allow a mom who is struggling to buy something for herself. [The Washington Post]

Will Finances Get In The Way Of Tech Companies' Optimism?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/09/26/will-finances-get-in-the-way-of-tech-companies-optimism/,2024-09-26T16:07:11Z,"With so much going on in tech, 82% of executives are optimistic about the future, a recent study from digital insurance company Embroker found. But there's one minor catch: They're not exactly comfortable with their finances.

The study, which looked at the tech industry as a whole, found that nearly six in 10 companies were struggling with the rising cost of doing business. Only 20% of companies are putting a priority on fundraising this year, and just under half of that group say they're optimistic about new funding or investment opportunities. Funding problems have caused many staff cuts this year across the industry. According to Layoffs.fyi, 445 tech companies have laid off 137,460 employees so far this year -- though the Embroker study found 39% of companies said they are prioritizing hiring and retention this year.

So why the optimism? Embroker conducted its study in May, long before last week's interest rate cuts and prior to the summer's supercharged AI stock run. About half of the optimistic respondents said their feelings came from each of these three areas: Promising financial performance in the first half of 2024, potential market growth and new product offerings. Basically, in spite of the recent past's pitfalls, there's more growth ahead.

The question is whether that optimism will turn into actual success. Top tech stocks have wobbled as of late, and it seems many investors are wanting to see results. After all, Nvidia stock saw a huge sell off late last month after it reported less-than-desired projections for the rest of the year -- forget about its record-breaking revenues. Apple's stock has slumped as some analysts try to figure out early iPhone 16 sales with incomplete data. Optimism isn't enough for investors anymore, and tech companies might not be able to do what they are planning if the lack of funds continues.

As companies move tech to the center of their plans, some are tying the traditionally siloed CIO role to broader leadership goals. New homebuilder Tri Pointe Homes solidified this connection this summer as it announced its new executive vice president and CIO -- Linda Mamet and Urmila Menon -- as well as a new structure in which the CIO reports directly to the EVP. I talked to both of them about it, and an excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Google is increasing its security game in a big way, with new protections for all business users. Forbes senior contributor Davey Winder writes the tech giant is adding enterprise-grade security to all business Gmail accounts, no matter their size. It will provide users with a security advisor tool that delivers reports on evolving threats and actionable guidance, based on what enterprise users are receiving, as well as a security sandbox that scans all email attachments for malicious software. Gmail will also scan the body of all emails with an AI-powered model that will search for bad content. Google says this upgrade is able to review 1,000 times more user-reported spam each day. The upgraded security advisor also enhances safe browsing mode on Chrome, providing advance warning of potentially dangerous sites and downloads; data protection to block or warn users against sharing sensitive information; and app access protections for admins, giving them the ability to block Google Workplace Apps from unsafe devices.

Google is also taking a page from Twitter and adding blue checkmarks for Gmail users on iOS and Android, its indicator for sender identification, or BIMI, Winder writes. Google first adopted blue checkmark verification for users who met a rigorous set of brand and domain requirements in May 2023. With this announcement, the verification is visible to more users, and the blue checkmarks will now be seen on most mobile Gmail platforms.

Smartsheet plans to go private through a $8.4 billion acquisition by Blackstone and Vista Equity Partners, reports Forbes' Brandon Kochkodin. Stockholders in the cloud-based enterprise work management platform will receive $56.50 a share, a 41% premium to the company's average closing price during the last three months. Vista specializes in enterprise software acquisitions, with a current portfolio that includes Arcos, Cvent, Infoblox, Jamf and Vividseats. According to a statement on the deal, Blackstone and Vista are hoping to accelerate Smartsheet's growth and new solutions. The merger agreement includes a 45-day period in which Smartsheet and its advisors can actively solicit alternative acquisition proposals.

Intel is all over the news this month for a variety of reasons. Its stock is surging. It's a takeover target. It's launching new processors ready for AI. It's putting out urgent updates for chips that are susceptible to permanent damage. It is turning its foundry business, which manufactures chips, into an independent business unit that may be spun off. It's a lot for a company that has been a quieter -- but still important -- player in the hardware sector for years.

Intel has been trying to turn around its business, which has slowed as Nvidia and AMD have pulled ahead with their AI-ready processors. It's the second worst-performing stock on the S&P 500 this year, with its worst market day ever in August, following the announced layoff of about 15,000 employees -- roughly 15% of its global workforce. The company announced turnaround plans earlier this month, but started to rally as reports surfaced that Qualcomm was eyeing an acquisition. These reports haven't been corroborated by the companies, but analysts say any potential deal would face stiff regulatory scrutiny.

In June, homebuilder Tri Pointe Homes announced 10-year company veteran Linda Mamet as its new executive vice president and newly hired Urmila Menon as its CIO. But not only were the hires announced at the same time, but the company also linked the two positions, with Menon directly reporting to Mamet. I talked to both of them about what the structure means for the homebuilder. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

How is this digital partnership between the EVP and CIO different from what was done before, and why is Tri Pointe Homes doing it?

Mamet: It was a different phase of our growth and development. There was work in collaboration across all of our functions with IT and technology to get onto consistent leading platforms. Our leadership and all of our team members at Tri Pointe are very supportive of innovation.

Two-thirds of Tri Pointe Homes customers are Millennials, and about 10% of our customers are Generation Z. These are customers who are digital natives, they are very technology savvy, they have good incomes, they're doing well in their careers, and they have high expectations of what the experience could be like when you are purchasing something as transformative as a new home, a new community.

Our internal team is also very adept with technology. We did a survey of 70 of our middle managers recently asking them about their perceptions of AI, and it was very positive. They see many opportunities for AI to help them be more effective in their job roles and free them up to do what they are most talented and capable of doing.

Menon: With emerging technology centers, generative AI and robotic process automation, I really see AI playing a significant role in optimizing our operations and truly enhancing our customer experiences. On the customer side, we do plan to use AI for personalized home recommendations and post-service automation as well.

The real estate industry in general has been somewhat challenged recently because of the economy. What do you plan to do with technology to make Tri Pointe Homes' offerings stand out?

Mamet: Homebuilders have the distinct advantage and ability to buy down mortgage interest rates to make new homes much more attainable for new home buyers. We also have a lot of other competitive advantages around home design and features that aren't available in older homes. We expect our focus on customer-driven technology at Tri Pointe to create value throughout market cycles. We will be leveraging our digital platforms to educate prospective buyers more on home choices, financing options, sustainable living features, and things that make owning a Tri Pointe home more appealing.

Menon: From the data side, we'll also be focusing on using our data to provide more personalized experience, product offerings and data-driven decisions. The way we see it is, no matter where the mortgage rates may stabilize in the future, Tri Pointe will be positioned to capitalize on pent-up demand through targeted marketing, customer engagement strategies and operational efficiencies.

In connecting your roles, Tri Pointe Homes has done something that is unique right now. Do you see other companies adopting the same sort of structure in the future?

Menon: I believe more companies will see the value in linking these roles, and truly, as technology becomes more central to business strategy, having an integrated leadership structure really allows for more cohesive decision-making and faster execution of innovative ideas.

Mamet: In the past, IT in home building might have been a more siloed support function, and today it's integral to all aspects of our business. The type of organizational structure that we have in place, with Urmila and I working together in our roles, ensures that our technology investments are really aligned with the company's broader business goals. That leads us to greater efficiencies, better customer and team member experience, and ultimately stronger financial performance for the company. We both think that this is a natural evolution of technology and business that will help Tri Pointe and other companies to continue to grow.

CNN host Kasie Hunt says Harris is 'Republican' and Trump is 'liberal' on their economic policies,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-host-kasie-hunt-says-harris-republican-trump-liberal-economic-policies,2024-09-26T15:39:40Z,"CNN host Kasie Hunt suggested on Thursday that Kamala Harris had ""Republican"" economic policies and Donald Trump had ""liberal"" ones.

CNN host Kasie Hunt argued on Thursday that Vice President Kamala Harris' policies on the economy appeared ""Republican"" and that former President Trump's seemed ""liberal.""

Wall Street Journal reporter Annie Linskey began the ""CNN This Morning"" panel discussion by saying that both Trump and Harris were focusing on investing in manufacturing and industrial policy.

""What Annie just said is in fact correct, but it does in fact sound like Harris is the Republican in this scenario and Donald Trump is the liberal in terms of the nature of the policies,"" Hunt said in response.

Harris delivered a policy speech at The Economic Club of Pittsburgh on Wednesday and Harris emphasized her ""middle-class upbringing."" She said she wanted to ""build a strong middle-class,"" with proposals she's rolled out in recent weeks like increasing the tax break for new small businesses and giving a $25,000 credit to first-time homebuyers.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTIONS ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

Hunt pointed to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who took aim at Trump's tariff proposals after Trump said on Tuesday during a rally in Pennsylvania that he would put a 200% tariff on John Deere if they move production of skid steer loaders and compact track loaders to an existing facility in Mexico.

Trump has called for steeper tariffs on China and other countries and has said he wants to slash the corporate tax rate on companies that produce their products in the U.S.

""The one thing when we talk about tariffs, we have to remember, he's talking about free and fair trade, reciprocal trade,"" The America First Policy Institute's Marc Lotter told the CNN panel on Thursday. ""He will talk about tariffs if a country is not treating us fairly.""

Harris spoke about lowering costs, investing in American innovation and entrepreneurship, and leading global competitors in the industries of the future during her speech in Pennsylvania.

""I think that the challenge in what he's talking about is, you know, tariffs can work if it's very strategic, he's not talking about them in a very strategic way. It's much more of a like, 'What audience am I talking to? Okay, you get something, you get something,' and think about if you think about 200% tariff on John Deere, that's a tax on farmers, people who really cannot handle more taxes. He talked about tariffs in a way that doesn't actually clarify that the companies pay the tariff, which means they pass on the cost to us,"" liberal CNN commentator Karen Finney said.

During Harris' speech on Wednesday, the vice president said that during Trump's four years in the White House, ""[M]anufacturing jobs went down across our country and across our economy. All told, almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during his presidency, starting before the pandemic hit, making Trump one of the biggest losers ever on manufacturing.""

Solana And Ethereum: How These Cryptocurrencies Stack Up In 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/amorsexton/2024/09/26/solana-and-ethereum-how-these-cryptocurrencies-stack-up-in-2024/,2024-09-26T15:35:23Z,"In 2008, Bitcoin was introduced as the world's first provably secure peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. Ethereum, announced in 2014, built on Bitcoin's vision by allowing developers to create their own decentralized applications on a blockchain. Solana, conceived in 2017, was built to address Web3's scalability challenges, enabling high throughput and low-latency transaction processing at scale.

Both Etheruem and Solana have been built to solve problems faced by the previous generation of blockchain technology. Both have also gone from zero to one in bringing new infrastructure to market, unlocking novel use cases, and driving adoption across Main Street and Wall Street alike. But how does one protocol compare to the other in 2024?

Today, let's look at how Ethereum and Solana stack up across three categories: institutional adoption, scalability, and liquidity.

Institutional Adoption

In 2024, institutional adoption has been driven in part by newly introduced crypto exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S, providing a regulated and accessible way for investors to add digital assets to their portfolios.

Most recently, Ethereum ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024, with funds from major institutions such as Blackrock and Grayscale. This followed the successful launch of eleven Bitcoin ETFs in January, after approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). By August, BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust was the first to surpass $1 billion in net inflows.

The debut of both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has paved the way for a potential Solana ETF. Solana ETFs are not currently listed in the U.S., although they are available in some international markets. There are, however, applications under review by the SEC, with VanEck being the first American company to file for a U.S. Solana ETF, and 21Shares also submitting an application. It has been reported that the SEC rejected the 19b-4 filings submitted by Cboe BZX on behalf of the two institutions, raising a question around the deadline for an ultimate decision on a Solana ETF.

Staking is notably excluded from Ethereum ETFs, leading some to believe a Solana ETF would follow suit, Solana also being a Proof of Stake blockchain. If so, this would indirectly transfer value to those who stake both SOL and ETH through each respective protocol's inflation rate, meaning those who self-stake or choose to stake with a third party would receive more value from their staking.

Scalability

Both Ethereum and Solana pursue a vastly different, yet equally ambitious, scalability roadmap.

Today, the Ethereum network faces throughput limits, with transactions ranging from 15-30 per second (TPS). These transactions are bundled into blocks, which are then processed by validators. Ethereum scalability relies on a strong Layer 2 (L2) ecosystem, a roadmap it has pursued since 2020. In March 2024, Ethereum's Dencun upgrade was launched, introducing proto danksharding and dramatically reducing fees for L2s. These L2s, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, are separate blockchains, fully compatible with Ethereum, that take transaction load off the main network. L2 solutions have grown in popularity due to their high speeds and low fees, with institutions, such as Kraken, Sony, and Coinbase, as notable examples looking towards L2s for a number of use cases.

Solana is faster than Ethereum, with a theoretical max of 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), and it aims to be even quicker. Yet historically, Solana's mainnet has had to overcome some uptime challenges. Firedancer, a Solana validator client built by Jump Trading, aims to deliver up to a theoretical TPS that is orders of magnitude higher, while improving reliability. Built from the ground up, Firedancer uses a concurrency model, borrowed from the low latency trading space, with high performance implementations of Solana's core primitives. Firedancer's testnet, Frankendancer, is a combination of Agave, developed by Solana Labs, and Firedancer. At this year's Solana Breakpoint, Frankendancer was announced as live on mainnet, with Firedancer live on testnet.

Liquidity

Liquidity is important for an efficient Web3 economy, as it determines how quickly assets can be traded without impacting price. Trading volumes on Solana have historically been much lower than Ethereum, by a factor of 2 or more. However the speed and low-fee properties of Solana has led to a recent catch up, when Solana trading volumes briefly surpassed Ethereum (July and August 2024). Both ecosystems see real-world use cases and tokenization, particularly with stablecoins which are prime trading assets, has strong drivers for increased liquidity.

Staking also impacts the levels of liquidity in both Ethereum and Solana, as both ETH and SOL require tokens to be locked in order to stake. Today, only 28% of the overall supply of ETH is staked, yet liquid staking has claimed the top spot in Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem. Liquid staking provides stakers with a Liquid Staking Token (LST) of their assets, one which is available to hold, trade, or participate in DeFi. The availability of liquid staking solutions is key to Ethereum's economy: without a centralized marketplace, buyers and sellers must provide liquidity in pools to allow for assets to be bought, sold, and swapped across DEXes and DeFi platforms. Liquid staking providers, such as Liquid Collective, allow greater capital efficiency for stakers wishing to receive rewards, while also giving them the liquidity to participate in Ethereum DeFi.

While Ethereum holds a lead in terms of deeper liquidity, institutional trust, and a thriving L2 ecosystem, Solana's momentum as a high-performance L1 is clear. Ethereum is building an increasingly modular stack, while Solana believes in the highly optimized, monolithic structure.

The institutional confidence in ETH as an asset is highlighted by the recent introduction of ETFs, and initiatives such as the recently introduced Node Operator Risk Standard (NORS) certification establishes an objective benchmark of excellence for professional Ethereum node operators.

But Solana's achievements, and future potential, cannot be understated. Solana is actively scaling its mainnet infrastructure, creating a superhighway for future growth without fragmenting liquidity across L2s. Furthermore, Solana's institutional interest has been signaled by a number of major players, including Franklin Templeton.

While Ethereum's advantage as a first mover is evident, both networks will play important roles in shaping the future of finance in both 2024 and beyond."
Who Will Replace Hoda Kotb At 'Today?' Here Are Five Possibilities.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonifitzgerald/2024/09/26/who-will-replace-hoda-kotb-at-today-here-are-five-possibilities/,2024-09-26T15:23:33Z,"After six years as co-anchor of Today, NBC's signature morning program, Hoda Kotb is stepping down to focus on her family. She announced the decision Thursday morning, and instantly social media erupted with speculation over who would replace her.

Kotb and Guthrie were the show's first all-female anchor team. Kotb got her start at NBC as a correspondent with Dateline, transitioning to co-hosting the final hour of Today with Katie Lee Gifford, injecting the program with heart and humor.

Finding the right replacement for Kotb, who said she wanted to be home with the two young girls she adopted in recent years, is critical to NBC. Today has been on top of rival Good Morning America on ABC among the key demographic of adults 25-54, and the network doesn't want to lose that lucrative spot.

NBC News has not commented on who could replace Kotb, the daughter of Egyptian immigrants. Here are five possible choices.

Hager seems like the obvious choice. She already hosts the final hour of Today with Kotb, with whom she shares an easy chemistry. Young women love Hager's relatability as a young mother, and she's a popular social media presence. She lacks hard news chops that are often necessary on morning shows -- Kotb had a rare ability to toggle between chugging wine with Gifford and discussing the economy -- but Savannah Guthrie is very strong on hard news, so it may not be an issue.

Jarrett checks all the boxes. Whip-smart and already a member of the Saturday Today crew, Jarrett is NBC's senior legal correspondent as well. She would bring gravitas to the co-host slot, and she and Guthrie would offer a formidable hard news presence. Her frequent posts about her adorable children on Instagram also make her relatable to Today's viewers. The Harvard Law School graduate, who covered Donald Trump's hush money trial earlier this year, got her start at CNN.

Like Hager, Geist is already a member of the Today team, hosting the Sunday edition. He also co-anchors MSNBC's Morning Joe and appears as the fill-in news anchor on weekday Today. He has an easy chemistry with the crew already. But NBC may want to preserve the female-female partnership that pushed it ahead of GMA in the ratings. And Geist's Morning Joe ties could make him too ""political"" (regardless of whether that's true) in a divided time when morning hosts need to appeal to all stripes.

Daly seems a less-likely choice, but he is already a part of Today, and the network has shown in the past that it likes to promote from within for this role. As a former MTV personality, Daly has the pop culture knowledge and contacts that are important to a morning news show. But like Hager, he hasn't shown particular prowess with hard news, and that will likely impact the network's decision.

Jones co-hosts the third hour of Today, and she has become an audience favorite.

Maryland Senate race: Democrat Alsobrooks leads Republican Hogan in closely watched contest,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/maryland-senate-race-democrat-alsobrooks-leads-republican-hogan-closely-watched-contest,2024-09-26T14:59:46Z,"Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan highlights how it's important people remain focused on the issues and not alienate swing voters, on 'Your World.'

The Democratic candidate for senate in Maryland has pulled significantly ahead of her Republican rival, according to a recent poll.

The Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released Thursday shows Democrat Angela Alsobrooks holding an 11% lead over her rival, Republican Larry Hogan.

Alsobrooks is leading Hogan 51% to 40%, according to the Washington Post-University of Maryland poll.

The gap between them among likely voters is surprising, given that both candidates enjoy a similar level of popularity with respondents.

Approximately 53% of respondents expressed favorable impressions of Hogan, compared to 27% who reported an unfavorable impression. Respondents gave Alsobrooks a 50% favorability rating, compared to 22% unfavorability.

Registered voters in the poll ranked the economy as the most important issue of the November elections, followed by immigration and then abortion.

The Washington Post-University of Maryland poll was conducted between Sept. 19 and Sept. 23 with a sample size of 1,012 registered voters.

It has a reported margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

With Democrats outnumbering Republicans by a roughly two-to-one margin in the state, Hogan will need a good chunk of cross-over voters to have a chance and has been highlighting his opposition to Trump and his independence from his party as he runs for the Senate.

Hogan, who flirted with a 2024 White House run before deciding against it, stood out from most other Republicans this spring for publicly calling for the guilty verdicts in Trump's criminal trial to be respected.

Hogan skipped July's Republican National Convention, where Trump was formally nominated, and has said he would not be voting for the former president. Hogan's campaign, after the former president's comments, spotlighted in a statement that ""Governor Hogan has been clear he is not supporting President Trump just as he didn't in 2016 and 2020.""

Republicans are also aiming to flip seats in Ohio and Montana, two states Trump comfortably carried four years ago. And five more Democratic-held seats up for grabs this year are in crucial presidential-election battleground states.

Warren Buffett Has It Right - Time In The Market Trumps Market Timing,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbuckingham/2024/09/26/warren-buffett-has-it-righttime-in-the-market-trumps-market-timing/,2024-09-26T14:46:45Z,"Warren Buffett famously once said, ""The stock market is a mechanism for transferring wealth from the impatient to the patient."" Countless examples throughout equity market history support this sentiment, most recently demonstrated by the rally following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut the target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5.0%.

The equity markets cheered the news, with major indices hitting all-time highs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's upbeat tone at the press conference, combined with better-than-expected economic data, painted a promising picture for the future. Retail sales in August rose by 0.1% -- a small but significant improvement over expectations -- and industrial production surged by 0.8%, far exceeding the 0.2% forecast. Housing starts also topped projections, adding to the sense of economic resilience. These numbers highlight an economy that continues to grow, even amid concerns over inflation and rising interest rates.

Just two weeks ago, the financial media was rife with fear over what the Fed would do next, and investors were bracing for the worst. Yet here we are, only a short time later, with markets rising and fears ostensibly subsiding.

As I am fond of saying, the secret to successful investing in stocks is to not be scared out of them. It is tempting to react impulsively to short-term market swings, but history shows that those who remain steadfast in their investment strategy are often rewarded. Rather than being swayed by daily volatility or media-driven fear, successful investors stay the course. By focusing on long-term growth and the power of compounding, they position themselves to weather downturns and capitalize on the inevitable recoveries that follow.

Indeed, through the Miracle of Compounding, great fortunes can accrue even with relatively modest returns. For example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average would eclipse 100,000 in less than 16 years simply by showing 5.8% per annum price appreciation, which has been the historical rate of return for the popular benchmark. As the table below shows, the Dow would make it to six figures in just eight years if it was a total return and not a price index, and if it enjoyed the 13.2% total return that has been the average for Value stocks since 1927.

The historical evidence is clear: stocks, particularly value stocks, have delivered strong returns over time, regardless of interest rate movements. Even as the 10-year Treasury yield rose from 3.65% to 3.74% last week, equities pushed higher. Investors who stick to their strategies, avoid panic selling and let their investments grow through the power of compounding will likely be the ones to benefit most from the market's long-term upward trajectory.

Whether it's an upcoming Federal Reserve decision or pending Presidential/Congressional election, it is crucial to keep the Oracle of Omaha's words in mind. Wealth is built not by reacting to every twist and turn, but by staying invested through thick and thin. Patience remains one of, if not the greatest, allies of the equity investor, ensuring that time in the market transfers wealth from those who chase short-term gains to those who play the long game."
Chinese Stocks Book $70 Billion US Rally As Beijing Brandishes 'Big Guns' Stimulus,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/26/chinese-stocks-book-70-billion-us-rally-as-beijing-brandishes-big-guns-stimulus/,2024-09-26T14:46:03Z,"Chinese stocks surged Thursday as investors responded favorably to Beijing's commitment to jolt its economy, with New York-listed shares of the firms adding hundreds of billions of dollars, helping boost American stocks as well.

This week is on pace to be the best week for the CSI 300, which is up 10.8%, since Dec. 2014, and for the Hang Seng, which is up 9.1%, since Oct. 2011. The ""compelling"" backdrop for a ""tactical recovery"" came as new money flowed in following the weakest hedge fund allocation to Chinese stocks in a decade, noted Goldman Sachs analyst Kinger Lau in a Wednesday note to clients.

""This could be a game changer"" for Chinese stocks, Solita Marcelli, UBS Global Wealth Management's chief investor officer, Americas, wrote to clients Thursday, though she noted risks from aggressive U.S. tariffs should former President Donald Trump win the presidency in November.

The 20 largest Chinese stocks used in the market value calculations are according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission's Jan. 2024 compilation. Despite this week's explosive rally, Chinese stocks are mired in an extended slump as the country's economy struggles to return to its pre-pandemic expansion rate. The CSI 300 has provided a 6% return to investors year-to-date and a -21% return over the last three years, far underperforming the S&P's 21% year-to-date and 35% three-year returns. U.S. trading of Chinese stocks involves the exchange of American depositary receipts, which entitle investors to equity in Chinese firms without direct ownership.

European luxury stocks, which were badly battered by diminished demand in China, soared Thursday as the market adjusted to optimism about a Chinese recovery. Shares of French firms LVMH, Hermès and Dior rose 9% apiece in Paris trading."
Super Micro's 10-For-1 Split Can Drive The Stock Higher,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/26/super-micros-10-for-1-split-can-drive-the-stock-higher/,2024-09-26T13:10:39Z,"Super Micro Computer stock (NASDAQ: SMCI) has experienced considerable volatility this year, although a potential boost may be on the horizon with the company's upcoming 10-for-1 stock split. SMCI stock rose nearly eightfold over the past two years -- from about $60 per share in September 2022 to levels of about $460 today, led by strong demand for servers from AI data centers. However, the stock saw a meaningful pullback earlier this year amid concerns over gross margins, supply chain issues, and a delayed 10-K filing following short-seller Hindenburg Research's accusations of accounting irregularities. Now as the stock prepares for split-adjusted trading starting from October 1, there could be renewed interest in Super Micro shares.

SMCI stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 39% in 2021, 87% in 2022, and 246% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So how will the upcoming split impact SMCI stock?

While splits don't alter the fundamental outlook for a company, they often trigger a run-up in stock prices post-announcement. We saw this during Nvidia's recent split and Tesla's first stock split in 2020. Additionally, stocks tend to outperform post-split for two reasons: they enhance accessibility for smaller investors, driving up demand and trading volumes. In Super Micro's case, the price of an individual share of stock would fall to a level of about $46 from $460 currently, and this could be a more palatable sum for smaller retail investors. Moreover, splits signal that management is confident about the company's prospects, indicating that growth may remain strong. There is ample reason for optimism in SMCI stock. Can Super Micro stock fare better than AI bellwether Nvidia?

SMCI is projected to grow its revenue by close to 90% in FY'25 (the current fiscal year) to levels of about $28 billion, per consensus estimates, as data center-related spending remains strong, with tech companies boosting their AI and accelerated computing capacity. AI models are increasingly multimodal, moving from just text processing to working with speech, images, video, and 3D calling for higher computing power and consequently higher demand for servers and computing capacity. Although the server market is commoditized, Super Micro does have some competitive advantages, given that its products are seen as being more customizable and more energy efficient than rivals. Super Micro's customers are also likely to opt for more premium products. For example, the company estimates that costly liquid-cooling systems for servers, which were relatively rare in the pre-AI era, will be installed in 30% of server racks it ships next year. The company is also steadily boosting its production capacity. For example, it is getting ready to roll out a new facility in Malaysia that can produce over 5,000 racks of server kits every month. Although the company has seen its gross margins face some pressure in recent quarters as it sells a higher mix of liquid-cooling systems, which are proving expensive to produce, things could pick up as it eventually builds out a more efficient supply chain for its servers.

Super Micro stock trades at just about 21x trailing earnings and 13.5x forward earnings at the current price level. Is this a reasonable multiple? We believe it is. While we note that the ongoing compliance-related matters present an overhang over the stock, there is potential for the stock to rise over 2x to $1,000. On the other hand, we present a counter case that outlines how Super Micro stock could decline to levels of about $200 per share.

"Hong Kong debuts 2 giant pandas from Beijing, raising hopes for tourism boost",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hong-kong-debuts-giant-pandas-beijing-raising-hopes-tourism-boost,2024-09-26T13:02:53Z,"With the arrival of the new pandas, Hong Kong now houses six pandas, including the twins and their father, Le Le.

Hong Kong welcomed a new pair of giant pandas gifted by Beijing on Thursday with a lavish ceremony, raising hopes for a boost to the city's tourism.

An An and Ke Ke are the third pair of giant pandas to be sent to the city from mainland China since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Their arrival came after their new neighbor, Ying Ying, gave birth to twins last month and became the world's oldest first-time panda mother on record.

With the addition of the new bears, the twins, and their father, Le Le, Hong Kong now houses six pandas.

GIANT PANDA CELEBRATES HER 20TH BIRTHDAY IN TAIWAN: 'FUNNY AND CUTE'

Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said An An is a 5-year-old male panda who is agile, intelligent and active, while Ke Ke, a 5-year-old female, is good at climbing, cute and has a gentle temperament.

The new arrivals will undergo two months of quarantine and adapt to their new home at Ocean Park, a zoo and aquarium that has long been a favorite of residents and tourists. Lee expressed hope that the public could meet the new bears in mid-December.

In October, the government will invite residents to propose new names that showcase the pandas' characteristics.

Tourism industry representatives are optimistic about the potential impact of housing six pandas, hoping it will boost visitor numbers in Hong Kong. Officials have encouraged businesses to capitalize on the popularity of the new bears and newborn cubs to seize opportunities in what some lawmakers have dubbed the ""panda economy.""

Pandas are widely considered China's unofficial national mascot. The country's giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing's soft-power diplomacy. Giant pandas are only found in China's southwest and their population is under threat from development.

But caring for pandas in captivity is expensive. A zoo in Finland agreed with Chinese authorities to return two loaned giant pandas to China more than eight years ahead of schedule because they were too costly for the facility to maintain amid declining visitors.

Hong Kong's Ocean Park has been hosting pandas since 1999, when the first pair, An An and Jia Jia, arrived in the financial hub shortly after it was handed back to China.

Jia Jia, who died at 38 in 2016, is the world's oldest-ever panda to have lived in captivity. The average lifespan for a panda in the wild is 18 to 20 years, while in captivity it's 30 years, according to the Guinness World Records."
How Universal's 'Wicked' Can Improve Retail Sales This Holiday Season,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2024/09/26/how-universals-wicked-can-improve-retail-sales-this-holiday-season/,2024-09-26T12:35:00Z,"Universal Pictures' Wicked musical release, starring Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba, is set to hit theaters on Wednesday, November 27, the day before Thanksgiving.

In advance, Universal has amassed an all-star lineup of retailers and brands, counting on the two witches from Oz to wave their magic wands and generate excitement in a consumer market that has been spooked by ""bad juju.""

Collaborations will cover apparel, accessories, footwear, home decor, beauty toys, role play, publishing, collectibles and more. Aldo, Ariana Grande's r.e.m. Beauty, Beekman 1802, Build-A-Bear, Bombas, Bloomingdale's, Crocs, Fisher-Price, Forever 21, H&M, Hallmark, Hasbro, Hot Topic, Kohl's, Rebecca Minkoff, Target, Vera Bradley, Walmart and many more are on the Wicked train.

Ulta Beauty just announced its Wicked multibrand lineup will hit stores October 6, explaining in a statement, ""The Wicked-themed collection defines beauty norms, empowering beauty enthusiasts to embrace their truest selves."" Ulta needs some good magic this holiday season as comparable sales declined 1.2% in its most recent quarter.

And it's not just Ulta that needs a lift. Consumers are spooked by the economy, and retailers hope good witch Glinda will cast a spell to get them to come out and spend in the critical holiday season ahead.

The Conference Board just announced that in September the Consumer Confidence Index fell by seven points, the largest drop in the last three years. And its Present Situation Index was off over ten points based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions.

""The deterioration across the Index's main components likely reflected consumer's concerns about the labor market and reactions to fewer hours, slower payroll increases, fewer job openings -- even if the labor market remains quite healthy, with low unemployment, few layoffs and elevated wages,"" The Conference Board's chief economist Dana M. Peterson said in a statement.

The fact that the Bureau of Labor Statistics just revised its previous 12-month job number down by 818,000 didn't help people's confidence in the job market.

The National Retail Federation (NRF) just released its Halloween spending forecast and predicts it will come in about 5% less than last year's, down from $12.2 billion to $11.6 billion this year.

""Halloween marks the official transition to the fall season for many Americans,"" NRF Vice President of Industry and Consumer Insights Katherine Cullen said in a statement.

As such, Halloween, along with back-to-school (BTS) shopping, are guides to how the coming holiday retail season will turn out. And BTS doesn't look promising either.

Back-to-school forecasts were off 5%, dropping from $41 billion in 2023 to $39 billion this year. Back-to-college spending was off even more, down 7% from $94 billion last year to $87 billion this year, according to the NRF.

In the NRF's September economic outlook, released before The Conference Board's report, it tried to put a positive spin on where the economy stands. ""The U.S. economy is clearly not in a recession nor is it likely to head into a recession in the home stretch of 2024. Instead, it appears that the economy is on the cusp of nailing a long-awaited soft landing with a simultaneous cooling of growth and inflation.""

Yet, The Conference Board's Expectations Index stands at 81.7 points, within striking distance of hitting 80 points, which typically signals a recession ahead.

""The proportion of consumers anticipating a recession over the next 12 months remained low but there was a slight uptick in the percentage of consumers believing the economy was already in recession,"" Peterson said.

While the Census Department's Monthly Retail Trade Survey shows retail, excluding motor vehicles and gasoline stations, has increased 3.7% through August, if you take food services out, retail sales have only advanced 1.5%, from $3.28 trillion to $3.33 trillion. These three categories are excluded from NRF's core retail tracking.

Nonstore retailers, the core retail sector's largest category, has grown 8.3% this year, and it certainly will continue to advance this holiday season.

However, other categories in retail are languishing. Furniture and home stores are off 5%, building materials and supplies down 2%, sporting goods and hobby declined 3.5% and department stores continue to struggle with revenues down 1% this year.

While inflation is well off highs reached in mid-2022, retail prices are still about 20% higher in most spending categories since runaway inflation took hold. For example, Bankrate found that only about 6 percent of the nearly 400 items tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are cheaper now than they were back in 2020.

In response, shoppers are widely trading down to less premium goods, according to McKinsey and Company's third quarter ConsumerWise survey among 4,000 U.S. consumers. Some 76% of consumers surveyed, including 86% of GenZ and Millennials, are trading down to save money.

And particularly among the younger cohort, a social media-driven trend called ""underconsumption core"" is taking hold. CNN reported that these young people are pushing back against influencers who urge followers to buy the next new fashion trend, beauty product or hot gadget.

They are opting instead to show off how well they are making do without, and helping to save the planet in the process.

""It's really pushing back against this idea that you need to constantly be buying things to have a happy and fulfilling life,"" Megan Doherty Bea, assistant professor of consumer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, shared with CNN.

The NRF has yet to announce its Winter Holiday forecast, but at the start of the year, it predicted core retail growth would be in the 2.5% to-3.5% range and reach between $5.23 trillion and $5.28 trillion by year end. However, as of August, retail growth is only about half that.

While NRF nailed its Winter Holiday 2023 forecast last year, with retail sales up 3.8% over November-December to reach $964.4 billion, retail will need to make up for the shortfall its experienced through the first eight months of this year to hit NRF's full-year forecast.

That looks increasingly unlikely, given current consumer sentiment and all the other unknowns we face, as McKinsey warns, ""The next few months may be turbulent. Market uncertainty, the upcoming U.S. general election and ongoing geopolitical conflicts may test U.S. consumers' faith in the economy.""

One hit movie can't be expected to singlehandedly lift holiday retail sales. Yet excitement generated by Wicked could bring consumers out of their funk and get them engaged for the holiday season.

Regardless, it's going to take a lot of powerful witchcraft to overcome retail's headwinds going into the last months of the year."
Real Estate To Suffer $0.5 Trillion Climate Hit By 2050: Report,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2024/09/26/real-estate-to-suffer-05-trillion-climate-hit-by-2050-report/,2024-09-26T12:23:04Z,"The impacts of climate change could cost the real estate sector upward of half a trillion dollars by mid-century, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund has warned in a new report, released as Hurricane Helene bears down on Florida.

The research, from Singapore's GIC and S&P Global, shows that even under limited warming conditions, more powerful storms, along with more intense heatwaves and rainfall, were expected to cause $536 billion in damage, equivalent to 26% of total real estate asset value listed in S&P's Global REIT Index.

Under more rapid warming conditions, the report warns, climate impacts could cause in excess of $110 billion in real estate damage this decade, and $559 billion by 2050.

But no matter what path global warming takes, severe impacts on property are expected to worsen globally.

""The warming that is already embedded in the climate system means that physical risks are likely to increase over time, raising costs across the broader economy for customers, tenants, building operators, owners, and investors,"" author Wong De Rui and colleagues state. ""This trend will likely accelerate as the window of opportunity to curb global warming narrows each year,"" they conclude.

Crucially, the researchers show, investing in solutions like greening roofs and floodproofing offered significant investment opportunities. They calculate that such investments could lower the costs of climate impacts by $45 billion by mid-century. Floodproofing could save $3.55 for every $1 invested, while greening roofs or adding cooling solutions could save $7.45 for every $1 invested.

For this reason, the report states, the demand for climate adaptation solutions could reach a value of $29 billion annually. The authors criticise existing risk models for failing to incorporate the value of adaptation, a situation that is ""making it harder for investors to prioritise risk management.""

However eye-opening GIC's calculations might be, they could be conservative. Earlier this year, Swiss reinsurance giant Swiss Re warned that the U.S. is sustaining losses of $97 billion every year, making it the country most exposed to climate change in financial terms.

The world's second-largest reinsurer noted that exposure to climate-fuelled catastrophes was causing insurers to raise their rates, or even to pull out of states, such as Florida, altogether.

The GIC report comes as Hurricane Helene approaches the U.S. southeast coast, with meteorologists warning that the storm is ""particularly worrisome"". On Thursday, the National Weather Service warned that storm surges in Florida could be ""catastrophic and unsurvivable"".

In May, Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill that would remove most references to climate change from state law."

The Biden-Harris record ""speaks for itself,"" and not in a good way, according to former first lady Melania Trump.

When asked about Vice President Harris replacing President Biden as the Democratic Party nominee, Melania said the country is experiencing numerous challenges under their leadership, a stark contrast to her husband's term in office.

""The country is suffering. People are not able to buy usual necessities for their families. We have wars going on around the world. Soldiers are dying. They were dying under this administration because of weak leadership. The border is open and dangerous. A lot of fentanyl is coming over, killing our youth. It's very hard to see,"" she told ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Ainsley Earhardt in an exclusive sit-down interview that aired Thursday.

MELANIA TRUMP OPENS UP AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS ON HER HUSBAND: SURVIVING BOTH WERE 'REALLY MIRACLES'

""[The economy] it's really not great. Inflation is high and, if we compare these four years under this administration compared to four years under my husband as commander in chief, he was leading the country through peace through strength. And the border was safer than ever before. We didn't have any wars. People were prospering. They had jobs. They could support their families, so I think the American people need to decide what they really want. Maybe some strong tweets, but everything else great for this country, so it's all in the American people's hands on November 5th.""

The conversation marked the former first lady's first television interview in more than two years. It also came in anticipation of her new memoir release titled ""Melania.""

During the interview, she also recalled finding out about the two attempts on her husband's life, which have come within a brief two-month span of each other.

The first came when gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire on the former president at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, striking his ear and leaving blood streaming down his face.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES OUTDOOR PENNSYLVANIA RALLY TO 'FINISH OUR SPEECH' AT SITE OF FIRST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Crooks also claimed the life of former Pennsylvania fire chief Corey Comperatore and injured rallygoers David Dutch and James Copenhaven.

""I ran to the TV and I [rewound] it and I watched it,"" Melania recalled.

""I didn't really see [it] live, but maybe, you know, three minutes, a few minutes later. But when I saw it, I, you know, it was only... Nobody really knew yet. Because when you see him on the floor, and you don't know, you don't know what really happened.""

MULTIPLE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS PUT ON LEAVE FOLLOWING TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Just two months later, the former president had another brush with death at the Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida, when the barrel of suspected gunman Ryan Routh's firearm was spotted among the bushes.

Melania was in New York at the time, but called to make sure everything was fine. While speaking to Earhardt, she credited the Secret Service for a ""fantastic"" job.

""The guys that they were, the team, they were fantastic. And I think both of the events, they were really miracles. If you really think about it, July 13th was a miracle. How... like that much, and he could, you know, he could not be with us.""

"Trump, Harris neck and neck in key states Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina: poll",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-harris-neck-neck-key-states-arizona-georgia-north-carolina-poll,2024-09-26T12:07:37Z,"Who is in the lead of the 2024 election roughly 40 days out? Will Cain breaks it all down. Plus, the Ruthless Podcast guys join Will to discuss if Trump can defeat Harris, the future of the GOP, and if sports are 'bread and circuses.'

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are virtually tied in three crucial battleground states, according to new statewide surveys from Marist College.

The Marist Poll released Thursday finds that Harris and Trump are tied at 49% among likely voters in North Carolina who were asked which candidate they were leaning toward. Of those polled who have made up their minds, 91% said they strongly support their choice.

The race is tight in Arizona as well, where Trump polls just one point ahead of Harris, 50% to 49%, according to the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. The same goes for Georgia, where 50% of likely voters are leaning towards Trump and 49% say they are more inclined to vote for Harris.

The Marist Polls were conducted from Sept. 19-24, surveying 4,643 registered voters across all three states who report they are definitely voting in this year's election.

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE

There are 43 Electoral College votes up for grabs between Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. Trump, a Republican, won all three in his 2016 victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, but lost Arizona and Georgia to President Biden in his 2020 defeat. North Carolina, a swing state that Trump won twice, has an incumbent Democratic governor and appears more competitive this year as the Republican candidate for governor, Mark Robinson, is mired in scandal over posts he allegedly made on a porn website and polls poorly against state Attorney General Josh Stein, the Democratic candidate.

""North Carolina, with its 16 electoral votes, is both the Harris and Trump campaigns' backup plan after the hard-fought battle over Pennsylvania,"" said Dr. Lee M. Miringoff, Director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. ""North Carolina is so close that the five regions in the state line up now almost exactly as they did four years ago. It's as if the Biden years and the 2024 campaign haven't happened.""

Harris and Trump are tied at 48% among North Carolina independents who are likely to vote. Biden carried Tar Heel independents by four points in 2020, according to the 2020 Presidential Exit Poll. Harris leads Trump among Black voters 86% to 13%, but underperforms compared to Biden, who earned 92% of the Black vote in North Carolina in 2020. Trump has an advantage over Harris with white voters, 59% to 40%, though Harris has improved with this demographic over Biden, who won 33% of the white vote in 2020.

The top issues for North Carolina voters are inflation (32%), preserving democracy (28%), immigration (14%) and abortion (11%), according to the poll.

HARRIS AND TRUMP DEADLOCKED IN PENNSYLVANIA AS FORMER PRESIDENT TRAILS IN OTHER 'BLUE WALL' STATES: POLL

Over in Arizona, Harris edges Trump among independents 51% to 47%. Biden won Arizona independents by 9 points four years ago, 53% to Trump's 44%. Again, Trump leads Harris among white voters 51% to 48%, while the Latino vote is competitive, with 51% leaning towards Trump and 49% towards Harris.

The top issues for Arizona voters are preserving democracy (27%), inflation (26%), immigration (21%) and abortion (14%), the survey said.

""Arizona's 11 electoral votes are up for grabs, but the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate (Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz.) has a double-digit lead,"" said Miringoff. ""Voters in the state, like elsewhere, are willing to split their ticket this time unlike the straight party voting that occurred in 2016 and 2020.""

Harris also leads Trump among Georgia independents by five percentage points, 51% to 46%. Similar to Arizona, Biden won Georgia independents by 9 points in what was the first presidential election win for Peach State Democrats since 1992. Trump heavily contested the 2020 results in Georgia and continues to make unproven allegations of widespread voter fraud that have been rejected by Georgia officials, including Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.

""Georgia was ground zero for election controversies in 2020. Yet, the overwhelming majority of Georgians express confidence that elections will be fair and accurate,"" said Miringoff. ""Interestingly, most Democrats and Republicans share this view despite the results last time.""

Georgia voters rank inflation as the top issue (34%), followed by preserving democracy (24%), immigration (13%) and abortion (11%).

A Fox News national poll taken after the first debate between Harris and Trump spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

""An increasing number say grocery prices and housing costs are tough for their family,"" the Fox News poll notes.

Trump led Harris on the economy by 5 points in the Fox News poll.

""The issue profile of this election continues to favor Trump,"" said Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson.

But Shaw added that Trump's ""edge on economic issues has decreased, probably due to Harris' messaging on housing costs and taxes, both of which target the middle class and appear to be paying off.""

Sixty-two years after Sam Walton opened the first Walmart in Rogers, Arkansas, its spectacular success has minted his eldest son as a centibillionaire.

Rob Walton became the first member of America's richest family to hold a 12-figure fortune, worth an estimated $100 billion. Shoppers have flocked to the budget retailer amid high inflation, sending Walmart's shares up 53% year-to-date.

Just 15 other people are worth $100 billion or more, including Elon Musk and Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang. With Walmart's stock market tear, Rob's siblings Jim and Alice may soon join him in this elite club.

A Forbes review of Facebook found nearly 800 groups offering to connect women to abortion remedies -- at least 300 of which operate in countries where abortion is at least sometimes illegal, or even a criminal offense. But the groups are something of a double-edged sword, says Katy Mayall, the director for strategic initiatives at the Center for Reproductive Rights. While they may get some women help, they can be a gateway to scams and fraudsters and carry health and privacy risks for people in restrictive countries.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on federal criminal charges by a grand jury Wednesday night, capping a series of federal corruption investigations against him and several high-ranking members of his administration. In a defiant video statement shortly before the indictment was reported, Adams said the charges were ""entirely false, based on lies"" and dismissed calls for him to resign, saying the people of New York ""elected me to lead this city, and lead it I will.""

Since the Federal Reserve's major interest rate cut last week, yields for 10-year Treasury notes, the benchmark for loans like mortgages and auto rates, have actually increased. Now expectations have shifted for the Fed to enact another big cut amid mounting evidence that the economy needs even more of a jolt.

Coinbase, the largest publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange in the world, has custody of 11% of all Bitcoin tokens. Now, Brian Armstrong, the company's chief executive and cofoun­der, wants to disrupt his money machine -- the key to that pivot is Base, a system designed to improve upon Ethereum's blockchain by potentially speeding up transactions.

A Delaware court extended an order stalling Bolt founder Ryan Breslow's bid to raise $450 million, characterizing the deal as a ""prisoner's dilemma"" for investors. It's the latest snag in Breslow's ongoing bid to raise fresh capital for the struggling payments company, as three irate Bolt investors requested the halt on the Series F financing round -- including the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock.

The Senate voted 78-18 to approve legislation Wednesday to continue funding the government through December 20, narrowly averting a shutdown just five days before the deadline. The short-term spending deal still requires lawmakers to either hash out a funding deal or pass another extension in December, about six weeks after Election Day.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin (D-Md.) was the target of a sophisticated spoofing operation where a video caller used deepfake imagery to pose as a high-level Ukrainian official, according to multiple reports late Wednesday. In a notice reported by NBC News, the Senate security office warned lawmakers about an ""active social engineering campaign ... targeting Senators and Senate staff.""

President Joe Biden said he was not forced out of the presidential race in his first sit-down interview since his historic decision to end his campaign in July. Biden said on ABC's The View that he always saw himself as a ""transition president,"" but insisted he would have beaten former President Donald Trump.

The Israeli military is reportedly considering a ground invasion into Lebanon, amid an escalating conflict with Hezbollah that has killed hundreds and threatens to turn into a full-blown war. Late Wednesday, the U.S., France and several key allies issued a statement calling for an immediate 21-day cease-fire, noting that the conflict ""presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he has not yet responded to the ""U.S.-French proposal"" and has ""instructed the IDF to continue fighting with full force.""

Since hedge fund Elliott Investment Management, run by billionaire activist investor Paul Singer, announced in June it had taken a $1.9 billion stake in Southwest Airlines, the carrier has made policy changes, upended its board and had its chairman resign. But it's apparently not enough: On Tuesday, the hedge fund announced it would call for a special meeting at Southwest Airlines ""in the coming weeks."" In a letter to shareholders, Elliott accuses Southwest's leadership of obstructing a leadership change with ""a chaotic series of defensive actions.""

TOPLINE Philip Morris International is rehabilitating nicotine's image with its wildly in-demand flavored Zyn pouches, embraced by celebrities, entrepreneurs and star athletes.

By the end of 2024, PMI, which owns Zyn manufacturer Swedish Match, expects to sell as much as 580 million cans of Zyn, a 50% increase over the 385 million sold last year. Forbes estimates that Zyn sales, which PMI does not break out in public filings, generated $1.3 billion last year (about 3.7% of PMI's $35 billion in total revenue) and could hit $1.9 billion this year.

Zyn is six times more profitable than PMI's cigarette division, says Bonnie Herzog, an analyst for Goldman Sachs who covers the tobacco industry. And unlike cigarettes, which have been steadily declining in volume for the last decade, Zyn is in hypergrowth mode. Shipment volume in the U.S. has jumped a staggering 238% since 2020.

But while pouches have successfully divorced nicotine from the cigarette, they still have health risks. Plus, the FDA has not authorized them for sale, although Swedish Match filed an application in March 2020. This means the products are technically illegal, but the FDA is allowing them to stay on the market while the agency reviews applications.

And at least five lawsuits allege that PMI is marketing Zyn to minors. ""Zyn is Juul 2.0,"" says Scott Schlesinger, a Florida-based attorney who recently filed a class action against PMI and Swe­dish Match.

But Stacey Kennedy, head of PMI's U.S. operations, insists that PMI is marketing Zyn only to adults who already smoke or use nicotine. ""I think Zyn is proof that nicotine can be used [to replace] more harmful products,"" she says.

WHY IT MATTERS ""Zyn has become a runaway success for PMI. Its newest nicotine product will generate nearly $2 billion in sales this year, Forbes estimates,"" says staff writer Will Yakowicz. ""But the nicotine pouch is more than just a financial juggernaut -- Zyn has spawned its own culture online (also known as the Zynternet), with viral memes and celebrities touting the brand. And it has even entered the presidential election: Ohio Senator JD Vance has been photographed holding a container of Zyn, while on the other side of the aisle, Tim Walz levied a 95% tax on Zyn and other nicotine products as governor of Minnesota.""

Shares Of Fubon-Backed Solar Farm Developer Slump In First Trading On Taiwan's Main Board,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/shanshankao/2024/09/26/shares-of-fubon-backed-solar-farm-developer-slump-in-first-trading-on-taiwans-main-board/,2024-09-26T11:28:48Z,"Taipei-based solar farm developer HD Renewable Energy (HDRE), backed by Taiwanese billionaire brothers Daniel and Richard Tsai's Fubon Financial, closed down 5.3% on its first day of trading on the Taiwan Stock Exchange's main board.

HDRE, which now has a market capitalization of NT$28.9 billion ($907.2 million), was previously listed on the Taiwan Innovation Board.

For fiscal year 2023, HDRE reported revenue of NT$5.8 billion, up 15.4% from the previous year, and profits increased 17.3% to NT$991.2 million. In the first half of the year, HDRE posted revenue of NT$2.2 billion, a 5.4% increase from the same period last year, while profits declined 4.6% to NT$251.4 million.

Demand for green energy, such as from solar panels, has been rising as Taiwanese suppliers of tech giants like Apple and Google try to meet their clients' carbon neutrality goals. To meet that commitment, renewable energy companies like HDRE will need to dramatically ramp up their capacity in the coming decades.

HDRE is backed by Fubon Financial's venture capital arm, Fubon Financial Holding Venture Capital, with a 5.8% stake in the company. Other investors of HDRE include Shihlin Electric and Taiwan Life Insurance, a subsidiary of billionaire Jeffrey Koo Jr.'s CTBC Financial Holding.

In June, Fubon Financial Holding Venture Capital invested NT$11 billion in its renewable arm, Fubon Green Power, which also received investments from HDRE and Fubon's Taiwan Mobile. In the same month, Fubon subsidiaries signed a contract with Star Power, a unit of HDRE, for the procurement of a total of 4.4 million kWh of green electricity. Cathay Life Insurance, controlled by the billionaire Tsai Hong-tu & Cheng-ta & family, also sought green energy from HDRE.

HDRE says it's aiming to become a leading private power company on the self-ruled island, aside from the state-owned Taiwan Power Company. It builds solar power farms, develops charging and storage systems, as well as sell renewable energy. Besides Taiwan, HDRE also has presence in Japan, Australia and the Philippines.

While companies use HDRE's green energy to power their AI programs, HDRE itself also utilizes the hot technology to manage its electricity supply and pricing. Last year, it acquired Taipei-based Beseye for NT$100 million to help develop its TITAN smart energy system that manages the production and consumption of green energy.

""The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources means that electricity generation may not always align with the demand for electricity,"" Chou Shih-chang, cofounder and general manager of HDRE, said in an interview at the company's headquarters last year. ""Therefore, the development of AI algorithms is necessary to predict the generation and usage.""

Besides generating and building energy storage systems, HDRE also sells electricity. ""We aim to provide end-to-end services from power generation and energy storage to charging infrastructure, and become the 'Uber' of the renewable energy industry,"" Chou said.

Chou believes that managing electrical resources will become a new norm of the sharing economy as more markets progress toward a net-zero reality. ""We aim to provide end-to-end services from power generation and energy storage to charging infrastructure, and become the 'Uber' of the renewable energy industry,"" he said.

Before starting HDRE in 2016, Chou and his cofounder Hsieh Yuan-i were running a totally different business. They sold souvenirs at a Buddhism museum in southern Taiwan. Although they initially turned a profit, the venture ultimately closed after losses piled up.

Despite the failure of their first business, they were eager to start a new venture. Later, Chou and Hsieh saw the potential for the green energy sector in Asia, so they pooled money from family and friends to begin investing in building solar power plants across the region. The pair had traveled in Japan, South Korea, mainland China, Vietnam and the Philippines to negotiate for potential business.

Their most successful investments were in the Japanese cities of Kansai and Tokyo. Then, they brought their experience and knowhow back to their home, when they spotted the opportunity created by key policy changes that saw Taiwan adopt a target to boost sustainable energy and reduce carbon emissions.

HDRE's plants now cover a total of 1,500 hectares with a development volume of more than 1.5GW. ""Everyone in the world is talking about carbon indicators. Without green energy, they do not have the trading pass,"" Chou said. ""Either you use green energy or you pay a big amount of carbon tax.""

""We hope to develop a software platform, establish a strong brand presence, and expand our reach by exploring opportunities in other countries,"" Chou added."
Data Monetization Trends: Insights From 1000 Organizations,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/douglaslaney/2024/09/26/data-monetization-trends-insights-from-1000-organizations/,2024-09-26T11:21:30Z,"An analysis of more than 1000 organizations generating measurable value from data, compiled by West Monroe, reveals several compelling trends that are influencing the future of data monetization and the future of the economy itself. Businesses are increasingly acknowledging the untapped potential of their data assets. As such, the landscape of data monetization is undergoing a rapid evolution, encompassing concepts and technologies like data marketplaces and AI. The following are some of the most significant trends in data monetization today:

AI and Advanced Analytics

One of the most exciting trends in data monetization is the use of AI and advanced analytics. Organizations are leveraging machine learning and natural language processing techniques to extract valuable insights from structured and unstructured data. For instance, some organizations use advanced text analytics and a variety of harvested web content to identify critical patterns and trends. This demonstrates how integrating multiple data sources, even those with relatively small volumes, can create high-value data products.

For example, The North Face successfully leveraged AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) technology from EasyAsk to enhance its online search functionality, allowing customers to use natural language queries. This improvement led to more accurate and relevant search results, significantly enhancing the customer experience. As a result, The North Face saw a 23% increase in online revenue, demonstrating the powerful impact of AI and advanced analytics in data monetization by driving higher conversion rates and sales through improved customer interactions.

Shift from Selling Data to Generating Economic Benefits

Data monetization is no longer limited to selling data. Organizations are now focusing on using data to improve internal processes, leading to measurable returns. This indirect form of data monetization can optimize supply chains, enhance customer service, and improve product development. Direct data monetization, on the other hand, entails externalizing data for commercial gain. Companies have successfully monetized data by enhancing their online search capabilities leading to improved customer experience and loyalty.

Walmart is a notable example of a company that generates measurable economic benefits from data. By incorporating social media trends into its search engine algorithm, Walmart was able to significantly reduce online shopping cart abandonment rates by 10-15%. This strategic use of data improved the customer shopping experience by making product searches more relevant and timely, but it also directly translated into increased sales and reduced lost revenue. This case highlights how leveraging data insights can lead to tangible financial gains and enhanced operational efficiency.

Monetizing Unstructured Content

Many organizations possess vast amounts of unstructured data that present opportunities for monetization. Techniques like text mining, sentiment analysis, and natural language processing can unlock the value hidden in this data. For example, some companies analyze project communications and documentation to gain greater foresight into project outcomes. This showcases the immense potential of mining unstructured data to derive actionable insights.

A lesser-known but fascinating example of generating immense value from unstructured content is the organization Thorn. Thorn uses advanced text analytics on a broad array of harvested web content and other unstructured data sources to combat human trafficking. By analyzing online ads, social media posts, and other digital footprints, Thorn's technology identifies patterns and connections that help law enforcement agencies locate and rescue victims and apprehend traffickers. This innovative use of unstructured data generates significant social and economic benefits by addressing a critical issue, as well as demonstrating the transformative power of data analytics in creating real-world impact.

A Healthy Dose of Healthcare Data

The healthcare industry is rich with data that, when de-identified and aggregated, can provide significant value to various stakeholders. The pharma and hospital sectors are finding tremendous success in monetizing de-identified data, which is valuable for research, investment, and improving healthcare outcomes. This trend highlights a focus on drug research, driving down healthcare costs, spurring innovation, and improving patient care.

Allina Health is a compelling healthcare example. By integrating and analyzing unstructured data from clinical notes, patient feedback, and operational records, Allina Health has been able to identify and reduce unwanted clinical variations. This data-driven approach has significantly improved patient outcomes, such as lowering heart failure readmissions and enhancing stroke care. Financially, these initiatives have contributed to a $30 million impact out of a total $125 million in improvements. This case illustrates how effectively managing and monetizing unstructured healthcare data can lead to both enhanced patient care and substantial economic benefits.

Data Bartering and Trading

Data bartering and trading allow organizations to acquire valuable data without direct monetary transactions. Grocery stores and other retailers often use loyalty programs to exchange customer data for discounts and other benefits. Retailers can use this data to personalize marketing efforts, optimize inventory, and enhance customer experiences. Data bartering and trading offer a cost-effective way to enhance data assets, drive business growth, and foster business partnerships.

A prime example of data bartering is the collaboration between the agricultural company John Deere and various technology firms. John Deere, known for its farming equipment, collects vast amounts of data from its machinery, including soil conditions, crop health, and equipment performance. Instead of selling this data outright, John Deere often trades it with technology firms in exchange for advanced analytics tools and software solutions. This exchange allows John Deere to enhance its precision agriculture services, providing farmers with actionable insights to improve crop yields and operational efficiency. Meanwhile, the technology firms acquire valuable agricultural data to enhance their products and services.

Data Marketplaces

Data marketplaces are revolutionizing data monetization by enabling organizations of all sizes to participate in the data economy. These platforms allow companies to monetize their corporate data, providing a way for businesses to leverage their data assets and generate new revenue streams. As data governance practices evolve and organizations become more aware of the value of their data, data marketplaces are likely to grow in popularity. This shift not only monetizes and democratizes access to valuable datasets but also fosters innovation and collaboration across industries.

Databricks is one of several technology providers that now offer a data marketplace. Its Databricks Marketplace platform enables organizations to share and monetize their data assets, as well as access a wide variety of datasets for analytics and machine learning purposes. Companies from diverse industries, such as finance, healthcare, and retail, can leverage Databricks Marketplace to enhance their data-driven initiatives. For instance, a fintech company looking to develop new financial products or services can purchase anonymized transaction data shared by a financial services firm on the marketplace. In return, the financial services firm could access datasets related to market trends or consumer behavior to refine their own offerings.

Government and Open Data

Businesses are increasingly using government open-data platforms for commercial purposes. To enhance their data assets, companies are leveraging open data from government sources. Applications ranging from market research to product development and beyond can utilize this data. Open data from government sources can be a goldmine for businesses looking to enhance their data assets.

The City of Chicago's open data initiative is a prime example of monetizing government data. By making datasets on vacant buildings, crime statistics, public health, and transportation publicly available, the city enables businesses, researchers, and developers to leverage this information for various purposes. Real estate developers, for instance, can use data on vacant buildings and neighborhood demographics to identify prime locations for new projects, while tech startups can create innovative applications like real-time transit updates using public transportation data. This initiative helps foster economic development and innovation, along with enhanced transparency and civic engagement, ultimately benefiting both the public and private sectors.

A Shift From Free Data to Licensing Insights

Businesses that have traditionally shared data for free are now exploring the economic benefits of licensing it. Licensing data allows organizations to retain ownership while generating revenue. This approach can be particularly beneficial for companies with valuable proprietary data that others are willing to pay for. Giving away data can become a slippery slope. Reconsidering this strategy, or cutting it off at some point, and moving towards licensing data or insights can create new revenue streams and ensure that data is used in a controlled and compliant manner.

Dollar General is a notable example of a company that transitioned from giving away data to licensing it. Initially, Dollar General shared its sales, inventory, and shopping basket data with its Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) partners as part of their business relationships. However, recognizing the economic potential of this data, the company shifted to a licensing model. By doing so, Dollar General now generates revenue from its data assets, creating a self-funding data lake. This strategic move monetizes their valuable information and provides their partners with actionable insights, enhancing the overall value proposition for both parties.

Web Content Harvesting

Organizations can gather large amounts of data from the internet through web content harvesting, which they can then analyze and monetize. This approach is useful for competitive intelligence, market research, and other data-driven strategies. By systematically collecting and analyzing web content, organizations can generate new monetizable datasets and gain a competitive edge.

Sigma-Aldrich, now part of Merck, is a great example of a company effectively using web content harvesting. With over 180,000 products, pricing them optimally within the marketplace was a daunting manual task. To address this, Sigma-Aldrich employed web data collection agents to collect, aggregate, and structure competitor product pricing information in real-time. They directly feed this harvested data into their pricing models, enabling them to dynamically adjust prices and maintain competitiveness. This approach streamlines their pricing strategy and also provides a significant competitive edge in the market.

These major trends and examples highlight the diverse and innovative ways organizations are leveraging data to create new value streams. As the data economy continues to expand, businesses that embrace these trends will be well-positioned to unlock the full potential of their data assets and thrive in their own markets."
How To Make Your Ski Or Snowboard Trip Better And Easier This Winter,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryolmsted/2024/09/26/how-to-make-your-ski-or-snowboard-trip-better-and-easier-this-winter/,2024-09-26T11:21:18Z,"Some people believe travel is about the journey, not the destination. Those people probably have not flown recently on a commercial carrier. I love to travel and always look forward to my next trip, but increasingly, I have come to dislike the ""getting there"" part when it involves flying -- especially with luggage.

In recent years most major airlines, including the big legacy carriers, have transformed themselves into more crowded, less friendly companies that give you less with your airfare than you got historically, especially when it comes to luggage. These issues are even worse with most budget airlines, many of whom see luggage not as part of customer service but rather as a major profit center (with the still surprising exception of Southwest, the last one standing with two free checked bags for economy passengers). Airlines have also cut back on customer service, which you notice as soon as you have a problem with your luggage.

To make matters worse, American and Jet Blue, among others, raised baggage fees this year, and more will likely follow. Jet Blue's policy is virtually incomprehensible, based on several different factors, including how far in advance you pay, what type of fare you buy, and in addition, they have gone to a form of dynamic pricing with even higher prices at peak times, including popular ski vacation slots such as Christmas holidays. Across the board, most airlines charge more for the second bag than the first, and even more for a third, bizarrely making this just about the only consumer product or service in existence where the price goes up, rather than down, with volume purchasing.

The baggage fees can be heinous, but what's even worse is when you pay and your baggage goes astray. Last year more than 2.8 million checked bags were lost, damaged, delayed, or stolen in the United States. That's higher than pre-pandemic numbers, but the only good news is that 2023 was better than 2022, a record year for baggage incompetence.

Checked luggage is always an issue for travelers but rarely more so than when it comes to ski and snowboard vacations. These are big items that cannot be packed with your regular checked luggage, and on a winter trip you are often already carrying more clothing and gear than usual (helmets, boots, ski jackets, pants and insulated layers, etc.). In addition, ski bags are unwieldy and often necessitate renting a larger -- and more expensive -- vehicle if you are self-driving. In Europe (and Japan), much ski travel is by train, which while efficient and eco-friendly, is not ski luggage friendly (though it's worth noting that one major European airline, Swiss, with a rich alpine history, lets skiers and snowboarders check their gear for free, just because).

When I go on a golf trip, I lug my clubs because they are highly customized and personalized, and I cannot rent a set as good for me. Also, I have high airline frequent flier status and often get free checked baggage which affects my decisions. But while I love my skis, most of us have major brands that can be rented in nearly identical models wherever we are going, so there is less pressure to bring your own. Ski technology also improves faster than most other sports gear, and if your skis are few years old, chance are the high-performance rentals might well be better. And if you are not a high-performance skier, the issue is likely a non-issue.

Unlike skis, if you have good boots, the pro move is to always bring these -- and carry them on the plane. Ski boots you love are the single hardest thing in your luggage to replicate if your bags get lost, and it's easy to carry them on, either in a backpack or simply slung over your shoulder as you see so many skiers on winter flights doing. They fit overhead or under the seat and if all else goes wrong you'll be glad you have them. They are also bulky and relatively heavy, and you can use the space in your checked luggage for something else. They are almost sure to be more comfortable, and probably higher performance, than the rentals, not that there are not good rental boots, but simply because you already know you like them, and many skiers have customized their boots or insoles.

The exception is if you are shipping all your luggage in advance, then your boots can go too.

There are two very different ways to get around the hassle of bringing skis on the plane and in the car/shuttle/train. One is to ship your own stuff out, the other is to rent. When it comes to rentals, traditional ski resort lodge shops have had some problems, including limited selections and long lines, but there are now specialized delivery services that come to you with no wait, in the comfort of your own rental accommodation or hotel, with a big selection of top-shelf gear you can reserve well in advance.

If you've arrived in a ski town after a long day in airports and on planes, usually followed by a lengthy drive/shuttle to the mountains, especially with kids, and gone to the rental shop, you have probably experienced the frustration of a long (like over an hour) line behind other families filling out paperwork and trying on boots. Now imagine sitting on the couch drinking wine while staffers help your family with their gear -- gear you can choose precisely and in advance. That's a better mental picture.

There are two major multi-location players in the world of rental delivery, long established companies that do door to door delivery and fitting with a robust selection of top brands and good service in many different key ski markets.

Black Tie Ski Rentals services 48 mountains across North America from 20 locally owned and operated shops. They have the buying power to leverage a fleet of top ski, snowboard and boot brands with the personal attention that comes from local ownership. Geographically they are much heavier on the West, with locations at major resorts in California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Utah and Wyoming, while in the East, they exist only in North Carolina. In Canada they cover both sides of the country, including Whistler/Blackcomb, the Ski Big 3 trio of Lake Louise, Sunshine and Mt. Norquay in Banff, and Mt. Tremblant in Quebec, new for this year along with Schweitzer, the biggest resort in Idaho.

Black Tie carries skis from all the top brands, biggies like Head, K2, Atomic, Elan and Fischer, as well as more niche brands including Armada and Icelandic, plus many more, and in snowboards, everything from Arbor to Burton. They have lots of choices for beginners, intermediates and experts, and many women-specific models. They also rent helmets, boots and even cross-country gear.

The other big player is Ski Butlers, which excels at geographic diversity, covering the major Western resorts, plus a couple in Vermont and biggies across Europe, including Courchevel, Meribel, Tignes, Val d'Isere, Val di Fassa and Cortina, home of the next Winter Olympic Games.

They have a much smaller selection of brands, mainly partnering with Rossignol, but that's a great company and they have a big slate of skis and boards, from first timer to performance to high-performance, men's and women's. On top of that, Ski Butlers offers a ""Premium Ski"" specialty category, and they are not kidding, as these include custom skis from Telluride's Wagner Custom, the most renowned bespoke ski maker in the nation, as well as Parlor Custom skis. Most people will never have the opportunity to ski on Wagners unless they have a pair handmade for them or rent from Ski Butlers. I've had the opportunity, and they are awesome.

In a similar vein, while they carry a lineup of Rossignol snowboards for every ability, they are also the exclusive rental agent for Whitespace snowboards, designed by all-time greatest competitor and Olympic and X Games Gold Medalist Shuan White.

This year the company added a new service option, Ski Butlers Express. This delivers pre-sized gear so you skip the fitting and don't have to schedule an appointment to meet a visiting technician, saving some time, and especially helpful if your arrival gets delayed, but it costs the same.

I've used both companies in different locations and have been very happy. Both offer the same model of advance booking of specific gear and setting up delivery appointments on their websites, but it doesn't end there. Once you start skiing, if you don't like something or if it suddenly dumps snow and you want a fatter powder ski, or vice versa, you call them and they come swap out the gear, even midday. That's a level of flexibility you cannot get with your own stuff, and it saves a trip to an often out of the way rental shop -- and more time standing in line.

There are now several companies that specialize in shipping ski gear, as well as golf gear and even luggage, right from your home to your vacation destination. Many forego boxes and let you just print a label at home, slap it onto your ski bag, golf bag or suitcase, making the process very smooth. Almost all charge less if you drop the stuff off at a brick-and-mortar counter, but all will pick up at your door, and if money is no object, shipping all your stuff ahead of time and skipping any checked luggage is a great luxury way to go, and a safer way to ensure your stuff arrives, but it does typically cost more than checked luggage. Too give you an idea, your skis are typically going to be the second checked bag, and on Jet Blue in Peak season, that bag would cost you $60-$70 each way. A third checked bag would run you $135.

One of the cheapest is Lugless, which lets you enter info online, compares FedEx and UPS to find the cheapest option, leveraging its volume for much lower rates than you would pay (they all enjoy favorable volume rates, just like Amazon). I did a few imaginary comparisons online and they generally seemed to have the lowest rates, with a set of skis from Boston to Vail via FedEx for $50, if you drop off at FedEx. They also had a first-time discount offer on their website when I last checked.

I have not used Lugless but I have used Luggage Forward and it was a seamless experience, the stuff was in my hotel room when I arrived and I dropped it with the concierge when I left. Luggage Forward was one of the pioneers two decades ago and uses its vast historical data to predict real delivery times, which is especially useful to remote mountain destinations. I live in rural Vermont and know the dates I've gotten from FedEx and UPS and Amazon have often been off, so it's good to have the expertise. They pick up door to door and include a double money on time guarantee. The site is simple and seamless, with a standard pair of skis from New York to Vail starting at $114 including pick up and delivery.

ShipSkis (and golf sibling ShipSticks) is the other long-established operator in this space, both part of a larger company called Ship & Play. Ship & Play's CEO Jonathan Marsico said he saw a spike in travelers using the various luggage shipping services after the difficult summer of travel made headlines this year, and amidst consumer frustration with airline baggage policies. Ship & Play positions itself as a more ""white glove"" option with additional customer service and support. They also offer a one-time 20% off and ongoing 10% off discount for Ikon season passholders. When I priced out the Boston to Vail route for a set of skis it was about $90 without any discounts."
"Mortgage Rates Today: September 26, 2024 -- Rates Remain Fairly Steady",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-09-26-24/,2024-09-26T10:55:45Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

The current average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.68% with an APR of 6.70%, according to Curinos. The 15-year fixed mortgage has an average rate of 5.71% with an APR of 5.75%. On a 30-year jumbo mortgage, the average rate is 6.74% with an APR of 6.77%.

Today's average rate on a 30-year mortgage (fixed-rate) remained at 6.68% from 6.68% yesterday. This time last week, the 30-year fixed was 6.62%.

The APR on a 30-year fixed is 6.70%. This time last week, it was 6.63%. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

At today's interest rate of 6.68%, borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $100,000 will pay $644 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included), the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. You'd pay approximately $131,870 in total interest over the life of the loan.

With an interest rate of 5.71%, you would pay $828 per month in principal and interest for every $100,000 borrowed. Over the life of the loan, you would pay $49,127 in total interest.

The current average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage is 6.74% -- 0.01 percentage point up from last week. The 30-year jumbo mortgage rate had a 52-week APR low of 5.00% and a 52-week high of 10.50%.

A 30-year jumbo mortgage at today's fixed interest rate of 6.74% will cost you $648 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. On a $750,000 jumbo mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment would be approximately $4,862.

The Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy -- including its interest rate hikes, which it's using to restrain inflation -- is the primary factor that's pushing long-term mortgage rates higher. The state of the economy and housing market also affects mortgage rates. As for what interest rate the lender might offer you, this depends on your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and credit score, both of which indicate your risk as a borrower.

Shop around and talk to various lenders to get a sense of each company's mortgage loan offerings and services. Don't go with the first lender quote you receive; instead, compare the best mortgage rate quotes to get a deal. In particular, consider what fees they charge, what fees they're willing to waive and what closing assistance they might provide. Make sure any special offers or discounts don't come at the cost of a higher mortgage rate.

Be sure to apply with each lender within a 45-day window. During this window, you can have multiple lenders pull your credit history without additional impact on your credit score.

Mortgage rates remain elevated, and the nation's housing supply remains limited. The low inventory is preventing house prices from dropping. Meanwhile, the combination of high mortgage rates and appreciated home values will continue to present an obstacle for many prospective homebuyers seeking affordable housing.

Home loan borrowers can qualify for better mortgage rates by having good or excellent credit, maintaining a low debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and pursuing loan programs that don't charge mortgage insurance premiums or similar ongoing charges that increase the loan's annual percentage rate (APR).

Comparing rates from different mortgage lenders is an excellent starting point. You may also compare conventional, first-time homebuyer and government-backed programs like FHA and VA loans, which have different rates and fees.

For the most part, several economic factors influence the trajectory of rates for new home loans. The recent Federal Reserve rate hikes don't directly cause mortgage rates to rise but have indirectly caused the interest rates for many long-term loans to increase. Rates are more likely to decrease when the Fed pauses or decreases its benchmark Federal Funds Rate.

Further, the inflation rate and the general state of the economy directly impact interest rates. High inflation and a strong economy typically signal higher rates. Cooling consumer demand or inflation may help rates decrease.

As you compare lenders, consider getting rate quotes for several loan programs. In addition to comparing rates and fees, these programs can have flexible down payment and credit requirements that make qualifying easier.

Conventional mortgages are likely to offer competitive rates when you have a credit score between 670 and 850, although it's possible to qualify with a minimum score of 620. This home loan type also doesn't require annual fees when you have at least 20% equity and waive PMI.

Several government-backed programs are better when you want to make little or no down payment:"
"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: September 26, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-09-26-24/,2024-09-26T10:55:40Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are decreasing. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can put some money aside? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are known for paying puny interest rates. But if you know where to look, you can find rates 10x higher. Several online banks and credit unions pay rates that are far more competitive than those offered by brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you spot a basic savings account with a rate in that ballpark, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield also was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.24%, Curinos says. Last week, it was 0.24%. APY, or annual percentage yield, depicts the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts typically pay substantially higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the trade-off is you may have to meet strict conditions laid down by the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.97%. You'll be in good shape if you can nail down an account offering a rate close to 4.97%. Last week at this time, the best rate was a similar 4.97%.

The current average is 0.25% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's below last week's 0.26%.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
Why Bitcoin's Biggest Banker Is Making A Risky Pivot,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierpaz/2024/09/26/why-bitcoins-biggest-banker-is-making-a-risky-pivot/,2024-09-26T10:32:16Z,"Coinbase's Brian Armstrong created one of crypto's central players, a fee-gushing monster that holds more than a tenth of all the Bitcoin ever minted. But now, in the cause of ""decentralization,"" he's pursuing a new path. It's easy to be an idealist when you're a billionaire.

e're at a really exci­ting moment for crypto,"" enthuses Brian Armstrong, chief executive and cofoun­der of Coinbase, the largest publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange in the world. ""There is a shift happening from crypto being primarily an asset class that people want to trade to speculate on to it becoming more and more used for daily utility,"" he insists. ""Four hundred million people or so have used crypto globally.""

That's debatable. When it comes to crypto, most people only care about pri­ces, and those have been on a tear lately. Bitcoin has more than doubled in the last year to around $58,000. More than 20 crypto ETFs holding $54 billion in digital assets are trading in the U.S. Crypto is more widely held than ever and has become an important topic in the presidential election. With Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried now both in prison, Armstrong has emerged as the movement's most prominent spokesperson.

Given that Coinbase's stock mirrors trading in Bitcoin, Armstrong is a billionaire seven times over at age 41. The crypto­currency exchange he cofounded 12 years ago to become the ""Gmail for Bitcoin"" has a market capitalization of $40 billion and crypto assets under its custody of $270 billion. That includes holding more than $20 billion for BlackRock ($10 trillion in assets under management), now the world's largest crypto ETF provider. In 2023, the company, which makes most of its money from trading fees, netted $95 million on revenue of $3.1 billion. This year is on track to be much better: In the first six months of 2024, Coinbase's revenue amounted to $3.1 billion but net income soared to $1.2 billion.

If there were such a thing as a ""Too Big to Fail"" institution in the world of digital assets, Coinbase would be it. Just in terms of Bitcoin, Coinbase has custody of 11% of all tokens in existence. For crypto's second-most important currency, Ether, its share is even larger at an estimated 14% of all tokens. If Coinbase imploded, the consequences could be catastrophic.

Not everyone is a fan. In June 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase for acting as an unregistered exchange, broker-dealer and clearing firm -- all activities it engages in for more than 14,500 institutions, as well as 8 million active retail customers. The case is likely to go to trial in 2025.

Crypto evangelists hate the idea of centralized power, but operationally, Coinbase is more similar to other command-and-control financial institutions like JPMorgan than it is to something like an employee-owned credit union. Its main businesses are trading, custody and co-mana­ging (with Circle) a huge ($35 billion) stablecoin operation that pegs the value of the USDC token to the U.S. dollar. Coinbase's dominant position allows it to charge high fees. Purchasing $5,000 of Bitcoin on the exchange will cost you $90. On Kraken it costs $20, and on Robinhood it's free.

But Armstrong is a crypto idealist, and he isn't entirely happy with this state of affairs. He wants to disrupt his money machine, creating a whole new infrastructure for rapid-fire transactions, which will not only lower fees but also weaken the control of big tech and financial firms.

""The whole reason I got into this and the mission of Coinbase is around increasing economic freedom in the world,"" he says. ""The vision here is that crypto is going to power more and more of global GDP. [It will] create sound money, sound financial infrastructure for people all over the world with lower fees, lower friction.""

The key element in Armstrong's corporate pivot is Base, which launched in August 2023. Base is a so-called Layer 2 platform. Instead of being a self-sufficient blockchain like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, it is designed to improve upon Ethereum by potentially processing thousands of transactions per second, costing less than a cent each. Ethereum can handle only about a dozen transactions per second, each costing an average of $1. It's a huge improvement, but still far less than existing financial networks. Visa's global processing network, VisaNet, can handle 65,000 transactions a second.

Armstrong would like his low-cost Base to be interoperable with other Ethereum-based blockchains and support decentralized versions of Facebook, YouTube, Google, Uber and X. He's also onboarding merchants ranging from Anheuser-Busch to Wharton business school using his Coinbase Commerce service, taking aim at the likes of PayPal, Mastercard and Visa, which charge fees as high as 3% per transaction. Coinbase Commerce charges only 1%. But consumer adoption has been slow. The network processes fewer than 2,000 transactions daily. Visa does that many every second.

""Some of these businesses might have only 5% margins, and 2% of it is going to the card network,"" Armstrong says. ""There's no reason it needs to be this way. It's an unnecessary tax on the economy.""

According to Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau, Base's estimated 1 million active users are expec­ted to contribute $100 million to Coinbase's revenue in 2024. Most of that is from trading fees (this is crypto, after all).

Ironically, if Coinbase is going to be even more successful with Base, it will have to give up control -- and share fees. Coinbase is currently Base's only ""sequencer,"" crypto jargon for operator or supervisor. To become decentralized, Base will require more sequencers. If Base had four sequen­cers, Coinbase might earn only 25% of the total fees.

Talk of lower fees and revenue dilution may not win Coinbase long-term fans on Wall Street. In the short term, shareholders don't seem to mind. Shares of Coinbase have nearly doubled in the last 12 months. As long as the price of crypto keeps soaring -- and the geeks keep tra­ding it -- Armstrong can spout as much idealistic claptrap as he wants."
Opinion | Trump's campaign shows the problems with the Aquaman presidency,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-second-term-aquaman-theory-rcna172665,2024-09-26T10:28:52Z,"A second term would show the excesses of presidential power more clearly.

During Barack Obama's presidency, frustration among his supporters at unfulfilled campaign promises became so common that a political scientist coined a name for the phenomenon. These supporters, Dartmouth University's Brendan Nyhan explained, were suffering from the Green Lantern Theory of the Presidency.

The Obama supporters' belief was that, just as the superhero Green Lantern could will anything into existence using his power ring, presidents could achieve any policy goal if they simply tried hard enough.

Most of the left has moved on from this cartoonish view of the presidency, but not Donald Trump. In recent weeks, the Republican presidential nominee has promised to do everything from cutting car insurance rates to making in vitro fertilization free. These pledges come after he previously claimed that he would impose across-the-board tariffs on all imports, deport millions of undocumented immigrants, end inflation, end the Ukraine war, repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and abolish the Department of Education, among a number of other big ideas.

It's tempting to view these as all empty promises, especially given how many pledges he didn't fulfill in his first term. But there's a risk to being too dismissive of presidential power, too, especially when faced with the prospect of a second Trump term. Some of his worst ideas would be entirely within his powers as president, especially the way the office is currently constructed, while his proposals to help the average American are most likely out of reach.

The key to understanding this is what I call the Aquaman Theory of the Presidency: The commander in chief is all powerful in certain circumstances, like how Aquaman can summon aid from sea creatures underwater, and totally useless in other situations, just as Aquaman isn't much help in the desert.

Consider tariffs. Trump, who has called himself ""a Tariff Man,"" has said he would levy a 20% tariff on all imports to encourage domestic manufacturing. Additionally, he recently threatened to impose a 100% tariff on cars made in Mexico and a 200% tariff on John Deere tractors if production is moved to Mexico. These tariffs would drive up costs for consumers, spark retaliatory moves that hurt American businesses and destabilize the global economy.

But could Trump do them? Sure. In this case, Tariff Man is Aquaman on his home turf.

Over the last century, Congress has repeatedly expanded the president's power to impose tariffs during wartime or for national security or even, some argue, any kind of national emergency. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has proposed a long-shot bill to limit that power, and some free-market supporters hope the Supreme Court might step in, but Trump would have the advantage in this fight for now.

By contrast, Trump would have to go through Congress to fulfill his off-the-cuff promises to end taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security income. Republicans are already planning to extend the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which disproportionately helped the wealthy at a cost of several trillion dollars. They might be persuaded to tack on one or two of those new proposals, but Trump wouldn't have much power to force the issue if they didn't want to do it.

Overall, Trump has broad powers for some of his worst ideas:

The success of some of his other ideas would depend in large part on how Congress and the Supreme Court reacted.

For example, Trump has proposed signing an executive order to end birthright citizenship, the post-Civil War guarantee from the 14th Amendment that anyone born on U.S. soil is an American citizen. Would Republicans in Congress stand up to the president and seek to undo that? Would the current Supreme Court reject it as clearly beyond the pale? Or would they both acquiesce, effectively granting the president a power that he does not actually have?

Trump would have fewer powers, however, when he needed Congress to act.

If he earnestly tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, for example, he would be unlikely to get any more cooperation from all the lawmakers he'd need to do it than in his last attempt in 2017. And Republicans are certainly not going to rush to make IVF free. In fact, anything more complicated than cutting taxes is likely to run into a legislative brick wall, especially since Trump hasn't outlined any plans for exactly what he'd do and has little support among the rank and file for these ideas.

Not all of this is absolute. Presidents can sometimes get Congress to do their bidding, muscling through key pieces of legislation with combinations of threats and favors. And the current Supreme Court would certainly find some limits on presidential power if they are used by a President Kamala Harris.

But if Trump gets a second term, he would have some Aquaman-like powers to do a lot of harm and not a lot of power to do good."
Athletics Bid Farewell To Oakland After 57 Years And Broken Promises,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/waynemcdonnell/2024/09/26/athletics-bid-farewell-to-oakland-after-57-years-and-broken-promises/,2024-09-26T10:20:32Z,"The departure of Major League Baseball from the city of Oakland, California is heartbreaking after decades of broken promises, a penchant for cheapness and failed ballpark proposals. No one is immune from guilt given how ownership and politicians equally drank from the well of avarice. A mixed-use development project could have revitalized a fan base and community that has experienced traumatic losses when it comes to professional sports franchises leaving Oakland. A series of missteps have led the Athletics to a vagabond existence as they plan to spend the next three seasons in a minor league ballpark in Sacramento before officially relocating to Las Vegas. Not only are they torturing their forlorn fans in Oakland, but the Athletics are teasing the city of Sacramento with a false sense of hope that one day they could be a permanent home for Major League Baseball.

After 57 years, the Athletics' time in Oakland (1968-2024) sadly becomes a footnote in the franchise's history just like previous homes in Philadelphia (1901-1954) and Kansas City (1955-1967). Regardless of the six American League pennants and four world championships won by the Athletics while playing in Oakland, the lack of respect and dignity paid to the fans will always supersede the joyful memories created by iconic ball players, innovative managers and one colorful owner who blended creativity with controversy. John Fisher, managing partner and board member of the Athletics, will reign in infamy as another professional sports franchise owner who became infatuated with the temptations of Las Vegas instead of preserving a cherished community asset.

Walter O'Malley was vilified for generations as he ripped the heart out of Brooklyn by relocating the beloved Dodgers to Los Angeles at the conclusion of the 1957 season. Time and perspective have served O'Malley well as he is considered an innovator when it comes to Major League Baseball's presence on the west coast. O'Malley's legacy was cemented in 2008 with his election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. In Fisher's case, he will never be mistaken for an innovator or influential contributor in baseball's history. He could have been a savior in Oakland but chose to be a copycat in an oversaturated market whose local economy relies heavily on tourism, gambling and hospitality while exceeding 40.8 million visitors in 2023 according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.

Alongside Lew Wolff and a limited partnership group, Fisher purchased the Athletics in April 2005 for $180 million according to Forbes. By November 2016, Wolff stepped down as managing partner and sold his 10% stake to the Fisher family who had already owned 80% of the franchise. Fisher is the son of Donald and Doris Fisher, co-founders of Gap Inc., a global apparel retail company whose origins date back to 1969 in San Francisco. Major League Baseball approved Fisher to be the managing partner of the Athletics upon Wolff's departure from the position.

In an ownership capacity with the Athletics since 2005, Fisher has seen the franchise qualify for the postseason seven times with one appearance in the American League Championship Series in 2016 where they were swept in four ball games by the Detroit Tigers. Five seasons of at least 90 victories under Fisher's regime seems like a distant memory given recent developments. Over the past three seasons, the Athletics have become synonymous with irrelevance and neglect amid an uncertain future in Oakland. Besides the paltry revenues generated by local media rights fees and the ballpark experience, the Athletics had serious concerns regarding their revenue sharing eligibility after being phased out in the previous collective bargaining agreement and required a binding agreement to build a new ballpark to maintain eligibility. The Athletics' designation as a revenue sharing recipient was never predicated on market size, but a desperate need for a new ballpark.

The Oakland Coliseum had become a blight on the Athletics. Always experiencing an identity crisis as evident in the ever-changing naming rights associated with the coliseum, sadness exudes from the concrete edifice. It is devoid of charm and revenue capabilities in the modern sense while receiving unwanted national attention for sewage leaks and an opossum living in the walls of the visiting ball club's broadcast booth. The Athletics were essentially playing in an abandoned National Football League stadium with green tarpaulins covering thousands of seats that were unsuitable for baseball. Instead of detracting attention from an obvious eyesore, the Athletics decided to paint the retired numbers of ball players along with acknowledgements of the franchise's world championships in both Philadelphia and Oakland on the tarpaulins in the colors of blue, gold, and white.

A $1.2 billion franchise valuation according to Forbes, there are no guarantees Las Vegas will be an immediate economic catalyst for the Athletics as Major League Baseball's home inventory of 81 regular season ball games is vastly different than every other professional sports league. Concerns presently exist regarding how the $1.5 billion, 33,000-seat ballpark will be financed as an October 17th meeting with the Las Vegas Stadium Authority will hopefully provide clarity regarding development, non-relocation and lease agreements. The current thought process pertaining to the ballpark's financing blends private equity from the Fisher family ($850 million) with public funding ($350 million) and debt incurred by the Athletics ($300 million) according to the Associated Press. The Tropicana Las Vegas, owned by Bally's Corporation, is scheduled for implosion on October 9th with nine of the 35 acres expected to be used to build a new ballpark for the Athletics. If all goes according to plan for the Athletics and their new ballpark, a sports district could be created in the shadows of the world famous ""Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas"" sign alongside Allegiant Stadium and T-Mobile Arena.

Sparse crowds in a cavernous and dilapidated coliseum are images that resonate the most when it comes to the Oakland Athletics. While the conditions were far from idyllic, the spirit and passion of the fans never wavered while only wanting a ballpark befitting their favorite ball club and community. In what could be best described as three seasons of purgatory in Sacramento before calling Las Vegas their home, the Athletics leave behind a cherished legacy and fan base in Oakland that deserved far more than a tone-deaf goodbye letter. While lacking in authenticity and empathy, John Fisher's words lay the foundation for what he now must build in Las Vegas while no longer hiding behind the veil of inadequacy."
North Carolina GOP focusing on 'hand-to-hand political combat' to ramp up ground game in battleground state,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/north-carolina-gop-engaging-hand-hand-political-combat-get-out-vote-battleground-state,2024-09-26T08:15:40Z,"RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republicans are taking both a data-driven and hand-to-hand approach to target key voters in the battleground state whose electoral votes are historically decided by just a small fraction of people.

Republicans won North Carolina in the past three presidential elections, but the results have consistently come down to just a couple of thousand votes, with former President Trump winning by about 4% in 2016 and 1% in 2020. The last Democrat to win the state, former President Obama in 2008, won by less than 14,000 votes.

As Republicans ramp up their get out the vote efforts this cycle, leaders at the forefront of the movement told Fox News Digital that they are focusing their resources on encouraging early voting and delivering their message to the key 1% to 2% that could swing the election for either party.

Jason Simmons, chair of the North Carolina Republican Party, told Fox News Digital that there has been an ""overwhelming"" response to their knocking on doors and grassroots activism.

""We've been very engaged with all of our grassroots activists and have a very enthusiastic response. People are fired up. As I travel from one end of the state to the next, you see our Trump captains really engaging with the voters of North Carolina, taking the message of why it's important in this year to go out more so than ever,"" Simmons told Fox. ""They're out there every day knocking [on] doors, making phone calls, talking to the voters of North Carolina about the issues that matter most.""

Republicans in the state are also using data to help turn out the vote for residents who haven't been engaged in voting in past elections.

TRUMP LEADS HARRIS IN CRUCIAL STATES GEORGIA, ARIZONA, NORTH CAROLINA, POLL FINDS

""It's really drilling down into the data and identifying those voters that we know will vote our way, especially the low- to mid-propensity voters, by getting in front of them and talking to them about those issues that matter most to them and then encouraging them to make that plan and to go vote,"" Simmons said.

After speaking with voters across the state, Simmons said the economy, inflation and the southern border are the issues of top concern among North Carolina voters.

Republicans are also investing in encouraging early voting this cycle, and according to Dallas Woodhouse, state director for a conservative training outfit, American Majority, the data reveals that more early voting would benefit the GOP in 2024.

""We have field teams out right now educating conservative voters about the importance of actually voting early, voting by mail in North Carolina, how it is safe to vote by mail. We're trying to turn around some of the trends that were difficult for conservatives in 2020 and 2022,"" Woodhouse said. ""What we know is that the earlier you get the vote in, the more efficient it is for candidates, for parties. And if you wait till the last minute, you are at risk of illness and bad weather and your cost per vote goes way out.""

Woodhouse said that by Election Day, America Majority expects to have knocked on half a million doors in the state, reached a million voters by phone and a million and a half voters through text messages.

""All you can do is go out and fight every day, go out, push the message of free markets, limited government, strong national defense, and get people out to vote what they do from theirs up to them.""

Woodhouse added that the presidential race in North Carolina is going to be ""razor-close to the end.""

""The fact is, North Carolina is razor-close. ... So, voter by voter or house by house, that's what you're into: hand-to-hand political combat to get every single voter to the polls.""

Mark Robinson, North Carolina's lieutenant governor and the Republican gubernatorial candidate, recently came under fire after CNN published a report alleging that Robinson had previously made salacious comments, such as referring to himself as a ""Black Nazi"" on pornographic websites in the late 2000s. Just days later, his campaign released a statement that staff in various senior roles had stepped down.

""It's very unfortunate, and it's disturbing, troubling, the remarks that we've seen and the allegations attributed to Mark Robinson,"" Simmons told Fox of the recent controversy. ""But ultimately, it's up to him to go and talk to the voters of North Carolina and show them that these are not his words, his values. And we'll continue to talk to the voters of North Carolina about those issues that matter most to them.""

Disney Reveals Star Wars Show 'The Acolyte' Was Over Budget At $230 Million,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2024/09/26/disney-reveals-star-wars-show-the-acolyte-was-over-budget-at-230-million/,2024-09-26T07:43:13Z,"Disney has revealed that its controversial Star Wars streaming show The Acolyte came in ""over the production budget"" with its costs hitting $230.1 million (£172.7 million) when it was only part of the way through post production.

It couldn't be much different to the outlook before shooting began in October 2022 as the previous month Disney confirmed that the eight-episode show ""was forecasted to be in line with the production budget.""

The failure to stick to its budget was the final nail in the coffin of the show which was review-bombed by detractors who complained it was woke. Its audience dwindled soon after it debuted in June this year and just over a month after it ended in July, the plans for a second season were canceled.

The Acolyte had a dramatic fall from grace following a strong debut when its first two episodes generated 4.8 million views on launch day, making it the biggest series premiere on Disney+ this year according to Deadline.

This earned it seventh place on Nielsen's Top 10 originals chart in its premiere week with 488 million minutes viewed. It climbed one spot in the second week but was booted out of the list in the third following an online backlash to the show driven by complaints about its quality and the diversity of its cast.

Set around 100 years before the events of the much-derided Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, The Acolyte sees a former Jedi apprentice reuniting with her master to investigate a series of crimes. Black and international actors dominated the show's ranks leading to it being dubbed the most inclusive live-action Star Wars project ever.

The Hunger Games' Amandla Stenberg has dual roles as the ex-student Osha and her evil twin Mae, who is trained by Qimir, a character played by Filipino-Canadian actor Manny Jacinto. British model Jodie Turner-Smith stars as the twins' mother Aniseya who also leads a coven of witches which wants to induct them. Osha escapes their clutches and goes on the hunt for Mae along with two Jedis played by Spanish actress Dafne Keen - star of this summer's smash hit Deadpool & Wolverine - and Rebecca Henderson, wife of The Acolyte's showrunner Leslye Headland.

She admitted that the show's approach to diversity was deliberate, even extending to the behaviour of the characters with Qimir being shown cooking and wearing feminine clothing despite being a villain. ""It's so wildly intentional that I don't know what to say,"" Headland told Collider.

The diversity of its line-up led to the show being branded woke which was supposedly the driving force behind its plummeting rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Just a day after it launched on June 4 its audience score stood at 50% but then even darker clouds began to gather.

Overwhelmingly-negative reviews flooded in leaving The Acolyte with a score of just 18% which is lower than the critically-panned Star Wars: The Clone Wars and the notorious 1978 Star Wars: Holiday Special.

The low score has been attributed to unjustified review bombing with the key evidence being the fact that the show's Rotten Tomatoes critics' score stands at a more respectable 78%. However, closely reading the reviews in some of the most prestigious print titles reveals serious structural problems with the show.

""Most of the pieces are uneven at best, if not simply underwhelming,"" said Rolling Stone whilst USA Today added that the show is ""full of logical fallacies, hokey dialogue and nonsensical plots."" That's a charge that can perhaps be leveled at the best movies in the Star Wars saga but the other key criticisms certainly can't.

The Times of London scored The Acolyte two out of five driven by the show's ""sombre expositional dialogue"" whilst the New York Times said that ""beneath the familiar trappings, the visceral pull that Star Wars can summon in its best moments doesn't manifest itself. Characters speak in platitudes about loss, grief, loyalty and revenge, and the cast mostly works down to the level of the dialogue.""

It was far from a dream ticket even though the show ticked the diversity box and this wasn't lost on Disney's chief executive Bob Iger. Talking about Disney's productions in general at the New York Times' DealBook Summit in November last year, Iger said that its ""creators lost sight of what their number one objective needed to be."" He added ""we have to entertain first. It's not about messages."" Clearly agitated by this, Iger didn't stop there and told CNBC in April that ""infusing messaging is not what we're up to."" Surprisingly, the messaging didn't run deep in The Acolyte.

As we revealed, despite supposedly being a showcase for diversity, just 30% of the employees working on the show on April 5, 2023 were female and, across the entire workforce, women's average hourly pay was 19.4% lower than men's. Audiences saw through the message and although The Acolyte returned to Nielsen's Top 10 after the release of the finale, it occupied the bottom slot with 335 million minutes of viewing which Deadline said was the lowest for a Star Wars series finale.

Just over a month later, Disney put the brakes on a second series which anti-woke activists saw as a success. In fact, their criticism was far from the only disturbance in the force.

Development of The Acolyte began in 2021 at the height of the battle between Disney and Netflix for the title of the world's biggest streaming platform. As Disney+ subscriber numbers surged during lockdown, the Mouse commissioned a slew of costly content to tempt more people to sign up.

It fueled $11.4 billion of losses at Disney's Direct To Consumer (DTC) division and Iger was powerless to stop it as he was sitting at home in retirement. After he was tempted back to the driving seat in November 2022 he told investors that the studio needs to ""reduce costs on everything that we make because, while we're extremely proud of what's on the screen, it's gotten to a point where it's extraordinarily expensive."" The Acolyte was no exception.

Budgets of television shows are usually a closely-guarded secret as studios tend to absorb the cost of individual programmes in their overall expenses. Ones which are filmed in the United Kingdom are exceptions and that includes The Acolyte.

Principal photography began in October 2022 at Shinfield Studios just outside London where The Acolyte was reportedly filmed in front of the same kind of LED screens that have been used to such great effect in Disney's blockbuster Star Wars series The Mandalorian as we have reported. The location shines a spotlight on the spending.

Studios film in the UK to benefit from the government's Audio-Visual Expenditure Credit (AVEC) which gives them a cash reimbursement of up to 25.5% of the money they spend in the country.

To qualify for the reimbursement, at least 10% of core production costs need to relate to activities in the UK. In order to demonstrate this to the government, studios tend to set up a separate production company in the UK for each show they make there. Each one has to file financial statements which reveal precisely how much was spent on the production. The filings show everything from the headcount and salaries to the total costs and the level of cash reimbursement.

The companies usually have code names so that they don't raise attention with fans when filing for permits to film on location. The Acolyte was made by Disney's subsidiary Blue Stockings (UK) which is believed to be a reference to the show's leading ladies as the term refers to the educated, intellectual female members of the 18th-century Blue Stockings Society from England led by the hostess and critic Elizabeth Montagu.

The latest financial statements for Blue Stockings (UK) were released on Tuesday and cover the year to September 24, 2023 which is nearly four months after filming wrapped. The Acolyte was released almost exactly a year after the end of filming so post production was still underway when the financial statements were drafted. This means that the costs could still soar in the next set of filings, especially as the show is VFX heavy with Jedi battles aplenty.

The $230.1 million spent on the show has been widely misreported with even industry outlets wrongly claiming that it cost $180 million to make. Two experts who got it right were news site That Park Place and entertainment industry pundit Valliant Renegade with the latter also noting that the show's production costs are still likely to soar.

It is music to the ears of the UK government as it benefits from studios spending in the country on everything from security and catering to prop manufacturing and visual effects. Testimony to this, The British Film Institute's latest Screen Business report found that for every $1.33 (£1) of film tax relief given to productions in 2019, it generated $11.08 (£8.30) for the UK economy.

This spending, and the tax that is paid on it, is why the UK government offers rich rewards for studios to film in the UK. In order for them to get the cash reimbursement for streaming shows they must spend at least $1.3 million (£1 million) per broadcast hour. The Acolyte had spent more than 20 times that amount before post production was even complete.

Although the show was staggeringly expensive, it is still one of the cheapest Star Wars productions made in the UK. In comparison, The Acolyte's costs are nearly three times lower than the sum spent on 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which is the most expensive movie in history as we revealed. However, remarkably, The Acolyte's spending beats it in one area.

In the year to September 24, 2023 The Acolyte employed 344 production staff without even including the freelancers who make up the majority of the crew on a shoot. Their total pay package came to $26.8 million (£20.1 million) which is more than any other Star Wars production filmed in the UK has spent on staff in any single period.

Keeping local production staff in work is another reason that the UK government gives studios such generous benefits for filming. The financial statements reveal that The Acolyte received a total of $46.5 million (£34.8 million) bringing its net spending down to $183.6 million. Although there is no doubt from the filings about how much it cost to make, it is much harder to say how much money it made.

Unlike theatrical releases, which share ticket sales between studios and exhibitors, Disney receives all of the revenue from its streaming platform. Disney+ subscribers pay a single fee which grants them access to all of its new content throughout the year making it impossible to determine how much subscription revenue is generated by each streaming show.

Regardless of the furore from fans, The Acolyte doesn't seem to have been a moneyspinner when it comes to merchandise. As our Forbes colleague Paul Tassi wrote, Disney has deleted all official Acolyte merchandise from its store, though he added that it also isn't available for certain other Star Wars streaming shows. Nevertheless, he pointed out that old links to specific items didn't just have a sold-out page, the listings were gone completely and returned error pages.

Coupled with the cancelation of the second series it caused some fans to fear that The Acolyte could be removed entirely from the Disney+ archive in order for Disney to get a tax write-off as Warner Bros. did by scrapping its largely complete Coyote vs. ACME and Batgirl movies before they hit theaters.

The fans' worries have proved to be unfounded and there is no suggestion this will happen to The Acolyte. Some went as far as to say that it isn't even possible for a studio to get a tax write-off by pulling a production from the archive of a streaming platform but that is far from correct.

A production (whether it's a movie or a streaming show) is listed as an asset on the financial statements of a studio. Before it is released, its value is typically based on its production cost whereas once it debuts, its box office forecast and takings can be used to calculate this figure.

If a movie is scrapped once it is complete, its value on the studio's balance sheet is reduced to zero because it can't generate any revenue. In financial parlance, this is what is known as a write-down and the studio gets an impairment charge equivalent to it. The impairment charge reduces the studio's tax bill in acknowledgement of the fact that it spent money on an asset which was not commercially viable.

Similarly, if a show is complete and sitting on a streamer, it too is an asset to the studio. The studio ascribes a value to it based on the subscriptions or advertising it could generate so if it is pulled from the platform, its value is written down and there is a tax-efficient impairment charge.

This is precisely what happened in May last year when more than 50 titles were removed from Disney+ and Hulu including series such as Willow, The Mysterious Benedict Society and Dollface.

The impact was seen in Disney's third quarter filings which revealed that ""in the current quarter, the company recorded charges of $2,440 million related to the removal of content from our DTC services."" It added that ""due to the significance of this charge on pre-tax income, our reported effective tax rate for the current quarter is negative 14.2%. Excluding the impact of this charge, the effective income tax rate on continuing operations would have been approximately 25.5%.""

It gave Disney a tax bill of just $19 million, down from $617 million in the same period the previous year. Now that is a force to be reckoned with."

66 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS YET TO DO A FORMAL PRESS CONFERNECE SINCE EMERGING AS THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

JESSE WATTERS: ...Kamala heard that and said, what are you doing Wednesday? Stephanie Ruhle is a business analyst on NBC. She's a Trump hater. And the interview focused on the economy, something Kamala can't talk about. Because if she said what her plan was, she'd lose in a landslide.

Kamala was just asked about her policies. She rambled and then said, the American dream is gone. She's been in power for four years and said the American dream is gone. She just sank her campaign. But that was just the beginning.

They just asked her what her trade plan was, she never answered and then said Trump doesn't have one.

Trump's not serious about trade? He's deadly serious. He won a trade war with China. Passed the new NAFTA deal, signed new trade deals with South Korea and Japan. He used tariffs to bring countries to the negotiating table. And we had a great economy with no inflation. I don't know if Kamala Harris knows this, but the Biden-Harris administration kept Trump's tariffs on China."
John Leguizamo says Trump is gaining support among religious Latinos because they're 'homophobic',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/john-leguizamo-says-trump-gaining-support-among-religious-latinos-because-theyre-homophobic,2024-09-26T01:45:53Z,"Small business owners Shana Gray, Ryan Sprankle and Rafael Arroyo share the impact inflation has had on their companies and weigh VP Harris and former President Trump's economic policies.

Actor and comedian John Leguizamo said that religious Latinos who support former President Trump were ""homophobic.""

During an interview with TMZ, Leguizamo was asked about Vice President Kamala Harris polling lower with Latino voters than President Biden had when he was the 2024 presidential nominee. The ""John Wick"" and ""Encanto"" actor said Harris needed to be more ""aggressive"" and ""court"" Latinos, suggesting the VP needed a big-name celebrity to endorse her and encourage younger people in this demographic to vote.

When asked about Latinos in the Sun Belt trending toward Trump, Leguizamo suggested Harris would have a difficult time winning over religious Latinos due to their views on abortion and LGBTQ issues.

""Latino people are not a monolith,"" said Leguizamo. ""No group is, right? So, religious Latinos, they are anti-abortion and homophobic,"" he said, adding that these voters might be swayed on jobs and housing instead.

CNN DATA GURU SAYS HARRIS IS 'STRUGGLING AMONG VOTERS OF COLOR' IN THE SUN BELT: 'REALLY INTERESTING'

""You might get them, because the thing Latinos care most about is jobs and housing,"" he continued.

""So if you're talking about start[ing] businesses, Latino women are No. 1 start-up businesses in America. And we Latinos poll very large [sic] on keeping the housing market going...and Kamala Harris brought up those points and she's gotta keep hitting those points,"" he said.

Leguizamo also suggested Latinos who support Trump on immigration don't have ""sympathy or empathy"" for those coming into America seeking asylum or those who cross the border illegally.

""I think a lot of immigrants who came here are competitive with other immigrants coming in for some weird reason and have no sympathy or empathy for people looking for a better life,"" he said.

""Nobody wants to come to the border that way...you only do that if you have no other option. If you're running away from violence, starving to death,"" he continued. ""They're only coming here to work. To get a job -- no American would risk their life for a job.""

HISPANIC VOTERS IN NEVADA SAY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAKING SOME CONSIDER VOTING TRUMP

In an interview with Salon last May, the politically outspoken actor said that Latino Americans don't understand that Trump was responsible for ""damaging"" the economy.

""Because Latinos, they're blaming him [Biden] for the economy, which they shouldn't be because COVID was the culprit and Trump not handling COVID was the culprit in damaging our economy,"" he told the outlet.

Leguizamo also compared Latinos who support Trump to roaches supporting insecticide.

""Latin people for Republicans are like roaches for Raid. Let's just get real,"" Leguizamo said on an episode of ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" in October of 2020. ""I think there's a level of self-hate or just lack of care for the rest of your Latin brothers and sisters who are in cages, who are being demonized by this president.""

Hispanic voters give Trump a 42% to 37% advantage over Harris regarding immigration policy, Reuters/Ipsos polling from late August shows. These voters also prefer Trump's platform on the economy by 45% to 36%, but they give Harris a double-digit advantage on the issues of health care and climate change, according to the poll.

This is a full transcript of the exclusive interview of Vice President Kamala Harris by MSNBC's ""11th Hour"" host Stephanie Ruhle. It has been lightly edited for clarity.

RUHLE: Madam Vice President, you just laid out your economic vision for the future.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: But, still, there are lots of Americans who don't see themselves in your plans. For those who say, these policies aren't for me, what do you say to them?

HARRIS: Well, if you are hardworking, if you have the dreams and the ambitions and the aspirations of what I believe you do, you're in my plan.

I have to tell you, I really love and am so energized by what I know to be the spirit and character of the American people. We have ambition. We have aspirations. We have dreams. We can see what's possible. We have an incredible work ethic.

But not everyone has the access to the opportunities that allow them to achieve those things. But we don't lack for those things. But not everyone gets handed stuff on a silver platter. And so my vision for the economy -- I call it an opportunity economy -- is about making sure that all Americans, wherever they start, wherever they are, have the ability to actually achieve those dreams and those ambitions, which include, for middle-class families, just being able to know that their hard work allows them to get ahead, right?

I think we can't and we shouldn't aspire to have an economy that just allows people to get by. People want to do more than just get by. They want to get ahead. And I come from the middle class.

Look, my mother raised my sister and me. She worked hard. She saved up. By the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy our first home. And homeownership for too many people in our country now is elusive. You know, gone is the day of everyone thinking they could actually live the American dream.

So part of my vision for the economy is, let's deal with some of the everyday challenges that people face and address them with commonsense solutions, such as affordable housing.

RUHLE: Over the last four years, there have been tremendous economic wins. And you have just laid out a big plan.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: But, still, polling shows that more -- most likely voters still think Donald Trump is better to handle the economy. Why do you think that is?

HARRIS: Well, here's what I know in terms of the facts.

Donald Trump left us with the worst economy since the Great Depression, when you look at, for example, the employment numbers.

RUHLE: It was during COVID, and employment was so high because we shut down the government, we shut down the country.

HARRIS: Even before the pandemic, he lost manufacturing jobs, by most people's estimates, at least 200,000. He lost manufacturing plants. Ask the autoworkers how he lost auto plants.

We have grown over 20 new auto plants. He has an agenda. Let's just deal with it right now going forward, not to mention what happened in the past.

He has an agenda that would include making it more difficult for workers to earn overtime, an agenda that would include cutting off access to small business loans for small businesses, an agenda that includes tariffs to the point that the average working person will spend 20 percent more on everyday necessities and an estimated $4,000 more a year on those everyday necessities, to the point that top economists in our country, from Nobel laureates, to people at Moody's and Goldman Sachs, have compared my plan with his and said my plan would grow the economy.

His would shrink the economy. Some of them have actually assessed that his plan would increase inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. So, the facts remain that Donald Trump has a history of taking care of very rich people.

And I'm not mad at anybody for being rich, but they should pay their fair share -- but tax cuts for the billionaires and the top corporations in our country, and then not really paying much attention to middle-class families. My perspective on the economy is, when you grow the middle class, America's economy is stronger.

And there's empirical evidence to prove my point correct.

RUHLE: Then let me ask you about taxes, because lots of people will say, I don't like Donald Trump, but he cut my taxes. He didn't just cut corporate taxes. He cut individual taxes.

Now, that expires next year. And there's some people confused, saying, I don't know what's going to happen next year.

Under a Harris administration, at what income level should someone expect their taxes to go up? And that state and local tax deduction that's currently capped and matters to a lot of people in blue states, are you going to lift that cap?

HARRIS: So, first of all, when it relates to anybody making less than $400,000 a year, your taxes will not go up. Your taxes will not go up. And, in fact, under my plan, taxes for 100 million Americans will actually be cut, including $6,000 a year for young couples for the first year of their child's life in a tax cut, a tax credit, essentially, by expansion of the child tax credit.

And why is that? Because during the first year of a young couple -- of a person's -- child's life, they're going to need help buying a crib, buying a car seat. And we all benefit when they're actually able to do what they naturally want, to do to take care of their child.

RUHLE: And expanding that child tax credit, or you mentioned housing before, giving that extra money for a first home, if you can't raise corporate taxes, or if GOP takes control of the Senate, where do you get the money to do that?

Do you still go forward with those plans and borrow?

HARRIS: Well, but we're going to have to raise corporate taxes. And we're going to have to raise -- we're going to have to make sure that the biggest corporations and billionaires pay their fair share.

That's just it. It's about paying their fair share. I am not mad at anyone for achieving success, but everyone should pay their fair share. And it is not right that the teachers and the firefighters that I meet every day across our country are paying a higher tax than the richest people in our country.

RUHLE: Bill Gates just said it this week. If he was in charge of taxes, he would have paid more.

But how do you find that line to make sure corporations are paying their fair share, but they're not leaving our country?

HARRIS: Well, listen, I work with a lot of CEOs. I have spent a lot of time with CEOs.

And I'm going to tell you that the business leaders who are actually part of the engine of America's economy agree that people should pay their fair share. They also agree that, when we look at a plan such as mine, that is about investing in the middle class, investing in new industries, investing in bringing down costs, investing in entrepreneurs like small businesses, that the overall economy is stronger and everyone benefits.

Part of my plan for the economy is investing in new industries in a way that we have active partnership with the private sector. I have worked with the private sector my entire career. I -- even as vice president, working with some of the biggest banks and biggest tech companies to increase by billions of dollars the money going into community banks to increase access to capital for small businesses.

Why do those biggest corporations and CEOs do that? Because they know those kinds of investments, like in our small businesses, in start-ups and entrepreneurs, actually strengthens America's economy overall, and everyone benefits.

So this is not about bilking anybody, but it is certainly about saying, let's make sure that we create opportunities for everyone to grow wealth. I believe that it is not sufficient and it should not be our goal to just make sure everyone is working. That should be the baseline. That should be a given.

And let's create an economy where people have the ability to buy a home, to start a business, to take a nice vacation from time to time, right?

RUHLE: For people who want to buy a home, yes, getting a $25,000 kicker would be great, but it's not just affording a home. We don't have enough in this country.

HARRIS: You're absolutely right.

RUHLE: And one of the main problems are regulations and rules, strict, strict rules at a local level.

How does the federal government cut through all that red tape and get down to, I don't know, the suburbs of Pittsburgh and say, we're going to have to build some affordable housing here? How do you connect the two?

HARRIS: So, you're absolutely right.

So, across our country, people rightly are concerned about the cost of housing. So it's homeownership, to your point. We need more supply. That is, without any question, part of the solution.

Creating more supply under my plan includes creating tax incentives to work with the private sector and homebuilders. Part of my goal and the plan would be to create three million new housing units for rent and for ownership by the end of my first term. It includes also what we must do to cut red tape. You're absolutely right.

It takes far too long and there's too much bureaucracy associated with homebuilding. And I say that as a devout public servant. I know that we have to reduce the red tape and speed up what we need to do around building. And that is going to require working from the federal level with state and local governments.

And it's going to be different in different places, depending on the needs of that community, the needs of that local government, that municipality, but working in consultation and coordination and also around incentives that we can create.

For example, some of the work is going to be through what we do in terms of giving benefits and assistance to state and local governments around transit dollars, and looking holistically at the connection between that and housing, and looking holistically at the incentives we in the federal government can create for local and state governments to actually engage in planning in a holistic manner that includes prioritizing affordable housing for working people.

RUHLE: Then let me ask you a business that matters a lot to this town...

RUHLE: Right? When you think Pennsylvania, when you think Pittsburgh, you have got the Liberty Bell in Philly and you have got U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh.

RUHLE: You are opposed to this idea. Many people are. But if the deal doesn't go through, they have said people could lose jobs. They could close mills. They could leave the state of Pennsylvania.

I mean, that is like moving the Liberty Bell to Newark. So which is more important?

HARRIS: It's most important that we maintain America's ability to have American manufacturing of steel by American workers, for a number of reasons, which includes, again, back to the point of growing our economy and how I think about the economy overall, investing in new industries.

There is not a new industry that I can imagine that is not going to require steel as a -- manufacturing of steel as a fundamental part of what it accomplishes. And having American workers in an American company manufacturing that steel for those new industries is going to be critically important, not only in terms of our economy, but also in the context of national security.

Most people now realize, if we didn't before the pandemic and the strain on supply chains and an over-reliance on foreign manufacturing, that we have to be intentional about U.S.-based manufacturing. And of the products that we have to prioritize, steel is one of them. And that's always going to be my priority.

RUHLE: Steelworkers matter in this country. Unions matter.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: In 2016, Donald Trump connected with unions. He saw them. He -- there was an emotional connection. But what he didn't do was deliver policy.

In the last four years, we have seen huge wins in this country for unions, but not all unions have gotten behind you. I want to understand. When the Teamsters decided not to endorse you, what was their reasoning? What are they looking for?

HARRIS: Well, let me go back to our just previous conversation. I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the steelworkers and almost every other major union in America, because I stand by workers and I stand by the importance of being able to join a union and to understand the benefit and the value of unions.

And I understand the importance of investing in new industries and working actively with the private sector to grow our economy.

RUHLE: But I'm asking, because there's this idea, we want something more from her. What is it?

HARRIS: Well, here's the thing that -- back to your point about previous election cycles.

Donald Trump made a whole lot of promises that he did not meet and, one would argue, broke. Look at Lordstown. He said he was going to...

And what happened? It shut down. Outsourcing under Donald Trump. His policies that are about putting tens to hundreds of percent tariffs.

So, part of the challenge -- and I don't disagree that it's a challenge, got to earn the vote of everybody -- is reminding people of fact, regardless of what somebody says in a small rally somewhere. And I think that's really important. And that's part of what I'm doing in this campaign, is to remind people, just like here in Pittsburgh, of the reality of who has stood with union labor, who stands for American manufacturing, who stands for American jobs.

RUHLE: Can I ask you about tariffs?

Because you just mentioned it. It's not just with one company. Donald Trump's sort of big idea is this broad-based tariffs across the board. You and many others have said that would be, not only disastrous, but it would be a direct tax on the American consumer.

HARRIS: It would be a sales tax on the American people that -- the independent economists have already measured this by his -- the sales tax of doing a 20 percent tariffs on all imports that he has described, would be a 20 percent sales tax, in essence, on basic necessities for the average American worker, average American family, totaling almost $4,000 a year.

That is no small matter. Here in Pittsburgh, when I'm talking to a group of folks who work here, who live here, and when they hear it might be $4,000 more a year for them, look, people can't afford that.

RUHLE: But tariffs aren't unique to President Trump. President Biden has tariffs in place. He's actually looking to potentially implement more. Where do you come out on, is there a good tariff, a bad tariff?

HARRIS: Well, part of it is, you don't just throw around the idea of just tariffs across the board. And that's part of the problem with Donald Trump.

I -- frankly, I'm going to -- and I say this in all sincerity. He's just not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues. And one must be serious and have a plan, and a real plan, that's not just about some talking point ending in an exclamation at a political rally, but actually putting the thought into, what will be the return on the investment, what will be the economic impact on everyday people?

And when you look at my plans, you will see what those benefits will be, $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers. You know what that means? Then you're creating the ability of that working person to build intergenerational wealth.

Doing the work of a $6,000 child tax credit, doing the work of a $50,000 tax deduction for first-time small businesses, start-ups, because, right now...

RUHLE: That's a real plan.

HARRIS: It's a real plan, because, right now -- and, again, it's about paying attention to the detail and being serious about it.

I'm serious about my enthusiasm and my -- for small businesses and my belief in what they will do as part of America's economic engine. On Friday...

HARRIS: And also looking at the fact that, right now, the tax deduction is $5,000. Nobody in this Year of our Lord 2024 can start a small business with $5,000. Very few can.

So, extending it to $50,000, tax deduction for start-ups, to generate the innovation and the ambition of the ideas that are present and among us, but need the fuel to be able to actually achieve the goal.

RUHLE: His plan is not serious when you lay it out like that, but a serious problem over the last few years has been inflation. Luckily, it's cooling, but prices are still high.

RUHLE: You have said you want to take this on by going after those who engage in price gouging.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: But as somebody who supports free markets, who's a capitalist, how do you go after price gouging without implementing price controls?

Because, once we get in this zone, people start to get worried and they say, I don't know what she stands for.

HARRIS: So, just to be very frank, I am never going to apologize for going after companies and corporations that take advantage of the desperation of the American people.

And, as attorney general, I saw this happen. In the midst of an emergency, whether it be an extreme weather event or even the pandemic, we saw it, where those few companies, not the majority, not most, but those few companies that would take advantage of the desperation of people and jack up prices.

Yes, I'm going to go after them. Yes, I'm going to go after them. And that is part of a much more comprehensive plan on what we can do to bring down the cost of living, including housing, including the everyday needs of the American people.

RUHLE: On Friday, you are going to the border.

Immigration is complicated. One of the issues is an economic one. And no one is eating cats and dogs in Springfield, Ohio. And I'm glad not to be talking about that. But there are people there that are stressed, that feel that they're at capacity. Communities around the country that have legal immigration, many have said, we're at capacity.

And many feel like the government has said to them, well, adapt, sit down, be quiet, this is how it is.

What would a Harris administration do for those communities who've taken in many, many legal immigrants, but are at capacity?

HARRIS: Well, first of all, we do have a broken immigration system. And it needs to be fixed.

And if we take a step back, months ago, some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress came together with others, proposed a border security bill that would have put 1,500 new border agents on the border to help those hardworking border agents who are there right now working around the clock, would have put more money into stemming the flow of fentanyl, which is killing Americans around our country and devastating communities, would have put more resources into our ability to prosecute transnational criminal organizations, which, in my career, I have prosecuted.

Donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on, and told them to kill the bill, don't put it up for a vote. He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution, because he wants to run on a problem, instead of fixing a problem.

And that's part of what needs to be addressed. And my pledge is that, when elected president, if the American people will have me, I will bring that bill back and I will sign it into law. And we need a comprehensive plan that includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border, but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship.

RUHLE: And I want to just ask you about a little job and a big job.

RUHLE: Because your opponent almost every day seems to be talking about this. So I just want to ask you, yes or no...

(CROSSTALK)

RUHLE: ... at any point in your life, have you served two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun...

HARRIS: And -- but it was not a small job. Like, I did fries.

HARRIS: But, to your point, if you don't mind, before you get to the big job...

RUHLE: Please.

HARRIS: ... it's a -- there's a -- part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald's is because there are people who work at McDonald's in our country who are trying to raise a family -- I worked there as a student, I was a kid -- who work there trying to raise families and pay rent on that.

And I think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs of the American people and what our responsibility then is to meet those needs.

RUHLE: But the economy is an unpredictable beast. And you are running for a job that takes extraordinary instinct and guts.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: When's the last time you had to make a gut decision? This here is very prescribed. It's very controlled.

HARRIS: Yes.

Probably the biggest gut decision I have made most recently is to choose my running mate, yes. There were lots of good, incredible candidates. And, ultimately, that came down to a gut decision.

RUHLE: I know I'm out of time, but then I just want to ask you a question from my gut.

HARRIS: OK.

RUHLE: Because, today, we're talking about reproductive -- excuse me -- we're talking about the economy.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: And people don't think often about reproductive rights being an economic issue. But it is, a woman's ability to plan her future, her education, her life.

Today, and in the last few days, Donald Trump keeps talking about it and how, in overturning Roe v. Wade, he helped women, he protected women. He says, they're miserable today. They're poorer today. They're more vulnerable today. He said he will be the protector of women if elected.

Can you respond to that?

HARRIS: So, Donald Trump is also the person who said women should be punished for exercising a decision that they rightly should be able to make about their own body and their future.

So, I think we would all agree that, as a result of that perspective that he has about women, he also then chose three members of the United States Supreme Court who did as he intended, undid the protections of Roe v. Wade.

And now in, state after state, you see laws being passed that do punish women, laws that -- I mean, most recently, a heartbreaking story resulted in a young woman dying, a mother of a 6-year-old, heart-wrenching stories. And that's for the listener, much less their family.

So, look, I think the thing about Donald Trump is that I don't think the women of America need him to say he's going to protect them. The women of America need him to trust them.

I am not perfect, but I will tell you, I'm always going to put the needs of the people first.

RUHLE: Madam Vice President, thank you for your time today."
"Harris calls for Americans to 'move past the failed policies' in November, draws mockery",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-calls-americans-move-past-failed-policies-november-draws-mockery,2024-09-26T00:10:35Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris takes aim at former President Trump as she tries to narrow the gap on the economy, Americans' top issue.

Vice President Kamala Harris faced ridicule on social media after she called for Americans to move on from the ""failed policies"" that ""we have proven don't work,"" in an address on the economy on Wednesday.

During a policy speech at The Economic Club of Pittsburgh, Harris emphasized her ""middle-class upbringing"" and pledged to ""build a strong middle-class,"" with proposals she's rolled out in recent weeks like increasing the tax break for new small businesses and giving a $25,000 credit to first-time homebuyers.

""When the middle class is strong. America is strong. And we can build a stronger middle class,"" Harris said. ""The American economy-- is the most powerful force for innovation and wealth creation in human history. We just need to move past the failed policies that we have proven don't work. And like generations before us, let us be inspired by what is possible,"" Harris said.

Harris' comments about ""moving past"" failed policies drew jokes from conservative political commentators on social media, who found her statement ironic since she's the incumbent vice-president.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTIONS ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""Acceptance is the first step,"" Former 2020 Trump campaign advisor and Fox News contributor Steve Cortes joked.

""Who wants to tell her?"" Redstate columnist Buzz Patterson quipped.

""Kamala Harris says we need to move past the failed policies that don't work. She's telling to to vote for Trump. Listen to her,"" Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon wrote.

""New Trump ad just dropped!"" conservative commentator LibsofTikTok posted.

""You're right,"" Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, also wrote in response. ""The American people are sick and tired of the Harris-Biden Administration's failed policies. November can't come soon enough!""

""Quite the optics today as Harris is out saying we need to move past failed policies while the old man is on The View saying he delegated everything to her in his administration,"" posted Versus media podcast host Stephen L. Miller.

During her speech, Harris also called her 2024 opponent, ""one of the biggest losers ever,"" a phrase President Biden said about Trump while on ""The View"" earlier in the day.

Harris trails Trump with voters on key issues like the economy and inflation, according to polls. In recent weeks, she has made the economy a focus in her public remarks as she tries to narrow the gap between herself and Trump on Americans' top concern."
Opinion | 5 takeaways from Kamala Harris' first solo interview as the Democratic nominee,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/5-takeaways-kamala-harris-msnbc-interview-stephanie-ruhle-rcna172740,2024-09-25T23:49:19Z,"The vice president made a convincing case for why voters should trust her more than Donald Trump to care more about their economic worries.

MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris following the Democratic presidential nominee's speech at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where she laid out an economic vision for her administration if elected.

If there was an overarching theme to the interview, it was the disconnect between the two parties' records on the economy, the public's perception of those records and the irony that some middle-class people -- including some union members -- believe former President Donald Trump has a greater understanding of their struggles than the vice president.

Here are five takeaways from this exclusive interview, her first solo sit-down since she became the Democratic nominee.

Ruhle pointed out during the interview that ""most likely voters still think Donald Trump is better to handle the economy."" But Harris articulated how she comes from a background that's far more relatable to the struggles of most Americans.

""Part of the reason I even talk about working at McDonald's is that there are people who work at McDonald's in our country there who are trying to raise a family. I worked there as a student. I was a kid who worked there."" Harris added that some families are ""trying to raise families and pay rent"" based on that income. ""I think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs of the American people and what our responsibility is to meet those needs.""

As Helaine Olen noted in an MSNBC column in April, after California's $20-an-hour minimum wage for fast-food workers became law, the era of mostly teenagers working fast-food jobs after high school was rendered obsolete, and ""well over half of California's fast-food workers are people of color and over 25.""

In an interview in which Harris often stuck to well-rehearsed talking points, her answer about her time at McDonald's came off as the most genuine, and it was the best evidence that she sees struggling people not as abstractions but as real human beings.

Harris won her debate against Trump by triggering him into a rambling rage after she characterized his ""big, beautiful"" rallies as small, boring affairs that have many attendees seeking the exit. It was amusing, then, to see her sandwich that same point in an answer about how she's going to keep reminding people that Trump is lying about his economic record and lying when he says he stands with workers.

Harris described the ""challenge"" she faces to ""earn the vote of everybody."" She argued that ""regardless of what somebody says in a small rally somewhere ... part of what I'm doing in this campaign is to remind people, just like here in Pittsburgh, of the reality of who has stood with union labor, who stands for American manufacturing, who stands for American jobs.""

The only two words Trump is likely to hear are ""small rally.""

When the vice president said Trump had ""left us with the worst unemploy,et rate since the Great Depression,"" Ruhle pointed out that that dramatic downturn happened during the height of the pandemic.

""Even before the pandemic, he lost manufacturing jobs,"" Harris countered. His raison d'être as president, Harris essentially argued, was to provide ""tax cuts for the billionaires and the top corporations in our country.""

When Ruhle asked Harris about the most recent time she'd made a gut decision, she answered, ""Probably the biggest gut decision I've made most recently is to choose my running mate. There were lots of good, incredible candidates, and ultimately that came down to the gut decision.""

Though Republicans tried to make hay with the preposterous claim that antisemitism made Harris (who is married to a Jewish man) pick Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, picking Walz has proven to be a smart political choice, and it demonstrated she can make wise decisions in a limited amount of time.

Trump has recently boasted that he'll be women's protector. Harris, who has made abortion rights a centerpiece of her campaign, said that's rich coming from a man who once said women who get abortions should be prosecuted and whose Supreme Court appointees helped dismantle Roe v. Wade.

But Ruhle's question about Trump's statement prompted what was perhaps Harris' best line of the interview: ""I don't think the women of America need him to say he's going to protect them. The women of America need him to trust them."""
GOP leaders rely on Dems (again) to prevent a government shutdown,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gop-leaders-rely-dems-prevent-government-shutdown-rcna172753,2024-09-25T23:31:21Z,"A couple of weeks ago, facing the possibility of a Republican-imposed government shutdown, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries shared an underappreciated point with reporters. ""Democrats are temporarily in the minority but have repeatedly governed as if we are in the majority, because we recognize that our job is to deliver for the American people,"" the New York Democrat explained.

Two weeks later, the accuracy of Jeffries' assessment rang true anew. NBC News reported:

It was just last week when the House GOP leadership tried a far-right approach to preventing a shutdown, tying spending cuts to a far-right election scheme called the SAVE Act, which would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. That bill failed in humiliating fashion, prompting House Speaker Mike Johnson to turn to a backup plan.

This week, we learned that the backup plan was, for all intents and purposes, to give up entirely.

The temporary spending bill -- called a ""continuing resolution,"" or ""CR"" -- now heads to the Democratic-led Senate, which is expected to approve it quickly.

But as the dust settles on this unnecessary drama, it's worth appreciating just how frequently House Republican leaders have been forced to rely on the Democratic minority to govern.

Five months ago, for example, Congress passed a long-sought security-aid package, but in order to advance the legislation, Johnson and his leadership team had no choice but to disregard the wishes of their far-right members and partner with the Democratic minority -- which provided more than two-thirds of the votes needed to pass the bill.

This was not an isolated incident. Ten days earlier, the House reauthorized the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and it was the Democratic minority that provided a majority of the votes. A few weeks before that, the House passed a bill to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year and Democrats provided nearly two-thirds of the votes.

A month before that, House Republican leaders endorsed a stopgap spending measure and relied on Democrats to pass it. A month earlier, the House considered a bipartisan compromise on tax policy, which was endorsed by the House GOP leadership. It was nevertheless Democrats who provided most of the votes to pass it.

Two weeks earlier, a bill to prevent a partial government shutdown cleared the House, but roughly two-thirds of those votes came from the House Democratic minority.

The circumstances have become a staple of the current Congress. A year ago this week, to prevent a government shutdown, it was Democrats who provided most of the votes on a must-pass bill. Two months later, again to prevent a government shutdown, Republicans also relied on Democratic votes.

During the mid-November debate on that bill, Democratic Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois joked during floor remarks, ""Next week, Americans will gather around their dinner tables and share what they're thankful for. I hope my Republican colleagues will use that moment to reflect on how lucky you are to work with us House Democrats.""

A month later, when the House needed to pass the National Defense Authorization Act, Democrats again provided a majority of the votes.

And when Republicans threatened to crash the economy on purpose by leveraging the debt ceiling, it was -- you guessed it -- Democrats who cast most of the votes to pass the bipartisan solution.

As 2023 came to an end, Axios highlighted the underappreciated pattern: ""Republicans may hold the House majority, but Democratic yeas outnumbered GOP votes on every major bill that landed on President Biden's desk this year.""

In 2024, the pattern remains unchanged. A Washington Post report summarized in the spring, ""If it wasn't obvious before, it's obvious now. The House's governing coalition has been cemented. It consists of nearly every Democrat and about half of Republicans. The pattern was reinforced this weekend with a vote to pass Ukraine aid, but it has played out over and over again this Congress with the passage of major pieces of legislation.""

When Republican John Boehner was the House speaker, he too found himself dependent on Democrats when his far-right members didn't want to govern. During Paul Ryan's tenure, it happened some more. When Kevin McCarthy did the same thing, it contributed to the intraparty revolt that cost him his gavel.

And now, here we are, watching Speaker Johnson do the same thing, reinforcing the fact that one of the major parties on Capitol Hill is focused on constructive policymaking, and it's clearly not the GOP."
5 Ways Blockchain Can Power Kamala Harris's Opportunity Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2024/09/25/5-ways-blockchain-can-power-kamala-harriss-opportunity-economy/,2024-09-25T23:15:04Z,"In a speech at The Economic Club of Pittsburgh on Sept. 25, 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris outlined her vision for an ""Opportunity Economy"" -- a strategy focused on strengthening the middle class, fostering innovation, and ensuring America's leadership in key industries like clean energy and emerging technologies. Harris emphasized creating jobs, lowering costs for middle-class families, and investing in innovation as central pillars of her plan.

As a legal, policy and economic justice expert in digital assets and blockchain, I see a tremendous opportunity for this technology to drive real, meaningful change. Blockchain's ability to foster transparency, decentralization, and trust without intermediaries can redefine industries, expand access to financial services, and create a more equitable economy. Below, I highlight five key areas where blockchain can accelerate Harris's Opportunity Economy, positioning America as a leader in the digital future. These opportunities are not just theoretical; they represent real pathways to innovation and inclusive growth.

1. Empowering Middle-Class Financial Inclusion Through DeFi

One of Harris's primary goals is to lower costs for middle-class families, particularly in housing, childcare, and eldercare. Blockchain's decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions can be a powerful tool in this effort. DeFi platforms allow users to access lending, borrowing, and saving services without relying on traditional banks, which often charge high fees and impose barriers to entry.

For example, blockchain-based mortgage platforms could streamline the home-buying process, reducing costs and time. Additionally, tokenized real estate allows families to invest in fractional homeownership, helping them get a foot in the door without needing a large down payment. Harris's vision of wealth-building for middle-class families aligns perfectly with the democratizing potential of DeFi, offering accessible financial products that reduce reliance on intermediaries and promote financial inclusion.

2. Revitalizing Small Businesses with Blockchain-Based Capital Access

Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy, and Harris's plan to increase access to capital is critical for their growth. However, many entrepreneurs struggle to secure funding from traditional financial institutions. Blockchain can provide new avenues for raising capital, such as tokenization, smart contracts, and decentralized crowdfunding.

Tokenization allows businesses to issue digital tokens representing ownership or future revenue, offering flexibility in securing funding without the need for traditional lenders. Smart contracts further streamline loan agreements, reducing administrative costs and delays by executing automatically when predefined conditions are met. By integrating blockchain into small business funding models, Harris's administration could fuel innovation and growth in communities across the nation, helping to reach the ambitious goal of 25 million new small business applications by the end of her first term.

3. Leading the World in Clean Energy Innovation

Harris pledged to make the U.S. a global leader in clean energy, and blockchain technology can significantly support this mission. Contrary to popular belief, blockchain technology can facilitate transparent and efficient energy markets by enabling decentralized grids, tracking carbon credits, and supporting peer-to-peer energy trading. These innovations align with Harris's goals of investing in clean energy technologies like advanced batteries and sustainable energy infrastructure.

Blockchain can also improve transparency in energy production and consumption by providing immutable records of energy transactions. This ensures accountability and compliance with environmental regulations, while enhancing trust among stakeholders. Additionally, its decentralized nature can reduce reliance on traditional intermediaries, streamlining processes and increasing efficiency, which further strengthens U.S. competitiveness in the global clean energy market.

4. Democratizing Workforce Development with Blockchain Certifications

In her speech, Harris highlighted the importance of skills-based hiring over traditional degree requirements and committed to doubling the number of registered apprenticeships. Blockchain can help accelerate this shift by providing a secure, verifiable method for issuing digital credentials and certifications.

Blockchain-based credentials offer a tamper-proof way for workers to demonstrate their skills, allowing them to build a digital resume recognized across industries. This supports Harris's commitment to workforce development by creating more accessible pathways to high-paying jobs in fields like AI, blockchain, and clean energy. Additionally, as Harris moves to eliminate degree requirements for federal jobs, blockchain could ensure merit-based hiring and provide transparency in the hiring process.

5. Boosting Affordable Housing Through Tokenization

Affordable housing is a key pillar of Harris's Opportunity Economy, and blockchain can help achieve this goal by making real estate more accessible. Tokenizing real estate assets allows for fractional ownership, lowering the barrier to entry for first-time homebuyers.

Blockchain can also streamline housing transactions by eliminating intermediaries, reducing costs, and speeding up processes. For renters, blockchain-based smart contracts can automate rent payments and enforce lease agreements, making the rental process more efficient and secure. By integrating blockchain into housing initiatives, Harris's administration could drive down costs, make homeownership more accessible, and help families build intergenerational wealth.

Despite the clear opportunities blockchain presents, many people remain hesitant to engage due to persistent myths that fuel what I call the fear of getting in (FOGI). Common misconceptions -- like the belief that crypto is too complicated, only used by criminals, or isn't regulated -- deter potential investors and innovators.

The reality is that cryptocurrencies have become far more user-friendly, with platforms designed for ease of use. Additionally, blockchain's transparency makes it harder for illicit activity to go unnoticed, and regulatory frameworks, such as crypto-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), are creating safer avenues for investment. Concerns about the environmental impact are also being addressed as newer cryptocurrencies adopt energy-efficient models and bitcoin mining increasingly incorporates renewable energy.

By debunking these myths, more individuals and businesses can confidently explore the opportunities that blockchain and digital assets offer -- especially in sectors where Harris's Opportunity Economy is focused on fostering growth and innovation.

Harris's vision of an Opportunity Economy is built on fairness, opportunity, and innovation. Blockchain and digital assets are uniquely positioned to support this vision by democratizing access to financial services, revitalizing small businesses, advancing clean energy, fostering workforce development, and expanding affordable housing.

As Harris continues to outline her economic agenda, it's essential to recognize the transformative potential of blockchain in shaping the future of American industry and economic growth. By embracing blockchain and digital assets, we can ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in innovation while empowering the middle class and fostering economic opportunity for all."
Harris calls Trump 'one of the biggest losers ever' during economy speech in key battleground,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-claims-trump-one-biggest-losers-ever-economy-speech,2024-09-25T23:01:27Z,"PITTSBURGH -- Vice President Harris pledged to lower child care and elder care costs as part of her push to help middle-class Americans cope with rising prices during her highly touted economic address in which she also repeatedly took aim at her rival for the White House, former President Trump.

Speaking at the Pittsburgh Economic Club in the must-win battleground state of Pennsylvania, the Democratic Party's presidential nominee outlined the three pillars of her economic agenda: lower costs, investing in American innovation and entrepreneurship, and leading global competitors in the industries of the future.

Pointing to persistent inflation, which has dogged President Biden's administration and provided Trump with plenty of political ammunition to fire at Harris, the vice president said that despite recent economic ""positive steps ... the cost of living in America is just too high.""

But Harris also said Trump ""has no intention of lowering costs"" and that he's made it harder for small businesses to function as the backbone of the nation's economy.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

And one day after Trump in a speech in battleground Georgia vowed to create manufacturing jobs by raising tariffs on overseas rivals and lowering taxes on U.S.-based manufacturers, Harris took aim.

Harris said Trump ""makes big promises on manufacturing. Just yesterday, he went out and promised to bring back manufacturing jobs.""

She then said that during Trump's four years in the White House, ""[M]anufacturing jobs went down across our country and across our economy. All told, almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during his presidency, starting before the pandemic hit, making Trump one of the biggest losers ever on manufacturing.""

THIS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS UPPER HAND IN 2024 CASH DASH

And the vice president also blasted Trump over the nation's trade deficit with China.

""Donald Trump also talked a big game on our trade deficit with China, but it is far lower under our watch than any year of his administration while he constantly got played by China,"" she said.

And she described Trump as someone who wants to help the wealthy and big businesses, but not average Americans.

""For Donald Trump, our economy works best if it works for those who own the big skyscrapers, not those who actually build them, not those who wire them, not those who mop the floors,"" she said.

The Trump campaign, returning fire, put out a statement moments after the vice president's address ended headlined ""Kamala's Speech Full of Lies.""

Spotlighting a line from her address, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said ""Kamala Harris is right about one thing -- it's time to turn the page. She's had three and a half years to prove herself, and she has failed.""

Pointing to economic conditions the past three and a half years under President Biden's administration, Leavitt said ""personal savings are down, credit card debt is up, small business optimism is at a record-low, and people are struggling to afford homes, groceries, and gas. Every time Kamala speaks, it becomes increasingly clear that ONLY President Trump will Make America WEALTHY Again.""

WHICH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HOLDS THE EDGE ON THE ECONOMY?

Trump mockingly calls Harris ""Comrade Kamala"" and says she's a far-left socialist.

Apparently pushing back, the vice president, near the top of her speech, spotlighted that ""I'm a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets. I believe in consistent and transparent rules of the road to create a stable business environment. And I know the power of American innovation.""

Harris, in her address, detailed plans for new tax incentives that would aim to spark next-generation industries critical to the economy and national security.

And the vice president shined a spotlight on her proposals to provide first-time home buyers $25,000 to help with down payments and a $6,000 tax credit for families with newborns.

""When we lower the cost and ease the burdens people face, we will not only make it ... easier for them to meet their obligations as caregivers, we will also make it more possible for them to go to work and pursue their economic aspirations,"" she said. ""And when that happens, our economy as a whole grows stronger.""

With less than six weeks until Election Day on Nov. 5 and with early in-person voting or absentee balloting underway in nearly two dozen states, just about every poll indicates the economy remains the top issue on the minds of Americans.

And while the nation's economic recovery from the pandemic-inflicted recession continues, high prices remain a leading concern among voters.

When it comes to which presidential candidate can better handle the economy, Trump continues to have the edge, but his margin over Harris differs dramatically depending on the poll.

The former president is up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, 11 points in a CNN poll and favored by seven points in an ABC News/Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at five points in the latest Fox News poll and two points in an AP/NORC survey.

In Pennsylvania, a new Monmouth University survey indicated Trump holding a three-point edge over Harris when respondents were asked which candidate is more trusted to handle the economy.

Pennsylvania, with 19 electoral votes up for grabs, is the biggest prize among the seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 presidential election victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Harris or Trump succeeds Biden in the White House.

Hours before Harris arrived in Pittsburgh, a new public opinion poll from Muhlenberg College indicated the vice president and Trump deadlocked at 48% in the Keystone State. It was the latest survey to point to an incredibly close contest in the must-win state.

Jeff Swensen/Getty Images hide caption

Vice President Harris gave the lengthiest economic speech of her campaign on Wednesday, describing what she called a ""pragmatic"" vision that would work with the private sector to help grow opportunities for the middle class.

In Pittsburgh -- a city known for its steel industry in a state seen as key to the upcoming presidential election -- Harris talked about plans to invest in new technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain, as well as ideas to double the number of apprenticeships and reform tax laws to make it easier to create profit-sharing plans.

""I believe we shouldn't be constrained by ideology, and instead should seek practical solutions to problems, realistic assessments of what is working and what is not, applying metrics to our analysis,"" Harris said.

Harris affirmed her intention to support labor unions if she became president, but also work with the private sector and entrepreneurs.

Harris has previously laid out ideas to cut costs for housing and families and give incentives to small businesses.

On Wednesday, she said she is concerned that it takes too long to start new projects in the United States compared to China -- and would crack down on dumping, unfair subsidies and counterfeits from China.

""I will never hesitate to take swift and strong measures when China undermines the rules of the road at the expense of our workers, our communities, and our companies,"" she said.

Harris' speech was long on vision and short on details -- her campaign has said it believes voters are less interested in hearing intricate policy proposals than they are about Harris' priorities.

She listed sectors where she wants to see growth -- biomanufacturing, aerospace, AI, quantum computing, advanced batteries -- but also said that her administration would invest in ""factory towns"" and ""agricultural centers.""

Her campaign later said that Harris would propose tax credits for companies investing in those sectors. It also said she would scale up a pilot project in AI research at the National Science Foundation so that more companies could access AI tools.

Harris' campaign said her plan would cost about $100 billion and would be paid for by tax hikes on corporations that move their headquarters outside the United States and other such strategies.

With early voting starting, and only 40 days left before Election Day, both Harris and former President Donald Trump are trying to reach undecided voters in swing states. This was Harris' eighth visit to Pennsylvania since she started running for president in July. She spent a few days in Pittsburgh earlier this month while preparing for her debate against Trump.

Harris used her speech to draw a contrast with Trump, painting herself as a product of the middle class while her Republican opponent came from wealth.

""For Donald Trump, our economy works best if it works for those who own the big skyscrapers. Not those who actually build them. Not those who wire them. Not those who mop the floors,"" Harris said.

Trump was in Georgia -- another battleground state -- on Tuesday, and said if elected he would lower the tax rate for manufacturers, cut regulation, hike tariffs on imported goods, and offer federal land to manufacturers.

On Wednesday in Mint Hill, N.C., Trump said Harris' plan to raise the corporate tax rate - announced previously in her campaign - would drive manufacturing out of the country. He said she could have done more to support manufacturing and wealth creation in her role as vice president.

""She's been there for almost four years, and she didn't do it. She didn't create wealth,"" Trump said.

When it comes to the economy, most polls have shown that Trump has had an edge on Harris. But it's a smaller lead on the issue than he had over President Biden.

President Biden focused his economic policy on manufacturing, building on some of Trump's policies by using tariffs and subsidies to try to bring companies back from overseas. But those measures failed to gain traction in polls, which showed voters blamed Biden for the high cost of living."

Reading it, in my opinion, evokes some pretty great insights about where we are going with AI in these exciting times...so let's get into it!

Near the beginning, Altman talks about how our generational achievement isn't a genetic evolution, but instead, a societal change.

Reading this portion of the essay, I was struck by the contrast between previous generations and their analog achievements - and this generation and their digital ones.

""Our grandparents built and achieved great things,"" he writes. ""They contributed to the scaffolding of human progress that we all benefit from. ... AI will give people tools to solve hard problems. The story of progress will continue ...""

A bit later, he comes up with this broad description of both analog and digital computing progress that I thought was just brilliant. Here it is in all of its splendor:

""Here is one narrow way to look at human history: after thousands of years of compounding scientific discovery and technological progress, we have figured out how to melt sand, add some impurities, arrange it with astonishing precision at extraordinarily tiny scale into computer chips, run energy through it, and end up with systems capable of creating increasingly capable artificial intelligence.""

Melting sand: it's an analog pursuit, but it blazes a trail for something profoundly un-analog: the eclipsing of all physical media, in our lifetimes. That's not nothing. Far from it.

After that, he suggests that we'll have ""superintelligence in a few thousand days"" - which is a mind-bending timeline.

Midway through the essay, as Altman talks about the potential for shared prosperity. I have to admit I think a lot of readers would have some skepticism. We are this far without any real progress on a universal basic income - and automation is erasing jobs and gig economy work at a fast clip.

We are no longer able to rely on our natural skills to make us better than machines. The machines are winning. And since it's a free competitive market - there is some real potential for problems.

However, Altman's description of this prosperity is based on reasonable projections of what we can do with this technology. We won't have to do a lot of different kinds of work. The work will be done for us, just like a washer and dryer make it make it unnecessary for us to scrub each of our garments in a pool of sink water.

Then there is Altman's description of how we got to this point - ""deep learning worked.""

That's succinct, but it makes sense. We have discovered this intelligence, hidden in pulverized rock, and metal, and electricity, that has rocked our collective world. We're still scratching the surface of what this free-wheeling power is capable of. Not for nothing do the scribes of our time compare it to fire, and electricity.

As Altman puts it, ""the path to the intelligence age is paved with compute, energy, and human will.""

And, as he suggests, to get this right, humans must deliberate a good bit.

""We need to act wisely, but with conviction,"" he writes.

There's an interesting part of the essay where Altman talks about democratizing compute through building infrastructure, and giving people enough cheap and accessible resources.

You might think of this as mirroring the state of our housing market, where we need to make housing work accessible. Altman implicitly suggests that we should do the same with compute.

If we can do that, the implication is that we're going to have tremendous prosperity.

Altman suggests we'll be able to do big things, like fixing the climate, and establishing a space colony. Presumably, most of us would be happy with fixing the climate, since that existential problem often seems insurmountable.

As for the work world, where Altman acknowledges we have issues, the hope is that we act to support the value of humans, and make sure that AI raises all boats. He voices some optimism:

""People have an innate desire to create and be useful to each other,"" he writes. ""Nobody is looking back at the past, wishing they were a lamplighter.""

Let's hope that Altman is right - that we're able to re-order society so that everyone benefits from the abundant benefits of AI. If that can actually happen, we will be on our way towards something that looks to us like Utopia."
From Digital Poverty To Analog Abundance: Our Choices Matter,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/corneliawalther/2024/09/25/from-digital-poverty-to-analog-abundance-our-choices-matter/,2024-09-25T21:30:00Z,"As we buzz with excitement over AI-driven innovation, billions still face daily struggles with basic needs such as food, clean water, sanitation, and access to reliable energy. This dual reality underscores the profound global inequities -- not just in technology access, but in fundamental living conditions. While AI holds transformative potential, addressing both digital poverty and broader material deprivations must be central to any development strategy. Ultimately, the shift towards a more equitable world starts offline, with the choices we make every day.

As of 2023, an estimated 2.7 billion people remain offline, and over 3.5 billion people lack reliable electricity, according to the International Telecommunication Union. These statistics reveal the chasm between technological advancements in wealthier nations and the barriers that prevent billions from accessing the digital economy and its opportunities. Far from reaping the benefits of AI, many people are still battling hunger and preventable diseases, their lives untouched by the promises of technological progress.

While the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, adopted in 2015, aim to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030 - a goal that we are far from achieving - the reality is even more complex. Billions still live on less than $30 per day -- a figure well above the World Bank's extreme poverty line of $2.15 per day, but still insufficient for a life of dignity and opportunity.

Today one in three individuals is unable to afford a healthy diet, and one in two lacks access to basic sanitation according to the 2023 Human Development Report. These conditions persist, not because of a lack of resources, but due to systemic inequalities that impede both digital and material progress. Having enough to eat, and access to education, water, and health care is not a luxury, nor is access to electricity.

Access to electricity is a fundamental building block for digital inclusion. Without reliable power, it is impossible to establish the infrastructure needed to support digital tools and platforms, effectively disconnecting entire populations from the digital world. One example of the potential of putting promise to practice is Mission 300, a $30 billion initiative spearheaded by the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and partners like the Rockefeller Foundation, which aims to bring electricity to 300 million people in Africa by 2030.

Beyond powering homes and businesses, this type of effort may create jobs, foster educational opportunities, and lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth. It is a step to establishing the conditions of making AI accessible to those who might benefit the most, due to the possibility it opens for example to expand remote learning and telemedicine in areas where quality eduction is not accessible, and medical professionals are sparse.

While AI has the power to revolutionize industries and improve lives, its true potential lies in Prosocial AI -- AI designed with the intent to benefit individuals and society as a whole, especially in underserved communities. From AI-driven agricultural tools to 24/7 business coaching, via telemedicine to educational platforms AI with a social vocation could radically reduce the burdens of material and digital poverty. But such positive outcomes will not manifest automatically.

Natural Intelligence, and the aspirations it is embedded in, will dictate whether our expanding artificial assets will further deepen already staggering inequality or serve as a force for good. From individuals to institutions, encompassing public and private sector, nonprofits, and start-ups, each of us can contribute something to transform AI from a tool for business productivity into a treasure chest that is open to everyone and empowers rather than marginalizes.

To curate a more acute understanding of our personal and professional opportunity to address the hybrid divide, the INCLUDE framework might serve:

By adopting these principles in your daily actions and decisions, you can help shift the narrative -- from digital poverty to analog abundance -- fostering a world where technological progress benefits everyone, not just the privileged few."
October Weakness Might Provide Buying Opportunity,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/randywatts/2024/09/25/october-weakness-might-provide-buying-opportunity/,2024-09-25T20:39:37Z,"After a strong three quarters of a year, U.S. equity markets enter the final quarter with strong gains across the board. Normally, the stocks have their best performance in the November to April period. In fact, looking back, in the period from 1970 to present, the stock market averaged an above 4% return in the fourth quarter of the year. However, 2024 is an election year, and while still positive, the returns in election years have been muted with the S&P 500 returning 2% as shown in Figure 1. This is greatly below a typical year where returns average over 4% in the fourth quarter.

Figure 1: Index Averages in Q4 of Election Year

Within the fourth quarter, October tends to be the problem month with a negative return for all three of the major indexes. Typically, this is followed by a recovery in November and December once the election passes. As a whole, the Nasdaq has a tendency to lag the S&P 500 and DJIA in the fourth quarter of election years. This is shown below in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Monthly Index Averages in Q4 of Election Year

Looking at each year since 1970, the monthly performance varies as seen in the three tables below. October is negative six of 13 times on the S&P 500, eight of 13 on the DJIA, and 10 of 13 on the Nasdaq. November is negative five, six, and four times on the respective indices. December is also negative five, six, and four times on the respective indices.

Figures 3, 4, 5: Monthly Index Performance in Q4 of Election Year

In terms of sector performance during the fourth quarter of an election year, more cyclical groups tend to be favored with Transportation, Capital Equipment and Basic Materials doing best. Interestingly, the defensive sector, Utility, also does well. It appears investors enter the next term of the presidential cycle more optimistic on the economy. Conversely, Technology, which enjoys substantial outperformance in the third year of the cycle and the first half of the fourth year, tends to lag just before the election, as seen in Figure 6.

Figure 6: Sector Averages in Q4 of Election Year

Currently, the sector setup is favorable for several of the historical Q4 leaders including Capital Equipment and Utility, but less so for Energy and Transportation. These could create strong opportunities in the two latter sectors if history holds. Also, looking forward a bit further, once through October, the market moves into the much more historically favorable November through April period for performance.

Figure 7: Index Averages May-October and November-April

Into Q4 2024, the market internals are very strong, so it will be interesting to see if this October can buck its normal trend and be strong. William O'Neil + Co. studies the number of stocks breaking out each week. We define a breakout as a stock breaking above prior highs after a minimum period of five weeks of consolidation. Recent weekly breakout totals have continued to spike every few weeks, which is normally indicative of an ongoing bull market as shown in Figures 8 and 9.

Figures 8, 9: U.S. Weekly Stock Breakouts

Excluding the ever-increasing ETF effect, the breakout totals in Figure 8, excluding the Financial sector (which houses all ETFs), are also strong, although somewhat below two prior bull markets in 2020-2021 and 2017-2018. This is usually a sign that the stock market will continue to rise from its existing levels.

Themes where there is strong breadth in terms of stocks breaking out of bases recently include Homebuilders (XHB), Utilities (XLU), REITs/Real Estate (IYR), Midcap Software (SKYY), Online Retail (IBUY), Payments (IPAY), Infrastructure (PAVE), Leisure and Entertainment (PEJ), Insurance (IAK), and Emerging Markets (EEM). Below are the respective Datagraphs® with the ETF for each industry group.

Figures 10, 11, 12: Leading Themes/Groups

In conclusion, given its recent run, the U.S. stock market may be due for a pullback in October if normal election year seasonality holds. However, we will prefer to buy if this weakness occurs given the historical strength stocks experience after the election and after the Fed starts cutting rates. We discussed this last point in our August article. So, investors should be ready to increase equity exposure as we enter the best period of the year."

One Of Canada's Most Celebrated Cheesemakers Also Produces Artisanal Spirits And Wines,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hudsonlindenberger/2024/09/25/one-of-canadas-most-celebrated-cheesemakers-also-produces-artisanal-spirits-and-wines/,2024-09-25T18:59:13Z,"If you are looking for fantastic cheeses, wines, and spirits, head to the Charlevoix Region, just north of Quebec City to the Famille Migneron de Charlevoix farm.

When Madeline Dufour first decided to make a spirit out of leftover whey, a byproduct produced during cheesemaking, people doubted her ability to succeed. In fact, they thought she was wasting her time.

""My instructor at the spirits-making institute where I was training looked me straight in the eye and told me, 'Good luck with that.' He thought I would soon be back with my tail between my legs. Well, he was wrong. We knew that the journey behind our project to create a sustainable circular economy on our farm would never be simple, but my family and I are always up for a challenge when a project aligns with our philosophy. Our spirits fans have embraced our Whey Eau-de Vie, and we are very thankful for that.""

It was 1994 when Maurice Dufour and Francine Bouchard, Madeline Dufour's parents, decided to start making artisanal cheeses in the Charlevoix region northeast of Quebec City, Canada. No one was making cheese in the region, and many people questioned the couple's decision to move into the countryside to pursue such an endeavor. But they were onto something.

At that time, the area was quietly becoming known for its budding agritourism industry, which was forming around the region's numerous small farms. Situated beside the broad Saint Lawrence River in a bowl-shaped depression, the area has been home to farmers since the 17 century.

Starting with a few cows, Famille Migneron de Charlevoix began producing artisanal cheeses that soon garnered national attention. In 2002, their Migneron de Charlevoix, a semi-firm cheese, was named the Grand Champion of Canada. These days, their cheeses are much sought after and are featured on the menus of many of Canada's finest restaurants.

As Famille Migneron de Charlevoix grew, they looked for other ways to expand business while staying true to their sustainable farm-to-table ethos. One way was to dive into winemaking. Maurice Dufour planted his first grape vines in 2009 and today has over 16,000 vines growing a variety of grape types in an area known for its cold, long winters and short, stunning summers.

Marketed under the name Charlevoyou, a playful expression that roughly translates from French as 'Chalevoix residents are bad-asses,' according to Madeline Dufour, their cool-climate wines have become an integral part of their business. Certified organic by Ecocert Canada, their Charlevoyou wines showcase hand-picked grapes from their Nordic-style vineyards. Using native yeasts, their wines showcase the unique local terroir only found in the Charlevoix region.

Their lineup includes Méthode Traditionnelle, a sparkling white; Rosé of Radisson/Ste Croix; Oscéola Muscat, a light white wine; and Lambruscool, a Lambrusco-style red. In addition to those bottles, they offer several seasonals, including a canned Cidre and white wine.

Due to the success of their wines and cheeses, Famille Migneron de Charlevoix decided to enter the spirits industry. Each year, they generated tons of leftover whey from their cheese factory and a fair amount of pomace (a blend of grape seeds, stalks, and stems) from their winemaking. If they could convert that waste into spirits, they would tighten their sustainability loop and generate more profits for their farm.

It quickly became a passion project for Madeline Dufour, the daughter of the farm's founders. Both she and her older brother Alex were raised on the farm and now run the enterprise. Plucky, with a never-say-never attitude, she knew that they could create something unique in a valley filled with locavore producers, including craft brewers and tomato and honey winemakers.

They built a small distillery on site in 2016, and she began to experiment in her downtime. As Madeline Dufour refined her distilling techniques, her passion for innovation grew. Her creations highlight the local ingredients found in Charlevoix and on their farm. Focusing on using the natural byproducts from their farm, they now offer a selection of distinctive spirits.

Their portfolio includes aged spirits, grappas, liqueurs, RTDs, and the aforementioned Whey Eau-de-Vie, a clear whey brandy with sweet undertones that became the brand's first product sold outside Quebec with distribution in New York. What began as a way to manage waste has turned into a line of spirits that is gaining fans. Today, Famille Migneron de Charlevoix's distillery is yet another symbol of resilience and creativity from a family that continues to surprise."
Bitcoin's Volatility Is Its Strategic Edge,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/25/bitcoins-volatility-is-its-strategic-edge/,2024-09-25T18:39:29Z,"Even people who know very little about bitcoin know that its price fluctuates wildly. The volatility started early. From April to June 2011, the price jumped 3000% from $0.80 to $26.35. By October, it was back down to $2.50, a 90% drop. While these are some of the highest short-term fluctuations, bitcoin remains volatile. From January to March of this year, the price nearly doubled, from $39,000 to $73,000. Today it sits at $64,318. Within 24-hour periods, bitcoin still occasionally rises or drops 10%.

Some say that bitcoin's volatility is a function of its youthfulness. As bitcoin persists, the story goes, its volatility will level off. Everyone will have heard of it, know the costs and benefits, and will have made a decision about whether to use it or not. Right now bitcoin is in price discovery mode, and when the price is discovered, that will be the end of the volatility.

But there is no guarantee of this. Since the beginning of the year, the price of gold has risen 28%, from $2,000 on 14 February to $2,663 on 24 September. Gold has been around for millenia, and yet retains some degree of volatility.

So, it's not purely being new that makes an asset volatile. One obvious reason for gold's volatility is that demand fluctuates. For normal goods, when demand goes up, supply goes up too. From 2010, Apple went from producing 40 million iPhones each year to producing over 200 million in 2024. If they'd kept the supply at 40 million per year, the price would have gone up, as the 200 million people who wanted iPhones would have competed to purchase the scarce supply. The supply of new gold almost certainly cannot increase by 500% in a decade, because it resides in the ground and the process for getting it out won't allow for such increases in discovery or extraction. So, when demand for gold increases, so does the price.

Bitcoin is even more resistant to large increases in supply than gold is. New bitcoin is produced by the process of mining, where specialized computing hardware attempts to solve a math problem by trial and error. The answer can be verified with one calculation, but there's no way of working out whether a value is an answer other than trying it. The reward for providing a correct answer is new bitcoin.

Like gold, the value of bitcoin fluctuates. Like gold, when the value of bitcoin goes up, it makes sense to dedicate more resources to mining. But like gold, the Bitcoin network resists linear correlation between an increase in resources expended in mining and an increase in production. In the case of gold, this is due to the physical limitations of mining. In the case of Bitcoin, it's due to the code - in particular, the difficulty adjustment.

The Bitcoin network has an algorithm governing block production; the target is one block every ten minutes. Every 2016 blocks, the difficulty of the math problem changes. The algorithm looks at how long the previous 2016 blocks took to mine. The ideal is two weeks. If the past 2016 blocks took less than two weeks, the math problem gets harder. If they take more than two weeks, the math problem gets easier. So, when the price of bitcoin goes up, miners can turn on more machines and use more electricity and reap more rewards. But that will make the blocks come faster, and will give them at most two weeks of faster block production. After that, the difficulty will adjust and the supply schedule will resume as normal.

This fixed supply schedule means that the price of bitcoin will always fluctuate as long as demand fluctuates. And demand will fluctuate. Demand for gold fluctuates, and so the gold price fluctuates; but of course gold is much more established, and so people don't react as strongly to demand fluctuations. Even demand for government-backed currency fluctuates, based on the economy of the country. When more people want the country's exports, demand for the currency rises. When people in the country would rather hold cash than other assets, demand rises. Governments can respond to this by creating more money, and thus keeping the price of the money in terms of other currencies as well as goods and services. Bitcoin cannot.

Critics treat bitcoin's volatility as a negative. One argument is that bitcoin is too volatile to be money. That is, bitcoin can never become a common medium of exchange because it's too volatile. But this is a mistake. First, while volatility is in the negative column with respect to money, bitcoin racks up many things in the positive column - divisibility, fungibility, transportability, privacy, durability, and more. It may well be that these other features of bitcoin more than compensate for its volatility. Second, most currencies slowly lose value over time. It may be that many people prefer volatility - to the upside and downside - to an inexorable decline in value.

And bitcoin's volatility has some upside, too. Look back to the first sentence of this article. Price fluctuations are headline-grabbers. They keep the attention on bitcoin, even as it ages without changing very much at all. In many ways, bitcoin isn't interesting. It's just a protocol working as it should for a decade and a half. But 70% price drops and 500% price increases are interesting, and keep people talking about bitcoin. And each time, some people who didn't use bitcoin before are enticed into acquiring some.

Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, could have made bitcoin without price volatility, either by pegging the value of bitcoin to a government-backed currency or by implementing a mechanism for supply to respond to price. But Satoshi didn't do that, saying in a P2P forum post that ""would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of things."" Satoshi chose volatility over trusted third parties. The result is far more interesting, and, in my opinion, likely more successful."
The Next Fed Decision And The U.S. Presidential Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/09/25/the-next-fed-decision-and-the-us-presidential-election/,2024-09-25T18:39:16Z,"The Federal Reserve will issue its next policy decision on November 7, just two days after the upcoming U.S. election. Another interest rate cut is likely, and market data will be critical for the FOMC as it weighs a rate cut of either 0.25% or 0.5%. The election outcome is unlikely to impact the Fed's decision making, unless the result of the presidential election is still unknown at the time of the next policy decision. If the result is unknown, the Fed would be incentivized to announce a bigger rate cut.

As the Federal Open Market Committee weighs its interest rate decision in November, the outcome of the U.S. presidential election is unlikely to play a role in the Fed's decision - unless there is no clear winner by the time the FOMC issues its policy statement on November 7.

Make no mistake: the biggest downside risk to the U.S. economy in the near term is if Americans do not know who won the presidential election right away. An unknown U.S. presidential election outcome presents significant downside risks to equity markets and investments of all stripes. It could weigh on business investment decisions and dampen consumer spending, especially if risks of political violence become elevated against a backdrop of uncertainty.

If it is unclear who the next president will be by November 7, the Fed will need to consider the downside risks to financial markets and the economy of political uncertainty.

The last time that there was an unclear election outcome was back in 2000, which triggered a recession beginning with a contraction in Q1 2001 GDP. If there is an uncertain election result this year accompanied by the risk of protracted recounts and lawsuits, the Fed would be incentivized to cut rates by 0.5% in an attempt to counter negative business sentiment and confidence that would be engendered by uncertainty.

Current expectations are split about the potential size of a Fed rate cut on November 7. As of September 25 at 1:01 p.m. ET, the CME FedWatch tool reflected the odds of a 0.5% rate cut at 60%, while the odds of a 0.25% rate cut were at 40%. These odds have changed greatly in the past week. In fact, the likelihood of a 0.5% rate cut was only 14% on September 11.

As another potential data point, the results of my recent LinkedIn poll on this topic, conducted between Sept. 21-24, 2024, reflected the highest probability of only a 0.25% rate cut on November 7. Moreover, 26% expect no change in Fed interest rate policy. That's a big difference from the implications of the latest CME FedWatch Tool.

These data differ because the CME FedWatch Tool is quoted in real time, while surveys are performed over multiple days. Additionally, the CME FedWatch Tool is based on market data, while this survey was conducted among a wide range of LinkedIn members. Finally, this LinkedIn poll was not done with the scientific rigor of professional polling.

Despite these differences and limitations, this survey reveals the valuable caveat that not all market participants have fully priced in any specific Fed action for November 7. Moreover, if this LinkedIn poll is even somewhat directionally correct, the CME FedWatch Tool appears to be reflect some overestimation of the potential for a 0.5% rate cut.

More interest rate cuts lie ahead, with rates likely to fall on trend through at least the end of 2026, according to the Federal Open Market Committee members' September 18 projections. This is good news for interest rate sensitive industries like construction and manufacturing, and it is likely to lead to a boost in hiring across industries.

Lower interest rates are also likely to weigh on the dollar, which would provide support for exports and exporting businesses. Plus, lower interest rates are likely to present upside risks for equity markets, bond prices, oil prices, and industrial metals prices. After all, lower interest rates would reduce companies' weighted average cost of capital, likely bolstering private and public company business valuations and encouraging investments across the economy.

These are all generally positive dynamics, but risks related to the outcome of the U.S. presidential election could cast a large shadow over financial markets. It's the biggest downside risk to that outlook, which is why the Fed may make a deeper cut to keep downside risks at bay -- especially if investors don't know who the president-elect is by November 7.

What do you think the Fed policy decision will be on November 7?"
Investing With An Ownership Lens: Addressing The Wealth Gap Through Homeownership And Employee Ownership,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sorensonimpact/2024/09/25/investing-with-an-ownership-lens-addressing-the-wealth-gap-through-homeownership-and-employee-ownership/,2024-09-25T18:22:48Z,"With the wealth gap expanding from generation to generation, economic mobility is even less attainable for many people than it was for their parents. The wealthiest 10% of the U.S. population owns around 90% of all assets, while 50% have few to no assets at all. The reality for millions of Americans is that there is nothing to pass down and no financial leg-up toward attaining middle-class markers, such as a college education or homeownership.

""We have profound challenges to address economic inequality, but the corresponding piece of that is opportunities,"" shared Lafayette Square Institute Founder and Executive Director Jack Moriarty, who moderated a panel at the 2024 Sorenson Impact Summit.

Moriarty led a conversation with four leaders in homeownership and employee ownership who shared their work and ideas on how to shrink the wealth gap and create opportunities for generational wealth and economic mobility.

The conversation featured:

They discuss how their work has evolved and grown in the panel excerpts below.

David: Home prices are pretty high, and they're going up. Wages have grown at a much slower rate, and as those compound over time, there's a major gap between what's fundable from your standard 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage and the purchase price of a home. Homeownership is a key tool that can be used to combat income and economic inequality, and it was actually one of the points of the spear for enforcing things like segregation. It's one of the legacy sources of that inequality; the problem is much worse for Black and Latino home purchasers.

Low- and moderate-income borrowers have had this dynamic for many decades, but it is now starting to creep up the income scale and become a real crisis for governments, municipalities, and obviously for anyone trying to purchase a home.

Homium is an end-to-end loan origination platform and lender. We offer homeowners a second mortgage, which comes with no interest or monthly payments. Instead, it secures shared appreciation in the home's value. It's pretty straightforward: If you borrow 10% of your home's value, you repay 10% of your home's value when you choose to refinance or sell. We take that note and we securitize it into a pool, which we offer to foundations, endowments, and other types of catalytic capital here at the beginning, and we will eventually move into institutional investors looking for exposure to home equity as an asset class.

We didn't invent shared appreciation. The Deerfield Fund that Gary Community Ventures has been successful in using this model with Black homeowners in Denver, and we want to do something similar, paired with on-the-ground CDFIs, MDIs, down payment assistance programs, who want to bring a new capital solution for homeowners so that they can bridge the gap between the cost of that first mortgage and the actual purchase price of their home. We can also use this same instrument to unlock home equity for retirees or folks with fixed or lower incomes so that they can take funds out of their house without having to get additional monthly payments or sell their home and use that for key life expenses like medical bills or college, or just passing wealth to the next generation. This prevents that home from becoming a rental home. It preserves homeownership for that family, and it creates the opportunity for them to use the primary ladder that we have in this country to build family wealth.

Malini: The Essential Owners Fund was set up to help essential workers share in the value that they create. Covid laid bare an inconvenient truth for us all, which is that the essential workers who power our economy and drive value in the business are also living at a level of economic precarity that is, first and foremost, a moral failing of our society, and second of all, just bad for business. It creates a lot of disruption in our supply chains and in our health services, as we've seen. Despite robotics and AI, there are still vast portions of our economy where the frontline workforce drives enterprise value -- think produce farming, food manufacturing, and senior care. In these businesses, those essential workers are delivering the value proposition of the company.

We know from years of research that employee ownership is one of the best ways to provide economic stability and engagement at work when it's well managed. So the Essential Owners Fund was set up to finance employee-owned stakes in essential industry companies. We use debt and equity for non-controlling stakes in companies where frontline workers are deeply and measurably tied to enterprise value. We've engaged business owners, typically private, family-run companies that are very profitable and high-performing that are not looking for buyout offers. They're often looking to handle a little bit of labor disruption and retention, to reward and engage their workforce that has been with them for many years, or look at other strategic options to drive value in their enterprises. They are ready to share ownership.

We are coming in to finance those stakes, and we use impact-informed capital in particular. We use the flexibility to create very competitive terms.

Todd: Apis & Heritage Capital Partners is an impact-focused, market-facing, mission-driven investment firm that's taking capital from a very prestigious group of impact investors. With that capital, we do on the front end what looks very similar to private, 100% equity buyouts of small and medium-sized businesses across the U.S. But instead of that equity in that company going into our fund or to our investors' hands, 100% of that equity goes into the hands of workers through what's called an employee stock ownership plan, or an ESOP.

For us, the mission and vision is to address the racial wealth gap in the U.S. in a scalable, market-facing way. We get at the racial wealth gap component by focusing on investing in companies with diverse workforces. We're happy to say that with the four companies we've invested in to date, north of 85% of the 400-plus workers are workers of color, so we are definitely exceeding that threshold. ESOP was created with the same tax legislation that created the 401(k).

What's really important is the cultural change. How do you shift the mindset of your workforce from a relationship of ""I'm a worker in somebody else's company"" to ""I am now a worker-owner in my own company?"" The research shows, as do anecdotal stories from our portfolio, that when you do that, you actually start to see real business and financial value created at these companies. Statistically, only employee-owned firms that institute those cultural changes see higher growth. They're more resilient, less likely to shut down during a downturn or a recession. They have better margins, and they're overall better companies. For us and our investors, they're better, safer investments.

So, how do we go about making that mindset shift from worker to worker-owner? First, we don't do it alone. We have a partner organization called the Democracy at Work Institute. Our firm was actually incubated and birthed out of this national nonprofit to figure out how to scale this model for workers and workers-owners of color.

We have three primary ways: culturally competent and linguistically competent training and education, governance, and actual ownership. Culturally competent education that teaches them what it means to be a worker-owner, in whatever language the workforce speaks. Secondly is governance. Going in, we give a seat on the board of directors to a worker-owner, and as we exit the company, over the course of five years, we will replace our board seats with worker-owners. When we leave, workers will actually have governance control of the firm. The third piece is actual ownership. A lot of companies do engagement, a lot of companies do education, but there's no replacement for real financial ownership of a company. And through the ESOP, that's how we do it. That's how you shift that mindset.

Santhosh: I'm an asset allocator. I work for a family office and a private foundation. We've kind of taken an obsession towards the ownership lens in the last few years. It came from two points of clarity. One: We are deeply invested in economic mobility, and we started realizing that the pathway toward wealth for most Americans is not going to come from income. We're not going to earn our way into wealth-building in this country. It's going to come from assets and their balance sheet appreciating in value.

We also realized that we ourselves are a significant asset holder-half a billion dollar endowment when we started-and we've been asset holders that have been appreciating dramatically. We did the math to determine where across that capital value chain we have been sharing that wealth. There are wealth creators and value creators, whether it's employees in a company, workers in an enterprise, or potentially renters in a multifamily unit. We have all those assets in our balance sheet. Then there are owner-operators, then fund managers, and then there's us. In the last 10 years, we've shared about $100 million of wealth with fund managers. But we have shared zero wealth with value creators who are workers in these companies when it's a private-equity owned transaction or it's a multi-family affordable housing deal. That was shocking, because we're place-based and our bias here is to build wealth in our communities. How do we change that?

That to us is the obsession with ownership lens. The starting place was easy. It's these amazing folks here. The second part of ownership lens for us is that every manager we meet across any asset class, we ask them about ownership, we ask them about who's creating value and how they are sharing that value with people across the value chain. The more we ask that question, the more we think that we exert power as LPs into the institutions that haven't thought about it. I think the more they hear that conversation, the more we're going to see specs with an ownership focus.

I want to say something slightly controversial. Extractive ownership is the cardinal sin of American capitalism. We all built this, and it's based on owning bodies and owning land -- we took the land and put fences around it. That's the root of our capitalism. And that's not the controversial thing, by the way. The controversial thing is impact investing was built out of it. We as a community have built climate lens models, education, FinTech, gender lens, all of these funds. We invested in all of them. But not one single instance did we ever say that wealth needs to be distributed and equitably shared. It's just a tiny sliver. I think it's an opportunity where there's a small but really critical group of investors, Sorensen being a significant part of it, that are all starting to see the world."
Joe Scarborough: Business owners and conservatives call Trump out over tariff obsession,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/trump-tariffs-economic-plan-wall-street-journal-john-deere-rcna172685,2024-09-25T18:07:06Z,"On Tuesday in Georgia, Donald Trump delivered what was billed by his campaign as a speech on the economy. During those remarks, Trump continued to pitch tariffs as a way to lower costs for Americans. He called tariffs ""one of the most beautiful words I've ever heard"" and ""music to my ears.""

That speech came just one day after the former president threatened tariffs on John Deere, following the company's announcement that it would shift some of its U.S.-based production out of the country.

""As you know, they've announced a few days ago that they are going to move a lot of their manufacturing business to Mexico,"" Trump said on Monday in Pennsylvania. ""I am just notifying John Deere right now that if you do that, we are putting a 200% tariff on everything that you want to sell into the United States.""

Business owners, conservatives and even The Wall Street Journal editorial board have not been shy to say what they think of Trump's tariff proposal. On Tuesday, the WSJ editorial board laid out their thoughts clearly, publishing a piece titled, ""A Deere in Trump's Political Headlights."" The first sentence reads, ""Hard to believe, but Donald Trump is giving U.S. companies a reason to think Kamala Harris might be better for their business.""

Yes, you read that right. The conservative-friendly Wall Street Journal editorial board says Trump's incessant talk of tariffs is making business owners think a Harris administration would put forward economic proposals that would be friendlier toward their companies.

Trump has dumbed down his already inane economic policies, so that now it all comes down to tariffs. If you ask him about child care, he talks to you about tariffs. If you ask him about jobs, he talks about tariffs. If you ask him about the deficit, he talks about tariffs.

He says tariffs will not hurt middle-class people, that they won't be inflationary. Yes, they will. Trump can't reverse the laws of economics any more than he can reverse the laws of physics."
Cash Is Definitely Not King For Card-Carrying Swedes,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/02/02/383321605/cash-is-definitely-not-king-for-card-carrying-swedes,2024-09-25T18:02:12Z,"Nina Galata displays her smartphone equipped with a card reader to accept donations and payment for Situation Stockholm, a magazine sold by Stockholm's homeless.

Peter Fredell carries an unusual wallet. It feels a bit like leather, but the material is pale and thin. He pulls it out on a street corner in Stockholm.

""I actually made it myself,"" he says. ""It's an eel that I fished up. And I used the skin and stitched it together.""

This eelskin wallet carries personal significance -- but it does not carry cash.

Around the world, cash is fading. Electronic transactions are becoming a bigger part of the economy every year. And one of the leaders in this trend is Sweden, where more than 95 percent of transactions are digital.

Fredell is the CEO of a company called Seamless that designs payment systems for cellphones.

Back in his office, I asked him to recall the last time he needed cash.

He thought for a bit.

""My son plays ice hockey, and I had to give something to the ice hockey team, and so I gave them some cash,"" Fredell says eventually. ""But as a matter of fact, that will disappear too.""

He says the ice hockey team has just started taking cellphone payments.

I decided to see just how far this goes.

So we stuck our heads out of Fredell's office to the open-plan workspace. I asked if anyone had cash. Person after person shook his head.

Finally we found one employee with cash -- an engineer named Wilhelm Svenselius.

He said he'd needed it for a party the previous weekend. It was held at a bar that doesn't take cards, and Svenselius had had to get cash especially for the occasion. He says that happens once a month or so.

Of course, these people work for a digital payment company.

But national data show that in Sweden, they are not unusual. There are churches that pass a digital payment system with the collection plate. Some homeless people who sell newspapers on the street take digital payments.

Ruth Goodwin-Groen runs the Better than Cash Alliance, which the U.N. and major global foundations are funding as part of an effort to move the global economy away from cash toward digital transactions.

""This is a means of helping achieve many different goals,"" Goodwin-Groen says.

Electronic transactions are more transparent and more accountable, she says. They cost less, and they're more secure. It's a global trend, from the developing world to the biggest, most advanced economies.

But there are holdouts.

""For some consumers, and especially older consumers, they prefer cash and don't prefer to use cards or mobile payments,"" says Ron Shevlin, a senior analyst at the Aite Group, a financial services firm in Boston.

And people making illegal purchases on the black market will always prefer cash.

Plus, he says, digital transactions do raise security concerns.

""In some respects, the economic impact is negative because of the propensity for data breaches and fraudulent transactions,"" Shevlin says.

Back in Stockholm, Fredell is already imagining ways to make cashless transactions completely secure.

""My favorite payment actually is DNA payment. You spit in a cup next to the cashier,"" he said.

That spit system doesn't exist anywhere yet.

""But it's the absolutely safest way, right?"" Fredell says. ""Someone would have to copy your DNA.""

It's a dream -- but not one that he sees happening anytime soon."
Jobs That Will Benefit From Interest Rate Cuts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/09/25/jobs-that-will-benefit-from-interest-rate-cuts/,2024-09-25T17:52:04Z,"The Federal Reserve initiated its first interest rate reduction last week, lowering rates by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5%. As the central bank appears more assured in its ability to control inflation, the Fed is now turning its attention to bolstering employment in the United States.

During periods of low interest rates, industries that rely heavily on borrowing for growth could experience a notable surge in profitability. The reduced cost of borrowing would not only fuel growth and innovation, but could also create a ripple effect that enhances job opportunities and career advancement for American workers.

As companies capitalize on favorable financing conditions, they are more likely to invest in talent development and workforce expansion, making this an opportune time for individuals seeking to advance their careers.

Additionally, by reducing the cost of borrowing for major purchases, like homes and cars, as well as easing the burden of credit card debt, these rate cuts are poised to increase the disposable income of Americans. This extra cash in consumers' pockets is expected to stimulate spending, which in turn could boost economic growth.

As consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of U.S. gross domestic product, the potential impact of lower interest rates on the overall economy could be significant.

As economic activity surges, job creation often follows, touching multiple sectors of the economy.

Consumer spending power is likely to drive demand across various discretionary industries, including retail, hospitality and leisure. As companies in these sectors expand to meet growing consumer appetites, they are expected to create new employment opportunities.

For instance, retailers may need to hire more staff to handle increased sales volumes, while hotels and restaurants might expand their workforce to accommodate a surge in travel and dining out.

Lower interest rates typically vitalize the housing market by making mortgages more affordable, leading to increased demand for homes. Real estate agencies may need to expand their workforce to handle higher transaction volumes.

Moreoverover, lower borrowing costs make financing more accessible for developers, which can spur investments in residential and commercial construction projects.

There will be a likely surge in demand for skilled labor across various construction specialties, as well as boosting employment in related fields such as architecture, engineering and building materials manufacturing. As more construction projects become financially viable, there may be an uptick in infrastructure development and renovation work, further expanding job opportunities.

Lower interest rates can stimulate investment in high-growth sectors, making it easier for tech startups and established companies to secure funding. This influx of capital is likely to fuel a surge in hiring across various tech roles, from software development to data science and artificial intelligence.

Tech companies may also be more inclined to invest in research and development, potentially creating new product lines and services that require additional headcount.

This environment is likely to spur job creation in areas such as mortgage lending, as more consumers seek to purchase homes or refinance existing loans. Investment banking could see increased activity, with companies looking to capitalize on cheaper borrowing costs for mergers, acquisitions and expansions. Furthermore, the wealth management sector may experience growth as investors seek professional guidance to navigate the changing economic landscape.

It will be more affordable for businesses to invest in new equipment, facilities and production lines. This economic shift is likely to encourage manufacturers to expand operations and their workforce, as well as spark hiring in supply chain management, logistics and research and development.

As manufacturing becomes more cost-effective, there could be an uptick in reshoring efforts, bringing production back to domestic facilities and further expanding job opportunities."
Whither Inflation?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevendesmyter/2024/09/25/whither-inflation/,2024-09-25T17:36:59Z,"We were lucky enough to have the great David Zervos speaking to us at our MAIS conference in Oxford on Wednesday afternoon, just hours before the release of the Fed's rate decision. There are few who understand the Fed reaction function so intimately or discuss it so eloquently. David suggested that he thought 50bps was a definite possibility, expounding on the reasons that might prompt this deeper cut. Later, over dinner, as we were listening to Tom Holland discussing great historical decisions, news of the 50bps cut dropped. And my phone and those of many others at the conference, looked something like this (posted on our #marketmemes Slack channel by my colleague William J. Ross).

The markets took a little while to digest the implications of the cut - the mood was, eventually, one of optimism. It feels, though, in discussion within the firm and with analysts and investors outside it, that many things remain up in the air. Former Kansas Banking Commissioner Michelle Bowman became the first dissenting voice on a Fed decision since 2005. It was striking, not just because there has been so much focus on the dynamics and politics of the September decision, but because Jerome Powell has been so keen to promote his tenure as one of consensus and compromise.

Bowman said that she was voting for a 25bps cut because she was worried that inflation, far from tamed, was merely temporarily abated. ""I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market continued to be near estimates of full employment,"" she said in a speech to the Kentucky Bankers' Association.

One of the many fascinating things that Zervos said to our gathering of investors in Oxford was that Ben Bernanke's anatomization of Fed activity in response to the GFC laid the foundation for subsequent interventions. And the key message Bernanke drew? The Fed should have gone earlier, and bigger. So it was that when Covid hit, the central bank response was both more significant and more multi-faceted than anything we have seen before. As such, given the scale of the stimulus one understands Bowman's impulse that suggests we wait and see if inflation really has been beaten into abeyance.

Henry Neville, who chairs our Tuesday market meetings, drew our attention to several interesting charts this week. Firstly, this one, showing that while the volatility of growth readings has normalized post-Covid, inflation volatility remains elevated.

It's striking that, while growth volatility (the turquoise line) has fallen back to long run averages of around 2%, inflation volatility (dark blue line), after moderating somewhat, remains persistently elevated, indicating the potential for a stickier and more prolonged inflation than many seem to expect.

Some upstream inflationary inputs are starting to look a little ominous. Take semiconductors: one of the key elements driving optimistic prognoses of economic performance. After a Covid-related spike, semiconductors continued a long-term downward pricing trend through 2021 and 2022 before, coinciding almost exactly with the launch of Chat GPT4 in March 2023, chip pricing began to appreciate dramatically. It's clear that this major driver of economic growth is a potential inflationary stumbling block in the months and years ahead, particularly given the possible pass-through effects to be taken into account here (whereby semiconductors pricing tends to be reflected in a lagged fashion in end products). For instance, in the 21/22 inflation spike, semiconductors were one of the key bottlenecks that (indirectly) caused the run-up of used car pricing.

Bowman also mentioned the neutral policy rate or r* - the rate at which the economy operates at equilibrium between saving and investment (and thus between employment and inflation) - that was being used by the Fed as the basis for decisions was, in her view, much higher than her colleagues thought. As such, she is implicitly arguing that the economy requires higher rates in order to avoid stoking inflation. The interplay of policy rates and r* is beyond the scope of this article, but I'd strongly recommend this Bank for International Settlements - BIS paper by Gianluca Benigno et al, which looks at how r* has changed in a post-pandemic world Quo vadis, r*? The natural rate of interest after the pandemic (bis.org). The question of where r* was and what it implied was something that I chewed over regularly with my friend and former colleague Ben Funnell. Ben sent me this chart, which shows that over recent history, policy rates have consistently undershot the neutral rate.

He also sent me the chart below showing the break in the relationship between economic growth and r*, a relationship that has tracked closely since the 1960s.

Again, I'm not sure this is the place to delve too deeply into economic wonkery, but I do think we might think about the fact that so much in the new regime seems to be operating somewhat differently to how it operated before, and so cautious incrementalism might be preferable as an approach rather than yet again reaching for the policy bazookas that - at least in the near and medium term - bailed us out of the GFC and Covid."
Giving States The Tools To Decide For Themselves How To Fight Climate Change Is The Right Approach,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billfrist/2024/09/25/giving-states-the-tools-to-decide-for-themselves-how-to-fight-climate-change-is-the-right-approach/,2024-09-25T17:27:30Z,"Everyone across the country feels the effects of our changing climate, but we're not all feeling them in the same way. In Tennessee, we're seeing more heavy, sudden rain and flooding. Throughout the summer we've seen heavy rain trigger flash flooding in parts of the state, and the remnants of storm Francine just caused the latest round of flood warnings earlier in September. Out West, they aren't getting enough rain and face wildfires and drought. In August, with over a month of fire season left, wildfires already burned more land in the state of Oregon than in all of 2023.

Just as the effects of climate change differ from state to state and community to community, so will the best approaches for how we tackle these extreme weather events. That's why we can't use a one-size-fits-all approach. What I found from my twelve years serving in the United States Senate, is often what works in one state might not work in another. Additionally, not all states will have the same resources available to them. That's where the federal government comes in and plays a critical role in providing states with the funding they need to meet the urgency of crisis events - including the climate crisis we are facing today. In fact, Congress has already stepped up in a big way by passing the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Together, these two pieces of legislation will invest a historic $570 billion over the next 10 years into climate and conservation projects at the federal, state, local and tribal levels.

Money from these landmark pieces of legislation is already beginning to transform our landscapes, energy systems, economy, and communities. One of the largest IRA programs run by the Environmental Protection Agency is the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants (CPRG) program. The CPRG program provides necessary funding for states to develop and implement their own plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful air pollution.

The CPRG program is a notable example of how major federal investments in climate action can provide substantial resources for states while allowing them the flexibility to pursue solutions that meet their own specific needs. These types of partnerships between the federal government and state, local and tribal governments are essential because that's how we can test new climate solutions that can then be scaled or adopted by others. Collaboration and partnership are key to success. And at the state and local level, we can act more quickly than the federal government, which allows us to responsibly accelerate smart climate action across the country.

States used the first round of funding from the CPRG program to develop their own climate action plans. In many states, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) helped develop those plans with conservation and community concerns and needs in mind. As chair of the Global Board of The Nature Conservancy, I'm particularly proud of TNC's work with Tennessee, which developed its first ever climate action plan using CPRG funding. Tennessee's plan created goals to protect forests to preserve their ability to absorb and store carbon dioxide, expand solar energy, and improve community access to electric vehicle charging. These are all investments that make sense for Tennesseans and for the future of our state.

Then this past July, the federal government announced the second and most recent round of grants to fund projects identified in states' climate action plans. In total, the government awarded roughly $4.3 billion for states to use to reduce emissions and support communities.

I'm excited that TNC's work in Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia will be supported by $200 million from these grants through a coalition with state governments. Projects in these states will focus on natural climate solutions that have a lot of potential to reduce greenhouse gases, including improved forest management, peatland restoration and tidal wetland enhancement.

Across the country, this second round of CPRG awards covers a wide variety of state-based solutions, including investments in energy efficiency measures for buildings, transportation electrification and climate-smart agriculture. Many of the solutions that the CPRG supports are nature-based solutions that harness the power of the natural environment to adapt and build resilience to the effects of climate change. This could, for example, include investing in reforestation to store more carbon or restoring oyster reefs to function as a breakwater or to improve water quality.

These types of nature-based solutions were not in the mainstream conservation and climate policy conversations prior to the last ten years. The Nature Conservancy smartly made sizable investments to demonstrate the science behind natural and nature-based climate solutions, which laid the foundation for the policy, grants, and projects we are seeing effectively implemented around the country today.

The CPRG program and others like it are helping states jumpstart climate planning and projects in nuanced and innovative ways. States know what they need best, and through these programs the federal government is supporting their right to decide for themselves how they want to tackle extreme weather events and a changing climate. By encouraging this important partnership between the federal, state, local and tribal governments, we're ensuring that climate solutions will create the most benefit for our communities, land, and wildlife across the country."
Harris-Trump showdown: New poll indicates who has edge in most important battleground,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-trump-showdown-new-poll-indicates-who-has-edge-most-important-battleground,2024-09-25T16:32:35Z,"PITTSBURGH, PA - A new public opinion poll indicates Vice President Kamala Harris holding the edge over former President Trump in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania.

Forty-eight percent of those questioned in Monmouth University survey of registered Pennsylvania voters released on Wednesday said they are definitely or probably supporting Harris in the presidential election, with 45% saying the same thing about Trump.

And the poll, conducted Sept. 19-23, indicates Harris holding a four-point advantage over Trump among those who said they are extremely motivated to cast a ballot in the White House race.

The survey is the latest to indicate a close contest in Pennsylvania, which, with 19 electoral votes up for grabs, is the biggest prize among the seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided President Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Harris or Trump succeeds Biden in the White House.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

Pennsylvania, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, makes up the Democrats' so-called 'blue wall,' which the party reliably won for a quarter-century in presidential elections until Trump narrowly carried all three states in his 2016 White House victory. But Biden - with razor-thin margins - won back all three states four years ago.

Both Harris and Trump have repeatedly made stops this summer in Pennsylvania. And while the campaigns and their allied super PACs are pouring resources into all seven swing states, more money has been spent to run spots in Pennsylvania than any of the other battlegrounds. And both sides have dished out more dollars to reserve airtime going forward in the Keystone State than any of the other swing states, according to figures from AdImpact, a top national ad tracking firm.

The release of the poll comes a couple of hours before Harris returns to Pennsylvania - which is considered a must win state for the Democratic presidential nominee - to deliver what her campaign is billing as a major speech on the economy.

THIS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS THE UPPER HAND IN THE 2024 CASH DASH

The vice president, at her address at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, is expected to offer up the most substantial comments on the economy since replacing Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticker just over two months ago.

A senior Harris campaign official said the vice president will spotlight her ""pragmatic"" approach to the economy and will offer up ""practical, realistic solutions.""

The official added that Harris - who has been derided by Trump as ""Comrade Kamala"" - will describe herself as ""a capitalist"" who ""understands the limitations of government and has always sought to take good ideas from wherever they come and harness the power of innovation.""

Her address comes a day after the former president, in a speech in battleground Georgia, gave what was also billed a major economic speech, and vowed to lower taxes on U.S.-based manufacturers.

With less than six weeks to go until Election Day on Nov. 5 and with early in-person voting or absentee balloting underway in nearly two-dozen states, just about every poll indicates that the economy remains the top issue on the minds of Americans.

This, as nation's economic recovery from the pandemic-inflicted recession continues, but inflation remains a leading concern among voters.

WHICH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HOLDS THE EDGE ON THE ECONOMY?

When it comes to which presidential candidate can better handle the economy, Trump continues to have the edge - but his margins over Harris differ dramatically depending on the poll.

The former president's up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, and favored by 7 points in an ABC News Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only 5 points in the LATEST Fox News poll, and just 2 points in an AP/NORC survey.

In Pennsylvania, the new Monmouth University survey indicates Trump holding a three-point edge over Harris when respondents were asked which candidate is more trusted to handle the economy.

Harris, according to the senior campaign aide, is expected in her speech to premiere some new manufacturing proposals and highlight her ideas to lower costs, invest in American innovation and entrepreneurship, and her goal of ""leading the world in the industries of the future.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

The senior official added that Harris is expected to argue that ""for Donald Trump, our economy works best if it works for those who own the big skyscrapers. Not those who build them. Not those who wire them. Not those who mop the floors.""

And that she will reiterate her charge that Trump has ""no intention to grow the middle class, because all he cares about is helping himself and billionaires like him.""

Trump has repeatedly charged that Harris' plans for the economy are inept and potentially dangerous.

""If you think four years of Harris-Biden is bad, that's nothing compared to four years of Harris-Walz,"" the Trump campaign has argued.

Trump On Tariffs: Can We Replace Income Taxes?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/taxnotes/2024/09/25/trump-on-tariffs-can-we-replace-income-taxes/,2024-09-25T16:29:39Z,"In this video, Tax Notes contributing editors Robert Goulder and Joseph J. Thorndike explore former President Donald Trump's tariff proposals, all in five minutes.

This video has been produced by Tax Notes. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

Robert Goulder: Everyone acknowledges that tax reform is hard. Lawmakers have always wanted to lower people's taxes. But at the same time, they don't want to blow a hole in the federal budget deficit. It's already big enough. Well, wouldn't it be great if there was some utopian revenue source that we could draw from to get a little bit of extra revenue to pay for our precious tax cuts without the consequential political pain?

Some people think that they've stumbled upon such a pot of gold, and it's been there right in front of us since the earliest days of our republic. We're talking about tariffs.

I'm Bob Goulder, contributing editor with Tax Notes. Together with my colleague, historian Joe Thorndike, we're going to try to make sense of these recent calls to use tariff revenues to reduce our income tax burden.

Joe, now, we've got to be honest here: This is President Trump's idea. He is the major proponent of this, and I won't try to conceal the fact that it strikes me as a little bit outside the norm. So let me ask you this: Should we take Trump seriously when he suggests we can use tariffs to pay for income tax cuts?

Joseph J. Thorndike: Well, yeah, basically, I think we should. Trump, he's revived this idea -- against all logic and available evidence -- that tariffs, they could be the foundation of federal finance, just like they were in the 19th century. But, you know, that was a long time ago. Different time, different economy. Still hasn't stopped Trump from saying he wants to use revenue from those higher tariffs to pay for cuts in other taxes, like the corporate income tax; maybe others, too. And I think we should take that seriously.

Robert Goulder: Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't tariffs regressive? So they're akin to a federal consumption tax, except narrowly focused on a selected pool of imported goods. So if you think this through, would it not be the case that using tariffs to finance income tax cuts really boils down to using a regressive tax source to finance a big reduction in a progressive income tax? Or am I missing something?

Joseph J. Thorndike: No. I think, Bob, that you've got that exactly right. Tariffs are very regressive. Erica York, who's at the Tax Foundation, which is not exactly a liberal outfit, she pointed out that when Trump was president, he imposed about $80 billion worth of tariffs. It was one of the largest tax hikes in decades, and consumers paid for most of it in the form of higher prices at the cash register.

So by extension, another round of tariffs -- and Trump wants bigger ones -- would mean even more taxes pushed onto consumers. And if we use those tariff revenues to further cut the corporate income tax, which is paid mostly by the owners of capital, well then, yeah, we've traded a progressive tax for a regressive one, by and large.

Robert Goulder: So the most outlandish proposal here is to actually repeal the income tax altogether. Eliminate it. No more income taxes as we know it. Get rid of them all and pay for that hole in the budget with revenues from tariffs, as if it were 1824 instead of 2024. Is that even possible, mathematically?

Joseph J. Thorndike: All right, so here are some inconvenient facts for Donald Trump: The contribution of tariffs to total federal revenue hasn't exceeded 90 percent since the Civil War, which was a while ago. The tariff contribution has also been declining steadily since about 1890. And President William McKinley, who Trump talks about all the time and he loves because McKinley raised tariffs, he was unable to stop that slide, despite getting some laws passed that tried to do that. So as you said here, the math is really just impossible when it comes to replacing income taxes with tariffs.

Somebody else -- Catherine Rampell at The Washington Post -- said recently that we have about $3 trillion a year that we collect from income taxes. Trump wants to replace all that money with revenue from tariffs, but the entire value of all the things that we import every year, that's about $3 trillion.

So we would have to tax all those imports at 100 percent just to make up the hole from the lost income tax revenue. More, really, since the higher tariffs would actually reduce the amount that we're importing, and that would require even higher taxes on the remaining goods that were still coming into the country. So let's be clear: Not going to happen.

Robert Goulder: OK, so what's the bottom line to all of this? Should we just dismiss it as a harebrained scheme?

Joseph J. Thorndike: Yeah, it's tempting, but I don't think so. The tariff contribution to total revenue doesn't have to be Trump's 100 percent, or even the antebellum 90 percent level, to make a difference when it comes to tax reform debates. New tariffs could still raise a lot of money, just not $3 trillion. So if we take Trump seriously -- and I think we should, given how often he talks about this -- then trade policy could be a big factor in paying for next year's extension of the 2017 tax cuts.

Robert Goulder: And there you have it in five minutes or less, the lowdown on using tariff revenues to pay for income tax cuts. Thank you, Joe, and thank everyone for watching."
Pfizer Is Rising Past Covid-19,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/09/25/pfizer-is-rising-past-covid-19/,2024-09-25T16:16:36Z,"At 11 times forward earnings, Pfizer's attractive valuation, alongside a robust 5.90% dividend yield, presents a compelling case for investment.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE, Financial) rose to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic for its rapid development of a vaccine and antiviral therapy, establishing a household name in the process. As the pandemic faded, the stock lost over 50% of its value from its all-time high. However, the company legacy goes far beyond this.

With a long history of pioneering invention, the pharmaceutical giant has continually provided life-saving solutions in fields such as oncology and cardiovascular care. Further, it has been making notable strides in recent quarters, with an impressive second-quarter performance that is starting to turn heads once again.

Given Pfizer's robust fundamentals and strategic positioning, there is much to explore when considering its growth potential. The recent dip in share price, while reflecting short-term market challenges, also provides a lucrative entry point for investors. My analysis suggests the stock could achieve double-digit gains from its current levels before any significant pullback is likely.

From pandemic windfall to long-term growth

Pfizer's pandemic-fueled revenue surge, largely driven by Covid-19 products like Comirnaty, has now become a challenge as vaccine revenues sharply decline. In the second quarter, Comirnaty sales plunged 87% year over year from $1.30 billion to just $195 million. Yet, the company's overall revenue increased by a modest 3% to $13.30 billion. What's even more impressive is that when we exclude the pandemic-related figures, Pfizer's operational growth actually soared 14%.

The biotech company is strategically shifting away from its reliance on Covid-19 products, which are expected to generate $8.50 billion in 2024 or about 14% of total sales. Paxlovid sales nearly doubled to $251 million, providing some cushion. Still, the company's future growth is increasingly tied to new and existing drugs outside the pandemic sphere.

Key products like Eliquis and the Vyndaqel family are leading the charge, contributing approximately $3.20 billion in the second quarter, with an impressive $650 million increase annually. Additionally, newly acquired drugs such as Padcev, Adcetris, Tukysa and Tivdak generated $394 million, $279 million, $121 million, and $33 million in revenue.

Meanwhile, Pfizer's whopping $43 billion Seagen acquisition marks a bold move into oncology, a market expected to grow at a compound annual rate of around 15.80% through 2032. Seagen's portfolio, which includes cancer therapies like Padcev and Adcetris, adds a powerful new dimension to the company's offerings. This strategic acquisition positions Pfizer to capture significant value in a rapidly growing market provided it successfully integrates Seagen's assets and continues to develop these promising therapies.

The chart below underscores a significant financial shift for Pfizer, with its debt load rising sharply to $69.50 billion as of August, primarily due to the Seagen acquisition. This upswing is starkly contrasted with relatively stable cash reserves, indicating a growing gap between the company's debt and available cash.

Even though Pfizer paid down $2.30 billion in debt in the second quarter, the load could overshadow its otherwise bright outlook. While the company plans to manage this debt through robust cash flow, the substantial increase raises concerns about its financial flexibility, particularly if Seagen's drugs do not perform as expected. This financial imbalance highlights the risk associated with Pfizer's strategic expansion into oncology, emphasizing the need for careful management of both debt reduction and operational efficiency.

Balancing growth with debt management

Pfizer is wisely focusing on reducing its debt, given the significant $778 million in quarterly interest expenses that are cutting into profits. However, the large quarterly dividend payout of $2.40 billion slows down the debt reduction process. While this 5.80% dividend yield is appealing to income-focused investors, it also brings up concerns about its sustainability, particularly if Pfizer encounters unexpected drops in revenue. Balancing debt reduction with maintaining a high dividend is crucial, but it could become challenging if the company's financial situation changes unexpectedly.

To address these financial pressures, Pfizer's current strategy hinges on several factors. First, the company's focus on operational efficiency is vital, with a $4 billion cost reduction plan and a $1.50 billion manufacturing optimization initiative aimed at preserving margins as it moves beyond its pandemic-era products. While these cost-saving measures are expected to enhance profitability, there are execution risks, particularly as Pfizer integrates Seagen's operations.

Pfizer's revised 2024 earnings per share of $2.55 clearly shows its confidence in the future. Even with a 40-cent earnings hit from the Seagen deal, the company is well-positioned to reach the $3 earnings per share target by 2025-26. Trading at just 11 times forward earnings, the stock offers a great opportunity for growth. As long as Pfizer keeps delivering in drug development and the economy stays stable, the future looks bright.

Potential for bullish reversal

The graph below showcases Pfizer's closing price over time, highlighting the dramatic surge in stock value during the height of the pandemic, with prices peaking around $60 in 2022. This surge was driven by the market's recognition of the company's crucial role in vaccine production, which temporarily positioned it at the forefront of global efforts to combat the virus. Between 2022 and 2023, the stock shows volatile swings, including attempts to rally after declines, followed by further drops. However, afterwards as the urgency surrounding the pandemic waned, so did Pfizer's stock, entering a period of consistent decline.

This decline, however, has found a floor in the $25 to $30 range, where the stock appears to have stabilized. This range likely represents the market's reassessment of Pfizer's intrinsic value outside of its pandemic-driven performance. The stabilization phase is crucial. It suggests the stock is potentially bottoming out, with the market waiting for a catalyst to reignite upward momentum.

Around the July 2024 peak, a spike in volume likely reflected a mix of buying enthusiasm and profit-taking. As the stock declined, however, volume tapered off, suggesting the aggressive selling was beginning to dry up. This tapering often signals the market is running out of sellers, which can pave the way for a recovery as buyers start to see value at these lower levels.

Over the past four months, Pfizer's stock has experienced varying levels of momentum, as depicted by the moving average convergence divergence and signal line chart.

Starting from early May, the MACD line has consistently been above the signal line, indicating sustained bullish momentum. This positive momentum persisted through mid-May, driving the stock higher.

As the MACD line began to taper off afterwards, a brief bearish crossover occurred, but this was followed by a reversal, where the MACD line once again crossed above the signal line in July, signaling the resumption of positive momentum.

However, from mid-August onward, the MACD line crossed below the signal line, reflecting a weakening in the stock's upward momentum and signaling the start of a bearish phase. Despite this, the gap between the MACD and Signal lines has narrowed significantly as of early September, which suggests the bearish pressure is fading and a potential bullish crossover may be on the horizon.

Given this setup, investors should watch closely for a possible bullish crossover in the near term as it could signal a resumption of upward momentum.

Further, Pfizer's current share price is positioned near the GF Value of $27.49, indicating the stock is fairly valued with significant potential for upside.

Final word

Pfizer's current position in the pharmaceutical landscape shows a strategic shift away from pandemic-driven revenue toward sustainable, long-term growth. While the sharp decline in Covid-19-related sales presents near-term challenges, the company's focus on its core segments, particularly in oncology and cardiovascular care, highlights a promising trajectory. Key products like Eliquis and the Vyndaqel family, alongside newly acquired assets like Seagen's portfolio, showcase Pfizer's ability to capitalize on growth opportunities in critical sectors. The Seagen acquisition, though resulting in increased debt, adds significant value to the company's oncology pipeline, an area set for rapid expansion.

Moreover, Pfizer's cost-cutting initiatives and manufacturing optimizations will be crucial in maintaining margins, ensuring the company can weather near-term market challenges and build a robust foundation for the future. The focus on balancing its high dividend yield with debt management shows the company's commitment to sustaining investor confidence while strategically positioning itself for long-term success.

Lastly, Pfizer's stock has stabilized around the $25 to $30 range, and signs of a potential bullish reversal present an appealing opportunity for investors. With solid fundamentals, a promising drug pipeline and favorable valuation metrics, the company offers a compelling case for growth.

Presidential Documents: A Baseline To Curb The Pen And Phone,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/waynecrews/2024/09/25/presidential-documents-a-baseline-to-curb-the-pen-and-phone/,2024-09-25T16:15:56Z,"We are not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we're providing Americans the kind of help that they need. I've got a pen, and I've got a phone. -- Barack Obama, 2014

With debate swirling over federal spending, regulation, and a presidential election just weeks away, it is appropriate to reflect on the significant influence of presidential executive orders, memoranda and other proclamations. These interact with laws, agency rules and a variety of sub-regulatory guidance documents in countless legitimate ways. But they can also be unilaterally as in the case of Obama's famous pen-and-phone strategy, which contained echoes of FDR's bold declarations:

""It is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority may be wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us. But it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure... But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two courses, and in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me."" -- Franklin D. Roosevelt, Inaugural Address

While we can count laws and agency rules, the same cannot be said for ostensibly non-binding guidance documents, interpretations, circulars, and the myriad other declarations of agency policy.

Those laws are one thing, but the legitimacy of alternative and highly influential tools like regulation and guidance deserves scrutiny, as they were never explicitly established by the Constitution, which established enumerated powers for Congress and set up an executive branch with just four original cabinet offices: State, War, Treasury, and the Post Office.

In an era of rising spending, legislation and regulation, it is only natural that executive power is ascendant as well. Policymakers are already looking at reducing spending and regulation. Alongside that, a survey of executive orders and other presidential actions, compared across administrations, can help us explore the wisdom of such power remaining concentrated in the office of the presidency.

Pens and Phones Can Launder Objectionable Regulation

While Joe Biden is not the record-holder when it comes to the tally of formal executive orders, there are other pens, phones, and other tools at his and any president's disposal.

Like FDR and Obama before him, Biden is notable for his commitment to an expansive central government. In Biden's case, this is manifest in an unprecedented pursuit of a wide array of ""whole-of-government"" transformations aimed at implementing progressive policies. These initiatives range across the public policy spectrum: climate and net-zero energy, the ""care economy,"" equity and environmental justice, housing affordability, price controls in already deeply regulated sectors, and the controversial forgiveness of student loans.

Despite welcome Supreme Court rulings curbing federal agency powers, regulations, guidance, and executive actions have been reinvigorated by unparalleled spending and high-impact legislation since the pandemic. This has made regulatory adventurism easier, enabling the laundering of regulation through subsidies, loan guarantees (e.g., broadband expansion and CHIPS Act funding), and contracting and procurement rules, much of which can circumvent the traditional notice-and-comment process.

As policymakers grapple with their own overspending and regulatory overreach by agencies, they must also turn greater attention to the use -- and potential misuse -- of presidential powers.

Tracking and Disciplining Presidential Directives

To hold executive power accountable, policymakers need to compare and contrast the directives issued by the presidential pen and phone across different administrations. Moreover, a systematic approach is needed to place these activities in the broader context of overall federal government expansion.

As recent elections have shown, presidents now exert dramatic and sometimes radical effects on national policy, with 180-degree shifts between administrations. Trump rolled back several Obama rules; on his first day in office, Biden reversed nearly all of Trump's executive actions on deregulation.

While inventories of laws and regulations are readily available, and proposals to catalog guidance documents are under consideration, presidential executive orders, memoranda, and other decrees deserve more attention today. The table below names these actions as cataloged by the National Archives, and inventories Biden's directives alongside those of his recent predecessors.

As visible on the excellent American Presidency Project website, there are many other types of spoken and written presidential remarks, from fireside chats to farewell addresses, but the documents shown above represent the core tools of executive governance.

The similarities in the number by type of documents across recent administrations highlight the ongoing and institutionalized role of the executive branch within the federal government. The purpose here is to provide a snapshot for policymakers, who may choose to audit these categories of activity as circumstances demand in the course of other reforms of the federal regulatory enterprise. Below is a description of each document type, with some examples.

Executive Order

Executive orders (E.O.s) are legally binding presidential directives issued to federal administrative agencies, published in the Federal Register. These directives can instruct agencies on how to implement existing laws or manage specific operations within the federal government. Executive orders may address a wide range of policy and governance issues, including national security, the economy, health, and immigration. They can be challenged in court if deemed to overstep presidential authority or conflict with existing law. While executive orders can be used to scale back government -- such as with E.O. 13771 (Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs), which required agencies to repeal two regulations for every new one -- they may be more apt to foster the expansion of federal authority. A notable example is Biden's E.O. 14,008, ""Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,"" which rejoined the Paris Agreement, established a National Climate Task Force, and set the stage for transitioning to subsidized green energy.

Memorandum

Memoranda are often similar to executive orders but typically less formal, as they are neither numbered nor always published in the Federal Register. However, they can still contain specific instructions and policy directives.

Notable memoranda from President Biden include his first-day Memorandum on Ending Construction of the Border Wall, as well as a 2021 Memorandum on Revitalizing America's Foreign Policy and National Security Workforce, which emphasized diversity, equity, and inclusion within foreign policy and national security agencies.

Determinations are specific decisions or findings made by the President, often required by statute, that trigger particular policy or legal actions. These documents are numbered and typically address matters such as whether a foreign nation should receive aid based on human rights criteria, as well as national security issues, and trade sanctions or preferences.

Notice

Notices are public notifications or official announcements, such as declarations of a national emergency (or the continuation or termination thereof) related to health crises or foreign threats. They are also used to extend previous executive orders. Notices can hold legal significance because they can maintain or alter the status of national policy and may involve the mobilization of federal resources.

Recent examples include Biden's February 2023 Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency Concerning the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic and the September 2024 Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Certain Terrorist Attacks, which extended the national emergency first declared after the September 11, 2001, attacks.

Proclamation

Proclamations are formal, numbered statements or declarations issued to the public, often of a ceremonial nature, such as observances of national holidays (e.g., Thanksgiving proclamations by George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, or Biden's Juneteenth Day of Observance) or days, weeks, or months dedicated to raising awareness (e.g., A Proclamation on Indigenous Peoples' Day).

Proclamations can also carry legal weight and regulatory significance by invoking or altering laws. For example, they can affect federal land management or national monument policy, as seen in separate Biden proclamations regarding Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. Additionally, proclamations may affect international relations by establishing tariffs under statutory authority, such as those on aluminum, steel, and crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells -- actions by Biden that notably retained elements of Trump-era trade protections. They can also address immigration matters, including suspending the entry of certain foreign nationals.

Presidential Order

Presidential orders, distinct from executive orders, are categorized separately on the National Archives page but are generally less recognized elsewhere. These orders are few number and pertain to statutory requirements related to government spending and budgeting procedures, including budget sequestration and adjustments to discretionary spending limits. They primarily serve specific functions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (commonly known as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings), ensuring compliance with pre-set spending caps and automatic budget cuts.

The most recent example is the March 2024 Sequestration Order for Fiscal Year 2025, issued pursuant to Section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. While spending cannot be said to be under control, for our purposes here the implication of these orders suggests that a future regulatory budget could be similarly institutionalized, with necessary adjustments documented.

Other

The National Archives ""Other"" category captures a handful of less-common or specialized documents or procedural actions of recent vintage. Biden's four have involved opening and maintaining vehicular and pedestrian border crossings. Trump's more than two dozen included establishment of the Space Force, a National Space Traffic Management Policy, and directives on operation and maintenance of pipeline facilities (such as Keystone) at the Canadian and Mexican borders.

What to Do Now

There can be overlap between these categories, as the president possesses broad authority and discretion to issue directives in various formats. The choice may often be strategic or based on preference rather than a strict legal distinction.

For instance, an executive order might be issued to signal a major policy shift and garner media attention, while a memorandum could just as effectively provide quiet instructions to agencies, depending on the contentiousness of the issue.

Each of the three branches of government, which should ideally provide checks and balances, sometimes appears to outmaneuver one another in a rock-paper-scissors dynamic. To remedy that, Congress must adhere to its enumerated powers, while departments and agencies need to be downsized and terminated to curb excessive spending, regulation, and unwelcome sub-regulatory guidance.

Regarding the presidency, it is essential to consider all the aforementioned categories and their potential to substitute for one another. In contentious times, presidential proclamations and determinations alike can impose trade sanctions and tariffs, while notices declaring national emergencies might be used to exploit the Defense Production Act for inefficient and unasked-for technologies. Recognizing the potential for exploitation of executive power is crucial, especially when the Biden/Harris administration is being urged to declare a so-called climate emergency, which it may not oppose.

As the national government has expanded to considerable dimensions, the influence of presidential directives on the public merits careful scrutiny. Even with the recent end of Chevron deference, there a plethora of statutes can still be selectively interpreted to justify unwise policies, such as the aforementioned attempt, still ongoing, at student loan forgiveness.

Laws and regulations can grow inappropriately, but so too can questionable executive actions. This overview provides an initial snapshot of the volumes and magnitudes of significant presidential activity. By understanding our current position, we can better decide where we want to go."
Sound Future CIO Shares The State Of Climate Career Opportunities,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylrobinson/2024/09/25/sound-future-cio-shares-the-state-of-climate-career-opportunities/,2024-09-25T15:51:52Z,"Sustainability initiatives are becoming more popular across corporate America. Advances in technology and environmental awareness have resulted in the evolution of environmentally focused occupations, which are referred to as ""climate jobs."" Globally, the transition to sustainable energy is expected to be a net job creator despite climate-induced challenges such as heat stress, potentially reducing working hours by approximately 3.8% by 2030. In 2022, clean energy job creation outpaced overall job growth, with over 4.2 million climate jobs recorded.

Green jobs present a unique blend of challenges and fulfillment, making them an attractive employment path for many. Working in climate change is more than manual labor; it's understanding the industry and painting a picture of an actual, positive impact.

Professionals in these roles are frequently at the cutting edge of technological advancements, harnessing renewable energy or designing eco-friendly processes. The challenge comes from navigating evolving regulations and technology and the larger mission of creating a sustainable future.

Kelci Zile, managing director at EnVest, specializes in unlocking innovation via funding and deploying sustainability solutions. Additionally, she serves as the chief innovation officer of Sound Future, a nonprofit that harnesses the power of live events to test and scale climate solutions, and a venture partner at SNØCAP.

Zile started her career leading sustainability for AWS Marketplace and served on the Amazon Sustainability Ambassadors Global Board, where she co-led an Amazon-wide internal education series. As she advanced in her career and gained experience in circular economy, supply chain emissions reduction and nature-based solutions, she realized that sustainability goes beyond just climate change. She's helping companies step away from greenwashing to take action.

""Greenwashing is the act of using marketing tactics or things as simple as green colors or your positive fluffy verbiage to trick the audience or the purchaser into thinking that the action that they're taking or the goods that they're purchasing or the donation they're making is going to heating the planet or lowering emissions,"" Zile explains during a phone interview. ""An example is when water bottles covered in green leaves state that it's recycled. However, the fine print reveals it's 5% post-consumer recycled plastic, 95% brand new plastic.""

Green shifting is another tactic that companies partake in. Big businesses lacking in sustainability efforts will put the need to be sustainable on the consumer rather than themselves. A prime example is when food companies use packaging to guide the consumer to recycle the bottles. In contrast, the solution would be to create a refillable program or make a compostable bottle.

This notion that sustainability actions are on the consumer is also seen in the live events space. Sound Future started its Restoration Program to help artists and venues give back to their communities in a way that supports climate change initiatives.

""A lot of fans are made to feel bad for traveling,"" Zile comments. ""At the end of the day, everyone wants to enjoy these experiences. Traveling is part of it, and there are emissions associated with it. A lot of live events are trying to make the fans feel bad about that. But in reality, we're like, 'Let's not do green shifting and build these restoration programs which are lowering the actual emissions of the event and make it tangible and easier, rather than pushing the shame book.'""

The fashion industry poses another area of concern. In 2022, thredUP found that nearly 27 million brand-new festival outfits were going to be purchased for that single festival season, and one-third were expected to be worn only once. The World Economic Forum identified the fashion industry as the third largest polluter, contributing over 10% of worldwide emissions annually. For comparison, air travel is roughly 3%.

Pivoting consumer mindsets is challenging when, for generations, there has been a particular way of doing things. There are green groups such as Work on Climate, MCJ Collective, and Music Sustainability to look into for volunteer positions or learn more about different areas in which you want to make a difference. Climate tech is another pillar for people looking to change careers and want to make an impact.

For people looking for traditional positions within the climate change sector, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects rapid growth for roles like wind turbine service technicians and solar photovoltaic installers. The fastest-growing green jobs include:

The top job sites to apply for climate change jobs are:

""For sustainability to take off, it needs to be better, faster and cheaper,"" Zile concludes. ""There's that expression that people think of sustainability as a warm beer and cold showers, which no one wants. If we can switch it to cold beer chilled through renewable energy and long, beautiful, warm showers powered by the sun and rain entrapment, people, whether they care about saving the Earth or not, are getting behind it."""
Beijing Begins To Face Demographic Reality And Raises Retirement Ages,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2024/09/25/beijing-begins-to-face-demographic-reality-and-raises-retirement-ages/,2024-09-25T15:51:27Z,"Authorities in China have finally responded to the nation's demographic strains -- on the state pension system and on the economy generally. They have raised statutory retirement ages. For years, such matters were far from the minds of leadership in Beijing. Because China could count on a huge flow of young people into the workforce, it could support one of the youngest retirement ages in the world. The flow of young workers provided productive strength and a torrent of funds for the nation's pension system. Chinese society could easily afford to move workers along into retirement. But things have changed. Decades of the one-child policy have now left China with a paucity of young workers. No longer does the economy have access to so many young hands and minds or the funds they once poured into the state pension scheme. Beijing has had to respond.

Accordingly, the authorities have announced a jump in statutory retirement ages. Men, who previously could go onto the pension scheme at 60 years of age will now have to work until 63. For women in blue collar jobs, the retirement age will rise from 50 at present to 55. Women in other lines of work will see their statutory retirement age rise from 55 presently to 58. So as not to shock those just approaching the old statutory ages, the increase, the authorities have announced, will take place gradually over the next 15 years.

Demographic trends will no doubt require another such adjustment. Decades of the one-child policy have already left China with twice the number of retirees for each person of working age than was the case 25 years ago. The implicit pressure of this situation has already impelled the authorities in Beijing to loosen the old one-child rules, but as it has turned out, Chinese householders are no more interested in having more children than they were under the old law's strictures. Matters will then likely become still more intense in coming years, demanding additional adjustments in the retirement age among other accommodations. Even had fertility rates risen with the loosening of the old law, it would be 15-20 years before rising birth rates could affect the labor situation and pension flows. As it is, no such relief is coming.

China's planners have inadvertently compounded this situation. Some years ago, they decided that the unfolding Chinese economy would require vast numbers of engineering and science graduates. They pushed youth to go this route and financed it. For years, China graduated more engineers than just about the rest of the world combined. But as it has turned out, the economy has less need for all these graduates than the planners anticipated. Many young graduates cannot find work appropriate to their level of education and remain unemployed rather than take a menial job. At last measure, China's youth unemployment rate stood at almost 19 percent. So, in addition to having fewer young workers than are needed, quite a large portion of the young population seems to have opted out of the active workforce even as China already faces a shortage of factory workers.

Beijing thus had little choice. Keeping working men and those women in white collar jobs at work for three additional years and women in blue collar jobs at work for an additional five years gives time to assemble enough young workers to take their place in the tax-paying, production part of China's economy. It also means that existing workers will pay into the pension system and not draw on it for 3-5 more years than they would have under the old retirement laws. And since the new rules are not likely to change life expectancy, the new retirement rules will have those drawing on the system for 3-5 years less than they would have under the old system.

Given the still low fertility rates in China, this hike in the retirement age will not be the last. Likely even before the 15-year transition ends, Beijing will have to raise the statutory retirement ages again. To be sure, similar pressures exist in Japan, Europe, and the United States, but nowhere as acutely as in China."
Growth Or Value Stocks?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2024/09/25/growth-or-value-stocks/,2024-09-25T15:39:59Z,"The stock market faced another test last week as the bearish sentiment was quite high even though some sort of rate cut was almost guaranteed. From the week's low the S&P 500 closed up 100 points or 1.7% with the Inveco QQQ Trust (QQQ) closing 2.7% above its low.

Many were still concerned as some pointed to high valuations like Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management who commented that the ""upside from just lower rates is somewhat limited."" Others worry that fundamental measures like price-to-book and price-to-sales are also now well above the past historic averages.

From a technical perspective, I have found these measures to often be unreliable. According to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group ""The Fed has cut rates 20 times since 1980 when the S&P 500 was within 2% of an all-time high. He found that the index has been ""higher a year later every time, with an average gain of 13.9%"".

The recessionary fears are still keeping many investors out of stocks. The analysis of the market internals and the advance/decline lines ahead of the FOMC meeting projected new highs.

The slightly improving bullish sentiment at the start of this week was dampened when the Consumer Confidence Index on Tuesday came in at 98.7 down from August's six-month high of 105.6. This was the largest decline since August 2021.

A deeper dive into the results revealed that the ""drop in confidence was steepest for consumers aged 35 to 54. As a result, on a six-month moving average basis, the 35-54 age group has become the least confident while consumers under 35 remain the most confident."" The under 50K segment showed the largest drop in sentiment while the 100K group remained the most confident.

It has been my view, based in part on the chart of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment, that the consumer's outlook for the economy will improve as we get closer to the election. The latest report comes out this Friday and I am not sure that this one data point is significant.

Also, it is interesting that the Conference Board noted that The cutoff date for the preliminary results was September 17, 2024. Therefore some part of the survey results were tallied before the FOMC cut rates.

The weekly outlook for the stock market did not change after last week's action or the price action early this week. The outlook for growth stocks has improved as the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) is up 1% so far this week. The August high at $484.86 has been exceeded. The R1 monthly pivot resistance is at $499.36 and the July high is at $502.81.

The Nasdaq 100 Advance/Decline line is still in a strong trend after it dropped back to support, line c, early in the month. It is very close to last week's new high. More importantly, the relative performance RS now looks closer to completing its bottom formation after it recently broke the downtrend, line e. A move in the RS above the August high should signal that the QQQ is again leading the S&P 500.

The growth/value ratio chart of the iShares Russell 1000 Growth (IWF) versus the iShares Russell 1000 Value (IWD closed above its 20-week EMA last week (see arrow). This analysis has been very helpful in determining whether one should favor growth or value stocks as well as ETFs.

The bullish divergences in the MACDs were a positive sign for growth stocks in late 2022 and early 2023 contrary to the overall market sentiment. Currently, the signals are not as clear as the MACDs are still negative.

There are some positive signs from some of the tech sectors as charts of some semiconductor stocks look quite strong. I am still on alert for a 1-2 day sharp pullback as we move into October but think it will be a buying opportunity."
The One Chart You Need To Track To Predict The Stock Market,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2024/09/25/the-one-chart-you-need-to-track-to-predict-the-stock-market/,2024-09-25T15:26:42Z,"People are still fixated about the interest rate moves. Interest rates up markets down, interest rates down markets up. Interest rates are generally considered the be all and end all of monetary policy.

This is old hat.

As any payday loan shark will tell you, it is the availability of money not the interest rate that is important. Conversely, what is the use of 1% interest rates if no one will lend you money? We think of the availability of money for borrowing as simply a function of a borrower's salesmanship or collateral or even the toughness of the lender, and in the old model that works just fine. However, in the modern world it's more a case of the availability of money rather than anything else.

When money is easy lenders run out of good people to lend to and conversely, when money is tight lenders run out of money to lend to good borrowers. As such, today it is the availability of cash to lend that is key rather than a percentage point of interest here or there. On the margin the rate counts but QE and QT are king because they control availability of cash or in modern parlance liquidity. Interest rates are a big deal in the very long term but in the short term, when for example many corporations send IOUs to their banks just to get the cash to make payroll, the liquidity necessary to make this apparently precarious sort of situation possible is much more important. Without the access to liquidity cash there is no long term. This is what the ballooned Fed balance sheet is all about. It ballooned because the Federal Reserve used it as a way of taking long term uncash-like debit and turning it into instruments with more cash-like properties.

Ultimately, the extremities of the macroeconomic response to the pandemic caused inflation, and to drag inflation-causing cash out of the system the means by which it was created, expansion of the federal Reserve's balance sheet, had to be reversed.

That is what has been happening. Here is the full process so far, care of the Fed's site:

As an aside, the Federal Reserve is bringing down its balance sheet at roughly $1 trillion a year. So normality resumes nominally in three years. But if you roll in inflation that will be perhaps just two years. Yet along the lines of fun facts, blowing up the balance sheet has proved to be a life saver in two major economic emergencies so you could forgive folks for imagining a large balance sheet might not be the work of the devil that needs to be cast out. We will see, however, while this chart shows the Fed's plan at work, there is another that shows the criticality of this process and that is where we need to look for the canary in the U.S. economies economic coal mine.

What is it? It's a graph of excess money in the system. How, why? When the system makes too much money, banks end up with cash they can't lend. They don't want to have it sloshing around and the central bank offers them a home for it with a nice interest rate. This is what the ""reverse repo"" is, a deposit account for the excess money in the system; it's a way of keeping the case out of trouble, so to speak. So here is a long-term chart of it to give context, care of the New York Fed:

If you relate to this representing excess money and you consider the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, you can see the Federal Reserve reeling in inflation in these two charts.

You can also see that while the Fed is unwinding its balance sheet it is slowing its pulling of cash from the market. Be assured, it has plenty of clever ways to manipulate money supply, it's what it does.

Optically, you can guess it's queasy about throwing the economy into recession, so it is leaving a margin of too much money in the systemin much the way it did 2014-2018.

The recent drop of 0.5% in interest rates and the recent deceleration of tightening shown by the reverse repo suggests the regulators feel they have reached a pivot point.

For the investor and trader, however, the procession of the repo and balance sheet are indicators of the long-term direction of travel for Fed policy.

I would suggest these charts together sketch a policy of looser money than many expect and therefore a little more lively inflation than is publicly targeted. It also shows a proactive policy of not crashing markets, which of course is a lovely safety net to have under any investor.

The next way point in post-election. If the Fed is actually diverging from long-term policy it will be because of the election and attempting to lower the rise of any emergency in the run up to it. Therefore, it would go back on track after the next president is selected and that will appear in new trajectories in these charts.

While there are plenty of matters to keep investors up at night right now, the Fed is not one of them. What is more, they telegraph their intentions and their actions are updated in these charts every week and it is from these charts that all others flow."
Harris's Rejection Of School Choice Contradicts Opportunity Rhetoric,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickgleason/2024/09/25/harriss-rejection-of-school-choice-contradicts-opportunity-rhetoric/,2024-09-25T15:11:28Z,"In response to the first question posed to her at the September 10 presidential debate hosted by ABC, Vice President Kamala Harris touted what she describes as an ""opportunity economy,"" a term she has continued to reference on the campaign trail. Given her campaign themes of ""freedom"" and ""opportunity,"" it's logical for a member of the national or battleground state press corps to ask Harris about the incongruence between that rhetoric and her rejection of school choice programs that expand opportunity by increasing education options available to parents and children.

For example North Carolina, which both Harris and her running mate have visited in recent days, has an Opportunity Scholarship Program, first enacted in 2013, that now provides tens of thousands of families with education vouchers that help them access more education options. Despite polling indicating its cross-ideological popularity, Governor Roy Cooper (D-N.C.) and other leading Democrats continue to oppose the Opportunity Scholarship Program, which provides families with an education voucher worth a little more than $7,000 annually to cover private school tuition. It would be instructive for North Carolina voters to hear Harris explain why she opposes this and other school choice programs that provide families more education opportunities.

Kamala Harris's most recent visit to North Carolina on September 12 came just one day after the GOP-run General Assembly in Raleigh passed legislation that will provide additional funding for the Opportunity Scholarship Program. That increased funding will address heightened demand for the program, which has risen since state lawmakers made eligibility for the program universal last year by removing income caps. North Carolina's now universal Opportunity Scholarship Program is means-tested, with the value of the voucher falling as household income rises.

The additional funding approved by North Carolina lawmakers will fund scholarships for the more than 50,000 children currently on a waiting list. That funding bill, which Governor Cooper vetoed on September 20, also provides the additional resources needed to clear the waiting list for the state's Education Savings Account (ESA) program for special needs children.

The Republican-controlled North Carolina House and Senate are expected override Cooper's veto in the coming days, green lighting a funding boost that will address growing demand for the state's school choice programs. School choice advocates point out that if Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, Roy Cooper, and other leading Democrats had their way, families would not be able to access ESAs or education vouchers.

Vice President Harris backed a 2019 Los Angeles teachers union strike that sought to limit access to charter schools. Governor Walz, meanwhile, opposed a 2021 proposal from Minnesota Senate Republicans to make ESAs available to most Minnesota families, with Walz claiming they would ""defund public education.""

In an August 15 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Joshua Robertson, senior pastor of the Rock Church of Harrisburg, Pa. and founder and CEO of Black Pastors United for Education, described Walz's claim that school choice defunds public education as a ""gross misinterpretation of ESAs and vouchers."" Robertson laments that Harris has ""never indicated any support for school choice in any of her previous roles.""

""Black families don't want to harm our public schools financially,"" Robertson added. ""We want properly funded public schools and education freedom at the same time.""

In addition to North Carolina, 11 other states now have a universal school choice program, while many other states have some form of school choice. According to EdChoice, as of 2024 more than 262,000 kids across 16 states utilize education vouchers, while more than 328,000 children in 17 states benefit from ESAs. Thanks to the outcome of recent primaries, Tennessee is poised to become the next state with universal school choice in 2025 and Texas is expected to finally get some form of school choice.

""In their 2024 party platform, Republicans committed themselves, for the first time, to 'universal school choice,' while the Democrats' draft platform denounces vouchers and calls for tighter restrictions on charter schools,"" notes Paul Peterson, the Henry Lee Shattuck Professor of Government at Harvard University. Even though the presidential contest will get the most attention, Peterson points out that decisions about whether or not school choice is expanded will be determined by the makeup of state legislatures.

""States and localities, not the national government, set most of the conditions affecting school choice,"" Professor Peterson added. ""These lower tiers of government decide whether to authorize charter schools and whether to offer such programs as school vouchers, tax-credit-funded scholarships, and education savings accounts (ESAs)."" Still, the Harris's rejection of school choice will be seen by many as contradictory to her talk of an ""opportunity economy"" and ""freedom.""

Why Kamala Harris has rejected programs that expand school choice -- like North Carolina's Opportunity Scholarship and special-needs ESA programs, Pennsylvania's tax credit scholarship program, and Arizona's ESA program -- is a logical question for a reporter to pose to Harris and her campaign, one whose response would provide useful information that many voters would like to have before heading to the polls or mailing in their absentee ballots. This author has contacted the Harris campaign for comment on the matter and will update this article with their response, should they provide one."
Data Centers At The Heart Of The AI And Digital Economy Surge,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2024/09/25/data-centers-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-and-digital-economy-surge/,2024-09-25T14:56:33Z,"Data centers have quietly evolved from obscure server warehouses tucked away in industrial parks to the backbone of our digital society. Once considered dull, gray structures, these facilities have become the critical infrastructure that powers everything we rely on today -- social media, artificial intelligence-driven innovations, and daily conveniences like navigation apps and ride-sharing. These high-security buildings are now as essential as highways and airports, connecting us to the digital economy that fuels our lives. However, their newfound importance comes with a host of challenges, and how we respond will dictate the pace of societal progress.

The New Digital Frontier

It's hard to believe that just a few decades ago, data centers were little more than warehouses for servers, often located in remote or economically disadvantaged areas. The internet boom of the late 1990s put data centers on the map, with companies like Exodus Communications pioneering the concept of large-scale data centers. But as with many tech trends, the early 2000s saw a crash. Overzealous investments led to an overbuild that left many data centers underutilized for years.

Fast forward to 2024, and we are witnessing another data center boom. This time, the demand is not only driven by a rapidly expanding internet but by a digital society that never sleeps -- compounded by artificial intelligence, which is creating an unprecedented need for computing power.

Data Centers Matter Now More Than Ever

Today, the U.S. data center market is experiencing explosive growth. According to JLL, the market has doubled in size since 2020, with a compound annual growth rate of 21%. Vacancy rates are at an all-time low of 3% and are rapidly approaching zero. According to Houlihan Lokey, this soaring demand is fueling a construction boom, with 5.3 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity under construction as of mid-2024, and 22 GW planned to meet the increasing need for digital infrastructure.

But it's not just the volume that's rising -- colocation rents, the cost of leasing space within data centers, have surged by as much as 37% year-over-year. No longer just a utility, data centers are now a premium asset in the digital economy.

Artificial intelligence is the primary driver behind this data center explosion. AI-related capital expenditures now exceed $300 billion, and the technology accounts for 20% of all new data center demand. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are at the forefront, developing hyperscale data centers that stretch the limits of computing power.

From self-driving cars to facial recognition, artificial intelligence consumes vast amounts of computational resources. Every time you interact with a digital assistant, use a navigation app, or even send flowers online, you are tapping into the enormous power of a data center.

Powering The Future: The Sustainability Crisis

This unprecedented demand, however, comes at a cost: electricity. Data centers are massive energy consumers, and as the number of facilities grows, so does the strain on the U.S. power grid. The rise of electric vehicles and increased manufacturing demands further compound the issue, pushing power availability to the brink of crisis. Some estimates suggest that data centers alone could account for 20% of global electricity demand by the end of the decade.

To combat this, industry leaders are turning to alternative energy solutions. For example, Amazon Web Services is exploring nuclear energy to power its massive campuses. This race for sustainable solutions isn't just about cutting costs -- it's about survival in an increasingly energy-hungry world.

Investor Confidence Soars

Despite these challenges, investor confidence in the data center market remains at an all-time high. Cap rates -- a measure of return on investment in real estate -- have remained stable between 6-7%, buoyed by strong demand for digital infrastructure and rising rents. Valuations of leading data center companies like Digital Realty Trust and Switch have reached unprecedented levels.

Heavyweights such as BlackRock and Microsoft are pouring hundreds of billions into expanding data center infrastructure, signaling that the sector isn't just a short-term play -- it's a long-term investment in the future of the digital economy.

A Call To Action: Building With Purpose, Not Panic

The data center industry is poised for a bright future, but it's crucial to learn from the mistakes of the past. During the dot-com boom, over-exuberance and a lack of strategic foresight led to a catastrophic overbuild that took years to correct. As we rush to meet today's demand, we must plan with purpose.

It's not enough to simply build more data centers. We need to build them with their specific use case in mind: Is it for hyperscale operations, artificial intelligence processing, or corporate IT? This means situating facilities near reliable power sources and connectivity hubs while ensuring they have access to renewable or responsible energy solutions -- whether solar, natural gas, or nuclear. The industry cannot afford another bubble, especially with stakes higher than ever before. Thoughtful planning today will set the foundation for sustainable growth tomorrow.

Data centers are no longer just the backbone of the internet -- they are the foundation of our digital world. But with this influence comes responsibility. The decisions we make today about data center construction, energy consumption, and workforce development will shape the digital infrastructure of the future."
Agility In The Age Of AI: Arun Sundararajan On Learning & Employment,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/vickiphillips/2024/09/25/agility-in-the-age-of-ai-arun-sundararajan-on-learning--employment/,2024-09-25T14:56:21Z,"Bold predictions about the transformational impact of artificial intelligence are seemingly everywhere.

In education, that has led to a robust appraisal and interrogation of the skills both students and educators need in order to thrive in an AI-driven future. There is an equally extensive dialogue underway with respect to the evolution trajectory required for employers, business, and industry to succeed in that context. Regardless of the individual solutions offered, these two worlds will remain inextricably linked.

How schools and educators either embrace or resist AI has big implications for the choices and challenges employers and industry are left with.

To explore this link and understand the stakes, I recently spoke with someone at the forefront of the public dialogue-NYU Stern's Arun Sundararajan.

The Harold Price Professor of Entrepreneurship, Sundararajan is one of the world's foremost experts in how digital technologies transform business and institutions. He is a member of the World Economic Forum's AI Governance Alliance as well as the Carnegie Council's Artificial Intelligence and Equality Initiative. He also advises organizations like the National Academy of Science and the National League of Cities, the cities of New York and Seoul, as well as major employers around the world.

Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Vicki Phillips: Arun, there has been a lot said already about the scale of impact that Artificial Intelligence will have on education. The long-term effects could be absolutely astonishing. But I'm interested in hearing about the more near term changes you see for education, both the classroom and our systems.

Arun Sundararajan: Thank you, Vicki. The potential for transformation is immense.

Of course, this potential won't immediately become a reality. Public education systems need to overcome internal resistance to change and fears of workforce displacement. The initial reaction to the technology will be to see it as a threat, and to focus on rule-setting around the use of generative AI within existing models of instruction.

Soon, educators will realize three things: (1) their metrics and assessments of learning need to change, much like they did in response to prior digital developments like the calculator, spell-check and search engines; (2) embracing and integrating current generative AI like ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude into a teaching plan is far more effective than trying to ban or police their use, and (3) creating AI-enabled tools that aid and complement classroom learning can enhance rather than diminish the value of human teachers.

VP: Helpful and insightful. As I've observed in this space, realizing the full potential of AI in education requires more than just technological innovation. Educators will need to prepare students for a future in which they can thrive alongside technology. What skills do you think educators should focus on to prepare students for an AI-driven future?

AS: First, a baseline understanding of how AI works is essential learning for any student. It's as important for the future as basic mathematics is today. We don't have to aspire to make everyone a machine learning engineer, but we must give everyone a foundational understanding so that they can better understand the possibilities and risks as the technology evolves.

Second, the pace of change in the human-machine mix -- what human workers do and what is delegated to AI and other technologies -- will accelerate in the coming decade. It is essential that we educate students on critical thinking, on learning how to learn, and on being entrepreneurial. As the pace at which specific skills become obsolete and unpredictability grows, this kind of education will serve them better in the long run.

VP: Your work focuses on how digital technologies transform business, government, and civil society. At NCEE we work at the intersection of education and the economy so I wonder what role you see industry playing in this context. How do you think employers and our education system can better partner to ensure that students can thrive in an AI-enabled world?

AS: The primary education imperative of the 20th century was K-12 and especially early-career education, culminating in an array of universities offering stellar four-year college degrees globally. In the 21st century, the most important additional imperative is mid-career transition education. The current higher education system is inadequately prepared. Prestige and funding still flow to flagship universities rather than community colleges or specialized transition education institutions.

The most effective partnership models will involve employers and large corporations creating a viable curriculum and business model for the mass-market transition education needed by society, and working with universities, perhaps under a new franchising model, to scale its delivery.

VP: To be sure, the need for systemic approaches to enabling learning across long lifetimes, upskilling, and reskilling will be absolutely vital. As technology evolves, what's your sense of how leading employers are thinking about reskilling their workforce in the years ahead?

AS: Preparing one's workforce for the AI-driven transformation of work has become a C-suite issue. Retail giants like Amazon and Walmart were early movers, since AI-driven automation affected them at scale earlier than some other sectors. For example, Walmart offers free college education to all its employees using an innovative design that integrates on-the-job training into a college curriculum.

It is imperative, however, that all large employers think bigger than just ""reskilling"". They need to think about mid-career ""transition"" more holistically. It takes more than new skills to transition into a new occupation. One needs a carefully designed bundle -- capability discovery, skills, mentoring, credentialing, access to new roles -- delivered in a way that is accessible and affordable to someone who holds a full-time job.

VP: What ethical considerations are front of mind for you as we think about AI applications for workforce development and human capital management?

AS: The ethical consideration foremost on people's minds is of mitigating any form of algorithmic bias in AI-based screening systems, ensuring that particular groups are not unfairly excluded from consideration.

An additional concern which is less widely discussed stems from the growing ""monoculture"" of AI -- we rely increasingly on general-purpose large-language models like OpenAI's GPT. Most systems of this kind are trained on pretty much the same data, and consequently, the inadvertent mistakes of exclusion or bias made by one system could be mirrored by the others. This kind of correlated error is hard to detect and correct.

Perhaps the most pressing ethical consideration has less to do with bias in AI systems, and more with the ethical responsibility of corporations and society to enable their workforce to transition to new occupations in the face of automation. This should occupy as high a priority position on the corporate social responsibility agenda as sustainability or fair labor practices.

VP: Let's turn back to today's students and their future. What advice would you give to young people entering the workforce in an era of rapid AI advancement?

AS: Your grandparents entered a workforce in which they reasonably expected to have the same job their entire career, while your parents entered a workforce in which they expected to practice the same occupation their entire career.

You are entering a world in which you are likely to have multiple occupations during your career. So prepare for change. It is impossible to predict what specialized mix of skills and capabilities the market will demand in a decade or two. So, while it still makes sense to have some depth of expertise in something, don't specialize exclusively in a particular field like finance or computer science.

Instead, spend time developing critical thinking skills, devote time to learning how to learn, train yourself to think like an entrepreneur, and invest in your professional network actively and early. It is important to be analytical, but it's equally important to be agile.

VP: The ability to learn how to learn, across one's long life, is something that is indeed vital. I'd like to close with a look at leaders-they will also be tested by these transformations. What advice do you have for those who will have to manage these transformations from leadership positions about how their skills may also need to change?

AS: Every leader has to be a change manager. Every leader needs to play a role in catalyzing the successful transition of their workforce.

I have all my executive education students develop a personalized transition plan each year to prepare them for the future of work. During the personal side of this exercise, they anticipate major changes in their current occupation and industry, define concrete steps to prepare for transition over a five-year horizon, and identify technical skills and forms of continuing education to invest in.

In the leadership side of the exercise, they identify the job roles in their organization most likely to be altered by AI, identify the job roles most important to target for aggressive retention and growth, lay out a basic strategy for transitioning workers within and out of their organization, define concrete pragmatic steps that can be taken by the people they manage or mentor, and reflect on leadership and cultural changes needed to better prepare for the future of work.

Granted, not every leader has the power to execute on all of these dimensions, but the exercise puts them in the right mindset, and it's one I recommend every leader engage in today.

VP: Arun, we appreciate your insights and unique vantage point across this complex and multifaceted landscape. The opportunities in front of us are clear and compelling. But as you note, it will require us to embrace AI in a way that is thoughtful, ethical, and human-centered. It's a big challenge with so much at stake, but in the end, clearly worth the effort to get it right. Thank you."
Backpedaling On ESG Commitments Will Inevitably Backfire,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adriandearnell/2024/09/25/backpedaling-on-esg-commitments-will-inevitably-backfire/,2024-09-25T14:44:37Z,"At a time when many companies are dialing down their prior commitments on sustainability, building trust and maintaining credibility in corporate communication has never been more important.

BlackRock, Unilever, JP Morgan Chase -- the list keeps growing when it comes to ESG backpedaling. And at a time when more eyes than ever are watching for slip-ups, not following through on commitments exposes a company to reputational risks.

However, these self-inflicted wounds are avoidable as long as companies recognize the importance of balancing financial performance and ESG commitments, and make a robust internal review before taking a public stand on hot-button topics.

BlackRock is learning that lesson now. After announcing a strong stance on ESG in 2020 ,""committed to putting sustainability at the center of our investment process,"" the world's largest asset manager recently backed away, citing higher-than-expected costs and lower-than-expected returns on green energy and other ESG-related assets.

Larry Fink, BlackRock's CEO, explained the change as consistent with the company's core mission to maximize returns to investors. ""If a customer wants to invest 100% in decarbonization, and financial profitability is not its priority, we will invest accordingly,"" Fink told the French daily Le Figaro in June 2024. ""But most of our investors want us to provide them with the best financial profitability."" He added, ""In reality, the energy transition is much more complex than we imagined.""

BlackRock's 2024 about-face, versus its 2020 stance, has generated scathing criticism, with the company being accused of having taken an opportunistic stand rather than showing genuine commitment to ESG goals.

Of course companies, like individuals, are entitled to change their minds. But those changes should not modify the core of the company's values. Values should be unshakeable and not subject to short-term market forces.

BlackRock's mistake was that it committed to an ESG course of action without fully realizing the implications. Once its ESG commitment was deemed too expensive and threatened to harm financial performance, the company backtracked on what it had previously upheld as a bedrock principle.

BlackRock is not alone. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently drew sharp criticism from U.S. senators over the bank's continued financing of fossil-fuel, despite longstanding public statements in support of battling climate change.

Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer goods giant, has been long seen as a leader in sustainability. The new CEO, Hein Schumacher, recently announced the company would be dialing down some of its previously stated ESG targets. Did the backpedaling occur because stock analysts had criticized Unilever for over-emphasizing ESG instead of financial performance?

Contrast these companies with the likes of Patagonia, known for its consistent alignment of business practices with environmental values. In its 51-year history, Patagonia has maintained profitability while staying true to its core environmental beliefs. The fact that Patagonia is a small, privately held company no doubt helps it stay insulated from stock-market pressures.

However, Costco, the third largest retailer in the world after WalMart and Amazon, regularly features on most-admired lists because of its competitive prices which are founded on good labor practices, good relations with suppliers, and good customer service. Costco's net income has risen steadily for the past four years.

Writing in Harvard Business Review, Andrew Winston analyzes the types of attacks companies are now facing on ESG and sustainability. While he notes that the criticism may be motivated by different interests, issues, or politics, his advice to companies is largely the same. ""Do what fits the values of the company and what seems right."" Further, ""Build better, more resilient businesses that profit by helping solve big challenges.""

For Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey, merging business practice, values, and corporate communications is simple. ""...for my basic product, I want to be water positive, I want to have a circular economy on my packaging, and I want to grow our business with less sugar -- you can call it anything you like, but no one with common sense says those are bad ideas.""

In the corporate world, consistency is still the key to maintaining the trust of investors, employees, suppliers, customers, and other external stakeholders such as ratings agencies and NGOs. So, from a communications standpoint remember to:

- Communicate genuine commitment to the company's values.

- Develop strategies for transparent and consistent communication that build and preserve trust."
Before & After: How The ACA Is A Step Forward For Small Businesses,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rhettbuttle/2024/09/25/before--after-how-the-aca-is-a-step-forward-for-small-businesses/,2024-09-25T13:37:39Z,"Rhett Buttle covers the intersection of the private and public sector.

Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released an analysis showing that 3.3 million small business owners and self-employed workers had healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace in 2022. This means that nearly one in five (18%) of small business owners and self-employed workers between the ages of 21 and 64 received coverage through the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces, compared to 6% of the rest of the population in that age range.

""The Affordable Care Act has been transformative for millions of small business owners and entrepreneurs who rely on the law for affordable and reliable health care coverage, including 3.3 million in 2022. The Affordable Care Act allows Americans with dreams of starting their own businesses to pursue new opportunities without fear of being unable to access or afford health insurance, creating a more dynamic and productive economy over the long run,"" said U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen.

This is roughly the 10th year that the Affordable Care Act has been in place since it opened to individuals in 2014. When one looks at the success of a monumental piece of legislation like this one, it is important to remember the landscape before it was implemented and how things have changed since then. Here is that picture for Main Streets across America.

Before: The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, with the Marketplace opening on January 1, 2014. Before it opened, many small business owners and self-employed workers were not able to obtain health insurance through their jobs and had limited options for purchasing affordable, high-quality health coverage. In most cases, the coverage was expensive and sometimes denied due to pre-existing conditions, and the quality of the plans was very inconsistent and hard to understand or compare.

After: Today, any aspiring entrepreneur can pursue launching a business without the fear of not being able to obtain healthcare coverage. In 2022, nearly one in five (18%) of small business owners and self-employed workers ages 21-64 relied on the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces for coverage. This in turn has encouraged entrepreneurship, freeing workers to leave large employers and not be forced to stay there because of insurance. A record 19 million business applications have been filed since the Biden-Harris Administration took office.

""It is no coincidence that the Biden-Harris Administration has seen a historic Small Business Boom alongside a surge in Marketplace enrollment among small business owners. With 19.4 million new business applications since the President took office, millions of entrepreneurs continue to rely on the Affordable Care Act for health insurance in order to pursue their American dream of business ownership,"" said U.S. Small Business Administration Administrator Isabel Casillas Guzman.

""Small business owners and entrepreneurs are the engine of America's economy. We are ensuring small businesses have access to affordable health care so they can focus on starting and growing businesses, not on whether they can afford health coverage,"" said Vice President Kamala Harris. ""I'm proud that over 4 million small business owners and self-employed workers have coverage through the ACA, up from 3.3 million in 2022. I will always support small businesses and invest in entrepreneurs by strengthening and expanding the ACA, and by rejecting Republican efforts to repeal it.""

This data also shows that the small business owners and workers are also utilizing the enhancements to the Affordable Care Act Premium Tax Credits, which can lower monthly payments. The American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act made the credit available to people purchasing coverage through the Marketplaces by increasing the amount of it for individuals with low and moderate incomes and expanding the eligibility for people with middle incomes facing high premiums. In 2022, more than 2.7 million (82%) of small business owners and self-employed workers claimed the Premium Tax Credit, including about 285,000 taxpayers with incomes over 400% of the poverty level. Unfortunately, these expanded tax credits are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025 if Congress does not take action to extend them or make them permanent.

""Marketplace enrollment has surged under the Biden-Harris Administration's economic policies, which have made premiums far more affordable for American small businesses and entrepreneurs,"" said Secretary Yellen.

In addition, the data showed that small business owners and self-employed workers accounted for 28% of all individuals covered by Affordable Care Act Marketplace coverage. In looking at this, one can see the importance of stable healthcare options to Main Streets across the country.

Vice President Kamala Harris would prefer voters not remember her role in the economic disaster of the past three and a half years. She has distanced herself from President Biden and the agenda bearing his name, ""Bidenomics.""

But in this life, we are judged by our actions and the company we keep. The truth is that Harris was the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the budget-busting packages that supercharged inflation. One of her closest advisers today, Brian Deese, is the architect of ""Bidenomics.""

Voters who think Harris would bring a new outlook to the White House should think again. If she is elected, the same old crew would be in charge. That means the next four years would look exactly like the last three and a half.

Prices have risen more than 20% across the board since Biden and Harris took office. The prices of many family staples have risen by more. Inflation has fallen from its peak of 9.6% in the summer of 2021, but it is still well above the Fed's 2% target.

TRUMP HAS A PLAN FOR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY, HARRIS DOES NOT

Democrats and the financial press are declaring ""Mission Accomplished,"" but this is a calamitous economic record that has left Americans worse off and resentful. The blame falls squarely on Bidenomics and its promoters, such as Harris and Deese.

Bidenomics was the belief that a government spending bonanza could juice the economy after the turmoil caused by a pandemic, lockdowns and supply-chain disruptions.

Deese, who served as Biden's chair of the National Economic Council from 2021 to 2023, said this agenda was based on the ""unapologetic acknowledgement"" that government action was necessary to ""correct for market failures"" and create ""strong and inclusive growth."" He contrasted Bidenomics with Reaganomics, saying the Biden-Harris approach had ""a more rational understanding of the productive and constructive role that the public sector and public investment can play.""

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

The original sin of Bidenomics was the American Rescue Plan, which became law in March 2021. Harris was hardly a spectator to this event. She cast the tie-breaking vote for it in the Senate. The bill injected an eye-popping $1.9 trillion into an economy already awash in easy money.

The result of this spending binge was predictable: immediate and persistent inflation.

However, the Biden administration downplayed the damage as temporary and attempted to shift the blame. In 2021, Deese claimed that ""short-term inflationary pressures"" were ""not the issue."" He later predicted that inflation would ""moderate"" in 2022.

In fact, inflation hit a 41-year high in 2022 and still has not returned to the 2% annual rate considered normal. To this day, Harris crows that inflation is ""under 3%."" They can move the goalposts, but they can't change the facts.

CONSERVATIVE ECONOMISTS POUR COLD WATER ON HARRIS' NEW SMALL-BUSINESS TAX PROPOSAL

Worse still, the Biden-Harris administration used inflation as an excuse to double down on the very agenda that caused it. Concerns about inflation ""underscore why it's so important that we move forward"" with the next installment of Bidenomics, Deese said in 2021.

That would turn into the perversely titled ""Inflation Reduction Act,"" another debt bomb designed to promote green energy. Goldman Sachs estimates that the IRA's climate subsidies cost an additional $1.2 trillion, more than three times what its supporters claimed.

To no one's surprise but the administration's, the result of this spending was sustained inflation. Casey Mulligan at the Committee to Unleash Prosperity found that the administration's spending policies accounted for about half of the inflation our economy has suffered. A better name for the bill would've been the Inflation Acceleration Act.

It's little wonder Harris is running from the record of the past three and a half years. Democrats have dropped the term ""Bidenomics"" as swiftly as they dropped the man. Instead, Harris speaks of an ""opportunity economy."" Her boosters promote her approach as ""fair capitalism"" or ""middle-class capitalism.""

But if you peek behind the curtain, it's clear Harris hasn't learned from her mistakes in office. To the contrary, she is carrying forward the administration's belief that spending and government are the solution, not the problem.

Deese, who should've been sidelined after his plans caused the worst inflation in 40 years, is back as a trusted adviser. Harris' plans bear his fingerprints, from $25,000 government checks for homebuyers to a $6,000 payoff for new parents.

Harris told CNN host Dana Bash in an August interview that her priority on ""Day One"" as president would be to start implementing her economic agenda. The vice president said one of her ""highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class,"" arguing that while she believes the Biden administration has done ""good work"" on the economy, ""there's more to do.""

Harris will speak Wednesday at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, where Politico reports she's set to deliver substantive comments on the economy. An anonymous Harris aide told the publication the vice president's speech will paint her as being ""pragmatic"" on the economy and as ""a capitalist"" who ""understands the limitations of government and has always sought to take good ideas from wherever they come and harness the power of innovation."" The speech is expected to include new proposals on manufacturing and ""lowering costs, investing in American innovation and entrepreneurship, and leading the world in the industries of the future,"" the aide told Politico. Harris could then elaborate more on her economic agenda Wednesday evening, as she'll sit down with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle for her first one-on-one interview on a major network since becoming the Democratic nominee.

Harris' economic policy agenda is largely in line with Biden's economic platform, with some tweaks to emphasize causes that are more important to her, like the child tax credit. ""Same values, different vision,"" a Harris aide told The Guardian. ""She's not moving far away from him on substance, she will highlight the ones that matter most to her."" The initial plans from Harris' campaign also suggest the vice president plans to be more aggressive in her policy approaches than Biden, however, as polls have suggested voters hold dim views of how the president has handled the economy. While Biden has also opposed price gouging, Harris' proposal to enable the FTC and U.S. attorneys to go after companies that hike up prices goes beyond what the president has proposed, Politico notes, and her proposed $40 million investment in the housing crisis is double the amount the Biden administration spent.

Harris' economic agenda so far hasn't gone fully in depth about her proposals, which The New York Times reports is by design. The Times reported before Harris unveiled her agenda that the Harris campaign has adopted a ""strategic vagueness"" for her economic proposals, believing that being more of a ""blank slate"" will help ward off attacks and attract more support from business groups.

Trump's economic agenda is largely focused on raising tariffs on imported goods, which Harris has said she opposes. The ex-president has also called for cutting taxes and regulations in hopes of lowering inflation, including lowering the corporate tax rate, and has encouraged increasing oil production in order to lower energy prices. In addition to his ""no tax on tips"" proposal that Harris has also endorsed, Trump has called for ending taxes on Social Security benefits, which Harris has not yet responded to. Experts believe the ex-president's proposal could speed up Social Security and Medicare becoming insolvent, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projecting exempting taxes on benefits would result in Social Security and Medicare receiving $1.6 trillion less in revenue between 2026 and 2035. The Trump campaign opposed reports of Harris' economic proposals earlier in September, with spokesperson Steven Cheung saying in a statement, ""Kamala Harris can't hide from her disastrous record of skyrocketing inflation ... Americans are struggling under the Biden-Harris economy, and now she wants to gaslight them into believing her bald-faced lies.""

41%. That's the share of voters who trust Harris more to handle the economy, according to an Associated Press/NORC poll conducted Sept. 12-16, versus 43% who trust Trump more. While Trump still maintains a narrow lead, recent polling has broadly shown voters are warming up to Harris on the economy, with polls on who voters prefer on the issue going from being strongly in Trump's favor to more of a toss up. A Washington Post analysis of five recent polls found that while Trump still leads on the economy by an average of six points, that's narrowed from a 12-point lead that the ex-president held against Biden before the president dropped out of the race.

Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in July after Biden stepped down suddenly from the presidential race, following weeks of pressure over mounting concerns about his mental fitness. While the vice president has quickly garnered Democrats' support and risen in the polls, Harris released few concrete policy proposals in the first few weeks of her campaign -- drawing some criticism as a result. The vice president has made releasing a platform on economic proposals her first priority, delivering a speech earlier in August laying out her economic platform that marked the most substantive remarks she had given on policy so far. Her focus on the economy comes as polling has repeatedly shown it's the most important issue to voters in this election cycle, with the vice president hoping to attract support amid low approval ratings for Biden's handling of the economy. Harris' August 16 speech also came days after news that inflation fell in July to its lowest point in more than three years, with federal data showing inflation at 2.9% in July, the first time it's been below 3% since March 2021."
Fox News Power Rankings: Harris ticks up and Senate Republicans take charge,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-power-rankings-harris-ticks-up-senate-republicans-take-charge,2024-09-25T13:05:33Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Republicans are set to flip the Senate for the first time this cycle in this week's Fox News Power Rankings.

Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris enjoys a small post-debate bump, three new toss-up races emerge in the House, and the GOP loses ground on the governor's map.

Two weeks after their first debate, Harris is up a point and former President Donald Trump is down the same in an average of high-quality polls.

If those numbers sound familiar, it is because they match the shifts after the first debate between President Biden and Trump four years ago.

That could be a problem for Republicans. In 2020, Trump did not narrow the polling gap that the first debate created until a stronger showing in the second. As of today, Harris and Trump have not agreed on terms for a rematch.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS THINK HARRIS DID BETTER THAN TRUMP IN DEBATE

Harris' improvement comes from independents more than any other group. They backed Trump by eight points in a Fox News survey last month but now prefer Harris by 12. Biden won independents by 15 points in the last election, so an enduring Harris lead in this group could give her an edge on election night. (Poll results among subgroups can be volatile.)

The same post-debate poll has Trump down two points among all voters, leaving the former president at 48% and Harris at 50%. A spread like that on election night gives Trump an electoral college advantage.

Further slippage in support for the former president would change that math.

Republicans have enjoyed a head start in the Senate from the beginning of this cycle. Their star candidate in Montana is doing more than anyone to get them to the finish line.

The latest forecast predicts Republicans will take at least 51 seats on election night, while Democrats are expected to take at least 47. That leaves two races in the Toss Up category.

Montana moves out of that category this week.

This state has been represented for nearly two decades by Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, one of the last rural Democrats, who has leaned on his farming background and gun rights advocacy to exceed expectations in three elections.

However, Trump won the state by 16 points in 2020, and Tester faces a strong opponent in businessman and former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy. He has run an efficient, disciplined campaign on the economy and the border.

That makes Montana a better pickup opportunity for the GOP than Ohio, which does not lean toward Trump as much as its western neighbor and where Republican candidate Bernie Moreno has made missteps on the trail.

Sheehy leads with 51% to Tester's 45% in an AARP poll conducted in late August. The incumbent Democrat is ahead among independents, but that is not enough to overcome this conservative electorate.

Sitting among the peaks that shape Montana's landscape is a mountain of cash. Over $121 million has been spent by the campaigns and outside groups so far, according to OpenSecrets, with at least $100 million more in reserved spending. That is an extraordinary sum for a race that isn't competitive at the presidential level and equates to more than $150 per registered voter.

That is what keeps this race tight. Tester has more than three times as much cash on hand as Sheehy, giving the Democrat spending money for local advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts.

If that cash can push this race back within the margin of error, Democrats have a shot at retaining the upper house.

EARLY VOTING MEANS 'ELECTION SEASON' HAS ALREADY BEGUN

Montana moves from Toss Up to Lean R.

The House is still a toss-up in the latest forecast. In fact, with three more races joining that category, it is less clear than ever which direction the lower chamber will take.

NEBRASKA GOP SENATOR OPPOSES ELECTORAL COLLEGE CHANGE THAT MAY HAVE HELPED TRUMP WIN RE-ELECTION

Finally, a sleepy gubernatorial cycle had its wake-up call last Thursday when CNN reported that North Carolina Republican Lt. Gov Mark Robinson referred to himself as a ""Black Nazi"" on a porn website he frequented between 2008 and 2012. He denied the report.

Robinson is more than embattled in this race. At least four senior staffers have resigned from his campaign, allies have jumped ship, and the Republican Governors Association is not spending another dollar on advertising.

No one knows how this will impact Trump. Voting has begun with Robinson's name a few rows down from Trump's on the ballot, and Democrats are reminding voters about the strong, consistent praise that the former president has offered Robinson. However, calcified support for Trump among Republicans and the state's history of ticket splitting should keep him competitive.

In the meantime, the Power Rankings already had the governor's race at Lean D because of previous Robinson scandals. Now, it moves to Likely D.

Voting has begun in 21 states, including Wisconsin, North Carolina, Minnesota and Virginia. By the end of the month, more than half of all states will send ballots to voters.

While many voters are expected to cast a ballot early, election day itself is only six weeks away.

Next week, vice presidential hopefuls Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, will participate in a debate hosted by CBS News in New York City. Fox News will simulcast the debate with special coverage anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum at 8:20 p.m. ET."
Financial Heavyweights Offer Mixed Forecasts On Fed's Next Move,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danirvine/2024/09/25/financial-heavyweights-offer-mixed-forecasts-on-feds-next-move/,2024-09-25T13:00:10Z,"The decision by the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates by an aggressive 50 basis points has ignited lively discourse among financial titans, each offering their unique perspectives on the potential ramifications. As the economy teeters on the precipice of uncertainty, the question that looms large is whether this monetary maneuver will catalyze a soft landing or precipitate a tumultuous descent.

Leading the optimistic camp is Goldman Sachs, with its chief financial officer, Denis Coleman, expressing confidence that the Fed's decisive action has paved the way for averting a recession. Coleman's remarks during an interview with CNBC this week resonate with the sentiment that the 50 basis-point cut signals a new trajectory for monetary policy.

In Coleman's estimation, the rate reduction should ""unlock incremental amounts of confidence"" and ""reduce the cost of capital,"" thereby fostering an environment conducive to strategic business initiatives as the year draws to a close. His projections envision a ripple effect, wherein the lower interest rates will invigorate investment backlogs and catalyze increased market activity in the forthcoming year.

Echoing the consensus among Goldman Sachs economists, Coleman insists that a recession remains an unlikely scenario. Instead, he anticipates a gradual economic recovery, particularly in Europe, fueled by an uptick in investment once the presidential election concludes and manufacturing gains momentum, buoyed by the favorable interest rate environment.

The Fed's decision to embark on this rate-cutting cycle was framed by Chair Jerome Powell as a ""recalibration"" of policy, a response to the evolving dynamics of falling inflation and rising employment risks. This recalibration, according to Coleman, aims to strike a delicate balance, enabling the central bank to lower inflation without tipping the economy into a recessionary vortex - a feat he acknowledges as a ""tricky job to manage economies through transition.""

Austan Goolsbee, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has emerged as a vocal proponent of a dovish monetary policy stance. In remarks delivered at the National Association of State Treasurers Annual Conference this week, he advocated for ""many more rate cuts over the next year"" to facilitate a soft landing for the economy.

Goolsbee's rationale is anchored in the observation that inflation has ""way down"" from its peak and has recently converged around the Fed's 2% target. Concurrently, the 4.2% unemployment rate is widely regarded as indicative of full employment, aligning with the central bank's dual mandate.

Despite the favorable economic conditions, Goolsbee emphasizes the incongruity of maintaining elevated interest rates, which he deems unsuitable for an environment where the primary objective is to sustain, rather than cool, the economy. This dissonance, he argues, necessitates a significant downward adjustment of rates to preserve the prevailing economic equilibrium.

Goolsbee's advocacy for preemptive rate cuts stems from a desire to remain proactive in steering the economy toward a soft landing. His stance is encapsulated in the notion that ""if we want a soft landing, we can't be behind the curve,"" a sentiment that resonates with the Fed's mandate to maintain a delicate balance between inflation and employment.

While Goldman Sachs exudes optimism, JPMorgan Chase's Chief Executive Officer, Jamie Dimon, strikes a more skeptical tone. Dimon's reservations stem from a belief that inflation may not dissipate as readily as anticipated, casting doubt on the notion of a seamless soft landing for the economy.

Dimon's skepticism is rooted in his conviction that ""inflation is going to go away so easily,"" as he stated on stage at The Atlantic Festival last week. This sentiment stands in stark contrast to the prevailing narrative of cooling inflationary pressures, as evidenced by the recent 2.5% year-over-year increase in overall inflation - a figure that suggests a moderating trend.

Dimon's assessment of the likelihood of a soft landing for the U.S. economy remains cautiously optimistic, hovering around a 35% to 40% chance, highlighting his reluctance to ""count [his] eggs"" prematurely.

Ultimately, the resolution of this debate will unfold over time as the economy responds to the Fed's monetary maneuvers and the interplay of various macroeconomic forces. Divergent discourse is a testament to the enduring complexity of economic forecasting, where nuanced insights and prudent risk management strategies will remain invaluable assets for navigating the next chapter of this saga."
Balancing Books And Babies: Challenges Of Student Parents In College,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisongriffin/2024/09/25/balancing-books-and-babies-challenges-of-student-parents-in-college/,2024-09-25T12:50:13Z,"These learners are balancing two demanding worlds: the challenge of managing coursework and classroom deadlines while also meeting the needs of their children, often with little sleep and few breaks. Many times, these students stop out due to the significant time and financial constraints of navigating postsecondary education while raising children. For student parents, leaving higher education before earning a credential has shown to have a detrimental effect on economic mobility and the creation of a college-going culture in families.

Student parents navigate a complex balancing act that demands new attention from policymakers, higher education leaders and community advocates to ensure they - and their children - can successfully navigate a future that includes postsecondary education success.

The Hidden Struggles of Student Parents

Student parents make up a substantial portion of the higher education population. According to the Institute for Women's Policy Research, nearly 4 million students, or 22% of all undergraduates, are raising children while attending college. A deeper look at the student parent population reveals that women make up more than 70% of student parents and just over half (51%) are Black, Hispanic or Native American.

Yet, the needs of these students often remain overlooked or unresolved in traditional campus settings.

Last spring, Three Frame Media released a docuseries entitled, ""Raising Up: A Student Parent Film Series,"" which investigates the barriers student parents face when pursuing higher education and profiles the campus and community leaders who are supporting them and helping to create generational impact.

""By elevating the personal stories of student parents, as well as the ways in which many forward-thinking institutions are taking action to support these learners, we wanted to highlight the path forward for policymakers and institutional leaders eager to ensure that the promise of higher education is within reach for student parents and their families,"" said Jaye Fenderson, a former college admissions officer, award-winning filmmaker and co-director of Raising Up.

As Fenderson found during her interviews with student parents, the challenges faced by this cohort of learners are multifaceted. Balancing coursework with childcare responsibilities, managing financial pressures, and dealing with time constraints are just a few of the hurdles student parents must overcome. Many of these students report feeling isolated on campus, struggling to find peers who understand their unique situation.

""Student parents are some of the most driven learners you'll find, but the lack of institutional support makes it incredibly difficult for them to thrive, and they often feel like they exist in the margins of campus life,"" said Amber Angel, program officer at ECMC Foundation, which launched a five-year $10 million Single Mother Student Success Initiative in 2021 and recently announced its updated grant making strategy for single mother student parents. ""Many institutions aren't even aware of how many student parents they have on campus because most colleges aren't collecting the data. That sense of invisibility only compounds the struggles these students already face and reinforces the perception that they don't belong.""

The Impact of Supportive Policies

Research shows that when provided with adequate support, student parents not only succeed but often outperform their peers. Their motivation, coupled with the right resources, can lead to impressive academic achievements and improved outcomes for their families.

However, the current support systems in many colleges and universities fall short. Childcare facilities on campuses are often limited, non-existent or under-resourced. Financial aid packages often do not account for the full cost of raising a child while studying. Inflexible class schedules and attendance policies can create additional stress for those juggling parental duties with academic responsibilities.

""We know student parents are facing barriers to entry that are challenging, but not insurmountable,"" said Chastity Lord, president and CEO of Jeremiah Program, a nonprofit that has been advocating for a two-generational strategy in support of student parents for 27 years. ""For example, we found at one institution, student parents - mostly mothers - who declared a major in the sciences were required to participate in labs. Those labs started at 7:30 in the morning. Do you know what is not open before 7:30 in the morning - most childcare centers. Those student parents are changing their majors from a pathway that leads to a high salary profession because of an outdated campus policy that keeps them from being able to leverage childcare.""

Calls for Change: What Can Be Done?

To address challenges faced by student parents, policy leaders and higher education administrators need to implement comprehensive strategies that recognize and support student parents.

The Today's Students Coalition (TSC) is a group of the nation's leading policy and advocacy member organizations, affiliates and student advocates united to champion federal policy changes that better serve today's students. For the last four years, TSC and its member organizations have supported a Congressional Resolution that recognizes September as Student Parent Month. This year, U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (R-KS) and Tom Carper (D-DE) introduced a resolution honoring and recognizing the millions of student parents on college and university campuses.

In addition to policies championed by TSC, there are a number of ways in which policy leaders - at both the federal and state level - can support student parents.

Expand On-Campus Childcare: Increasing the availability of affordable, quality childcare on or near campuses can significantly reduce one of the biggest barriers for student parents. A report from the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) highlights the states that have expanded eligibility requirements for childcare subsidies and other financial assistance.

Flexible Academic Policies: Implementing policies that allow for more flexible attendance, assignment deadlines, and course scheduling can help student parents manage their dual responsibilities more effectively.

Financial Aid Reform: For many students, a typical cost of attendance (COA) calculation includes tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, transportation and other personal expenses. The COA is the upper limit on the amount of financial aid a student can receive. In the case of a student parent, better accounting for the full cost of attendance - including childcare expenses - could alleviate financial stress.

Dedicated Support Services: According to research from Ascend at The Aspen Institute and the Jed Foundation, launching specific support services for student parents, such as counseling, peer mentoring programs, and parenting resources, can foster a more inclusive campus environment.

Housing Solutions: Providing family-friendly housing options on or near campus can address a critical need for many student parents. In California, the governor and legislature established the Higher Education Student Housing Grant Program (HESHG), which aimed to address housing needs of nearly 12,000 low-income students each year, including nearly 200 student parents and families.

""Parenting students go to college to help change the economic trajectory for themselves and their children,"" said Tanya Ang, executive director of the Today's Students Coalition. ""Single moms with a four year degree earn, on average, $625,000 more than those with a high school education. When a student is faced with barrier after barrier, it is impossible for them to finish a postsecondary program. Removing these barriers has a multi-generational impact on not just that family, but the American workforce and economy.""

The Role of Higher Education Leaders

College and university administrators play a crucial role in implementing these changes. By prioritizing the needs of student parents, they can create more inclusive and supportive learning environments. Some institutions have already taken steps in the right direction. For example, leaders at Howard Community College in Columbia, Maryland, have established the Parent Scholars Program, which provides low-income students with academic coaching, career counseling, and personalized goal-setting to help them achieve their academic and professional goals. The program also offers access to childcare, healthcare, and community support services.

""Every student can thrive with the right resources and nurturing, but a culture of being seen and appreciated makes the campus experience authentic for student parents,"" said Dr. Daria Willis, president of Howard Community College, and a student parent herself. ""Study spaces, childcare, and scholarships are the undercurrent for the mentoring our student parents need, and help strengthen relationships with faculty that power a full community around our families. A two-generational effort is how we create lasting impact in teaching and learning.""

A Call to Action

Supporting student parents is not just a matter of equity- it's an investment in the future. When student parents succeed, it has a ripple effect, improving outcomes for their children and contributing to breaking cycles of poverty.

""Student parents represent some of the most tenacious, dedicated, visionary, committed students on college and university campuses across the nation,"" said Lord. ""By showing up every day, student parents are saying to the rest of the campus that 'I will do what is necessary to change the trajectory of my life and my choices directly impact the trajectory of my children, and their children.' That is a powerful message, particularly, when you are not being recognized, celebrated, and centered as a student parent.""

It is crucial that policymakers, educational leaders, and communities come together to address the needs of student parents. By doing so, we not only support these determined individuals and their families but also strengthen our educational institutions and society as a whole. The journey of a student parent is challenging, but with the right support, it can be incredibly rewarding. It's time to fully embrace and empower these resilient learners, recognizing that their success is our collective success.

""If we can get college right for student parents, we have the opportunity to impact entire families for generations to come,"" said Fenderson."

The 37-year-old opened with a pitch that evoked fintech's go-go days of 2021 -- a time when San Francisco-based Plaid raised $425 million in funding at a $13.4 billion valuation, making Perret briefly a paper billionaire. ""The optimism and the energy in fintech is back,"" he said, later adding, ""the fintech-ification of everything is happening everywhere.""

Despite such public bravado, Perret is clear-eyed about the challenges he faces as he tries to recharge Plaid's mojo and ready it for going public, perhaps in 2026. He made his mark building the data plumbing for fintech-connecting consumers and their bank accounts to new services provided by the likes of Venmo, Chime, Robinhood and Affirm. Now he's aiming to build products, too, by leveraging that connectivity and the vast troves of financial information Plaid continuously collects on 100 million-plus consumers.

Perret is creating services in three lines of business: credit-risk analytics, fraud prevention and pay-by-bank (where you pay directly from your bank account instead of with a credit or debit card). What they all have in common is that Plaid's existing network of connections could give it an edge.

With many of the fintechs it serves in the doldrums, Plaid's revenues grew only 12% in 2023, down from a 23% growth rate in 2022, according to people familiar with its financials. Yet it still booked $308 million in revenue and is on track for 20% top-line growth in 2024, sources say.

WHY IT MATTERS Perret and his fellow executives describe the company as being at an ""inflection point"" and poised for much faster expansion. But big challenges remain. One is that the three new product areas Plaid is targeting are all intensely competitive. Another is that, with 1,100 people, the company is no longer a small, nimble startup, yet it will need to make fast, difficult decisions on where to cut and invest.

The psychological contract in the workplace -- once characterized by long-term employment and clear career ladders -- has given way to a more fluid, tenuous relationship. But leaders can help bridge the gap by being clear and honest in all communication, and creating spaces for employees to voice their concerns without fear of repercussions. And actions speak louder than words: Follow through on verbal commitments, even if they are small.

"A Freelance Pioneer Talks Freelancing Past, Present And Future",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonyounger/2024/09/25/a-freelance-pioneer-talks-freelancing-past-present-and-future/,2024-09-25T12:41:24Z,"Few pioneers of the freelance revolution have had more iconic experiences, or befriended and mentored so many, as Alvaro Oliveira. Now Chief Talent Officer of Andela, and formerly heading up both Talent and Engineering, his leadership over the years has quietly created much of what we now take for granted in the talent economy. Beginning in 2011 and working remotely as employee #1 and head of Talent Operations at Toptal, he and his team were an early and exceptional example of distributed teamwork, with members WFH from Germany, Italy, Brazil and Silicon Valley to develop the vaunted Toptal talent matching system.

From Toptal, Oliveira moved to consulting and eventually Mechanism. But after two years of building startups within Mechanism, he missed the action and returned to freelancing as a senior executive of Andela. At Andela he is innovating again, in this case having brought Engineering and Talent together.

Forbes was fortunate to catch up with Oliveira and talked about both the early days of freelancing, what he sees as the current strengths and challenges facing contingent work, and what the long term future might look like.

1. You were Toptal employee #1. How did you connect with Taso and Breanden? What were the early days like?

""Before joining Toptal in 2011 as their first employee, I was a freelance software developer. Taso and Breanden hired me to create Talent Operations and recruit a community of freelancers like me. Back then, we faced basic challenges: convincing top talent of the appeal of cross-border freelancing and growing and managing an international talent pool. We quickly realized that simply finding clients a ""Java developer"" wasn't enough. We had to certify freelancers and build a platform that matched them with clients based on specific experience and expertise. It was a time of great creativity and collaboration.""

2. Until recently you led Engineering and Talent at Andela, another pioneer of the freelance revolution. It's an interesting combination of roles. How was it helpful to Andela and its clients?

""I liken leading both Engineering and Talent to the confluence of two fast moving rivers ending at Iguazu Falls in Brazil. The Engineering team builds the infrastructure supporting clients and talent, while the Talent team ensures efficient matching. Having both teams under my leadership made alignment and issue resolution easier. Our goal was to provide a great experience for both clients, who want access to top talent and easy onboarding, and freelancers, who seek interesting, well-paid work with good clients. It was a helpful way to organize at the time, but nothing lasts forever. When launching the Andela Talent Cloud, it made sense for Product and Engineering to come under one leader.""

3. Looking back on your career -- Toptal, Mechanism, and Andela -- how has freelancing changed? First, what's gotten better over time?

""Freelancing has evolved remarkably, largely due to the growth of remote work. Here are the specifics that excite me: First, we've gained mainstream acceptance: Hiring remote talent was once novel and viewed skeptically but now companies embrace the flexibility and diverse talent pool freelancing offers. Second, technological advancements have been amazing: Tools for onboarding, collaboration, and project management have dramatically improved. Third, software allows us now to quickly set up remote development environments in minutes rather than days or weeks. And fourth, payment options now offer great flexibility in payments, currency conversions, and even cryptocurrency. This makes freelancing more attractive and accessible.""

4. Let's look at the other side. What has freelancing lost as the industry has grown that we should try to keep or regain?

""As freelancing has grown, I worry that maintaining trust and authenticity is challenging. There seem many more attempts at misrepresentation: groups posing as individual freelancers or freelancers subcontracting work without client consent. Jeopardizing client trust damages all of us. As a global community, we need to continue to professionalize: greater self-regulation, more transparency, a common code of conduct, enhancing quality measures and verification, and better education for both clients and freelancers.""

5. You've worked with many big corporate clients. How well are we building enterprise adoption?

""Great question. Enterprise adoption of freelancing hinges on integration, not disruption. Remember, big corporates want to avoid risk. We have to respect and fit into established corporate processes -- procurement, legal, payment systems -- if we want their business. Partnering with Procurement and HR, not bypassing them, helps build stronger relationships and helps hiring managers access freelance talent more easily and with less resistance.""

6. You've built several large freelance talent communities. What's most helpful in engaging freelancers?

""To engage freelancers, communicate meaningfully, listen to them, and be transparent and genuine. At Andela, we use regular surveys to understand what our talent wants. The biggest challenge is helping freelancers improve their ability to attract the amount and kind of work they desire, starting with helping them clarify their goals and building impactful personal reputations.""

7. What do you see for the future as the freelance ecosystem progresses?

""It's exciting! The future of freelancing is the future of work. Companies are focusing more on tasks than ""roles"" and realizing the need for workforce flexibility. Freelancing increasingly offers an alternative to full-time employment at scale. I see both consolidation and growth on the horizon, with a few major platforms standardizing processes. The lines between traditional staffing, freelancing, and the future of work, especially for high-skilled labor, are blurring. Innovative companies are beginning to see freelancers as core contributors to their most important work.""

8. When you think about the freelance industry overall, we're still in early stages. Are there industry parallels you find helpful in anticipating change?

""Drawing parallels with other disruptive platforms really helps us to anticipate change. Just as digital platforms simplified complex processes in other domains, technologies are coming that enable leaders to quickly assemble skilled global teams to meet important project objectives. These platforms will manage hiring, onboarding, and payment complexities. Like ride-sharing apps simplified transportation or streaming services revolutionized content delivery, platforms will make team assembly seamless and efficient. This transformation will reshape how we think about work, team structures, and organizational boundaries.""

9. What competencies do you look for in marketplace leaders?

""I look for marketplace leaders who genuinely understand the global landscape. Working for a U.S.-based company operating worldwide, it's important to recognize the nuances and challenges of different markets. Leaders need to be masters of remote work -- not just comfortable with video calls but leveraging productivity and collaboration tools to attract top talent and create effective remote environments. Lastly, they should embody the principles of the freelance marketplace in their own operations. Too often, marketplaces don't practice what they preach. The most effective leaders rely on freelancing to build and grow their businesses.""

10. What advice do you have for new or beginner freelancers just starting their journey?

""This is an excellent time to consider a freelancing career but be patient and thoughtful. First, freelancing differs from full-time employment. It offers flexibility and choice but comes with its own challenges. You've got to be a self-driven learner. Take advantage of online resources and communities to continuously improve your skills. Approach your freelance career with a business mindset. Think of yourself as a company: be organized, proactive in seeking work, and prepared for income fluctuations. Develop a solid financial plan to prepare for slow periods and time off. As a freelancer, you're responsible for your work-life balance. Calculate your annual earnings needs, recognizing you won't -- and shouldn't -- work every day of the year. Plan for vacations and downtime, understanding the financial implications. Successful freelancing is about embracing freedom while taking on the responsibilities of being your own boss. With the right preparation, you can build a rewarding and sustainable career in today's dynamic work environment."""
Why Interest Rates May Rise Again Sooner Than You Think,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/09/25/why-interest-rates-may-rise-again-sooner-than-you-think/,2024-09-25T12:29:46Z,"Rate cuts are finally here. So will we actually hit that vaunted ""soft landing"" everyone's been talking about?

Well, I've got a (contrarian, naturally!) take that I know most people haven't thought about -- especially since last week's jumbo 50-point rate cut dropped:

What if we hit a ""no landing"" scenario, where the economy ticks along and inflation comes back?

I'm bringing up that unpleasant idea because, usually in a rate-hiking cycle like the one that just ended, the central bank pushes the Fed funds rate higher until it breaks something.

But this time, it's not clear it has.

In fact, when it looked like it finally had -- when Silicon Valley Bank and friends crumbled to dust in March 2023 -- Jay blinked, and pumped liquidity into the market through the back door, a move we've referred to as ""Quiet QE"" here many times before:

With that in mind, last week's oversized cut was understandable: The Fed has been keen to take its foot off the brake for a while now. Now that inflation is close(-ish!) to its 2% target, it's making its move.

But here's the thing: The government's deficit spending is completely out of control. It is possible, perhaps probable, that Uncle Sam will overwhelm Powell.

For fiscal 2024, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a $1.9 trillion deficit on $4.9 trillion in tax receipts. (And yes, this is the CBO that paints its projections with rose-colored ink.) So we have nearly $5 trillion in revenues, and almost $7 trillion in expenditures.

A 40% overshoot.

Give me an extra $2 trillion, and I'll show you a good economy! But the resulting monetary inflation could flow back into consumer price inflation. So how do we profit if rates bottom before the media expects them to?

Here's an answer that might surprise you: We're buying a company that lends money to small businesses.

We're going with a small-business lender because an economy that's nicely humming along will encourage companies -- especially smaller, domestic firms seeing strong demand -- to expand in the near term.

In the long run, if rates show a hint of moving up, these same firms are also likely to try to front-run them by moving up their expansion plans.

It reminds me of the ""refi wave"" of 2020.

Remember that? I sure do. Your income strategist nearly missed the window to get in on it, despite many reminders from my wife. Fortunately, I managed to wake up and lock in a 2%+ mortgage before rates skyrocketed (and I wound up sleeping on the couch!).

I bring this up because we could see something similar on the business side: At any hint of rates bottoming, I expect the nation's companies to borrow more upfront to ""lock in"" an attractive rate, just like homeowners did.

And Ares Capital (ARCC) will be here for it.

Ares is a business development company (BDC), a class of firms that lend to small businesses. These days it's nearly impossible to get a business loan from a bank, so BDCs have stepped in to fill the gap, providing debt, equity and other finance solutions.

A key thing to keep in mind about BDCs is that they get special tax privileges, and in exchange, they must return at least 90% of their taxable profits to shareholders as dividends. They trade just like regular common stocks, with tickers we buy and sell.

(If this sounds like a real estate investment trust, or REIT, to you, it's because REITs get the same deal from Uncle Sam.)

As with REITs, the tax savings mean more money available to send out to us as dividends, juicing the yields on these stocks. (ARCC, as we'll discuss momentarily, pays an outsized 9.5% dividend today.)

Ares, unlike many BDCs, builds real long-term value (I've been hard on BDCs in the past for chasing too many bad loans instead of creating shareholder value). Ares was, for example, one of the only BDCs that kept on lending in 2020.

On the dividend front, the company's 61 cents a share earnings last quarter easily covered the 48-cent per share payout. A 79% payout ratio is great in the land of BDCs.

And about that dividend: Ares not only yields 9.5% but has a history of hiking its payout. I know I don't have to tell you that this is a rare setup in dividend-land: We usually have to pick between a payout that grows (but with a low current yield) or a high yield now.

ARCC gives us both!

Look at this chart, generated through our recently upgraded ""toy"" here at Contrarian Outlook -- our Income Calendar dividend tracker:

The ""bump"" at the end of 2022 was a special dividend. Ares keeps a ""spillover"" of extra earnings that it pays out to shareholders periodically, or it may choose to keep these funds on hand for a rainy lending day.

Plus, Ares increased its net asset value (NAV) over the past year. And those gains may begin to accelerate with a reheating economy."
Why Vibes Will Likely Determine Harris vs Trump Presidential Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcuscollins/2024/09/25/why-vibes-will-likely-decide-the-harris-vs-trump-presidential-election/,2024-09-25T11:34:14Z,"In an era when baseless pet-eating conspiracy theories and false claims about campaign rally crowd sizes have become standard fare in the contemporary political discourse, a surprising factor has emerged as the game-changer in the upcoming presidential election: vibes.

That's right -- the vibes, the distinct emotional response we experience when interacting with the world around us. The vibes will determine whether former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris will take office in 2025. It won't be policies that will sway voters at the ballot box but the candidate's ability to connect on an emotional level.

But just how effective can vibes really be? If science is any indication, the answer would be ""quite,"" in fact. According to the late Nobel laureate in economics, Daniel Kahneman, most of our decisions are made intuitively based on the emotional tags we've placed on our memory associations, not through rational data processing. Instead, our experiences and worldviews give meaning to the information we encounter in our daily lives, which informs how we think because of what we feel -- the vibes.

We are not rational human beings; we are emotional, rationalizing beings who disproportionately make most of our decisions based on shortcut heuristics and intangible feelings. Vibes determine what we buy, where we go, who we date, and, in the case of this election, how we'll vote -- not because of the substance of the candidates' policies but because of how they resonate in our hearts and minds.

I suppose it's not that surprising at all. The truth is that we've always made our electoral decisions based on emotions and only partially on rationality and policy positions. For instance, after the 1960 debate between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy, Americans discounted Nixon because they said he looked sick and worn under the broadcast lights of the first-ever televised presidential debate. The idea of a presumably ill president did not meet the vibe check, so people soared on Nixon, if only marginally. That said, in a race as closely contested as the polls suggest this election will be, every vote matters, and the vibes will have an impact.

I personally remember watching Bill Clinton play the saxophone on the Arsenio Hall show in sunglasses and thinking, ""How cool is this guy? That's my kind of president."" Like many Americans, I didn't know his policies -- granted, I was only thirteen years old -- but I definitely felt the vibes that framed Clinton in a favorable light in my mind and, more broadly, within the cultural zeitgeist. Unfortunately, Hilary Clinton didn't evoke such positive emotions in the hearts and minds of the American public, which plagued her 2016 presidential run.

The way a candidate makes us feel, the cultural touchstones they reference, and how well they align with our worldview are simply more influential than their stance on specific issues. If, for no other reason, in most cases, most Americans aren't fully aware of how government works or a politician's stance on a political matter. The man-on-the-street interviews by Comedy Central's The Daily Show Jordan Klepper provide convincing evidence for this fact. Klepper interviews Trump supporters at his rallies and asks them questions about his policy stance and questionable antics. Their responses are both comical and eye-opening. Although consequential policies are on the ballot, vibes will determine which will lead the Oval Office.

What's more, even when it comes to policy, we are equally drawn to vibes over empirical evidence, as in the case of the economy. Despite the objective indicators of a strong economy, some Americans believe the economy is in a worse state than it was during the worst part of the pandemic. That's not because it is, per se, as much as it is because of what we feel. Emotions are just that influential.

Again, this shift towards ""vibe politics"" is not entirely new, but it has certainly been amplified by social networking technologies and the rapid spread of cultural trends across society. Candidates who successfully tap into the zeitgeist and create a sense of cultural congruence with their target voters may find themselves with a significant advantage. The way a candidate makes us feel, the cultural touchstones they reference, and how well they align with our worldview can, therefore, be more influential than their stance on specific issues. If a recent Harvard Institute of Politics poll is indication, these benefits can be be substantial.

According to the poll that survey 18-to-29-year-olds nationwide, Harris is seemingly outperforming Trump on the vibes check with this cohort with regard to empathy (+33), relatability (+24), and honesty (+22). Of course, this is no indication that these individuals will vote, but it certainly signs potential advantages for race that is assumed to be neck and neck.

The impact of vibes -- as socially constructed, shared feelings -- extends beyond just likability. It influences how voters perceive and interpret information about candidates and issues based on the translation and perception of others. If my people say it's no good, it must be so, and, therefore, we end up holding the same position to promote social solidarity among us. The notion of perceived ubiquity and concurrence is simply more influential than objective facts.

This phenomenon presents both opportunities and challenges for political campaigns. On one hand, it opens up new avenues for connecting with voters through cultural touch points and emotional appeals. Conversely, it risks further polarization as voters increasingly gravitate towards candidates who simply ""feel right"" rather than those who might have the most comprehensive or realistic policy proposals.

As the election approaches, campaign strategists grapple with the challenge of harnessing the power of vibes while maintaining substance. The candidate who manages to strike the right balance between emotional resonance and policy substance may well find themselves with a decisive edge come election day.

In a political landscape where facts are often disputed, and trust in institutions is low, the intangible quality of vibes could be the deciding factor in who takes office. As voters head to the polls, they may find themselves swayed not just by what candidates say but by how they make them feel. Are you feeling joy or vitriol? That's the choice, and that choice is yours to make -- but choose wisely."
Empowering Africa's Sports And Cultural Ecosystem: Insights From NBA Africa's Triple-Double Accelerator And Startup Founders,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sindiswamabunda/2024/09/25/empowering-africas-sports-and-cultural-ecosystem-insights-from-nba-africas-triple-double-accelerator-and-startup-founders/,2024-09-25T11:27:39Z,"Africa's digital economy is on the rise, and with a youthful population rapidly increasing, the continent is positioning itself as a global hub for innovation. By 2030, it is estimated that young Africans will account for 42% of the world's youth and 75% of those under age 35 in Africa, offering vast potential to transform various industries, including sports and the creative economy.

In an interview with Forbes.com ahead of the NBA Africa Triple-Double Accelerator Demo Day in New York City, Clare Akamanzi, CEO of NBA Africa, shared more about the program and underscored the transformative power of Africa's youthful demographic. ""Africa is made up of young people trying to make the continent better than what their parents experienced,"" she stated, highlighting the critical importance of harnessing this vibrant energy for innovation and growth.

Forbes.com also spoke with two of the ten finalists in the accelerator, providing insights into their journeys and the innovations they are bringing to the forefront.

The NBA Triple-Double Accelerator, developed in partnership with ALX Ventures, aims to enhance Africa's sports ecosystem and support creative industries across the continent. The accelerator received an overwhelming 700 applications, from which 10 finalists from seven African countries were selected for an intensive mentorship program. Today, these finalists will pitch their products to a panel of international industry leaders at the NBA headquarters in New York City.

""This platform was created to assist young people in bringing their ideas to life and taking them to market,"" explained Akamanzi. ""Africa's young people are natural innovators; they just need support to unlock their full potential.""

The selected startups underwent rigorous mentorship focused on refining their business models and preparing them for a global stage.

Following the pitches, the panel will determine the four winning companies, which will receive financial support and additional mentorship, including participation in workshops and development programs facilitated by NBA Africa or its partners. This initiative aims to ensure that these startups are not only viable in Africa but also competitive internationally, establishing the continent as a hub of innovation in sports and creative industries.

The finalists in the Triple-Double Accelerator were evaluated based on stringent criteria, including the viability and scalability of their business models, their potential impact on Africa's sports and creative ecosystems, and their ability to address unique challenges faced by the continent.

Akamanzi noted, ""We want to give African startups an opportunity to sit at the table and take their ideas to the next level,"" highlighting a commitment to investing in talent and nurturing long-term partnerships. She added, ""The ten finalists received support to prepare and organize themselves, and the four winners will gain even more mentorship and funding."" This approach reflects NBA Africa's vision of creating sustainable, homegrown solutions for the continent's growing sports community.

One of the finalists is Vambo AI, a startup dedicated to preserving and promoting indigenous African languages through AI technology. The founder, Chido Dzinotyiwei, shared her personal journey and the challenges that inspired her to create this venture. ""I am extremely passionate about languages because I faced some language-related challenges while growing up,"" she explained. ""I had to repeat Grade 4 because I was not fluent in the language of instruction, which was English. My teacher did that so I wouldn't be limited in fulfilling my full potential because of language.""

This formative experience shaped her mission and motivated her to establish a business focused on language education. ""After completing my degree in economics at UCT, I decided to start a business that focused on teaching people language, both their mother tongue as well as English,"" she said. Vambo AI has since evolved into an AI-powered platform serving over 14,000 users. ""Vambo AI is a year and two months old, and we cover over 40 African languages. This has helped us understand the specific needs of different communities.""

Dzinotyiwei articulated her vision for the platform's future: ""Right now, we are really good at translation and text-to-text solutions, which means we can do subtitles and captions for speech. But we want to expand into speech and voice recognition to make the solution even more inclusive."" Her ambition is to ensure that even those who are differently abled, such as individuals who are blind, can engage with content such as sports in their mother tongue or the language they have mastered.

The opportunity to participate in the NBA Africa Triple-Double Accelerator has been pivotal for Vambo AI. ""This experience has helped us understand what it takes to serve a global company like the NBA and NBA Africa,"" Dzinotyiwei remarked. ""We hope to secure more clients of that calibre. This opportunity has validated our hard work and what we are contributing to the ecosystem.""

With Vambo AI having grown to 14,000 users since its inception, Dzinotyiwei highlighted the importance of long-term sustainability for their business: ""We want to ensure that our products remain within someone's business long term. You don't want to raise money and sell to one or two people; you want to become sustainable."" This focus on longevity underscores Vambo AI's commitment to being a lasting contributor to the language technology landscape in Africa.

In Nigeria's thriving tech scene, Buzza is emerging as a leader in sports technology under the guidance of 25-year-old Taofeeq Lawal. Inspired by the challenges he faced while managing sports leagues in university, Taofeeq used his computer science background from Veritas University to create a digital platform that improves sports community operations. ""Managing points and assists during our league was always a struggle, leading to disputes,"" Taofeeq recalled. ""This experience sparked my idea to create a website to address these issues.""

Buzza's success relies on its innovative approach to sports management, offering automation tools that help communities transition from traditional paper methods to a comprehensive digital platform. Taofeeq emphasized, ""Many sports communities in Africa lack access to automation tools despite seeking improvement. We're changing that behaviour, but it requires time and training.""

Joining the Triple Double Accelerator, designed to nurture African sports tech startups, has been crucial for Buzza. Taofeeq expressed gratitude for the opportunity, noting, ""We knew the accelerator would provide insights to navigate our growth across the continent. The NBA's experience in building sustainable sports leagues, like The BAL, has been invaluable.""

The program has helped refine Buzza's business model and connect with mentors who understand the complexities of the sports tech industry. Further enriching his understanding, Taofeeq highlighted lessons from the founder of ALX, who stressed the importance of long-term vision and scalability. ""It's not just about solving today's problems but also about building scalable solutions. This perspective is crucial as we look to expand Buzza's reach.""

By integrating gamification, Buzza enhances user engagement and fosters deeper connections between athletes and their communities. The revenue model has adapted to meet community needs, with Taofeeq noting, ""Initially, we faced revenue challenges, but we now charge businesses between $50 and $1,000 yearly, depending on community size. Our mentors have guided us in converting free users into paid ones."" This adaptability positions Buzza for sustainable growth in the competitive sports tech landscape.

Currently, Buzza has 5,000 registered users, with around 2,000 active during the school year, although participation dips in the off-season. Taofeeq and his team are exploring strategies to maintain user interest year-round. As Buzza evolves, it prioritizes fostering strong networks within the sports community. Taofeeq noted insights from industry leaders, including Gbemisola Abudu, NBA Africa Vice President, who emphasized the value of quality connections for growth. By prioritizing relationships, Buzza lays the groundwork for a robust community to support its long-term vision.

The NBA Africa Triple-Double Accelerator exemplifies the transformative power of technology in shaping Africa's sports landscape. From enriching fan experiences to fostering player engagement and enhancing sports management, technology is central to this evolution.

Akamanzi emphasized the critical role of digital innovation, making reference to the BAL, noting, ""Technology is integrated into everything we do -- from delivering products on and off the court to elevating live sports experiences."" The startups within the accelerator are leveraging technology to create solutions that meet the surging demand for sports and entertainment across the continent.

Initiatives like the Triple-Double Accelerator empower young innovators to contribute meaningfully to Africa's sports ecosystem. Akamanzi noted, ""Some solutions developed in the program focus on AI, event organization, and enhancing the live experience for sports fans.""

The Triple-Double Accelerator shows great promise in expanding its impact to support more African startups in the global sports and creative sectors. Akamanzi outlined the program's future goals: ""We aim to make this an annual initiative, continually improving our approach based on insights gained this year. Inclusivity remains our top priority; we are working to develop solutions that address technology access and infrastructure challenges, benefiting a wider range of African communities.""

In the rapidly changing world of sports technology, NBA Africa is not only participating in the conversation but also empowering the youth of the continent to drive it forward. With their innovative platform and commitment to community engagement, they are poised to make a lasting impact on Africa that goes beyond basketball.

As these startups take their first steps toward global impact, they not only represent their own aspirations but also the innovative spirit of Africa. By supporting their journeys, NBA Africa aims to inspire a new generation of entrepreneurs, ultimately establishing the continent as a powerhouse of innovation in the sports and creative industries."
The Artemis Fund Raises $36M To Fund Diverse Tech Founders,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/geristengel/2024/09/25/the-artemis-fund-raises-36m-to-fund-diverse-tech-founders/,2024-09-25T11:02:06Z,"Despite facing systemic challenges and a tightening VC landscape, The Artemis Fund, a women-led venture capital firm, has successfully closed its second fund at $36 million, more than double their first fund. It has defied the odds, highlighting the growing power of women VCs and founders in the tech industry.

The Artemis Fund -- launched in 2019 by Stephanie Campbell, general partner, Diana Murakhovskaya, general partner, and Leslie Goldman Tepper, founding partner -- emerged from a shared recognition of the funding gap female and minority founders face in the tech industry. With their combined experience in banking, angel investing, and startup acceleration, the trio identified a white space in the venture capital landscape: a lack of national, institutional-grade firms dedicated to leading investment rounds for female-founded tech companies.

Campbell brought her experience leading an angel network and her MBA from Rice University, while Murakhovskaya contributed her background in banking and her pioneering work in establishing one of the first accelerators for female founders. Together with Tepper, they sought to address the systemic underfunding of women-led ventures despite evidence of the strong performance of such firms.

Artemis Fund's focus on seed-stage investments filled a crucial gap, providing much-needed capital and support to early-stage companies led by women and people of color. The fund's emphasis on sectors like fintech, commerce enablement, and the care economy further underscored its commitment to driving economic mobility and prosperity for underserved communities.

""Female founders don't have the same access to venture capital,"" exclaimed Campbell. ""We connect them to the right firms to ensure they're not wasting time.""

""Artemis was the first to believe and understand the big problem we are solving for diverse, small business owners,"" explained Sofie Adbulraazaq, founder and CEO of Goodfynd, a marketplace for food truck vendors looking to streamline operations and a Fund I portfolio company. ""Every step of the way, Artemis has prepared us, opened doors, and advocated for us with partners and investors.""

""Artemis is building a brand as a trusted VC partner for female entrepreneurs,"" Jacob Walthour, CEO of Blueprint Capital Advisors, a co-investor. ""Their company research is among the best in the industry, and they have built one of the most effective advisory boards engaged in review and investment value creation.""

Artemis' portfolio companies have gone on to raise $250 million.

Building on the foundation laid by Fund I, Artemis Fund II represents a significant step forward in the firm's mission to support female-founded and co-founded tech companies. While maintaining its core investment philosophy and focus on early-stage ventures, Fund II distinguishes itself through several key enhancements:

The Artemis Fund recognized the importance of engaging accredited women investors in venture capital. They actively educate and involve women in Fund I. Even though they substantially diversified their investor base to include institutional investors for Fund II, they continue to attract accredited women investors as limited partners.

This strategic approach highlights the critical role of women investors in supporting and scaling women-led venture capital funds, fostering a more inclusive and equitable ecosystem for female founders.

Raising Artemis Fund II presented its challenges. Even though they successfully raised Fund I, they had not yet built an extensive track record and achieved the scale of more established firms in the venture capital industry.

The VC landscape has become increasingly challenging for small, women-led emerging funds. Economic headwinds and risk aversion among investors have led to a consolidation of capital into larger, established funds, leaving less room for emerging women fund managers who are often perceived as riskier investments. This, coupled with LP ""fund fatigue,"" has created a perfect storm where women-led VCs, typically operating with smaller fund sizes, struggle to compete for limited capital. This directly impacts the funding available for female founders, contributing to the sharp decline in VC dollars flowing to female-founded enterprises in 2024.

Another obstacle is the high cost of starting and maintaining a VC fund. Small funds, especially in their early stages, often struggle early on to generate enough fees to cover operational expenses until they achieve successful exits generating returns for themselves and their investors. This financial strain can be particularly acute for emerging managers.

Artemis Fund was able to overcome the challenge of financial strain in part through grant funding. They received crucial support from initiatives like the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) Inclusive Innovation Economy (IIE) program and private organizations like Pivotal Ventures. These grants helped subsidize operational costs, enabling Artemis to invest in essential infrastructure and technology, enhancing their ability to attract institutional investors and support their portfolio companies.

Another key factor in Artemis's success was their proactive approach to investor relations. They recognized the importance of keeping Limited Partners (LPs) engaged and informed, providing regular updates and insights into their investment strategy and portfolio performance. This transparency and communication helped build trust and confidence among their investors, even during challenging market conditions. ""We're very transparent with our investors,"" said Murakhovskaya. ""We want them to understand what we're doing and why we're doing it.""

Their experience underscores the importance of initiatives like SSBCI and IIE in fostering a more inclusive and equitable venture capital ecosystem, where emerging managers -- particularly those led by women and underrepresented groups -- have the resources and support they need to thrive.

"High-Yield Savings Account Rates Today: September 25, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-09-25-24/,2024-09-25T10:56:45Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor.

Rates on savings accounts are decreasing. You can now earn 5.84% or higher on your savings.

Searching for an account where you can park some cash? Here's a look at some of the best savings rates you can find today.

Related: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts

Traditional savings accounts, called ""statement savings accounts"" within the banking industry, are notorious for paying paltry interest rates. But it's easy to find rates 10x higher if you know where to look. For instance, online banks and credit unions often pay much higher rates than brick-and-mortar banks.

Today's highest rate on a standard savings account with a $2,500 minimum deposit requirement is 5.84%, according to data from Curinos. If you land a basic savings account with a rate in that range, you've found a good deal. One week ago, the best yield also was 5.84%.

Today's average APY for a traditional savings account is 0.24%, Curinos says. APY, or annual percentage yield, depicts the actual return your account will earn in a year. It includes compound interest, which is interest that builds on the interest already in your account.

High-yield savings accounts often pay substantially higher interest than conventional savings accounts. But the trade-off is you may have to meet strict conditions laid down by the bank or credit union. Often, that means making a large deposit to open the account.

On high-yield accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000, today's best interest rate is 5.35%. That's unchanged from one week ago.

The average APY for those accounts is now 0.24% APY, about the same as a week ago.

On high-yield savings accounts with a minimum opening deposit of $25,000, the highest rate offered today is 4.97%. You'll be in good shape if you can get an account offering a rate close to 4.97%. Last week at this time, the best rate was a similar 4.97%.

The current average is 0.26% APY for a high-yield account with a $25,000 minimum deposit. That's below last week's 0.26%.

Interest rates on savings accounts typically fluctuate in response to changes in other rates throughout the economy. Savings rates are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate moves, and the central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate several times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to control inflation. With inflation still high but cooling slowly, the federal funds rate has held steady since July 2023.

So far this year, earning rates on deposit accounts have been mostly stable. Savings yields, which remain favorable for consumers, are expected to start falling in 2024 when the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, but this likely won't happen until later in the year.

That's tough to say -- it depends on the path of inflation and the overall economy.

The highest interest rates in recent history were seen in the early 1980s when the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to over 19%. That was in response to record-breaking inflation that had prices rising at a rate of over 14% annually.

In the early 1980s, the average five-year CD paid almost 12%, compared to less than 2% today, according to Bankrate data. Savings rates eventually fell as inflation cooled and the federal funds rate was brought back down.

Curinos determines the average rates for savings accounts by focusing on those intended for personal use. Certain types of savings accounts -- such as relationship-based accounts and accounts designed for youths, seniors and students -- are not considered in the calculation."
"Mortgage Rates Today: September 25, 2024 -- Rates Remain Fairly Steady",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-09-25-24/,2024-09-25T10:56:36Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

Today, the mortgage interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.68%, according to Curinos. On a 15-year fixed mortgage, the average rate is 5.71%, and the average rate on a 30-year jumbo mortgage is 6.74%.

Today's average rate on a 30-year mortgage (fixed-rate) increased to 6.68% from 6.65% yesterday. This time last week, the 30-year fixed was 6.60%.

The APR on a 30-year fixed is 6.70%. This time last week, it was 6.62%. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

According to the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator, borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of 100,000 will pay $644 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included) at today's interest rate of 6.68%. You'd pay approximately $131,918 in total interest over the life of the loan.

Today, the 15-year mortgage rate is 5.71%, higher than it was one day ago. Last week, it was 5.67%.

The APR on a 15-year fixed is 5.74%. It was 5.69% this time last week.

At today's interest rate of 5.71%, a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage would cost approximately $828 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. You would pay around $49,069 in total interest over the life of the loan.

Today's average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage climbed 0.06 point from last week to 6.74%.

Borrowers with a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage with today's interest rate of 6.74% will pay approximately $648 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. On a $750,000 jumbo mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment would be approximately $4,861.

To get an estimate of your mortgage costs, using a mortgage calculator can help.

Simply input the following information:

Buying a house is a huge purchase and can put a big dent in your savings. Before you start looking, it's important to calculate how much house you can afford and you're willing to spend.

Not only do you want to consider your income and debt, but you also want to factor in emergency savings and any long-term financial goals such as retirement or college.

These are some basic financial factors that go into home affordability:

Multiple factors affect the interest rate for a mortgage, including the economy's overall health, benchmark interest rates and borrower-specific factors.

The Federal Reserve's rate decisions and inflation can influence rates to move higher or lower. Although the Fed raising rates doesn't directly cause mortgage rates to rise, an increase to its benchmark interest rate makes it more expensive for banks to lend money to consumers. Conversely, rates tend to decrease during periods of rate cuts and cooling inflation.

Home buyers can make several moves to improve their finances and qualify for competitive rates. One is having a good or excellent credit score, which ranges from 670 to 850. Another is maintaining a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio below 43%, which implies less risk of being unable to afford the monthly mortgage payment.

Further, making a minimum 20% down payment can help you avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI) on conventional home loans. If you can afford the larger monthly payment, 15-year home loans have lower rates than a 30-year term."
Trump's Economic Plans Don't Add Up,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardmcgahey/2024/09/25/trumps-economic-plans-dont-add-up/,2024-09-25T10:36:50Z,"As the presidential race enters its final month, both candidates are emphasizing the economy. What do the candidates offer? This blog looks at Donald Trump's economic ideas, and the next one will analyze Kamala Harris' proposals.

Analyzing Trump's economics -- or any of his policy ideas -- is challenging, because they often are sound bites with little underlying analysis or detail. And Trump pushes out new ideas virtually every day, with no underlying analysis of their impacts, making it even harder to keep track of his proposals.

We do know Trump supports extending and deepening regressive tax cuts favoring the wealthy and corporations, levying tariffs that will raise prices for all Americans and possibly start a trade war, and disrupting the labor market by deporting millions of immigrants.

Just this week, Trump talked about capping credit card interest rates at 10 percent, a proposal the Wall Street Journal editorial board compared to previous proposals by Bernie Sanders. No analysis was offered. We should expect more unvetted and unanalyzed ideas in the coming weeks, because that's how Trump campaigns.

New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, who has covered Trump for years, recently said journalism is ""not built to deal with somebody who says things that are not true as often as he (Trump) does or speaks as incoherently as he often does.""

But analysts still try to understand Trump's proposals. Economists at Goldman Sachs in September reportedly concluded Trump's tariff and immigration policies would reduce US GDP in 2025 by half a percent, or about $140 billion, with associated job losses. (Trump's immigration proposals include using the National Guard and US military to deport between 15 and 20 million people.)

Again, it's hard to model Trump's economic ideas. I started working on this blog by going to his campaign's website with the official Republican platform. The platform leads off with twenty ""promises,"" followed by ten ""chapters"" that do not map directly to the twenty ""promises.""

The platform is virtually all broad statements with no policy specifics. Idea number one is to ""defeat inflation and quickly bring down all prices."" How? Cut wasteful government spending, produce more energy, and stop illegal immigration (whatever that has to do with inflation.)

How about the promise to ""build the greatest economy in American history?"" Deep tax cuts, cut regulations, and produce more energy. How to do those things? The platform, and the Trump campaign, remain silent on details.

Maybe we can use Trump's campaign speeches as a guide? That's what economists at the University of Pennsylvania did, trying to operationalize Trump's ideas and run them through their Penn-Wharton budget model, in order to ""project the policy proposals' fiscal, distributional, and economic effects.""

All Wharton really does is estimate federal budget deficit impacts over ten years. They don't -- and can't -- provide a full analysis of the likely economic impacts, in significant part because Trump hasn't provided enough detail to estimate them.

They model three of Trump's main tax cut proposals -- reauthorizing and extending regressive personal and business tax cuts ($4 trillion -- yes, trillion), eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, even for wealthy retirees ($1.2 trillion), and lowering the corporate tax rate to 15 percent ($600 billion).

For Wharton, that means the deficit under Trump increases by $5.8 trillion over ten years, or a net deficit increase of $4.1 trillion after factoring in some positive economic stimulus effects.

Several of Trump's key economic proposals -- most notably raising tariffs by 10 percent on all imports and by 60 percent on imports from China -- weren't modeled by Wharton. Trump says those tariffs would offset the lost tax revenue, but Wharton laconically notes that ""key implementation details...are missing,"" including the impact on prices and retaliation from trading partners. So they don't model the tariffs.

Others have tried to. The conservative Tax Foundation modeled the 10 percent tariff over ten years, calling it a ""tax hike"" on Americans of over $300 billion that would raise prices of imported goods and services. Adding in the China tariff increases the ten-year tax hike to $2.6 billion. They estimate the two tariffs, in a dynamic economic model with other investment proposals and foreign retaliation in trade, would reduce overall GDP.

According to the Tax Policy Foundation, Trump's two tariff proposals ""would lower average after-tax incomes of US households by about $1800, or 1.8 percent."" And although the tariffs would raise some gross revenues, net revenues would be lower by close to $1 billion ""because those tariffs would reduce other tax receipts"" through their negative effects on the economy.

But, just as we saw this week on the credit card interest proposal, Trump has no interest in specifying details of what his proposals would look like. He campaigns more like an entertainer or stand-up comic, testing out lines to see what the audience likes.

And offering new unspecified ideas allows him to influence the news cycle, as journalists, academics, and analysts chase the latest unvetted notion and try to think what it might mean.

Attempts to engage on policy specifics are washed away when Trump changes the subject, or distorts and falsifies issues repeatedly. (NPR analyzed an hour-long Trump news conference in August, and found ""at least 162 misstatements, exaggerations and outright lies in 64 minutes."")

So assessing Trump's economic plans is hard. But we do know he advocates deeply regressive tax cuts tilted towards the wealthiest households; tariffs that would raise prices for Americans and possibly start a trade war; likely skyrocketing federal deficits; and deportations and immigration policies that would cut our labor force and shake our legal system. That's not an economy -- or a society -- that we should want."
Nancy Pelosi snaps at Tapper for playing clip of Trump criticizing Harris: 'Why would you even cover that?',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nancy-pelosi-snaps-tapper-playing-clip-trump-criticizing-harris-why-would-you-even-cover-that,2024-09-25T10:16:45Z,"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi scolded CNN host Jake Tapper after he played a brief clip of former President Trump criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris.

Former Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi scolded CNN host Jake Tapper for playing a clip of former President Trump criticizing the vice president during an interview Tuesday.

Tapper said he's heard from progressive and Democratic voters who want the media to cover Trump's ""cognitive problems"" as much as they did President Biden's and asked for Pelosi's reaction to Trump talking about it.

He then played a clip of Trump saying on Tuesday, ""They laugh at us all over the world. They're laughing at us. And you know what they're really laughing at? Kamala, because they can't believe that she's going to be president. They can't believe- You talk about cognitive problems? She's got bigger cognitive problems that [Biden] has, in my opinion.""

NANCY PELOSI GRILLED FOR TAKING SWIPE AT 30% OF REPUBLICANS: 'NASTY, UNTRUE AND CRUEL'

The news host then summarized, ""Donald Trump saying that Kamala Harris has bigger cognitive problems than Joe Biden.""

""Why would you even cover that?"" Pelosi demanded. ""This is a person who's not on the level. He is their nominee for president. He is incompetent. Let's not even talk about the silliness of it all, and the weirdness of it all, on the assault on women that it is.""

After the former House speaker criticized Trump for a litany of issues, including, ""The worst job creation record of any president since Herbert Hoover,"" Tapper interjected.

""Because of COVID, yes,"" he said.

'PAISANS FOR KAMALA' EVENT FEATURES DE NIRO, PELOSI BLASTING TRUMP ON IMMIGRATION

Pelosi rejected the explanation outright, arguing that Congress had worked to put $3-trillion into the economy, meanwhile slamming Trump for responding to the pandemic with ""denial and delay. Responsible for thousands and thousands and thousands of people dying.""

Tapper later defended himself for showing the clip of Trump.

""Let me just say, why do I run that clip? I run that clip because that's the Republican presidential nominee, and I thought you might have a reaction to it,"" he said.

At the DNC in August, Tapper retreated after pushback from Pelosi for asking about tensions between her and Biden.

""[W]hy are we even talking about it?"" Pelosi asked.

""They put it in my script and made me read it,"" he replied, then joked, ""They're holding my cat hostage."""
Harris heads to Pittsburgh (again) to make a manufacturing pitch to voters,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/24/nx-s1-5124999/harris-heads-to-pittsburgh-again-to-make-a-manufacturing-pitch-to-voters,2024-09-25T10:02:52Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris speaks to reporters at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, on Sept. 22 Matt Rourke/AFP hide caption

Vice President Harris is set to unveil her manufacturing policy on Wednesday in Pittsburgh, a city known for its steel industry in a state seen as key to the upcoming presidential election.

Harris intends to focus on her economic philosophy, describing it as ""pragmatic"" rather than ideological, her campaign said, and she will pledge to work with the private sector and entrepreneurs.

And Harris also will use the speech to try to draw a contrast with former President Donald Trump, painting herself as a product of the middle class while her Republican opponent came from wealth.

""For Donald Trump, our economy works best if it works for those who own the big skyscrapers. Not those who build them. Not those who wire them. Not those who mop the floors,"" Harris plans to say, according to a senior campaign official granted anonymity to describe a speech still being finalized.

With early voting starting, and only 40 days left before Election Day, both Harris and Trump are trying to reach undecided voters in swing states. This will be Harris' eighth visit to Pennsylvania since she started running for president in July. She spent a few days in Pittsburgh earlier this month while preparing for her debate against Trump.

Trump was in Georgia -- another battleground state -- on Tuesday, and said if elected he would lower the tax rate for manufacturers, cut regulation, hike tariffs on imported goods, and offer federal land to manufacturers.

When it comes to the economy, most polls have shown that Trump has had an edge on Harris. But it's a smaller lead on the issue than he had over President Biden.

President Biden focused his economic policy on manufacturing, building on some of Trump's policies by using tariffs and subsidies to try to bring companies back from overseas. But those measures failed to gain traction in polls, which showed voters blamed Biden for the high cost of living.

To date in her campaign, Harris has focused on ideas to cut costs for housing and families and give incentives to small businesses. Her campaign has said it believes voters are less interested in hearing detailed policy proposals than they are about Harris' priorities and vision."
